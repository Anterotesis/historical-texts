            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>OST Noble and Illuſtrious Drinkers, and you thrice precious Pockified blades; (for to you, and none elſe do I dedicate my writings) <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades,</hi> in that Dialogue of <hi>Plato's,</hi> which is entituled <hi>The Banquet,</hi> whil'ſt he was ſetting forth the praiſes of his Schoolmaſter <hi>Socrates</hi> (without all queſtion the Prince of Philoſophers) amongſt other diſcourſes to that purpoſe ſaid, that he reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the <hi>Silenes. Silenes</hi> of old were little boxes, like thoſe we now may ſee in the ſhops of Apothecaries, painted on the outſide with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114744:6"/>
wanton toyiſh figures, as <hi>Harpyes, Satyrs, bridled Geeſe, horned Hares, ſaddled Ducks, flying Goats, Thiller Harts,</hi> and other ſuch like counterfeted pictures at diſcretion, to excite people unto laughter, as <hi>Silenus</hi> himſelf, who was the foſter-father of good <hi>Bacchus,</hi> was wont to do; but within thoſe capricious caskets were carefully preſerved and kept many rich jewels, and fine drugs, ſuch us <hi>Balme, Ambergreece, Amamon, Musk, Civet,</hi> with ſeveral kindes of <hi>precious ſtones,</hi> and other things of great price. Juſt ſuch another thing was <hi>Socrates,</hi> for to have eyed his outſide, and eſteemed of him by his exterior appearance, you would not have given the peel of an Oinion for him, ſo deformed he was in body, and ridiculous in his geſture: he had a ſharp pointed noſe, with the look of a Bull, and countenance of a foote: he was in his carriage ſimple, booriſh in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, in fortune poore, unhappy in his wives, unfit for all offices in the Common-wealth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes laughing, tipling, and merrily carouſing to every one, with continual gybes and jeeres, the better by thoſe meanes to conceale his divine knowledge: now opening this boxe you would have found within it a heavenly and ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable drug, a more then humane underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, an admirable vertue, matchleſſe learning, invincible courage, unimitable ſobriety, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine contentment of minde, perfect aſſurance, and an incredible miſregard of all that, for
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114744:6"/>
which men commonly do ſo much watch, run, ſaile, fight, travel, toyle and turmoile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Whereunto (in your opinion) doth this little flouriſh of a preamble tend? For ſo much as you, my good diſciples, and ſome other jolly fooles of eaſe and leaſure, reading the pleaſant titles of ſome books of our invention, as <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantua, Pantagruel, Whippot,</hi> the dignity <note place="margin">Feſſepineé</note> of Cod-peeces, of Peaſe and Bacon with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary, &amp;c. are too ready to judge, that there is nothing in them but jeſts, mockeries, laſcivious diſcourſe, and recreative lies; becauſe the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide (which is the Title) is uſually (without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny farther enquiry) entertained with ſcoffing and deriſion: but truly it is very unbeſeeming to make ſo ſlight account of the works of men, ſeeing your ſelves avouch that it is not the habit makes the Monk, many being Monaſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally accoutred, who inwardly are nothing leſſe then monachal, and that there are of thoſe that we are <hi>Spaniſh</hi> caps, who have but little of the valour of <hi>Spaniards</hi> in them. Therefore is it, that you muſt open the book, and ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of the matter treated in it, then ſhall you finde that it containeth things of farre higher value then the boxe did promiſe; that is to ſay, that the ſubject thereof is not ſo fooliſh, as by the Title at the firſt ſight it would appear to be.</p>
                  <p>And put the caſe that in the literal ſenſe, you
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114744:7"/>
meet with purpoſes merry and ſolacious enough, and conſequently very correſpondent to their inſcriptions, yet muſt not you ſtop there as at the melody of the charming Syrens, but endeavour to interpret that in a ſublimer ſenſe, which poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly you intended to have ſpoken in the jollitie of your heart; did you ever pick the lock of a cupboard to ſteale a bottle of wine out of it? Tell me truly, and if you did call to minde the countenance which then you had? or did you ever ſee a Dog with a marrow-bone in his mouth (the beaſt of all other, ſaies <hi>Plato, lib. 2. de Republica,</hi> the moſt Philoſophical) if you have ſeene him, you might have remarked with what devotion and circumſpectneſſe he wards and watcheth it; with what care he keeps it: how fervently he holds it: how prudently he gobbets it: with what affection he breaks it: and with what diligence he ſucks it: to what end all this? what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him to take all theſe paines? what are the hopes of his labour? what doth he expect to reap thereby? nothing but a little marrow: True it is, that this little is more ſavoury and delicious then the great quantities of other ſorts of meat, becauſe the marrow <hi>(as</hi> Galen <hi>teſtifieth, 5. facult. nat. &amp; 11. de uſu partium)</hi> is a nouriſhment moſt perfectly elaboured by nature.</p>
                  <p>In imitation of this Dog, it becomes you to be wiſe, to ſmell, feele and have in eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114744:7"/>
theſe faire goodly books, ſtuffed with high conceptions, which though ſeemingly eaſie in the purſuit, are in the cope and encounter ſomewhat difficult; and then like him you muſt, by a ſedulous Lecture, and frequent meditation, break the bone, and ſuck out the marrow; that is, my allegorical ſenſe, or the things I to my ſelf propoſe to be ſignified by theſe <hi>Pythagorical</hi> Symbols, with aſſured hope, that in ſo doing, you will at laſt attaine to be both well-adviſed and valiant by the reading of them; for in the peruſal of this Treatiſe, you ſhall finde another kinde of taſte, and a doctrine of a more profound and abſtruſe conſideration, which will diſcloſe unto you the moſt glorious Sacraments, and dreadful myſteries, as well in what concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth your Religion, as matters of the publike State, and Life oeconomical.</p>
                  <p>Do you beleeve upon your conſcience, that <hi>Homer</hi> whil'ſt he was a couching his <hi>Ili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ads</hi> and <hi>Odyſſes,</hi> had any thought upon thoſe Allegories, which <hi>Plutarch, Heraclides, Ponticus, Friſtatius, Cornutus</hi> ſqueeſed out of him, and which <hi>Politian</hi> ſilched againe from them: if you truſt it, with neither hand nor foot do you come neare to my opinion, which judgeth them to have beene as little dreamed of by <hi>Homer,</hi> as the Goſpel-ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were by <hi>Ovid</hi> in his <hi>Metamorphoſis,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Frere lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin croq<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lardon.</note> though a certaine gulligut Fryer and true ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con-picker,

would have undertaken to prove it, if perhaps he had met with as very fools as himſelf (and as the Proverb ſaies) <hi>a lid worthy of ſuch a kettle;</hi> if you give no credit thereto, why do not you the' ſame in theſe jovial new chronicles of mine; albeit when I did dictate them, I thought upon no more then you, who poſsibly were drinking (the whil'ſt) as I was; for in the compoſing of this lordly book, I never loſt nor beſtowed any more, nor any other time then what was appointed to ſerve me for taking of my bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refection, that is, whil'ſt I was eating and drinking. And indeed that is the fitteſt, and moſt proper hour, wherein to write theſe high matters and deep Sciences: as <hi>Homer</hi> knew very well, the Paragon of all Philolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, and <hi>Ennius,</hi> the father of the Latine Poets (as <hi>Horace</hi> calls him) although a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſneaking jobernol alledged that his Verſes ſmelled more of the wine then oile.</p>
                  <p>So ſaith a <hi>Turlupin</hi> or a new ſtart-up grub of my books, but a turd for him.

                     <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of the Genealogy and Antiquity of</hi> GAR GANTUA.</head>
                     <p>I Muſt referre you to the great Chronicle of <hi>Pantagruel</hi> for the knowledge of that Genealogy, and Antiquity of race by which <hi>Gargantua</hi> is come unto us; in it you may underſtand more at large how the Giants were born in this world, and how from them by a direct line iſſued <hi>Gargantua</hi> the father of <hi>Pantagruel:</hi> and do not take it ill, if for this time I paſſe by it, although the ſubject be ſuch, that the oftener it were remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the more it would pleaſe your worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Seniorias;</hi> according to which you have the authority of <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Philebo</hi> and <hi>Gorgias;</hi> and of <hi>Flaccus,</hi> who ſaies that there are ſome kindes of purpoſes (ſuch as theſe are without doubt) which the frequentlier they be repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſtill prove the more delectable.</p>
                     <p>Would to God every one had as certaine knowledge of his Genealogy ſince the time of the Arke of <hi>Noah</hi> untill this age. I think many are at this day Emperours, Kings, Dukes, Princes, and Popes on the earth,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114744:10"/>
whoſe extraction is from ſome porters, and pardon-pedlars, as on the contrary, many are now poor wandring beggars, wretched and miſerable, who are deſcended of the blood and lineage of great Kings and Emperours, occaſioned (as I conceive it) by the tranſport and revolution of Kingdomes and Empires from the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> to the <hi>Medes,</hi> from the <hi>Medes</hi> to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> from the <hi>Perſians</hi> to the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> from the <hi>Macedonians</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> from the <hi>Romans</hi> to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> from the <hi>Greeks</hi> to the <hi>French, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to give you ſome hint concerning my ſelf, who ſpeaks unto you, I cannot think but I am come of the race of ſome rich King or Prince in former times, for never yet ſaw you any man that had a greater deſire to be a King, and to be rich, then I have; and that onely that I may make good chear, do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nor care forany thing, and plentifully enrich my friends, and all honeſt and learned men: but herein do I comfort my ſelf, that in the other world I ſhall be ſo, yea and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er too then at this preſent I dare wiſh: as for you, with the ſame or a better conceit conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late your ſelves in your diſtreſſes, and drink freſh if you can come by it.</p>
                     <p>To returne to our weathers, I ſay, that by the ſovereign gift of heaven, the Antiquity and Genealogy of <hi>Gargantua</hi> hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for our uſe more full and perfect then
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114744:10"/>
any other except that of the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> whereof I mean not to ſpeak; for it belongs not unto my purpoſe, and the Devils (that is to ſay) the falſe accuſers, and diſſembled goſpellers will therein oppoſe me. This Genealogy was found by <hi>John Andrew</hi> in a meadow, which he had near the Pole-arch, under the Olive-tree, as you go to <hi>Marſay:</hi> where, as he was making caſt up ſome ditches, the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers with their mattocks ſtruck againſt a great brazen tomb, and unmeaſurably long, for they could never finde the end thereof, by reaſon that it entered too farre within the Sluces of <hi>Vienne;</hi> opening this Tomb in a certain place thereof, ſealed on the top with the mark of a goblet, about which was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in <hi>Hetrurian</hi> letters HIC BIBI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUR; They found nine Flaggons ſet in ſuch order as they uſe to ranke their kyles in <hi>Gaſconie,</hi> of which that which was placed in the middle, had under it a big, fat, great, gray, pretty, ſmall, mouldy, little pamphlet, ſmelling ſtronger, but no better then Roſes. In that book the ſaid Genealogy was found written all at length, in a Chancery hand, not in paper, not in parchment, nor in wax, but in the bark of an elme-tree, yet ſo worne with the long tract of time, that hardly could three letters together be there perfectly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
                     <p>I (though unworthy) was ſent for thither,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114744:11"/>
and with much help of thoſe Spectacles, whereby the art of reading dim writings, and letters that do not clearly appear to the ſight, is practiſed, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teacheth it, did tranſlate the book as you may ſee in your <hi>pantagrueliſing,</hi> that is to ſay, in drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtifly to your own hearts deſire; and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dreadful and horrifick acts of <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel:</hi> at the end of the book there was a little Treatiſe entituled the <hi>Antidoted Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freluches,</hi> or a <hi>Galimatia</hi> of extravagant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits. The rats and mothes, or (that I may not lie) other wicked beaſts, had nibled off the beginning, the reſt I have hereto ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, for the reverence I beare to anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>GRangouſier</hi> was a good fellow in his time, and notable jeſter; he loved to drink neat, as much as any man that then was in the world, and would willingly eate ſalt meat: to this intent he was ordinarily well furniſhed with gammons of Bacon, both of <hi>Weſtphalia, Mayence</hi> and <hi>Bayone;</hi> with ſtore of dried Neats tongues, plenty of Links, Chitterlings and Puddings in their ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; together with ſalt Beefand muſtard, a good deale of hard rows of powdered mullet called <hi>Botargos,</hi> great proviſion of Sauciges, not of <hi>Bolonia</hi> (for he feared the <hi>Lombard boccone)</hi> but of <hi>Bigorre, Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaulnay, Brene,</hi> and <hi>Rouargue.</hi> In the vigor of his age he married <hi>Gargamelle,</hi> daughter to the King of the <hi>Parpaillons,</hi> a jolly pug, and well mouthed wench. Theſe two did often times do the two backed beaſt together, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully rubbing &amp; frotting their Bacon 'gainſt one another, inſofarre, that at laſt ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came great with childe of a faire ſonne, and went with him unto the eleventh moneth, for ſo long, yea longer may a woman carry
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114744:14"/>
her great belly, eſpecially when it is ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-piece of nature, and a perſon predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the performance, in his due time, of great exploits; as <hi>Homer</hi> ſaies, that the childe which <hi>Neptune</hi> begot upon the <hi>Nymph,</hi> was borne a whole year after the conception, that is, in the twelfth moneth; for as <hi>Aulus Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> ſaith, <hi>libr.</hi> 3. this long time was ſuitable to the majeſty of <hi>Neptune,</hi> that in it the childe might receive his perfect forme: for the like reaſon <hi>Jupiter</hi> made the night, wherein he lay with <hi>Alcmena,</hi> laſt fourty eight houres, a ſhorter time not being ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the forging of <hi>Hercules,</hi> who cleanſed the world of the Monſtres and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, wherewith it was ſuppreſt. <hi>My maſters,</hi> the ancient pantagrueliſts have confirmed that which I ſay, and withall declared it to be not onely poſſible, but alſo maintained the lawful birth and legitimation of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant borne of a woman in the eleventh moneth after the deceaſe of her husband, <hi>Hypocrates, lib. de alimento.

I pray you, my good luſty ſpringal lads, if you finde any of theſe females, that are worth the paines of untying the cod-peece-point, get up, ride upon them, and bring them to me; for if they happen within the third moneth to conceive, the childe ſhall be heire to the deceaſed, <hi>if before he died he had no other children, and the mother ſhall paſſe for an honeſt woman.</hi>

                     <p>When ſhe is known to have conceived, thruſt forward boldly, ſpare her not what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever betide you, ſeeing the paunch is full; as <hi>Julia</hi> the daughter of the Emperour <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi> never proſtituted her ſelf to her belly-bumpers, but when ſhe found her ſelf with childe, after the manner of Ships that receive not their ſteers-man, till they have their ballaſt and lading; and if any blame them

                     <p>They had abundance of tripes as you have heard, and they were ſo delicious, that every one licked his fingers, but the miſchife was

this, that for all men could do, there was no poſſibility to keep them long in that reliſh; for in a very ſhort while they would have ſtunk, which had been an undecent thing: it was therefore concluded, that they ſhould be all of them gulched up, without loſing any thing; to this effect they invited all the Burguers of <hi>Sainais,</hi> of <hi>Suille,</hi> of the <hi>Roche clermand,</hi> of <hi>Vaugaudry,</hi> without omitting the <hi>Boudray, Monpenſier,</hi> the <hi>Guedevede,</hi> and other their neighbours, all ſtiffe drinkers, brave fellows, and good players at the kyles. The good man <hi>Grangouſier</hi> took great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in their company, and commanded there ſhould be no want nor pinching for any thing: nevertheleſſe he bade his wife eate ſparingly, becauſe ſhe was near her time, and that theſe tripes were no very commendable meat: they would faine (ſaid he) be at the chewing of ordure, that would eat the caſe wherein it was. Notwithſtanding theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, ſhe did eate ſixteen quarters, two buſhels, three pecks and a pipkin full: O the fair fecality wherewith ſhe ſwelled, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grediency of ſuch ſhitten ſtuffe; after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they all went out in a hurle, to the grove of the willows, where on the green graſſe, to the ſound of the merry Flutes, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Bagpipes, they danced ſo gallantly, that it was a ſweet and heavenly ſport to ſee them ſo frolick.</p>

ſhewed you before: whereupon an old ugly trot in the company, who had the repute of an expert ſhe-Phyſician, and was come from <hi>Briſpaille</hi> near to Saint <hi>Gnou</hi> threeſcore yeers before, made her ſo horrible a reſtrictive, and binding medicine, and whereby all her <hi>Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> arſe-pipes and conduits were ſo opilated, ſtopped, obſtructed, and contracted, that you could hardly have opened and enlarged them with your teeth, which is a terrible thing to think upon; ſeeing the Devill at the Maſſe at Saint <hi>Martins</hi> was puzled with the like task, when with his teeth he had lengthened out the parchment whereon he wrote the tittle tattle of two young mangy whoores; by this inconvenient the <hi>cotyle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi> of her matrix, were preſently looſed, through which the childe ſprung up and leapt, and ſo entering into the hollow veine, did climbe by the diaphragm even above her ſhoulders, where that veine divides it ſelf into two, and from thence taking his way towards the left ſide, iſſued forth at her left eare; as ſoone as he was borne, he cried not as other babes uſe to do, <hi>miez, miez, miez, miez,</hi> but with a high, ſturdy and big voice ſhouted a loud, ſome drink, ſome drink, ſome drink, as inviting all the world to drink with him; the noiſe hereof was ſo extreamly great, that it was heard in both the Countreys at once, of <hi>Beauce</hi> and <hi>Bibarois.</hi> I doubt me that you

                     <p>THE good man <hi>Grangouſier</hi> drinking and making merry with the reſt, heard the horrible noiſe which his ſonne had made as he entered into the light of this world, when he cried out, Some drink, ſome drink, ſome drink; whereupon he ſaid in French, <hi>Que grand tuas et ſouple le gouſier,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>How great and nimble a throat thou haſt;</hi> which the company hearing, ſaid, that veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the childe ought to be called <hi>Gargantua;</hi> becauſe it was the firſt word that after his birth his father had ſpoke in imitation, and at the example of the ancient Hebrewes, whereunto he condeſcended, and his mother was very well pleaſed therewith; in the meane while to quiet the childe, they gave him to drink <hi>a tirelarigot,</hi> that is, till his throat was like to crack with it; then was he carried to the Font, and there baptized, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manner of good <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>

                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:114744:22"/>
Immediately thereafter were appointed for him ſeventeen thouſand, nine hundred, and thirteen Cowes of the towns of <hi>Pautil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le</hi> and <hi>Breemond</hi> to furniſh him with milk in ordinary, for it was impoſſible to finde a Nurſe ſufficient for him in all the Countrey, conſidering the great quantity of milk that was requiſite for his nouriſhment; although there were not wanting ſome Doctors of the opinion of <hi>Scotus,</hi> who affirmed that his own mother gave him ſuck, and that ſhe could draw out of her breaſts one thouſand, four hundred, two pipes, and nine pailes of milk at every time.</p>
                     <p>Which indeed is not probable, and this point hath been found duggiſhly ſcandalous and offenſive to tender eares, for that it ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured a little of Hereſie; thus was he hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for one yeare and ten moneths, after which time by the advice of Phyſicians they began to carry him, and then was made for him a fine little cart drawn with Oxen, of the invention of <hi>Jan Denio,</hi> wherein they led him hither and thither with great joy, and he was worth the ſeeing; for he was a fine boy, had a burly phyſnomie, and almoſt ten chins; he cried very little, but beſhit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf every hour: for to ſpeak truly of him, he was wonderfully flegmatick in his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, both by reaſon of his natural comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion, and the accidental diſpoſition which
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:114744:23"/>
had befallen him by his too much quaffing of the ſeptembral juyce. Yet without a cauſe did not he ſup one drop; for if he happened to be vexed, angry, diſpleaſed or ſorry; if he did fret, if he did weep, if he did cry, and what grievous quarter ſoever he kept in bringing him ſome drink, he would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly pacified, reſeated in his own temper, in a good humour againe, and as ſtill and quiet as ever. One of his governeſſes told me (ſwearing by her fig) how he was ſo accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to this kinde of way, that, at the ſound of pintes and flaggons he would on a ſudden fall into an extaſie, as if he had then taſted of the joyes of Paradiſe: ſo that they upon conſideration of this his divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, would every morning to cheare him up, play with a knife upon the glaſſes, on the bottles with their ſtopples, and on the pottle-pots with their lids and covers, at the ſound whereof he became gay, did leap for joy, would loll and rock himſelf in the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, then nod with his head, monocor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his fingers, and barytoniſing with his taile.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>How they apparelled</hi> Gargantua.</head>
                     <p>BEing of this age, his father ordained to have clothes made to him in his owne livery, which was white and blew. To work then went the Tailors, and with great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition were thoſe clothes made, cut, and ſewed, according to the faſhion that was then in requeſt. I finde by the ancient Records or Pancarts, to be ſeene in the chamber of accounts, or Count of the Exchequer at <hi>Montforeo,</hi> that he was accoutred in manner as followeth. To make him every ſhirt of his were taken up nine hundred ells of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telero</hi> linnen, and two hundred for the guiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets, in manner of cuſhions, which they put under his arm-pits; his ſhirt was not gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nor plaited, for the plaiting of ſhirts was not found out, till the Seamſters (vvhen the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Beſonger du cul,</hi> Engliſh'd, <hi>The eye of the needle.</hi>

Then vvas it that men began to tie their breeches to their doublets, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114744:24"/>
not their doublets to their breeches: for it is againſt nature, as hath moſt amply been ſhewed. <hi>Ockam</hi> upon the explonibles of Maſter <hi>Hautechauſſade.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For his breeches were taken up eleven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and five ells, and a third of white broad cloth; They were cut in forme of pillars, chamfered, channel'd and pinked behinde, that they might not over-heat his reines: and were within the panes, puffed out with the lining of as much blew damask as was needful: and remark, that he had very good Leg-harniſh, proportionable to the reſt of his ſtature.</p>
                     <p>For his Codpeece were uſed ſixteen ells, and a quarter of the ſame cloth, and it was faſhioned on the top like unto a Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Arch, moſt gallantly faſtened with two enamell'd Claſps, in each of which was ſet a great Emerauld, as big as an Orange; for, as ſayes <hi>Orpheus lib. de lapidibus,</hi> and <hi>Plinius libr. ultimo,</hi> it hath an erective vertue and comfortative of the natural member. The extiture, out-jecting or out-ſtanding of his Codpiece, was of the length of a yard, jagged and pinked, and withal bagging, and ſtrouting out with the blew damask lining, after the manner of his breeches: but had you ſeen the faire Embroyderie of the ſmall needle-work purle, and the curiouſly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced knots, by the Goldſmiths Art, ſet out
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:114744:24"/>
and trimmed with rich Diamonds, precious Rubies, fine Turquoiſes, coſtly Emeraulds, and <hi>Perſian</hi> pearles; you would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared it to a faire <hi>Cornucopia,</hi> or Horne of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, ſuch as you ſee in Anticks, or as <hi>Rhea</hi> gave to the two Nymphs, <hi>Amalthea</hi> and <hi>Ida,</hi> the Nurſes of <hi>Jupiter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And like to that Horn of abundance, it was ſtill gallant, ſucculent, droppie, ſappie, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, lively, alwayes flouriſhing, alwayes fructifying, full of juice, full of flower, full of fruit, and all manner of delight. I avow God, it would have done one good to have ſeen him, but I will tell you more of him in the book which I have made of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Codpieces: One thing I will tell you, that as it was both long and large, ſo was it well furniſhed and victualled within, nothing like unto the hypocritical Codpie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſome fond Wooers, and Wench-courters, which are ſtuffed only with wind, to the great prejudice of the female ſexe.</p>
                     <p>For his ſhoes, were taken up foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſix elles of blew Crimſon-velvet, and were very neatly cut by parallel lines, joyned in uniforme cylindres: for the ſoling of them were made uſe of eleven hundred Hides of brown Cowes, ſhapen like the taile of a Keeling.</p>
                     <p>For his coat were taken up eighteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred elles of blew velvet, died in grain, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:114744:25"/>
in its borders with faire Gilliflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in the middle decked with ſilver purle, intermixed with plates of gold, and ſtore of pearles, hereby ſhewing, that in his time he would prove an eſpecial good fellow, and ſingular whip-can.</p>
                     <p>His girdle was made of three hundred elles and a halfe of ſilken ſerge, halfe white and half blew, if I miſtake it not. His ſword was not of <hi>Valentia,</hi> nor his dagger of <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſa,</hi> for his father could not endure theſe <hi>hidalgos borrachos maraniſados como dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blos:</hi> but he had a faire ſword made of wood, and the dagger of borled leather, as well painted and guilded as any man could wiſh.</p>
                     <p>His purſe was made of the cod of an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, which was given him by <hi>Herre Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contal,</hi> Proconſul of <hi>Lybia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For his Gown were employed nine thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſix hundred elles, wanting two thirds, of blew velvet, as before, all ſo diagonally purled, that by true perſpective iſſued thence an unnamed colour, like that you ſee in the necks of Turtle-doves or Turkie-cocks, which wonderfully rejoyceth the eyes of the beholders. For his Bonnet or Cap were taken up three hundred two elles, and a quarter of white velvet, and the forme thereof was wide and round, of the bigneſſe of his Head; for his father ſaid, that the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:114744:25"/>
Caps of the <hi>Mirabaiſe</hi> faſhion, made like the Cover of a Paſtie, would one time or other bring a miſchief on thoſe that wore them. For his Plume, he wore a faire great blew feather, plucked from an <hi>Onocrotal</hi> of the countrey of <hi>Hircania</hi> the wilde, very pretti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hanging down over his right eare: For the Jewel or broach which in his Cap he carried; he had in a Cake of gold, weighing three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and eight marks, a faire piece ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell'd, wherein was portrayed a mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with two heads, looking towards one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, foure armes, foure feet, two arſes, ſuch as <hi>Plato in Sympoſio</hi> ſayes, was the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical beginning of mans nature; and about it was written in Ionick letters, <gap reason="foreign">

For his Gloves were put in work ſixteen Otters
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:114744:26"/>
skins, and three of <hi>lougarous</hi> or men-eating wolves, for the bordering of them: and of this ſtuffe were they made, by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Cabaliſts of <hi>Sanlono.</hi> As for the Rings which his father would have him to weare to renew the ancient mark of Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; He had on the forefinger of his left hand a Carbuncle as big as an Oſtrige's Egge, inchaſed very daintily in gold of the fineneſſe of a <hi>Turkie Seraph.</hi> Upon the middle finger of the ſame hand, he had a Ring made of foure metals together, of the ſtrongeſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion that ever was ſeen; ſo that the ſteel did not craſh againſt the gold, nor the ſilver cruſh the copper. All this was made by Captain <hi>Chappins,</hi> and <hi>Alcofribas</hi> his good Agent. On the medical finger of his right hand, he had a Ring made Spire wayes, wherein was ſet a perfect baleu rubie, a pointed Diamond, and a Phyſon Emerald of an ineſtimable value; for <hi>Hans-carvel</hi> the King of <hi>Melinda</hi>'s Jeweller, eſteemed them at the rate of threeſcore nine millions, eight hundred ninety foure thouſand and elgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen French Crowns of <hi>Berrie,</hi> and at ſo much did the foucres of <hi>Auſpurg</hi> prize them.</p>

                        <hi>GArgantua</hi>'s colours were white and blew, as I have ſhewed you before, by which his father would give us to underſtand, that his ſonne to him was a heavenly joy, for the white did ſignifie gladneſſe, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, delight and rejoycing, and the blew, celeſtial things. I know well enough, that in reading this you laugh at the old drinker, and hold this expoſition of colours to be very extravagant, and utterly diſagreeable to reaſon, becauſe white is ſaid to ſignifie faith, and blew conſtancy. But without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, vexing, heating or putting you in a chafe, (for the weather is dangerous) anſwer me if it pleaſe you; for no other compulſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way of arguing will I uſe towards you, or any elſe; only now and then I will mention a word or two of my bottle. What is it that induceth you? what ſtirs you up to believe, or who told you that white ſignifieth faith; and blew, conſtancy? An old paultry book, ſay you, ſold by the hawking Pedlars and Balladmongers, entituled <hi>The Blaſon of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours:</hi> Who made it? whoever it was, he was wiſe in that he did not ſet his name

                        <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, that ſuppoſing two things contrary in their kinde, as good and evill, vertue and vice, heat and cold, white and black, pleaſure and pain, joy and grief: And ſo of others, if you couple them in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the contrary of one kinde may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in reaſon with the contrary of the other, it muſt follow by conſequence, that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contrary muſt anſwer to the remanent oppoſite to that wherewith it is conferred; as for example, vertue and vice are contrary in one kinde, ſo are good and evil: if one of the contraries of the firſt kinde, be conſonant to one of thoſe of the ſecond, as vertue and good neſſe, for it is clear that vertue is good, ſo ſhall the other two contraries, (which are
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:114744:29"/>
evil and vice) have the ſame connexion, for vice is evil.</p>
                     <p>This Logical rule being underſtood, take theſe two contraries, joy and ſadneſſe: then theſe other two, white and black, for they are Phyſically contrary; if ſo be then that black do ſignifie grief, by good reaſon then ſhould white import joy. Nor is this ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation inſtituted by humane impoſition, but by the univerſal conſent of the world recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, which Philoſophers call <hi>Jus Gentium,</hi> the Law of Nations, or an uncontrolable right of force in all countreyes whatſoever: for you know well enough, that all people, and all languages and nations, (except the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Syracuſans,</hi> and certain <hi>Argives,</hi> who had croſſe and thwarting ſoules) when they mean outwardly to give evidence of their ſorrow, go in black; and all mourning is done with black, which general conſent is not without ſome argument, and reaſon in nature, the which every man may by himſelf very ſuddenly comprehend, without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of any; and this we call the Law of nature: By vertue of the ſame natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, we know that by white all the world hath underſtood joy, gladneſſe, mirth, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delight. In former times, the <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> and <hi>Crecians</hi> did mark their good, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious, and fortunate dayes with white ſtones: and their ſad, diſmal and unfortunate
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:114744:29"/>
ones with black, is not the night mournful, ſad and melancholick? it is black and dark by the privation of light; doth not the light comfort all the world? and it is more whitet hen any thing elſe, which to prove, I could direct you to the book of <hi>Laurentius Valla</hi> againſt <hi>Bartolus,</hi> but an Evangelical teſtimony I hope will content you, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. it is ſaid, that at the transfiguration of our Lord, <hi>Veſtimenta ejus facta ſunt alba ſicut lux,</hi> his apparel was made white like the light, by which lightſome whiteneſſe he gave his three Apoſtles to underſtand the <hi>Idea</hi> and figure of the eternal joyes; for by the light are all men comforted, according to the word of the old woman, who although ſhe had never a tooth in her head, was wont to ſay, <hi>Bona lux:</hi> and <hi>Tobit, chap.</hi> 5. after he had loſt his ſight, when <hi>Raphael</hi> ſaluted him, anſwered, <hi>What joy can I have, that do not ſee the light of Heaven?</hi> In that colour did the Angels teſtifie the joy of the whole world, at the Reſurrection of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 20. and at his Aſcenſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. with the like colour of veſture did St. <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 4. 7. ſee the faithful clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in the heavenly and bliſſed <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Reade the ancient both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> hiſtories, and you ſhall finde that the town of <hi>Alba,</hi> (the firſt patern of <hi>Rome,)</hi> was
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:114744:30"/>
founded, and ſo named by reaſon of a white ſow that was ſeen there: You ſhall likewiſe finde in thoſe ſtories, that when any man, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had vanquiſhed his enemies, was by decree of the Senate to enter into <hi>Rome</hi> tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly, he uſually rode in a chariot drawn by white horſes: which in the Ova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion triumph was alſo the cuſtome; for by no ſigne or colour would they ſo ſignificant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſe the joy of their coming, as by the white: You ſhall there alſo finde, how <hi>Pericles,</hi> the General of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> would needs have that part of his Army, unto whoſe lot befel the white beanes, to ſpend the whole day in mirth, pleaſure and eaſe, whileſt the reſt were a fighting. A thouſand other examples and places could I alledge to this purpoſe, but that it is not here where I ſhould do it.</p>
                     <p>By underſtanding hereof, you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve one Problem, which <hi>Alexander Aphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſeus</hi> hath accounted unanſwerable, why the Lion, who with his only cry and roaring affrights all beaſts, dreads and feareth only a white cock? for (as <hi>Proclus</hi> ſaith, <hi>libro de Sacrificio &amp; Magia)</hi> it is becauſe the preſence of the vertue of the Sunne, which is the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan and Promptuarie of all terreſtrial and <hi>ſyderial</hi> light, doth more ſymbolize and agree with a white cock, as well in regard of that colour, as of his property and ſpecifical qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:114744:30"/>
then with a Lion. He ſaith further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, that Devils have been often ſeen in the ſhape of Lions, which at the ſight of a white cock have preſently vaniſhed. This is the cauſe, why <hi>Galli</hi> or <hi>Gallices,</hi> (ſo are the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> called, becauſe they are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally white as milk, which the Greeks call <hi>Gala,)</hi> do willingly weare in their Caps white feathers, for by nature they are of a candid diſpoſition, merrie, kinde, gtacious and well-beloved, and for their cognizance and armes have the whiteſt flower of any, the <hi>Flower de luce</hi> or <hi>Lilie.</hi> If you demand, how by white, nature would have us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand joy and gladneſſe? I anſwer, that the analogy and uniformity is thus, for as the white doth outwardly diſperſe and ſcatter the rayes of the ſight, whereby the optick ſpirits are manifeſtly diſſolved, according to the opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Problemes and perſpective Treatiſes; as you may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe perceive by experience, when you paſſe over mountains covered with ſnow, how you will complain that you cannot ſee well: as <hi>Xenophon</hi> writes to have hapned to his men, and as <hi>Galen</hi> very largely declareth, <hi>lib.</hi> 10. <hi>de uſu partium:</hi> Juſt ſo the heart with exceſſive joy is inwardly dilated, and ſuffereth a manifeſt reſolution of the vital ſpirits, which may go ſo farre on, that it may thereby be deprived of its nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment,

                     <p>
                        <hi>GArgantua</hi> from three yeares upwards unto five, was brought up and inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all convenient diſcipline, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of his father; and ſpent that time like the other little children of the countrey, that is, in drinking, eating and ſleeping: in eating, ſleeping and drinking: and in ſleeping, drinking and eating: ſtill he wallowed and rowled up and down him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the mire and dirt: he blurred and ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied his noſe with filth: he blotted and ſmutch't his face with any kinde of ſcurvie ſtuffe, he trode down his ſhoes in the heele: At the flies he did oftentimes yawn, and ran very heartily after the Butterflies, the Empire whereof belonged to his father. He piſſed in his ſhoes, ſhit in his ſhirt, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his noſe on his ſleeve: He did let his ſnot and ſnivel fall in his pottage, and dabled, padled and ſlabbered every where: He would drink in his ſlipper, and ordinarily rub his belly againſt a Panier: He ſharpened his teeth with a top, waſhed his hands with his broth, and combed his head with a bole:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:114744:32"/>
He would ſit down betwixt two ſtooles, and his arſe to the ground, would cover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a wet ſack, and drink in eating of his ſoupe: He did eate his Cake ſometimes without bread, would bite in laughing, and laugh in biting; Oftentimes did he ſpit in the baſin, and fart for fatneſſe; piſſe againſt the Sunne, and hide himſelf in the water for fear of raine. He would ſtrike out of the cold iron, be often in the dumps, and frig and wriggle it. He would flay the Fox, ſay the Apes Paternoſter, return to his ſheep, and turn the Hogs to the Hay: He would beat the Dogs before the Lion, put the Plough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Oxen, and claw where it did not itch: He would pump one to draw ſomewhat out of him, by griping all would hold faſt nothing, and alwayes eat his white bread firſt. He ſhoo'd the Geeſe, kept a ſelf-tickling to make himſelf laugh, and was very ſtedable in the Kitchin: made a mock at the gods, would cauſe ſing <hi>Magnificat</hi> at <hi>Matines,</hi> and found it very connenient ſo to do: He would eat cabbage, and ſhite beets; knew flies in a diſh of milk, and would make them loſe their feet: He would ſcrape paper, blur parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then run away as hard as he could: He would pul at the Kids leather, or vomit up his dinner, then reckon without his Hoſt: He would beat the buſhes without catching the birds, thought the Moon was made of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:114744:32"/>
green cheeſe, and that bladders are lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes: out of one ſack he would take two moutures or fees for grinding; would act the Aſſes part to get ſome bran, and of his fiſt would make a Mallet: He took the cranes at the firſt leap, and would have the Mail-coats to be made link after link: He alwayes look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a given horſe in the mouth, leaped from the cock to the aſſe, and put one ripe between two green: By robbing <hi>Peter</hi> he payed <hi>Paul,</hi> he kept the Moon from the wolves, and hoped to catch Larks if ever the Heavens ſhould fall: He did make of neceſſity vertue, of ſuch bread ſuch pottage, and cared as little for the peeled as for the ſhaven: Every morning he did caſt up his gorge, and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers little dogs eat out of the diſh with him, and he with them: He would bite their eares and they would ſcratch his noſe: he would blow in their arſes, and they would lick his chaps. But hearken good fellows, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got ill betake you, and whirle round your braines, if you do not give eare: This little Lecher was alwayes groping his Nurſes and Governeſſes, upſide down, arſwerzie, top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiturvie, <hi>harribourr quet,</hi> with a <hi>Yacco haick, hyck gio,</hi> handling them very rudely in jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and tumbling them to keep them go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for he had already begun to exerciſe the tooles, and put his Codpiece in practice; which Codpiece or <hi>Braguette,</hi> his Governeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:114744:33"/>
did every day deck up and adorn with faire noſegayes, curious rubles, ſweet flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and fine ſilken tufts, and very pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would paſſe their time, in taking you know what between their fingers, and dand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it, till it did revive and creep up to the bulk and ſtiffeneſſe of a ſuppoſitory, or <hi>ſtreat magdaleon,</hi> which is a hard rowled up ſalve, ſpread upon leather. Then did they burſt out in laughing, when they ſaw it lift up its eares, as if the ſport had liked them; one of them would call it her little dille, her ſtaffe of love, her quillety, her faucetin, her dandilollie: Another her peen, her jolly kyle, her bableret, her membretoon, her quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet Imp: Another again, her branch of coral, her female adamant, her placket-racket, her cyprian ſcepter, her jewel for Ladies: and ſome of the other women would give it theſe names, my bunguetee, my ſtopple too, my buſheruſher, my gallant wimble, my pretty boarer, my coney-borow ferret, my little piercer, my augretine, my dangling hangers, down right to it, ſtiffe and ſtout, in &amp; to, my puſher, dreſſer, pouting ſtick, my hony pipe, my pretty pillicock, linkie pinkie, futilletie, my luſtie andouille, and crimſon chitterlin: my little couille bredouille, my pretty rogue, and ſo forth: It belongs to me ſaid one: it is mine ſaid the other: What, quoth a third, ſhall I have no ſhare in it? by my faith I will
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:114744:33"/>
cut it then: Ha, to cut it (ſaid the other,) would hurt him; <hi>Madam,</hi> do you cut little childrens things? were his cut off, he would be then <hi>Monſieur ſans queue,</hi> the curtail'd Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. And that he might play and ſport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf after the manner of the other little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the countrey, they made him a faire weather whirljack, of the wings of the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil of <hi>Myrebalais.</hi>

                     <p>AFterwards, that he might be all his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time a good Rider, they made to him a faire great horſe of wood, which he did make leap, curvete, yerk out behinde, and skip forward, all at a time: to pace, trot, rack, gallop, amble, to play the hobbie, the hackney-guelding: go the gate of the camel &amp; of the wild aſſe. He made him alſo change his colour of hair, as the Monks of <hi>Coultibo,</hi> (according to the variety of their holy-days) uſe to do their clothes, from bay, brown, to ſorrel, daple-gray, mouſe-dun, deer-colour, roan, cow-colour, gingioline, skued colour, pybal'd, and the colour of the ſavage elk.</p>

beam of a Vine-preſſe: and of a great Oak, made up a mule, with a foot-cloth for his chamber. Beſides this, he had ten or twelve ſpare horſes, and ſeven horſes for poſt; and all theſe were lodged in his own chamber, cloſe by his bed-ſide. One day the Lord of <hi>Breadinbag</hi> came to viſit his father in great <note place="margin">Painen ſac Franc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repas mouille<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vent.</note> bravery, and with a gallant traine: and at the ſame time to ſee him came likewiſe the Duke of <hi>Free-meale,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gullet.</hi> The houſe truly for ſo many gueſts at once was ſomewhat narrow, but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſtables; whereupon the ſteward and harbinger of the ſaid Lord <hi>Breadinbag,</hi> to know if there were any other empty ſtables in the houſe, came to <hi>Gargantua,</hi> a little young lad, and ſecretly asked him where the ſtables of the great horſes were, thinking that children would be ready to tell all? Then he led them up along the ſtairs of the Caſtle, paſſing by the ſecond Hall unto a broad great Gallery, by which they entred into a large Tower, and as they were going up at another paire of ſtaires, ſaid the harbinger to the ſteward, this childe deceives us, for the ſtables are never on the top of the houſe: You may be miſtaken (ſaid the ſteward,) for I know ſome places at <hi>Lyons,</hi> at the <hi>Baſmette,</hi> at <hi>Chaunon,</hi> and elſewhere, which have their ſtables at the very tops of the houſes, ſo it may be, that behinde the houſe there is a way

to come to this aſcent, but I will queſtion with him further. Then ſaid he to <hi>Gargan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi> My pretty little boy, whither do you lead us? To the ſtable (ſaid he) of my great horſes, we are almoſt come to it, we have but theſe ſtaires to go up at, then leading them alongſt another great Hall, he brought them into his chamber, and opening the door ſaid unto them, This is the ſtable that you ask for: this is my gennet, this is my gelding, this my courſer, and this my hackney, and laid on them with a great Leaver: I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon you (ſaid he) this <hi>Frizeland</hi> horſe, I had him from <hi>Francfort,</hi> yet will I give him you; for he is a pretty little nagge, and will go very well, with a teſſel of gooſehawk, halfe a doſen of ſpaniels, and a brace of grey-hounds, thus are you King of the hares and partridges for all this winter. By St. <hi>John</hi> (ſaid they) now we are payed, he hath gleek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to ſome purpoſe, bobbed we are now for ever: I deny it (ſaid he) he was not here above three dayes, judge you now, whether they had moſt cauſe, either to hide their heads for ſhame, or to laugh at the jeſt: as they were going down again thus amazed, he asked them, Will you have a <hi>whimwham?</hi> What is that, ſaid they? It is (ſaid he) five turds <note place="margin">Aubeliere.</note> to make you a muzzel: To day (ſaid the ſteward,) though we happen to be roſted, we ſhall not be burnt, for we are pretty well
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:114744:35"/>
quipped and larded in my opinion. O my jolly daper boy, thou haſt given us a gudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I hope to ſee thee Pope before I die: I think ſo (ſaid he) my ſelf: and then ſhall you be a <hi>puppie,</hi> and this gentle <hi>popinjeay</hi> a perfect <hi>papelard,</hi> that is, diſſembler: Well, well, (ſaid the harbinger,) But (ſaid <hi>Gargan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua;)</hi> gueſſe how many ſtitches there are in my mothers ſmock: Sixteen (quoth the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binger,) You do not ſpeak Goſpel (ſaid <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantua)</hi> for there is ſent before, and ſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, and you did reckon them ill, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the <hi>two under holes:</hi> When (ſaid the harbinger?)

                     <p>ABout the end of the fifth yeare, <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gouſier</hi> returning from the Conqueſt of the <hi>Canarians,</hi> went by the way to ſee his ſonne <hi>Gargantua,</hi> there was he filled with joy, as ſuch a father might be at the ſight of ſuch a childe of his: and whileſt he kiſt him and embrac'd him, he asked many childiſh queſtions of him about divers mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and drank very freely with him and with his governeſſes, of whom in great ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, he asked amongſt other things, whether they had been careful to keep him clean and ſweet?

What is that. (ſaid <hi>Grangouſier,)</hi> how is it? I will tell you by and by (ſaid <hi>Gargantua,)</hi> once I did wipe me with a Gentlewomans Velvet-mask, and found it to be good; for the ſoftneſſe of the ſilk was very voluptuous and pleaſant to my fundament. Another time with one of their Hoods, and in like manner that was comfortable: At another time with a Ladies Neck-kerchief, and after that I wiped me with ſome ear-pieces of hers made of Crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſattin, but there was ſuch a number of golden ſpangles in them (turdie round things, a pox take them) that they fetched away all the skin of my taile with a vengeance. Now I wiſh St. <hi>Anthonies</hi> fire burn the bum-gut of the Goldſmith that made them, and of her that wore them: This hurt I cured by wiping my ſelf with a Pages cap, garniſhed with a feather after the <hi>Suitſers</hi> faſhion.</p>

that he could ſay it by heart backwards; and about this he was five yeares and three moneths.

I am very well after it, and dine but the better: and Maſter <hi>Tubal,</hi> (who was the firſt Licenciat at <hi>Paris,)</hi> told me that it was not enough to run apace, but to ſet forth betimes; ſo doth not the total welfare of our humanity depend upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual drinking in a rible rable, like ducks, but on drinking early in the morning: <hi>unde verſus,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <l>To riſe betimes is no good houre.</l>
                     <l>To drink betimes is better ſure.</l>
                     <p>After that he had throughly broke his faſt, he went to Church, and they carried to him in a great basket, a huge <hi>impantouſted</hi> or thick-covered breviary, weighing what in greaſe, claſps, parchment and cover, little more or leſſe then eleven hundred and ſix pounds. There he heard ſix and twenty or thirty Maſſes: This while, to the ſame place
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:114744:51"/>
came his oriſon-mutterer <hi>impaletocked,</hi> or lap't up about the chin, like a tufted whoop, and his breath pretty well antidoted with ſtore of the Vine-tree-ſirrup: with him he mumbled all his <hi>Kiriele,</hi> and dunſical brebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions, which he ſo curiouſly thumbed and fingered, that there fell not ſo much as one graine to the ground; as he went from the Church, they brought him upon a Dray drawn with oxen, a confuſed heap of <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notres</hi> and <hi>Aves</hi> of <hi>Sante Claude,</hi> every one of them being of the bigneſſe of a hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>block; and thus walking through the cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, galleries or garden, he ſaid more in turning them over, then ſixteen Hermites would have done. Then did he ſtudy ſome paltry half-houre with his eyes fixed upon his book; but (as the Comick ſaith,) his minde was in the Kitchin. Piſſing then a full Urinal, he ſate down at table: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was naturally flegmatick, he began his meale with ſome dozens of gammons, dried neats tongues, hard rowes of mullet, called <hi>Botargos, Andouilles</hi> or ſauciges, and ſuch other forerunners of wine; in the mean while, foure of his folks did caſt into his mouth one after another continually mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard by whole ſhovels full. Immediately after that, he drank a horrible draught of white-wine for the eaſe of his kidneys. When that was done, he ate according to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:114744:51"/>
the ſeaſon meat agreeable to his appetite, and then left off eating when his belly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſtrout, and was like to crack for ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; as for his drinking, he had in that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end nor rule; for he was wont to ſay, that the limits and bounds of drinking were, when the cork of the ſhoes of him that drinketh, ſwelleth up half a foot high.</p>

                     <p>After he had thus well played, reveled, paſt and ſpent his time, it was thought fit to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:114744:54"/>
drink a little, and that was eleven glaſſefuls the man, and immediately after making good cheer again, he would ſtretch himelf upon a faire bench, or a good large bed, and there ſleep two or three houres together, without thinking or ſpeaking any hurt. After he was awakened he would ſhake his eares a little. In the mean time they brought him freſh wine, there he drank better then ever. <hi>Pono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> ſhewed him, that it was an ill diet to drink ſo after ſleeping. It is (anſwered <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantua,)</hi> the very life of the Patriarchs and holy Fathers; for naturally I ſleepe ſalt, and my ſleep hath been to me in ſtead of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gamons of bacon. Then began he to ſtudy a little, and out came the <hi>patenotres</hi> or roſary of beads: which the better and more formally to diſpatch, he got up on an old mule, which had ſerved nine Kings, and ſo mumbling with his mouth, nodding and dodling his head, would go ſee a coney fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retted or caught in a grinne; At his return he went into the Kitchin, to know what roſte meat was on the ſpit, and what otherwayes was to be dreſt for ſupper: and ſupped very well upon my conſcience: and commonly did invite ſome of his neighbours that were good drinkers, with whom carouſing and drinking merrily, they told ſtories of all ſorts from the old to the new. Amongſt others, he had for domeſticks the Lords of <hi>Fou,</hi> of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:114744:54"/>
                        <hi>Gourville,</hi> of <hi>Griniot,</hi> and of <hi>Marigny.</hi> After ſupper were brought in upon the place the faire wooden Goſpels, and the books of the foure Kings, that is to ſay, many paires of tables and cardes: or the faire fluſſe, one, two, three: or at all to make ſhort work: or elſe they went to ſee the wenches there-abouts with little ſmall banquets, intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with collations and reer-Suppers. Then did he ſleep without unbrideling, until eighr a clock in the next morning.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>WHen <hi>Ponocrates</hi> knew <hi>Gargantua</hi>'s vicious manner of living, he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to bring him up in another kinde; but for a while he bore with him, conſidering that nature cannot endure a ſudden change, without great violence. Therefore to begin his work the better, he requeſted a learned Phyſician of that time, called Maſter <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus,</hi> ſeriouſly to perpend (if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,) how to bring <hi>Gargantua</hi> unto a better courſe; the ſaid Phyſician purged him cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:114744:55"/>
with <hi>Anticyrian ellebore,</hi> by which medicine he cleanſed all the alteration, and perverſe habitude of his braine. By this meanes alſo <hi>Ponocrates</hi> made him forget all that he had learned under his ancient <hi>Praece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptors,</hi> as <hi>Timothie</hi> did to his diſciples, who had been inſtructed under other Muſicians. To do this the better, they brought him into the company of learned men, which were there, in whoſe imitation he had a great deſire and affection to ſtudy otherwayes, and to improve his parts. Afterwards he put himſelf into ſuch a road and way of ſtudying, that he loſt not any one houre in the day, but employed all his time in learning, and honeſt knowledge. <hi>Gargantua</hi> awaked them about foure a clock in the morning; whileſt they were in rubbing of him, there was read unto him ſome chapter of the holy Scripture aloud and clearly, with a pronunciation fit for the matter, and hereunto was appointed a young page borne in <hi>Baſche,</hi> named <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoſtes,</hi> according to the purpoſe and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that leſſon, he oftentimes gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to worſhip, adore, pray, and ſend up his ſupplications to that good God, whoſe Word did ſhew his majeſty and marvellous judgement. Then went he unto the ſecret places to make excretion of his natural dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions: there his Maſter repeated what had been read, expounding unto him the moſt
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:114744:55"/>
obſcure and difficult points; in returning, they conſidered the face of the sky, if it was ſuch as they had obſerved it the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and into what ſignes the Sun was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, as alſo the Moon for that day. This done, he was apparelled, combed, curled, trimmed and perfumed, during which time they repeated to him the leſſons of the day before: he himſelf ſaid them by heart, and upon them would ground ſome practical ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes concerning the eſtate of man, which he would proſecute ſometimes two or three houres, but ordinarily they ceaſed aſſoon as he was fully clothed. Then for three good houres he had a lecture read unto him. This done, they went forth, ſtill conferring of the ſubſtance of the lecture, either unto a field near the Univerſity called the <hi>Brack,</hi> or unto the medowes where they played at the ball, the long-tennis, and at the <hi>Piletrigone, (which is a play wherein we throw a triangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar piece of iron at a ring, to paſſe it,)</hi> moſt gallantly exerciſing their bodies, as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they had done their mindes. All their play was but in liberty, for they left off when they pleaſed, and that was commonly when they did ſweat over all their body, or were otherwayes weary. Then were they very well wiped and rubbed, ſhifted their ſhirts, and walking ſoberly, went to ſee if dinner were ready. Whileſt they ſtayed for that,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:114744:56"/>
they did clearly and eloquently pronounce ſome ſentences that they had retained of the lecture, in the mean time Maſter Appetite came, and then very orderly ſate they down at table; at the beginning of the meale, there was read ſome pleaſant hiſtory of the warlike actions of former times, until he had taken a glaſſe of wine. Then (if they thought good) they continued reading, or began to diſcourſe merrily together; ſpeaking firſt of the vertue, propriety, efficacy and nature of all that was ſerved in at the table: of bread, of wine, of water, of ſalt, of fleſhes, fiſhes, fruits, herbs, roots, and of their dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; by meanes whereof, he learned in a little time all the paſſages competent for this that were to be found in <hi>Plinie, Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, Dioſcorides, Julius Pollux, Galen, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phirie, Oppian, Polybius, Heliodore, Ariſtotle, Elian,</hi> and others. Whileſt they talked of theſe things, many times to be the more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, they cauſed the very books to be brought to the table, and ſo well and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly did he in his memory retain the things aboveſaid, that in that time there was not a Phyſician that knew half ſo much as he did. Afterwards they conferred of the leſſons read in the morning, and ending their repaſt with ſome conſerve or marmelade of quinces: he pick't his teeth with maſtick tooth-pickers; waſh't his hands and eyes with faire freſh
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:114744:56"/>
water, and gave thanks unto God in ſome fine Canticks, made in praiſe of the divine bounty and munificence. This done, they brought in cards, not to play, but to learn a thouſand pretty tricks, and new inventions, which were all grounded upon <hi>Arithmetick:</hi> by this meanes he fell in love with that nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical ſcience, and every day after dinner and ſupper he paſt his time in it as pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as he was wont to do at cardes and dice: ſo that at laſt he underſtood ſo well both the Theory and Practical part thereof; that <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal</hi> the <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> who had written very largely of that purpoſe, confeſſed that veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in compariſon of him he had no skill at all. And not only in that, but in the other <hi>Mathematical</hi> Sciences, as <hi>Geometrie, Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomie, Muſick, &amp;c.</hi> for in waiting on the concoction, and attending the digeſtion of his food, they made a thouſand pretty inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and <hi>Geometrical</hi> figures, &amp; did in ſome meaſure practiſe the <hi>Aſtronomical</hi> canons.</p>
                     <p>After this, they recreated themſelves with ſinging <hi>muſically,</hi> in foure or five parts, or upon a ſet theme or ground at random, as it beſt pleaſed them; in matter of <hi>muſical</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, he learned to play upon the Lute, the Virginals, the Harp, the Allman Flute with nine holes, the Viol, and the Sackbut. This houre thus ſpent, and digeſtion finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he did purge his body of natural excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:114744:57"/>
then betook himſelf to his principal ſtudy for three houres together, or more, as well to repeat his matutinal lectures, as to proceed in the book wherein he was, as alſo to write handſomly, to draw and forme the <hi>Antick</hi> and <hi>Romane</hi> letters. This being done, they went out of their houſe, and with them a young Gentleman of <hi>Touraine,</hi> named the Eſquire <hi>Gymnaſt,</hi> who taught him the Art of riding; changing then his clothes, he rode a <hi>Naples</hi> courſer, a <hi>Dutch</hi> rouſſin, a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> gennet, a barded or trapped ſteed, then a light fleet horſe, unto whom he gave a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred carieres, made him go the high ſaults, bounding in the aire, free the ditch with a skip, leap over a ſtile or pale, turne ſhort in a ring both to the right and left hand. There he broke not his lance; for it is the greateſt foolery in the world, to ſay, I have broken ten lances at tilt, or in fight, a Carpenter can do even as much: but it is a glorious and praiſe-worthy action, with one lance to break and overthrow ten enemies: therefore with a ſharp, ſtiffe, ſtrong and well-ſteeled lance, would he uſually force up a door, pierce a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, beat down a tree, carry away the ring, lift up a cuiraſier ſaddle, with the male-coat and gantlet; all this he did in compleat armes from head to foot. As for the prancing flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, and ſmacking popiſmes, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cheriſhing of the horſe, commonly uſed
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:114744:57"/>
in riding, none did them better then he. The cavallerize of <hi>Ferrara</hi> was but as an Ape compared to him. He was ſingularly skilful in leaping nimbly from one horſe to another, without putting foot to ground, and theſe horſes were called <hi>deſultories:</hi> he could like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe from either ſide, with a lance in his hand, leap on horſeback without ſtirrups, and rule the horſe at his pleaſure without a bridle, for ſuch things are uſeful in military engagements. Another day he exerciſed the battel-axe, which he ſo dextrouſly wield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, both in the nimble, ſtrong and ſmooth management of that weapon, and that in all the feats practiſeable by it, that he paſt Knight of Armes in the field, and at all Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayes. Then toſt he the pike, played with the two-handed ſword, with the backſword, with the ſpaniſh tuck, the dagger, poiniard, armed, unarmed, with a buckler, with a cloak, with a targuet. Then would he hunt the Hart, the Roe-buck, the Beare, the fallow Deer, the wilde Boare, the Hare, the Pheſant, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge and the Buſtard. He played at the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loon, and made it bound in the aire, both with fiſt and foot. He wreſtled, ran, jump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not at three ſteps and a leap <hi>(called the hops,)</hi> nor at <hi>clochepied, (called the Hares leap,)</hi> nor yet at the <hi>Almanes;</hi> for (ſaid <hi>Gymnaſt,)</hi> theſe jumps are for the warres altogether unprofitable, and of no uſe: but at one leap
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:114744:58"/>
he would skip over a ditch, ſpring over a hedge, mount ſix paces upon a wall, ramp and grapple after this faſhion up againſt a window, of the full height of a lance. He did ſwim in deep waters on his belly, on his back, ſidewiſe, with all his body, with his feet only, with one hand in the air, wherin he held a book, croſſing thus the bredth of the river of <hi>Seine,</hi> without wetting it, and dragged along his cloak with his teeth, as did <hi>Julius Caeſar;</hi> then with the help of one hand, he entred forcibly into a boat, from whence he caſt himſelf again headlong into the water, ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the depths, hollowed the rocks, and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the pits and gulphs. Then turned he the boat about, governed it, led it ſwiftly or ſlowly with the ſtream and againſt the ſtream, ſtopped it in its courſe, guided it with one hand, and with the other laid hard about him with a huge great Oare, hoiſed the ſaile, hied up along the maſt by the ſhrouds, ran upon the edge of the decks, ſet the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe in order, tackled the boulins, and ſteer'd the helme. Coming out of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he ran furiouſly up againſt a hill, and with the ſame alacrity and ſwiftneſſe ran down again; he climbed up at trees like a cat; and leaped from the one to the other like a ſquirrel; he did pull down the great boughes and branches, like another <hi>Milo;</hi> then with two ſharp well-ſteeled daggers,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:114744:58"/>
and two tried bodkins, would he run up by the wall to the very top of a houſe like a cat; then ſuddenly came down from the top to the bottom, with ſuch an even compoſition of members, that by the fall he would catch no harme.</p>
                     <p>He did caſt the dart, throw the barre, put the ſtone, practiſe the javelin, the boar-ſpear or partiſan, and the halbard; he broke the ſtrongeſt bowes in drawing, bended againſt his breaſt the greateſt croſſe-bowes of ſteele, took his aime by the eye with the hand-gun, and ſhot well, traverſed and planted the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, ſhot at but-marks, at the papgay from below upwards, <hi>or to a height;</hi> from above downwards, <hi>or to adeſcent,</hi> then before him, ſidewiſe, and behinde him, like the <hi>Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> They tied a cable-rope to the top of a high Tower, by one end whereof hanging near the ground, he wrought himſelf with his hands to the very top: Then upon the ſame tract came down ſo ſturdily and firme that you could not on a plaine meadow have run with more aſſurance. They ſet up a great pole fixed upon two trees, there would he hang by his hands, and with them alone, his feet touching at nothing, would go back and ſore along the foreſaid rope with ſo great ſwiftneſſe, that hardly could one over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take him with running; and then to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his breaſt and lungs, he would ſhout like
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:114744:59"/>
all the Devils in hell; I heard him once call <hi>Eudemon</hi> from St. <hi>Victors</hi> gate to <hi>Monmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre: Stentor</hi> had never ſuch a voyce at the ſiege of <hi>Troy.</hi> Then for the ſtrengthening of his nerves or ſinewes, they made him two great ſows of lead, each of them weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eight thouſand and ſeven hundred kintals, which they called <hi>Alteres;</hi> thoſe he took up from the ground in each hand one, then lifted them up over his head, and held them ſo without ſtirring three quarters of an hour and more, which was an inimitable force; he fought at Barriers with the ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt vigorous Champions: and when it came to the cope he ſtood ſo ſturdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on his feet, that he abandoned himſelf unto the ſtrongeſt, in caſe they could remove him from his place, as <hi>Milo</hi> was wont to do of old; in whoſe imitation likewiſe he held a Pomgranat in his hand, to give it unto him that could take it from him: The time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus beſtowed, and himſelf rubbed, cleanſed, wiped, and refreſht with other clothes, he returned fair and ſoftly; and paſſing through certain meadows, or other graſſie places, beheld the trees and plants, comparing them with what is written of them in the books of the Ancients, ſuch as <hi>Theophraſt, Dioſcorides, Marinus, Plinie, Nicander, Macer,</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> and carried home to the houſe great handfuls of them,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:114744:59"/>
whereof a young Page called <hi>Rizotomos</hi> had charge; together with little Mattocks, Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axes, Grubbing-hooks, Cabbies, Pruning-knives, and other inſtruments requiſite for herboriſing. Being come to their lodging, whileſt ſupper was making ready, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated certain paſſages of that which hath been read, and ſate down at table. Here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that his dinner was ſober and thrifty, for he did then eat only to prevent the gnawings of his ſtomack, but his ſupper was copious and large; for he took then as much as was fit to maintaine and nouriſh him; which indeed is the true diet preſcribed by the Art of good and ſound <hi>Phyſick.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a rabble of loggerheaded Phyſicians, nuzzeled in the brabling ſhop of <hi>Sophiſters,</hi> counſel the contrary; during that repaſt was continued the leſſon read at dinner as long as they thought good: the reſt was ſpent in good diſcourſe, learned and profitable. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that they had given thanks, he ſet himſelf to ſing vocally, and play upon harmonious inſtruments, or otherwayes paſſed his time at ſome pretty ſports, made with cards or dice; or in practiſing the feats of <hi>Legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi> with cups and balls. There they ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome nights in frolicking thus, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king themſelves merrie till it was time to go to bed; and on other nights they would go make viſits unto learned men, or to ſuch as
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:114744:60"/>
had been travellers in ſtrange and remote countreys. When it was full night before they retired themſelves, they went unto the moſt open place of the houſe to ſee the face of the sky, and there beheld the comets, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were, as likewiſe the figures, ſituations, aſpects, oppoſitions and conjunctions of the both fixed ſtarres and planets.</p>
                     <p>Then with his Maſter did he briefely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capitulate after the manner of the <hi>Pythagore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that which he had read, ſeen, learned, done and underſtood in the whole courſe of that day.</p>
                     <p>Then prayed they unto <hi>God</hi> the Creator, in falling down before him, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening their faith towards him, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying him for his boundleſſe bounty, and giving thanks unto him for the time that was paſt, they recommended themſelves to his divine clemency for the future, which being done, they went to bed, and betook themſelves to their repoſe and reſt.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>IF it happened that the weather were any thing cloudie, foul &amp; rainie, all the forenoon was employed, as before ſpecified, according to cuſtom, with this difference only, that they had a good clear fire lighted, to correct the diſtempers of the aire: but after dinner, in ſtead of their wonted exercitations they did abide within, and by way of <hi>Apotherapie,</hi> (that is, <hi>a making the body healthful by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,)</hi> did recreate themſelves in botteling up of hay, in cleaving and ſawing of wood, and in threſhing ſheaves of corn at the Barn. Then they ſtudied the Art of painting or carving; or brought into uſe the antick play of tables, as <hi>Leonicus</hi> hath written of it, and as our good friend <hi>Laſcaris</hi> playeth at it. In play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they examined the paſſages of ancient Authors, wherein the ſaid play is mentioned, or any metaphore drawn from it. They went likewiſe to ſee the drawing of mettals, or the caſting of great ordnance: how the Lapidaries did work, as alſo the Goldſmiths and Cutters of precious ſtones: nor did they

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:114744:62"/>
of <hi>Lerne</hi> happened to paſſe along in the broad high way, driving unto the City ten or twelve horſes loaded with cakes, the ſaid ſhepherds courteouſly intreated them to give them ſome for their money, as the price then ruled in the market; for here it is to be remarked, that it is a celeſtial food to eate for breakfaſt hot freſh cakes with grapes, eſpecially the frail cluſters, the great red grapes, the muſcadine, the verjuice grape and the luskard, for thoſe that are coſtive in their belly; becauſe it will make them guſh out, and ſquirt the length of a Hunters ſtaffe, like the very tap of a barrel; and often-times thinking to let a ſquib, they did all-to-beſquatter and conskite themſelves, whereupon they are commonly called the Vintage-thinkers. The Bunſellers or Cake-bakers were in nothing inclinable to their requeſt; but (which was worſe) did injure them moſt outragiouſly, calling them prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling gablers, lickorous gluttons, freckled bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, mangie raſcals, ſhiteabed ſcoundrels, drunken royſters, ſlie knaves, drowſie loi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, ſlapſauce fellows, ſlabberdegullion druggels, lubbardly lowts, coſening foxes, ruffian rogues, paultrie cuſtomers, ſyco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant-varlets, drawlatch hoydons, flouting milkſops, jeering companions, ſtaring clowns, forlorn ſnakes, ninnie lobcocks, ſcurvie ſneaksbies, fondling fops, baſe lowns,

To which provoking words, one amongſt them, called <hi>Forgier,</hi> (an honeſt fellow of his perſon, and a notable ſpringal,) made anſwer very calmly thus: How long is it ſince you have got hornes, that you are become ſo proud? indeed formerly you were wont to give us ſome freely, and will you not now let us have any for our money? This is not the part of good neighbours, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do we ſerve you thus when you come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to buy our good corn, wherof you make your cakes and buns: beſides that, we would have given you to the bargain ſome of our grapes, but <hi>by his Zounds,</hi> you may chance to repent it, and poſſibly have need of us at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other time, when we ſhall uſe you after the like manner, and therefore remember it. Then <hi>Marquet,</hi> a prime man in the confra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:114744:63"/>
of the cake-bakers, ſaid unto him, Yea Sir, thou art pretty well creſt-riſen this morning, thou didſt eat yeſternight too much millet and bolymoug, come hither <hi>Sirrah,</hi> come hither, I will give thee ſome cakes: whereupon <hi>Forgier</hi> dreading no harm, in all ſimplicity went towards him, and drew a ſixpence out of his leather ſach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, thinking that <hi>Market</hi> would have ſold him ſome of his cakes; but in ſtead of cakes, he gave him with his whip ſuch a rude laſh overthwart the legs, that the marks of the whipcord knots were apparent in them; then would have fled away, but <hi>Forgier</hi> cried out as loud as he could, O murther, murther, help, help, help, and in the mean time threw a great cudgel after him, which he carried under his arme, wherewith he hit him in the <hi>coronal</hi> joynt of his head, upon the <hi>crotaphick</hi> arterie of the right ſide thereof, ſo forcibly, that <hi>Marquet</hi> fell down from his mare, more like a dead then living man. Mean-while the farmers and countrey-ſwaines that were watching their walnuts near to that place, came running with their great poles and long ſtaves, and laid ſuch load on theſe cake-bakers, as if they had been to threſh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on green rie. The other ſhepherds and ſhepherdeſſes hearing the lamentable ſhout of <hi>Forgier,</hi> came with their ſlings and ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies following them, and throwing great
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:114744:64"/>
ſtones at them, as thick as if it had been haile. At laſt they overtook them, and took from them about foure or five doſen of their cakes: nevertheleſſe they payed for them the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary price, and gave them over and above one hundred egges, and three baskets full of mulberries. Then did the cake-bakers help to get up to his mare<hi>-Marquet,</hi> who was moſt ſhrewdly wounded, and forthwith returned to <hi>Lerne,</hi> changing the reſolution they had to go to <hi>Pareille,</hi> threatning very ſharp and boiſtrouſly the cowherds, ſhepherds and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of <hi>Sevile</hi> and <hi>Sinays.</hi> This done, the ſhepherds and ſhepherdeſſes made merry with theſe cakes and fine grapes, and ſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves together at the ſound of the pretty ſmall pipe, ſcoffing and laughing at thoſe vain-glorious cake-bakers, who had that day met with a miſchief for want of croſſing themſelves with a good hand in the morning. Nor did they forget to apply to <hi>Forgiers</hi> leg ſome faire great red medicinal grapes, and ſo handſomly dreſt it and bound it up, that he was quickly cured.</p>

                     <p>SO much they did, and ſo farre they went pillaging and ſtealing, that at laſt they came to <hi>Sevile,</hi> where they robbed both men and women, and took all they could catch: nothing was either too hot or too heavie for them. Although the plague was there in the moſt part of all the houſes, they neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe entered every where; then plundered and carried away all that was within; and yet for all this not one of them took any hurt, which is a moſt wonderful caſe. For the Curates, Vicars, Preachers, Phyſicians, Chirurgions and Apothecaries, who went to viſit, to dreſſe, to cure, to heale, to preach unto, and admoniſh thoſe that were ſick were all dead of the infection; and theſe devilliſh robbers and murtherers caught ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any harme at all. Whence comes this to paſſe, (my maſters) I beſeech you think upon it? the town being thus pillaged, they
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:114744:66"/>
went unto the Abbey with a horrible noiſe and tumult, but they found it ſhut and made faſt againſt them; whereupon the body of the army marched forward towards a paſſe or ford called the <hi>Sue de vede,</hi> except ſeven companies of foot, and two hundred lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciers, who ſtaying there, broke down the walls of the Cloſſe, to waſte, ſpoile and make havock of all the Vines and Vintage within that place. The Monks (poor devils) knew not in that extremity to which of all their Sancts they ſhould vow themſelves; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, at all adventures they rang the bells <hi>ad capitulum capitulantes:</hi> there it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that they ſhould make a faire Proceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſtnſſed with good lectures, prayers and letanies, <hi>contra hoſtium inſidias,</hi> and jollie reſponſes <hi>pro pace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There was then in the Abbey a clauſtral Monk, called <hi>Freer Ihon</hi> of the funnels and gobbets, in French <hi>des entoumeures,</hi> young, gallant, frisk, luſtie, nimble, <hi>quick, active,</hi> bold, adventurous, reſolute, tall, lean, wide-mouthed, long-noſed, a faire diſpatcher of morning prayers, unbridler of maſſes, and runner over of vigils: and to conclude ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily in a word, a right Monk, if ever there was any, ſince the Monking world monked a Monkerie: for the reſt a Clerk, even to the teeth in matter of breviary. This Monk hearing the noiſe that the enemy made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

the incloſure of the Vineyard, went out to ſee what they were doing; and perceiving that they were cutting and gathering the grapes, whereon was grounded the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all their next yeares wine, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the quire of the Church where the other Monks were, all amazed and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like ſo many Bell-melters, whom when he heard ſing, <hi>im, nim, pe, ne, ne, ne, ne, nene, tum, ne, num, num, ini, i mi, co, o, no, o, o, neno, ne, no, no, no, rum, nenum, num.</hi> It is well ſhit, well ſung, (ſaid he) by the vertue of God, why do not you ſing Paniers fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, Vintage is done; The devil ſnatch me, if they be not already within the middle of our Cloſſe, and cut ſo well both Vines and Grapes, that <hi>by cods body</hi> there will not be found for theſe four yeares to come ſo much as a gleaning in it. <hi>By the belly of Sanct James,</hi> what ſhall we <hi>(poor devils)</hi> drink the while?

are not in ſeaſon: wherefore is it that our devotions were inſtituted to be ſhort in the time of Harveſt and Vintage, and long in the Advent, and all the winter? The late Friar, <hi>Maſſepeloſſe</hi> of good memory, a true zealous man, (or elſe I give my ſelf to the devil) of our religion, told me, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it well, how the reaſon was, that in this ſeaſon we might preſſe and make the wine, and in Winter whiffe it up. Heark you, my maſters, you that love the wine, <hi>Cops body</hi> follow me, for <hi>Sanct Antonie</hi> burn me as freely as a fagot, if they get leave to taſte one drop of the liquour, that will not now come and fight for relief of the Vine. Hogs belly, the goods of the Church! Ha, no, no: what the devil, <hi>Sanct Thomas</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was well content to die for them; if I died in the ſame cauſe, ſhould not I be a <hi>Sanct</hi> likewiſe? Yes: yet ſhall not I die there for all this, for it is I that muſt do it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and ſend them a packing. As he ſpake this, he threw off his great Monks habit, and laid hold upon the ſtaffe of the croſſe, which was made of the heart of a ſorbaple-tree, it being of the length of a lance, round, of a full gripe, and a little poudred with lilies called <hi>flower de luce,</hi> the workmanſhip whereof was almoſt all defaced and worn out. Thus went he out in a faire long-skirted jacket, putting his frock ſcarfewayes athwart his breaſt, and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:114744:68"/>
in this equipage, with his ſtaffe, ſhaft or truncheon of the croſſe, laid on ſo luſtily, brisk and fiercely upon his enemies, who without any order, or enſigne, or trumpet, or drum, were buſied in gathering the grapes of the Vineyard; for the Cornets, Guidons and Enſigne-bearers, had laid down their ſtandards, banners, and colours by the wall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides: the Drummers had knock't out the heads of their Drums on one end, to fill them with grapes: The Trumpeters were loaded with great bundles of bunches, and huge knots of cluſters: In ſumme, every one of them was out of aray, and all in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order. He hurried therefore upon them ſo rudely, without crying <hi>gare</hi> or beware, that he overthrew them like hogs, tumbled them over like ſwine, ſtriking athwart and alongſt, and by one means or other laid ſo about him, after the old faſhion of fencing, that to ſome he beat out their braines, to others he cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their armes, battered their legs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwacked their ſides till their ribs cracked with it; to others again he unjoynted the ſpondyles <hi>or knuckles of the neck,</hi> disfigured their chaps, gaſhed their faces, made their cheeks hang flapping on their chin, and ſo ſwinged and belammed them, that they fell down before him like hay before a Mower: to ſome others he ſpoiled the frame of their kidneys, marred their backs, broke their
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:114744:68"/>
thigh-bones, paſh't in their noſes, poached out their eyes, cleft their mandibules, tore their jaws, dung in their teeth into their throat, ſhook aſunder their omoplates or ſhoulder-blade, <hi>ſphacelated</hi> their ſhins, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified their ſhanks, inflamed their ankles, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved off of the hinges their iſhies, their <hi>ſcia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica</hi> or hip-gout, diſlocated the joints of the knees, ſquattered into pieces the boughts or peſtles of their thighs, and ſo thumped, mawled and belaboured them every where, that never was corne ſo thick and threefold threſh't upon by Plowmens flailes, as were the pitifully disjoynted members of their mangled bodies, under the mercileſſe baton of the croſſe. If any offered to hide himſelf amongſt the thickeſt of the Vines, he laid him ſquat as a flounder, bruiſed the ridge of his back, and daſh't his reines like a dog.

Others again he ſo quaſhed and bebumped, that with a ſound bounce under the hollow of their ſhort ribs, he overturned their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs ſo that they died immediately: to ſome with a ſmart ſouſe on the <hi>Epigaſter,</hi> he would make their midrif ſwag, then redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the blow; gave them ſuch a home-puſh on the navel, that he made their puddings to guſh out.

They preſently leaving their outer habits and cowles upon the railes, began to throttle and make an end of thoſe whom he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready cruſhed: Can you tell with what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments they did it? with faire <hi>gullics,</hi>

which are little hulchback't demi-knives, the iron toole whereof is two inches long, and the wooden handle one inch thick, and three inches in length, wherewith the little boyes in our countrey cut ripe walnuts in two, (while they are yet in the ſhell,) and pick out the kernel, and they found them very fit for the expediting of that wezand-ſlitting ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit. In the mean time <hi>Friar Ihon</hi> with his formidable baton of the Croſſe, got to the breach which the enemies had made, and there ſtood to ſnatch up thoſe that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to eſcape: Some of the <hi>Monkito's</hi> carried the ſtandards, banners, enſignes, gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons and colours into their cells and cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, to make garters of them. But when thoſe that had been ſhriven, would have gone out at the gap of the ſaid breach, the ſturdy <hi>Monk</hi> quaſh't and fell'd them down with blowes, ſaying, Theſe men have had confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and are penitent ſoules, they have got their abſolution, and gained the pardons: they go into Paradiſe as ſtreight as a ſickle, or as the way is to <hi>Faye, (like Crooked-Lane at Eaſtcheap.)</hi> Thus by his proweſſe and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour were diſcomfited all thoſe of the army that entred into the Cloſſe of the Abbey, unto the number of thirteen thouſand, ſix hundred, twenty and two, beſides the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and little children, which is alwayes to be underſtood.

In the morning he ſtormed and took the Bulwarks and Caſtle, which afterwards he fortified with rampiers, and furniſhed with all ammunition requiſite, intending to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:114744:71"/>
make his retreat there, if he ſhould happen to be otherwiſe worſted; for it was a ſtrong place, both by Art and Nature, in regard of the ſtance and ſituation of it. But let us leave them there, and return to our good <hi>Gargantua,</hi> who is at <hi>Paris</hi> very aſſiduous and earneſt at the ſtudy of good letters, and ath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letical exercitations, and to the good old man <hi>Grangouſier</hi> his father, who after ſupper warmeth his ballocks by a good, clear, great fire, and waiting upon the broyling of ſome cheſtnuts, is very ſerious in drawing ſcratches on the hearth, with a ſtick burnt at the one end, wherewith they did ſtirre up the fire, telling to his wife and the reſt of the family pleaſant old ſtories and tales of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times. Whileſt he was thus employed, one of the ſhepherds which did keep the Vines, (named <hi>Pillot)</hi> came towards him, and to the full related the enormous abuſes which were committed, and the exceſſive ſpoil that was made by <hi>Picrochole</hi> King of <hi>Lerne,</hi> upon his lands and territories, and how he had pillaged, waſted and ranſacked all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, except the incloſure at <hi>Sevile,</hi> which Friar <hi>Ihon des entoumeures</hi> to his great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour had preſerved: and that at the ſame preſent time the ſaid King was in the rock <hi>Clermond:</hi> and there with great induſtry and circumſpection, was ſtrengthening himſelf and his whole army. <hi>Halas, halas, alas,</hi> (ſaid

I proteſt, I ſwear before thee, ſo be thou fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to me, if ever I did him or his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects any damage or diſpleaſure, or commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any the leaſt robbery in his countrey; but on the contrary I have ſuccoured and ſupplied him with men, money, friendſhip and counſel upon any occaſion, wherein I could be ſteadable for the improvement of his good; that he hath therefore at this nick of time ſo outraged and wronged me, it cannot be but by the malevolent and wicked ſpirit. Good God, thou knoweſt my courage, for nothing can be hidden from thee; if perhaps he be grown mad, and that thou haſt ſent him hither to me for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter recovery &amp; re-eſtabliſhment of his brain: grant me power and wiſdome to bring him to the yoke of thy holy will by good diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. <hi>Ho, ho, ho, ho,</hi> my good people, my friends and my faithful ſervants, muſt I hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you from helping me? alas, my old age required henceforward nothing elſe but
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:114744:72"/>
reſt, and all the dayes of my life I have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured for nothing ſo much as peace: but now I muſt (I ſee it well) load with armes my poor, weary and feeble ſhoulders; and take in my trembling hand the lance and horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans mace, to ſuccour and protect my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ſubjects: reaſon will have it ſo; for by their labour am I entertained, and with their ſweat am I nouriſhed, I, my children and my family. This notwithſtanding, I will not undertake warre, until I have firſt tried all the wayes and meanes of peace, that I reſolve upon. Then aſſembled he his counſel, and propoſed the matter as it was indeed, whereupon it was concluded, that they ſhould ſend ſome diſcreet man unto <hi>Picrochole,</hi> to know wherefore he had thus ſuddenly broken the Peace, and invaded thoſe lands unto which he had no right nor title. Furthermore, that they ſhould ſend for <hi>Gargantua,</hi> and thoſe under his command, for the preſervation of the countrey, and defence thereof now at need.

                     <p>THe fervency of thy ſtudies did require, that I ſhould not in a long time recall thee from that Philoſophical reſt thou now enjoyeſt: if the confidence repoſed in our friends and ancient confederates had not at this preſent diſappointed the aſſurance of my old age: But ſeeing ſuch is my fatal deſtiny, that I ſhould be now diſquieted by thoſe in whom I truſted moſt: I am forced to call thee back to help the people and goods, which by the right of nature belong unto thee; for even as armes are weak abroad if there be not counſel at home: ſo is that ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy vaine, and counſel unprofitable, which in a due and convenient time is not by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue executed and put in effect. My delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is not to provoke, but to appeaſe: not to aſſault, but to defend: not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, but to preſerve my faithful ſubjects and hereditary dominions: into which <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crochole</hi> is entred in a hoſtile manner without any ground or cauſe, and from day to day purſueth his furious enterpriſe with that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:114744:73"/>
height of inſolence that is intolerable to free-born ſpirits. I have endeavoured to moderate his tyrannical <hi>choler,</hi> offering him all that which I thought might give him ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction: and oftentimes have I ſent lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly unto him, to underſtand wherein, by whom, and how he found himſelf to be wronged? but of him could I obtain no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anſwer, but a meer defiance, and that in my lands he did pretend only to the right of a civil correſpondency and good behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, whereby I knew that the eternal God hath left him to the diſpoſure of his own free will and ſenſual appetite, which cannot chuſe but be wicked, if by divine grace it be not continually guided: and to contain him within his duty, and bring him to know himſelf, hath ſent him hither to me by a grievous token. Therefore, my beloved ſon, as ſoon as thou canſt, upon ſight of theſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, repaire hither with all diligence, to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour not me ſo much (which nevertheleſſe by natural Piety thou oughteſt to do,) as thine own People, which by reaſon thou mayeſt ſave and preſerve.

                     <p>THere cannot ariſe amongſt men a juſter cauſe of grief, then when they receive hurt and damage, where they may juſtly expect for favour and good will; and not without cauſe, (though without reaſon,) have many, after they had fallen into ſuch a calamitous accident, eſteemed this indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty leſſe ſupportable then the loſſe of their own lives, in ſuch ſort, that if they have not been able by force of armes, nor any other means, by reach of wit or ſubtilty, to ſtop them in their courſe, and reſtrain their fury, they have fallen into deſparation, and utterly
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:114744:74"/>
deprived themſelves of this light. It is therefore no wonder if King <hi>Grangouſier</hi> my Maſter be full of high diſpleaſure, and much diſquieted in minde upon thy outragious and hoſtile coming: but truly it would bea mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, if he were not ſenſible of, and moved with the incomparable abuſes and injuries perpetrated by thee and thine upon thoſe of his countrey, towards whom there hath been no example of inhumanity omitted; which in it ſelf is to him ſo grievous for the cordial affection, wherewith he hath alwayes che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed his ſubjects, that more it cannot be to any mortal man; yet in this (above humane apprehenſion) is it to him the more grievous, that theſe wrongs and ſad offences have been committed by thee and thine, who time out of minde from all antiquity, thou and thy Predeceſſors have been in a continual league and amity with him, and all his Anceſtors; which, even until this time, you have as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred together inviolably preſerved, kept and entertained, ſo well, that not he and his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but the very barbarous Nations of the <hi>Poictevins, Bretons, Manceaux,</hi> and thoſe that dwell beyond the iſles of the <hi>Canaries,</hi> and that of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> have thought it as eaſie to pull down the firmament, and to ſet up the depths above the clouds, as to make a breach in your alliance; and have been ſo afraid of it in their enterpriſes, that they have never
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:114744:75"/>
dared to provoke, incenſe or indamage the one for feare of the other. Nay, which is more, this ſacred league hath ſo filled the world, that there are few Nations at this day inhabiting throughout all the continent and iſles of the Ocean, who have not ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly aſpired to be received into it, upon your own covenants and conditions, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your joynt confederacie in as high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem as their own territories and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; in ſuch ſort, that from the memory of man, there hath not been either Prince or league ſo wilde and proud, that durſt have offered to invade, I ſay not your countreys, but not ſo much as thoſe of your confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates: and if by raſh and headie counſel they have attempted any new deſigne againſt them, aſſoon as they heard the name and title of your alliance, they have ſuddenly deſiſted from their enterpriſes. What rage and madneſſe therefore doth now incite thee, all old alliance infringed, all amity trod under foot, and all right violated, thus in a hoſtil manner to invade his countrey, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having been by him or his in any thing prejudiced, wronged or provoked? where is faith? where is law? where is reaſon? where is humanity? where is the feare of God? doſt thou think that theſe atrocious abuſes are hidden from the eternal ſpirits, and the ſupreme God, who is the juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder

Is it thy fatal deſtiny, or influences of the ſtars that would put an end to thy ſo long enjoyed eaſe and reſt? for that all things have their end and period, ſo as that when they are come to the ſuperlative point of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt height, they are in a trice tumbled down again, as not being able to abide long in that ſtate. This is the concluſion and end of thoſe who cannot by reaſon and temperance moderate their fortunes and proſperities. But if it be predeſtinated that thy happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and eaſe muſt now come to an end, muſt it needs be by wronging my King? him by whom thou wert eſtabliſhed? If thy houſe muſt come to ruine, ſhould it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in its fall cruſh the heels of him that ſet it up?

                     <p>Being come to the gate, they required to ſpeak with <hi>Picrochole</hi> from <hi>Grangouſier.

dozen did our people take away, they were well payed for; we love Peace ſo well, that we reſtore unto you five cartloads, of which this cart ſhall be for <hi>Marquet,</hi> who doth moſt complain; beſides, to content him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, here are ſeven hundred thouſand and three <hi>Philips,</hi> which I deliver to him: and for the loſſes he may pretend to have ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I reſigne for ever the farme of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mardiere,</hi> to be poſſeſſed in fee-ſimple by him and his for ever, without the payment of any duty, or acknowledgement of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, fealtie, fine or ſervice whatſoever: and here is the tenor of the deed, and for Gods ſake let us live henceforward in Peace, and withdraw your ſelves merrily into your own countrey from within this place, unto which you have no right at all, as your ſelves muſt needs confeſſe, and let us be good friends as before. <hi>Touquedillon</hi> related all this to <hi>Picrochole,</hi> and more and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated his courage, ſaying to him, Theſe clowns are afraid to ſome purpoſe: by G<hi>—Grangouſier</hi> conskites himſelf for feare; the poor drinker he is not skilled in warfare, nor hath he any ſtomach for it, he knows better how to empty the flaggons, that is his Art.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:114744:78"/>
they think to have to do with a <hi>ninnie-whoop,</hi> to feed you thus with cakes? You may ſee what it is; the good uſage, and great famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity which you have had with them hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, hath made you contemptible in their eyes. <hi>Anoint a villain, he will prick you: prick a villain, and he will anoint you:</hi> Sa, ſa, ſa, (ſaid <hi>Picrochole,)</hi> by St. <hi>James</hi> you have <note place="margin">Ungentem pungit. pungentem ruſticus ungit.</note> given a true character of them. One thing I will adviſe you (ſaid <hi>Touquedillon,)</hi> we are here but badly victualled, and furniſhed with mouth-harnaſſe very ſlenderly: if <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gouſier</hi> ſhould come to beſiege us, I would go preſently, and pluck out of all your ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers heads and mine own all the teeth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept three to each of us, and with them alone we ſhould make an end of our proviſion, but too ſoon we ſhall have (ſaid <hi>Picrochole,)</hi> but too much ſuſtenance and feeding-ſtuffe: came we hither to eat or to fight? To fight indeed (ſaid <hi>Touquedillon,)</hi> yet from the panch comes the dance, and where famine rules force is exiled. Leave off your prating (ſaid <hi>Picrochole,)</hi> and forthwith ſeize upon what they have brought. Then took they money and cakes, oxen and carts, and ſent them away without ſpeaking one word, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they would come no more ſo near, for a reaſon that they would give them the morrow after.

the whole matter unto him, ſubjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there was no hope left to draw them to Peace, but by ſharp and fierce warres.</p>

                     <p>IN this ſame very houre <hi>Gargantua,</hi> who was gone out of <hi>Paris,</hi> aſſoon as he had read his fathers letters, coming upon his great mare had already paſt the Nunnerie-bridge himſelf, <hi>Ponocrates, Gymnaſt</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demon,</hi> who all three, the better to inable them to go along with him took Poſt-hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: the reſt of his traine came after him by even journeys at a ſlower pace, bringing with them all his books and Philoſophical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments; aſſoon as he had alighted at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rille,</hi> he was informed by a farmer of <hi>Gouget,</hi> how <hi>Picrochole</hi> had fortified himſelf within the rock <hi>Clermond,</hi> and had ſent Captain <hi>Tripet</hi> with a great army to ſet upon the wood of <hi>Vede</hi> and <hi>Vaugaudry,</hi> and that they had already plundered the whole countrey, not leaving cock nor hen, even as farre as to the wine-preſſe of <hi>Billiard.</hi> Theſe ſtrange and almoſt incredible newes of the enormous abuſes, thus committed over all the land, ſo affrighted <hi>Gargantua,</hi> that he knew not what
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:114744:83"/>
to ſay nor do: but <hi>Ponocrates</hi> counſelled him to go unto the Lord of <hi>Vauguyon,</hi> who at all times had been their friend and confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and that by him they ſhould be better adviſed in their buſineſſe: which they did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently, and found him very willing, and fully reſolved to aſſiſt them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was of opinion, that they ſhould ſend ſome one of his company, to ſcout along and diſcover the countrey, to learn in what condition and poſture the enemy was, that they might take counſel, and proceed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the preſent occaſion. <hi>Gymnaſt</hi> offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to go; whereupon it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that for his ſafety, and the better expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he ſhould have with him ſome one that knew the wayes, avenues, turnings, windings and rivers thereabout. Then away went he and <hi>Prelingot,</hi> (the Querry or Gentleman of <hi>Vauguyons</hi> horſe,) who ſcout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and eſpied as narrowly as they could up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all quarters without any feare. In the mean time <hi>Gargantua</hi> took a little refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ate ſomewhat himſelf, the like did thoſe who were with him, and cauſed to give to his mare a <hi>Picotine</hi> of Oats, that is, three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and fourteen quarters and three buſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els. <hi>Gymnaſt</hi> and his Camerade rode ſo long, that at laſt they met with the enemies forces, all ſcattered and out of order, plundering, ſtealing, robbing and pillaging all they could
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:114744:83"/>
lay their hands on: and as far off as they could perceive him, they ran thronging upon the back of one another in all haſte towards him, to unload him of his money, and untruſſe his Portmantles. Then cried he out unto them, (My Maſters,) I am a poor devil, I deſire you to ſpare me, I have yet one Crown left, come, we muſt drink it; for it is <hi>aurum po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabile,</hi> and this horſe here ſhall be ſold to pay my welcome: afterwards take me for one of your own; for never yet was there any man that knew better how to take, lard, roſt and dreſſe, yea by G—to teare aſunder and devoure a hen, then I that am here: and for my <hi>Proficiat</hi> I drink to all good fellowes. With that he unſcrued his <hi>Borracho,</hi> (which was a great <hi>dutch</hi> leathern bottle,) and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out putting in his noſe drank very honeſtly: the <hi>marouſle</hi> Rogues looked upon him, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their throats a foot wide, and putting out their tongues like Greyhounds, in hopes to drink after him: but Captain <hi>Tripet,</hi> in the very nick of that their expectation, came running to him to ſee who it was.

terrified, departed from the place: all this did <hi>Gymnaſt</hi> very well remark and conſider, and therefore making as if he would have alighted from off his horſe, as he was poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf on the mounting ſide, he moſt nimbly (with his ſhort ſword by his thigh,) ſhifting his feet in the ſtirrup, performed the ſtirrup-leather feat, whereby after the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his body downwards, he forthwith lanch't himſelf aloft in the aire, and placed both his feet together on the ſaddle, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upright with his back turned towards the horſes head; Now (ſaid he) my caſe goes backward. Then ſuddenly in the ſame ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poſture wherein he was, he fetched a gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole upon one foot, and turning to the left hand, failed not to carry his body perfectly round, juſt into its former ſtance, without miſſing one jot. Ha (ſaid <hi>Tripet,)</hi> I will not do that at this time, and not without cauſe. Well, (ſaid <hi>Gymnaſt)</hi> I have failed, I will undo this leap: then with a marvellous ſtrength and agility, turning towards the right hand he fetch't another frisking gambole, as before, which done, he ſet his right hand thumb upon the hinde bowe of the ſaddle, raiſed himſelf up, and ſprung in the aire, poyſing and upholding his whole body, upon the muſcle and nerve of the ſaid thumb: and ſo turned and whirled himſelf about three times: at the fourth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:114744:85"/>
his body, and overturning it upſide down, and foreſide back, without touching any thing he brought himſelf betwixt the horſes two eares, ſpringing with all his body into the aire, upon the thumb of his left hand, and in that poſture turning like a windmill, did moſt actively do that trick which is called the Millers Paſſe. After this, clapping his right hand flat upon the middle of the ſaddle, he gave himſelf ſuch a jerking ſwing, that he thereby ſeated himſelf upon the crupper, after the manner of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>womens ſitting on horſeback: this done, he eaſily paſt his right leg over the ſaddle, and placed himſelf like one that rides in croup: But, ſaid he, it were better for me to get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſaddle; then putting the thumbs of both hands upon the crupper before him, and thereupon leaning himſelf, as upon the only ſupporters of his body, he incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turned heels over head in the aire, and ſtreight found himſelf betwixt the bowe of the ſaddle in a good ſettlement. Then with a <hi>ſummer-ſault</hi> ſpringing into the aire again, he fell to ſtand with both his feet cloſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the ſaddle, and there made above a hundred frisks, turnes and demi-pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mads, with his armes held out acroſſe, and in ſo doing, cried out aloud, I rage, I rage, devils, I am ſtark mad; devils, I am mad, hold me, devils, hold me, hold, devils, hold, hold.</p>

Whileſt he was thus vaulting, the Rogues in great aſtoniſhment ſaid to one another, By cocks death he is a goblin or a devil thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed, <hi>Ab hoſte maligno libera nos, Domine,</hi> and ran away in a ful flight, as if they had been routed, looking now and then behinde them like a dog that carrieth away a gooſe-wing in his mouth. Then <hi>Gymnaſt</hi> ſpying his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, alighted from his horſe, drew his ſword, &amp; laid on great blows upon the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and higheſt-creſted amongſt them, and overthrew them in great heaps, hurt, wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and bruiſed, being reſiſted by no body, they thinking he had been a ſtarved devil, as well in regard of his wonderful feats in vaulting, which they had ſeen, as for the talk <hi>Tripet</hi> had with him, calling him poor devil: only <hi>Tripet</hi> would have traiterouſly cleft his head with his horſemans ſword, or lanſe-knight fauchion; but he was well armed, and felt nothing of the blow, but the weight of the ſtroke; whereupon turning ſuddenly about, he gave <hi>Tripet</hi> a home-thruſt, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the back of that, whileſt he was about to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward his head from a flaſh, he in ran him at the breaſt with a hit, which at once cut his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, the fifth gut called the <hi>Colon;</hi> and the half of his liver, wherewith he fell to the ground, and in falling guſhed forth above foure pottles of pottage, and his ſoule ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the pottage.</p>

Then <hi>Gargantua</hi> mounted his great Mare, accompanied as we have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and finding in his way a high and great tree, (which commonly was called by the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:114744:86"/>
name of St. <hi>Martins</hi> tree, becauſe heretofore St. <hi>Martin</hi> planted a Pilgrims ſtaffe there, which in tract of time grew to that height and greatneſſe,) ſaid, This is that which I lacked; this tree ſhall ſerve me both for a ſtaffe and lance: with that he pulled it up eaſily, pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off the boughs, and trimmed it at his pleaſure: in the mean time his Mare piſſed to eaſe her belly, but it was in ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, that it did overflow the countrey ſeven leagues, and all the piſſe of that Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal flood, ran glib away towards the Ford of <hi>Vede,</hi> wherewith the water was ſo ſwollen, that all the Forces the enemy had there, were with great horrour drowned, except ſome who had taken the way on the left hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the hills. <hi>Gargantua</hi> being come to the place of the wood of <hi>Vede,</hi> was informed by <hi>Eudemon,</hi> that there was ſome remainder of the enemy within the Caſtle, which to know, <hi>Gargantua</hi> cried out as loud as he was able, Are you there, or are you not there? if you be there, be there no more; and if you be not there, I have no more to ſay. But a ruffian gunner, whoſe charge was to attend the Portcullis over the gate, let flie a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-ball at him, and hit him with that ſhot moſt furiouſly on the right temple of his head, yet did him no more hurt, then if he had but caſt a prune or kernel of a wine-grape at him: What is this?

do you throw at us grape-kernels here? the Vintage ſhall coſt you dear, thinking indeed that the bullet had been the kernel of a grape, or raiſin-kernel.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who were within the Caſtle, being till then buſie at the pillage, when they heard this noiſe, ran to the towers and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, from whence they ſhot at him above nine thouſand and five and twenty falcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot and harcabuſades, aiming all at his head, and ſo thick did they ſhoot at him, that he cried out, <hi>Ponocrates</hi> my friend, theſe flies here are like to put out mine eyes, give me a branch of thoſe willow-trees to drive them away, thinking that the bullets and ſtones ſhot out of the great ordnance had been but dunflies. <hi>Ponocrates</hi> looked and ſaw that there were no other flies, but great ſhot which they had ſhot from the Caſtle. Then was it that he, ruſht with his great tree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Caſtle, and with mighty blowes overthrew both towers and fortreſſes, and laid all level with the ground, by which meanes all that were within were ſlaine and broken in pieces. Going from thence, they came to the bridge at the Mill, where they found all the Ford covered with dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ſo thick, that they had choaked up the Mill, and ſtopped the current of its water, and theſe were thoſe that were deſtroyed in the Urinal deluge of the Mare. There they

were at a ſtand, conſulting how they might paſſe without hinderance by theſe dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſes.

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:114744:90"/>
cabbages and lettices. <hi>Gargantua</hi> finding himſelf ſomewhat dry, asked whether they could get any lettice to make him a ſallet; and hearing that there were the greateſt and faireſt in the countrey (for they were as great as plum-trees, or as walnut-trees) he would go thither himſelf, and brought thence in his hand what he thought good, and withal carried away the ſix Pilgrims, who were in ſo great feare, that they did not dare to ſpeak nor cough.</p>
                     <p>Waſhing them therefore firſt at the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the Pilgrims ſaid one to another ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, What ſhall we do? we are almoſt drowned here amongſt theſe lettice, ſhall we ſpeak? but if we ſpeak, he will kill us for ſpies: and as they were thus deliberating what to do, <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantua</hi> put them with the lettice into a plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the houſe, as large as the huge tun of the <hi>white Friars</hi> of the <hi>Ciſtertian</hi> order, which done, with oile, vineger and ſalt he ate them up, to refreſh himſelf a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſupper: and had already ſwallowed up five of the Pilgrims, the ſixth being in the platter, totally hid under a lettice, except his <hi>bourdon</hi> or <hi>ſtaffe</hi> that appeared, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe.

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:114744:90"/>
and therewith taking up the Pilgrim, he ate him very well, then drank a terrible draught of excellent white wine. The Pilgrims thus devoured, made ſhift to ſave themſelvs as wel as they could, by withdrawing their bodies out of the reach of the grinders of his teeth, but could not eſcape from thinking they had been put in the loweſt dungeon of a priſon. And when <hi>Gargantua</hi> whiffed the great draught, they thought to have been drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his mouth, and the flood of wine had almoſt carried them away into the gulf of his ſtomack. Nevertheleſſe skipping with their bourdons, as St. <hi>Michaels</hi> Palmers uſe to do, they ſheltered themſelves from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of that inundation, under the banks of his teeth. But one of them by chance, gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping or ſounding the countrey with his ſtaffe, to try whether they were in ſafety or no, ſtruck hard againſt the cleft of a hollow tooth, and hit the mandibulary ſinew, or nerve of the jaw, which put <hi>Gargantua</hi> to very great pain, ſo that he began to cry for the rage that he felt; to eaſe himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of his ſmarting ache, he called for his tooth-picker, and rubbing towards a young walnut-tree, where they lay skulking, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtled you my Gentlemen Pilgrims.</p>

My friend (ſaid the Monk) let me alone with it; for by G—I'le drink the better that it is on: it makes all my body jocund; if I ſhould lay it aſide, the waggiſh Pages would cut to themſelves garters out of it, as I was once ſerved at <hi>Coulaines:</hi> and which is worſe, I ſhould loſe my appetite: but if in this habit I ſit down at table, I will drink by G—both to thee and to thy horſe, and ſo courage, frolick, God ſave the company: I have already ſup't, yet will I eat never a whit the leſſe for that; for I have a paved ſtomack, as hollow as a But of malvoiſie, or St. <hi>Benedictus</hi> boot, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes open like a Lawyers pouch. Of all fiſhes, but the tench, take the wing of a Partridge, or the thigh of a Nunne; Doth not he die like a good fellow that dies with a ſtiffe <hi>Catſo?</hi> Our <hi>Prior</hi> loves exceedingly the white of a capon: In that (ſaid <hi>Gymnaſt)</hi> he doth not reſemble the foxes; for of the capons, hens and pullets which they carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, they never eat the white: Why? (ſaid the Monk) Becauſe (ſaid <hi>Gymnaſt)</hi> they have no Cooks to dreſſe them; and if they be not competently made ready, they remaine
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:114744:93"/>
red and not white, the redneſſe of meats be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a token that they have not got enough of the fire, whether by boyling, roſting or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, except the ſhrimps, lobſters, crabs and crayfiſhes, which are <hi>cardinaliſed</hi> with boyling: by Gods feaſt-gazers (ſaid the Monk) the Porter of our Abbey then hath not his head well-boyled, for his eyes are as red as a mazer made of an elder-tree. The thigh of this lerevet, is good for thoſe that have the gout. To the purpoſe of the truel, what is the reaſon that the thighs of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman are alwayes freſh and coole: This Probleme (ſaid <hi>Gargantua)</hi> is neither in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle,</hi> in <hi>Alexander Aphrodiſeus,</hi> nor in <hi>Plutarch.</hi> There are three cauſes (ſaid the Monk) by which that place is naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed. <hi>Primò,</hi> becauſe the water runs all along by it. <hi>Secundò,</hi> becauſe it is a ſhadie place, obſcure and dark, upon which the Sun never ſhines. And thirdly, becauſe it is continually flabbell'd, blown upon and aired by the northwindes of the <hi>hole arſtick,</hi> the fan of the <hi>ſmock,</hi> and <hi>flipflap</hi> of the Codpiece. And luſtie my lads, ſome bouſing liquour, Page; ſo: <hi>Crack, crack, crack.</hi> O how good is God that gives us of this excellent juice! I call him to witneſſe, if I had been in the time of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> I would have kept him from being taken by the <hi>Jewes</hi> in the garden of <hi>Olivet:</hi> and the devil faile me, if I ſhould

How is it then that they exclude the <hi>Monks</hi> from all good companies? calling them feaſt-troublers, marrers of mirth, and diſturbers of all civil converſation, as the bees drive away the drones from their hives; <hi>Ignavum fucos pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> (ſaid <hi>Maro) à praeſepibus arcent.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto anſwered <hi>Gargantua,</hi> There is nothing ſo true, as that the frock and cowle draw unto it ſelf the opprobries, injuries and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledictions of the world, juſt as the winde cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Cecias</hi> attracts the clouds: the perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory reaſon is, becauſe they eat the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure and excrements of the world, that is
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:114744:95"/>
to ſay, the ſins of the people, and like dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewers and excrementitious eaters, they are caſt into the privies and ſeceſſive places; that is, the Covents and Abbeys ſeparated from Political converſation, as the jakes and retreats of a houſe are: but if you conceive how an Ape in a family is alwayes mocked, and provokingly incenſed, you ſhall eaſily apprehend how Monks are ſhunned of all men, both young and old. The Ape keeps not the houſe as a dog doth: He drawes not in the plow as the oxe: He yields neither milk nor wooll as the ſheep: He carrieth no burthen as a horſe doth; that which he doth, is only to conskite, ſpoil and defile all, which is the cauſe wherefore he hath of all men mocks, frumperies and baſtonadoes.</p>
                     <p>After the ſame manner a Monk (I mean thoſe lither, idle, lazie Monks) doth not labour and work, as do the Peaſant and Artificer: doth not ward and defend the countrey, as doth the man of warre: cureth not the ſick and diſeaſed, as the Phyſician doth: doth neither preach nor teach, as do the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Doctors and Schoolmaſters: doth not import commodities and things neceſſary for the Common-wealth, as the Merchant doth: therefore is it, that by and of all men they are hooted at, hated and abhorred. Yea, but (ſaid <hi>Grangouſier,)</hi> they pray to God for us. Nothing leſſe, (anſwered <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentua.)</hi>
                        <pb n="181" facs="tcp:114744:95"/>
True it is, that with a tingle tangle jangling of bells they trouble and diſquiet all their neighbours about them: Right, (ſaid the Monk,) a maſſe, a matine, a veſpre well rung are half ſaid. They mumble out great ſtore of Legends and Pſalmes, by them not at all underſtood: they ſay many <hi>pate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notres,</hi> interlarded with <hi>ave-maries,</hi> without thinking upon, or apprehending the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what it is they ſay, which truly I call mocking of God, and not prayers. But ſo help them God, as they pray for us, and not for being afraid to loſe their victuals, their manchots, and good fat pottage. All true <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> of all eſtates and conditions, in all places and at all times ſend up their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God, and the Mediatour prayeth and intercedeth for them, and God is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to them. Now ſuch a one is our good <hi>Friar Ihon,</hi> therefore every man deſireth to have him in his company, he is no <hi>bigot</hi> or hypocrite, he is not torne and divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt reality and appearance, no wretch of a rugged and peeviſh diſpoſition, but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, jovial, reſolute and a good fellow: he travels, he labours, he defends the oppreſſed, comforts the afflicted, helps the needie, and keeps the cloſe of the Abbey: Nay (ſaid the Monk) I do a great deal more then that; for whileſt we are in diſpatching our matines and anniverſaries in the quire; I make with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

Ha, ha, (ſaid the Monk,) am not I in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of drowning, ſeeing I am in water even to the noſe? No, no, <hi>quare? quia,</hi> though ſome water come out from thence, there never goes in any; for it is well antidoted with pot-proof-armour, and ſirrup of the Vine-leaf.</p>

                     <p>SUpper being ended, they conſulted of the buſineſſe in hand, and concluded that about midnight they ſhould fall unawares upon the enemie, to know what manner of watch and ward they kept, and that in the mean while they ſhould take a little reſt, the better to refreſh themſelves. But <hi>Gargantua</hi> could not ſleep by any meanes, on which ſide ſoever he turned himfelf. Whereupon the Monk ſaid to him, I never ſleep ſoundly, but when I am at Sermon or Prayers; Let

If I had ſtrength anſwerable to my courage, <hi>by Sdeath</hi> I would plume them for you like ducks.

This <hi>Picrochole</hi> did not fully beleeve, though he doubted not much of it: Therefore ſent he under the command and conduct of the Count <hi>Draw-forth,</hi> for diſcovering of the countrey, the number of ſixteen hundred horſemen, all well-mounted upon light hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for skirmiſh, and throughly beſprinkled with holy water; and every one for their field-mark or cognizance had the ſigne of a ſtarre in his ſcarf, to ſerve at all adventures, in caſe they ſhould happen to incounter with devils; that by the vertue, as well of that <hi>Gregorian</hi> water, as of the ſtarres which they wore, they might make them diſappear and evaniſh.</p>
                     <p>In this equipage, they made an excurſion upon the countrey, till they came near to the <hi>Vauguyon, (which is the valley of</hi> Guyon) and to the ſpittle, but could never finde any body to ſpeak unto; whereupon they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned a little back, and took occaſion to paſſe above the aforeſaid hoſpital, to try what intelligence they could come by in thoſe parts, in which reſolution riding on, and by chance in a paſtoral lodge, or ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds

cottage near to <hi>Coudray,</hi> hitting upon the five Pilgrims, they carried them way-bound and manacled, as if they had been ſpies, for all the exclamations, adjurations and requeſts that they could make. Being come down from thence towards <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> they were heard by <hi>Gargantua,</hi> who ſaid then unto thoſe that were with him, Camerades and fellow ſouldiers, we have here met with an encounter, and they are ten times in number more then we: ſhall we charge them or no? What a devil (ſaid the <hi>Monk)</hi> ſhall we do elſe? Do you eſteem men by their number, rather then by their valour and prowes? With this he cried out, Charge, <hi>devils,</hi> charge; which when the enemies heard, they thought certainly that they had been very devils, and therefore even then began all of them to run away as hard as they could drive, <hi>Draw-forth</hi> only excepted, who immediately ſetled his lance on its reſt, and therewith hit the <hi>Monk</hi> with all his force on the very middle of his breaſt, but coming againſt his horrifick frock, the point of the iron, being with the blow either broke off or blunted, it was in matter of executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as if you had ſtruck againſt an Anvil with a little wax-candle.</p>
                     <p>Then did the <hi>Monk</hi> with his ſtaffe of the Croſſe, give him ſuch a ſturdie thump and whirret betwixt his neck and ſhoulders,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:114744:101"/>
upon the <hi>Acromion</hi> bone, that he made him loſe both ſenſe and motion, and fall down ſtone dead at his horſes feet; and ſeeing the ſigne of the ſtarre which he wore ſcarfwayes, he ſaid unto <hi>Gargantua,</hi> theſe men are but Prieſts, which is but the beginning of a Monk; by St. <hi>Ihon</hi> I am a perfect Monk, I will kill them to you like flies: Then ran he after them at a ſwift and full gallop, till he overtook the reere, and felled them down like tree-leaves, ſtriking athwart and alongſt and every way. <hi>Gymnaſt</hi> preſently asked <hi>Gargantua</hi> if they ſhould purſue them? To whom <hi>Gargantua</hi> anſwered, by no means; for, according to right military diſcipline, you muſt never drive your enemy unto deſpair, for that ſuch a ſtrait doth multiply his force, and increaſe his courage, which was before broken and caſt down; neither is there any better help, or outgate of relief for men that are amazed, out of heart, toiled and ſpent, then to hope for no favour at all. How many victories have been taken out of the hands of the Victors by the vanquiſhed, when they would not reſt ſatisfied with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but attempt to put all to the ſword, and totally to deſtroy their enemies, without leaving ſo much as one to carry home newes of the defeat of his fellowes? Open there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unto your enemies all the gates and wayes, and make to them a bridge of ſilver
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:114744:102"/>
rather then faile, that you may be rid of them. Yea, but (ſaid <hi>Gymnaſt)</hi> they have the <hi>Monk:</hi> Have they the <hi>Monk?</hi> (ſaid <hi>Gargantua)</hi> Upon mine honour then it will prove to their coſt: but to prevent all dangers, let us not yet retreat, but halt here quietly, as in an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh; for I think I do already underſtand the policie and judgement of our enemies, they are truly more directed by chance and meer fortune, then by good advice and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. In the mean while, whileſt theſe made a ſtop under the walnut-trees, the <hi>Monk</hi> purſued on the chaſe, charging all he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, and giving quarter to none, until he met with a trouper, who carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him one of the poor Pilgrims, and there would have rifled him. The Pilgrim, in hope of relief at the ſight of the <hi>Monk,</hi> cried out, Ha, my Lord <hi>Prior,</hi> my good friend, my Lord <hi>Prior,</hi> ſave me, I beſeech you, ſave me; which words being heard by thoſe that rode in the van, they inſtantly faced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and ſeeing there was no body but the <hi>Monk</hi> that made this great havock &amp; ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter among them, they loded him with blows as thick as they uſe to do an Aſſe with wood: but of all this he felt nothing, eſpecially when they ſtruck upon his frock, his skin was ſo hard. Then they committed him to two of the Marſhals men to keep, and looking about, ſaw no body coming againſt them,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:114744:102"/>
whereupon they thought that <hi>Gergantua</hi> and his Party were fled: then was it that they rode as hard as they could towards the wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut-trees to meet with them, and left the <hi>Monk</hi> there all alone, with his two foreſaid men to guard him. <hi>Gargantua</hi> heard the noiſe and neighing of the horſes, and ſaid to his men, <hi>Camerades,</hi> I hear the track and beating of the enemies horſe-feet, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all perceive that ſome of them come in a troupe and full body againſt us; let us rallie and cloſe here, then ſet forward in order, and by this means we ſhall be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their charge, to their loſſe and our honour.</p>

                     <p>And preſently the Monk gave his horſe the ſpurre, and kept the way that the enemy held, who had met with <hi>Gargantua</hi> and his companions in the broad high-way, and

were ſo diminiſhed of their number, for the enormous ſlaughter that <hi>Gargantua</hi> had made with his great tree amongſt them, as alſo <hi>Gymnaſt, Ponocrates, Eudemon,</hi> and the reſt, that they began to retreat diſorderly and in great haſte, as men altogether affrighted and troubled in both ſenſe and underſtanding; and as if they had ſeen the very proper <hi>ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> and forme of death before their eyes; or rather as when you ſee an Aſſe with a <hi>brizze</hi> or gad-bee under his taile, or flie that ſtings him, run hither and thither without keeping any path or way, throwing down his load to the ground, breaking his bridle and reines, and taking no breath nor reſt, and no man can tell what ailes him, for they ſee not any thing touch him: ſo fled theſe people deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of wit, without knowing any cauſe of flying, onely purſued by a <hi>panick</hi> terror, which in their mindes they had conceived.

and that which heretofore the <hi>Barbars</hi> and <hi>Saracens</hi> called proweſſe and valour, we do now call robbing, theevery and wickednes; It would have been more commendable in him to have contained himſelf within the bounds of his own territories, royally governing them, then to inſult and domineer in mine, pillaging and plundering every where like a moſt unmerciful enemy; for by ruling his own with diſcretion, he might have increaſ't his greatneſſe, but by robbing me he cannot eſcape deſtruction; Go your wayes in the name of God, proſecute good enterpriſes, ſhew your King what is amiſſe, and never counſel him with regard unto your own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular profit, for the publick loſſe will ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up the private benefit.

neither of us hath been wronged in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, nor is there any queſtion betwixt us in the main, but only how to redreſſe by the by ſome petty faults committed by our men; I mean, both yours and ours, which although you knew you ought to let paſſe; for theſe quarrelſome perſons deſerve rather to be contemned then mentioned, eſpecially ſeeing I offered them ſatisfaction according to the wrong. God ſhall be the juſt Judge of our variances, whom I beſeech by death rather to take me out of this life, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my goods to periſh and be deſtroyed before mine eyes, then that by me or mine he ſhould in any ſort be wronged. Theſe words uttered, he called the <hi>Monk,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them all ſpoke thus unto him: <hi>Friar Ihon,</hi> my good friend, is it you that took priſoner the Captain <hi>Touchfaucet</hi> here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent? Sir (ſaid the Monk) ſeeing himſelf is here, and that he is of the yeares of diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I had rather you ſhould know it by his confeſſion then by any words of mine. Then ſaid <hi>Touchfaucet,</hi> My ſovereign Lord, it is he indeed that took me, and I do therefore moſt freely yield my ſelf his priſoner. Have you put him to any ranſom, ſaid <hi>Grangouſier</hi> to the <hi>Monk?</hi> No, (ſaid the <hi>Monk,)</hi> of that I take no care: How much would you have for having taken him? nothing, nothing, (ſaid the <hi>Monk,)</hi> I am not ſwayed by that,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:114744:108"/>
nor do I regard it; Then <hi>Grangouſier</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that in preſence of <hi>Touchefaucet,</hi> ſhould be delivered to the Monk for taking him, the ſumme of threeſcore and two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſaluts <hi>(in</hi> Engliſh <hi>money fifteen thouſand and five hundred pounds)</hi> which was done, whileſt they made a collation or little ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet to the ſaid <hi>Touchfaucet,</hi> of whom <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gouſier</hi> asked, if he would ſtay with him, or if he loved rather to return to his King? <hi>Touchfaucet</hi> anſwered, that he was content to take whatever courſe he would adviſe him to; Then (ſaid <hi>Grangouſier)</hi> return unto your King, and God be with you.</p>
                     <p>Then he gave him an excellent ſword of <hi>Avienue</hi> blade, with a golden ſcabbard wrought with Vine-branch-like flouriſhes, of faire Goldſmiths work, and a coller or neck-chain of gold, weighing ſeven hundred and two thouſand marks <hi>(at eight ounces each,)</hi> garniſhed with precious ſtones of the fineſt ſort, eſteemed at a hundred and ſixty thouſand ducats, and ten thouſand crownes more, as an honourable donative, by way of preſent.</p>
                     <p>After this talk, <hi>Touchefaucet</hi> got to his horſe, and <hi>Gargantua</hi> for his ſafety allowed him the guard of thirty men at armes, and ſix ſcore archers to attend him under the conduct of <hi>Gymnaſt,</hi> to bring him even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the gate of the rock <hi>Clermond,</hi> if there
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:114744:109"/>
were need. Aſſoon as he was gone, the <hi>Monk</hi> reſtored unto <hi>Grangouſier</hi> the three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and two thouſand ſaluts, which he had received, ſaying, Sir it is not as yet the time for you to give ſuch gifts, ſtay till this warre be at an end, for none can tell what accidents may occurre, and war begun without good proviſion of money before-hand for going through with it, is but as a breathing of ſtrength, and blaſt that will quickly paſſe away; coine is the ſinews of warre.

                        <hi>GArgantua</hi> had the charge of the whole Army, and his father <hi>Grangouſier</hi> ſtayed in his Caſtle, who encouraging them with good words, promiſed great rewards unto thoſe that ſhould do any notable ſervice. Having thus ſet forward, aſſoon as they had gained the Paſſe at the Ford of <hi>Vede,</hi> with boats and bridges ſpeedily made, they paſt over in a trice, then conſidering the ſituation of the town, which was on a high and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous place, <hi>Gargantua</hi> thought fit to call his counſel, and paſſe that night in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration upon what was to be done: But <hi>Gymnaſt</hi> ſaid unto him, My ſovereign Lord,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:114744:112"/>
ſuch is the nature and complexion of the <hi>frenches,</hi> that they are worth nothing, but at the firſt puſh, then are they more fierce then devils; but if they linger a little, and be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with delays, they'l prove more faint and remiſſe then women: my opinion is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that now preſently after your men have taken breath, and ſome ſmall refecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you give order for a reſolute aſſault, and that we ſtorme them inſtantly. His ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was found very good, and for effectua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereof, he brought forth his army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the plain field, and placed the reſerves on the skirt or riſing of a little hill. The <hi>Monk</hi> took along with him ſix companies of foot, and two hundred horſemen well armed, and with great diligence croſſed the mariſh, and valiantly got up on the top of the green hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, even unto the high-way which leads to <hi>Loudin.</hi> Whileſt the aſſault was thus begun, <hi>Picrocholes</hi> men could not tell well what was beſt, to iſſue out and receive the Aſſailants, or keep within the town and not to ſtirre: Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the mean time, without deliberation, ſallied forth in a rage with the cavalry of his guard, who were forthwith received, and royally entertained with great cannon-ſhot, that fell upon them like haile from the high grounds, on which the Artillery was plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; whereupon the <hi>Gargantuiſts</hi> betook themſelves unto the valleys, to give the ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:114744:112"/>
leave to play, and range with the larger ſcope.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe of the town defended themſelves as well as they could, but their ſhot paſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, without doing us any hurt at all: Some of <hi>Picrocholes</hi> men that had eſcaped our Artillery, ſet moſt fiercely upon our ſouldiers, but prevailed little; for they were all let in betwixt the files, and there knock't down to the ground, which their fellow-ſouldiers ſeeing, they would have retreated, but the <hi>Monk</hi> having ſeiſed upon the Paſſe, by the which they were to return, they run away and fled in all the diſorder and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that could be imagined.</p>
                     <p>Some would have purſued after them, and followed the chaſe, but the <hi>Monk</hi> withheld them, apprehending that in their purſuit the Purſuers might loſe their ranks, and ſo give occaſion to the beſieged to ſallie out of the town upon them. Then ſtaying there ſome ſpace, and none coming againſt him, he ſent the Duke <hi>Phrontiſt,</hi> to adviſe <hi>Gargantua</hi> to advance towards the hill up on the left hand, to hinder <hi>Picrocholes</hi> retreat at that gate, which <hi>Gargantua</hi> did with all expedition, and ſent thither foure brigades under the conduct of <hi>Sebaſt,</hi> which had no ſooner reach't the top of the hill, but they met <hi>Picrochole</hi> in the teeth, and thoſe that were with him ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>

                        <pb n="216" facs="tcp:114744:113"/>
Then charged they upon them ſtoutly, yet were they much indamaged by thoſe that were upon the walles, who galled them with all manner of ſhot, both from the great ordnance, ſmall guns and bowes. Which <hi>Gargantua</hi> perceiving, he went with a ſtrong Partie to their relief, and with his Artillery began to thunder ſo terribly upon that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton of the wall, and ſo long, that all the ſtrength within the town, to maintain and fill up the breach, was drawn thither. The <hi>Monk</hi> ſeeing that quarter which he kept be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, void of men and competent guards, and in a manner altogether naked and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, did moſt magnanimouſly on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den lead up his men towards the Fort, and never left it till he had got up upon it, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſuch as come to the reſerve in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, bring with them alwayes more feare and terrour, then thoſe that deal about them with their hands in the fight.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſſe he gave no alarm till all his ſouldiers had got within the wall, except the two hundred horſemen, whom he left without to ſecure his entry. Then did he give a moſt horrible ſhout, ſo did all theſe who were with him, and immediately thereafter without reſiſtance, putting to the edge of the ſword the guard that was at that gate, they opened it to the horſemen, with whom moſt furiouſly they altogether ran towards the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:114744:113"/>
Eaſt-gate, where all the hurlie burlie was, and coming cloſe upon them in the reer, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw all their forces. The beſieged ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the <hi>Gargantuiſts</hi> had won the town upon them, and that they were like to be ſecure in no corner of it, ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto the mercy of the <hi>Monk,</hi> and asked for quarter, which the <hi>Monk</hi> very nobly granted to them, yet made them lay down their armes; then ſhutting them up within Churches, gave order to ſeiſe upon all the ſtaves of the Croſſes, and placed men at the doores to keep them from coming forth; then opening that Eaſt-gate, he iſſued out to ſuccour and aſſiſt <hi>Gargantua:</hi> but <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crochole,</hi> thinking it had been ſome relief co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to him from the towne, adventured more forwardly then before, and was upon the giving of a moſt deſperate home-charge, when <hi>Gargantua</hi> cried out, Ha, Friar <hi>Ihon,</hi> my friend, Friar <hi>Ihon,</hi> you are come in a good houre; which unexpected accident ſo affrighted <hi>Picrochole</hi> and his men, that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all for loſt, they betook themſelves to their heels, and fled on all hands. <hi>Gargantua</hi> chaſed them till they came near to <hi>Vaugau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry,</hi> killing and ſlaying all the way, and then ſounded the retreat.</p>

Thus went along this poor cholerick wretch, who paſſing the water at <hi>Porthuaux,</hi> and relating his miſadventurous diſaſters, was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by an old <hi>Lourpidon</hi> hag, that his Kingdome ſhould be reſtored to him at the coming of the <hi>Cocklicranes,</hi> which ſhe called <hi>Coquecigrues.</hi> What is become of him ſince we cannot certainly tell, yet was I told that
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:114744:114"/>
he is now a porter at <hi>Lyons,</hi> as teſtie and pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh in humour as ever he was before, and would be alwayes with great lamentation enquiring at all ſtrangers of the coming of the <hi>Cocklicranes,</hi> expecting aſſuredly, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the old womans prophecie, that at their coming he ſhall be re-eſtabliſhed in his Kingdom. The firſt thing <hi>Gargantua</hi> did after his return into the town, was to call the Muſter-roll of his men, which when he had done, he found that there were very few either killed or wounded, only ſome few foot of Captain <hi>Tolmeres</hi> company, and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocrates</hi> who was ſhot with a musket-ball through the doublet. Then he cauſed them all at and in their ſeveral poſts and diviſions to take a little refreſhment, which was very plenteouſly provided for them in the beſt drink and victuals that could be had for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and gave order to the Treaſurers and Commiſſaries of the Army, to pay for and defray that repaſt, and that there ſhould be no outrage at all, nor abuſe committed in the town, ſeeing it was his own. And further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more commanded, that immediately after the ſouldiers had done with eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for that time ſufficiently, and to their own hearts deſire, a gathering ſhould be beaten for bringing them altogether, to be drawn up on the <hi>Piazza</hi> before the Caſtle, there to receive ſix moneths pay compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

                     <p>Our forefathers and Anceſtors of all times, have been of this nature and diſpoſition, that upon the winning of a battel, they have choſen rather for a ſigne and memorial of their triumphs and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to erect trophies and monuments in the hearts of the vanquiſhed by clemencie, then by architecture in the lands which they had conquered; for they did hold in greater eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, the lively remembrance of men purchaſed by liberality, then the dumb in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of arches, pillars and pyramides, ſubject to the injury of ſtormes and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, and to the envie of every one.

us, and therefore wiſhed them to take ſuch courſe by way of compenſation therin, as that the whole world might be edified by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, as well of their honeſt graciouſneſſe to us, as of our gracious honeſty towards them. The reſult hereof was, that it was voted and decreed by an unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that they ſhould offer up entirely their Lands, Dominions and Kingdomes, to be diſpoſed of by us according to our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alpharbal</hi> in his own perſon, preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with nine thouſand and thirty eight great ſhips of burden, bringing with him the treaſures, not only of his houſe and royal linage, but almoſt of all the countrey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides; for he imbarking himſelf, to ſet ſaile with a <hi>Weſt-North-Eaſt</hi> winde, every one in heaps did caſt into the ſhip gold, ſilver, rings, jewels, ſpices, drugs, and aromatical parfumes, parrets, pelicans, monkies, civet-cats, black-ſpotted weeſils, porcupines, &amp;c. He was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted no good Mothers ſon, that did not caſt in all the rare and precious things he had.</p>
                     <p>Being ſafely arrived, he came to my ſaid father, and would have kiſt his feet: that action was found too ſubmiſſively low, and therefore was not permitted, but in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change he was moſt cordially embraced: he offfered his preſents, they were not received,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:114744:116"/>
becauſe they were too exceſſive: he yielded himſelf voluntarily a ſervant and vaſſal, and was content his whole poſterity ſhould be liable to the ſame bondage; this was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepred of, becauſe it ſeemed not equitable: he ſurrendered by vertue of the decree of his great Parliamentarie councel, his whole Countreys and Kingdomes to him, offering the Deed and Conveyance, ſigned, ſealed and ratified by all thoſe that were concerned in it; this was altogether refuſed, and the parchments caſt into the fire. In end, this free good will, and ſimple meaning of the <hi>Canarriens,</hi> wrought ſuch tenderneſſe in my fathers heart, that he could not abſtain from ſhedding teares, and wept moſt profuſely: then by choiſe words very congruouſly adapted, ſtrove in what he could to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the eſtimation of the good offices which he had done them, ſaying, that any cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie he had conferred upon them, was not worth a ruſh, and what favour ſoever he had ſhewed them, he was bound to do it. But ſo much the more did <hi>Alpharbal</hi> augment the repute thereof. What was the iſſue? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as for his ranſom in the greateſt extremity of rigour, and moſt tyrannical dealing, could not have been exacted above twenty times a hundred thouſand crownes, and his eldeſt ſons detained as hoſtages, till that ſumme had been payed, they made themſelves per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:114744:117"/>
tributaries, and obliged to give us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very year twomillions of gold at foure and twenty carats fine: The firſt year we received the whole ſum of two millions: the ſecond yeare of their own accord they payed freely to us three and twenty hundred thouſand crowns: the third year ſix and twenty hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand; the fourth year three milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and do ſo increaſe it alwayes out of their own good will, that we ſhall be conſtrained to forbid them to bring us any more. This is the nature of gratitude and true thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe. For time which gnawes and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth all things elſe, augments and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth benefits; becauſe a noble action of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality done to a man of reaſon, doth gnaw continually, by his generous thinking of it, and remembring it.</p>
                     <p>Being unwilling therefore any way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate from the hereditary mildneſſe and clemency of my Parents; I do now forgive you, deliver you from all fines and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonments, fully releaſe you, ſet you at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and every way make you as frank and free as ever you were before. Moreover, at your going out of the gate, you ſhall have every one of you three moneths pay to bring you home into your houſes and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and ſhall have a ſafe convoy of ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred cuiraſiers and eight thouſand foot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of <hi>Alexander,</hi> Eſquire of

And becauſe a Realm thus deſolate, may eaſily come to ruine; if the covetouſneſſe and avarice of thoſe, who by their places are obliged to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter juſtice in it, be not curbed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained: I ordain and will have it ſo, that <hi>Pono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> be overſeer &amp; ſuperintendent above all his governours, with whatever power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is requiſite thereto, &amp; that he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually with the childe, until he finde him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; capable to rule and govern by himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Now I muſt tell you, that you are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how a too feeble and diſſolute faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in pardoning evil-doers, giveth them oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to commit wickedneſſe afterwards more readily, upon this pernicious confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of receiving favour; I conſider, that <hi>Moſes,</hi> the meekeſt man that was in his time

crowns of the Sunne, and as many of the ſeven ſtarres, to be charged all upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the cuſtom.

The Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture was in a figure hexagonal, and in ſuch a faſhion, that in every one of the ſix corners there was built a great round tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of threeſcore foot in diameter, and were all of alike forme and bigneſſe. Upon the north-ſide ran along the river of <hi>Loire,</hi> on the bank whereof was ſituated the tower called <hi>Arctick:</hi> going towards the Eaſt, there was another called <hi>Calaer,</hi> the next following <hi>Anatole;</hi> the next <hi>Meſembrine:</hi> the next <hi>Heſperia,</hi> and the laſt <hi>Criere.</hi> Every tower was diſtant from other the ſpace of three hundred and twelve paces. The whole Aedifice was every where ſix ſtories high, reckoning the Cellars under ground for one: the ſecond was arched after the faſhion of a basket-handle; the reſt were ſeeled with pure wainſcot, flouriſhed with <hi>Flanders</hi> fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, in the forme of the foot of a lamp: and covered above with fine ſlates, with

                     <p>This ſame building was a hundred times more ſumptuous and magnificent then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was <hi>Bonnivet, Chambourg</hi> or <hi>Chantillie;</hi> for there were in it nine thouſand, three hundred and two and thirty chambers, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one whereof had a withdrawing room, a handſom cloſet, a wardrobe, an oratory, and neat paſſage, leading into a great and ſpacious hall.

                     <p>IN the middle of the lower Court there was a ſtately fountain of faire Alabaſter; upon the top thereof ſtood the three Graces, with their <hi>cornucopias,</hi> or hornes of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and did jert out the water at their breaſts, mouth, eares, eyes, and other open paſſages of the body; the inſide of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in this lower Court ſtood upon great pillars of <hi>Caſſydonie</hi> ſtone, and <hi>Porphyrie</hi> marble, made arch-wayes after a goodly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick faſhion. Within thoſe were ſpacious galleries, long and large, adorned with cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious pictures, the hornes of Bucks and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corns:

with <hi>Rhinoceroſes,</hi> water-horſes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Hippopotames,</hi> the teeth and tusks of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, and other things well worth the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding. The lodging of the Ladies <hi>(for ſo we may call thoſe gallant women)</hi> took up all from the tower <hi>Arctick</hi> unto the gate <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembrine:</hi> the men poſſeſſed the reſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſaid lodging of the Ladies, that they might have their recreation betweeen the two firſt towers. On the out-ſide were placed the tilt-yard, the barriers or liſts for turnements, the <hi>hippodrome</hi> or riding Court, the <hi>theater</hi> or publike play-houſe, and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatorie</hi> or place to ſwim in, with moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable bathes in three ſtages, ſituated above one another, well furniſhed with all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary accommodation, and ſtore of myrtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water. By the river-ſide was the faire garden of pleaſure: and in the midſt of that the glorious labyrinth. Between the two other towers were the Courts for the tennis and the baloon. Towards the tower <hi>Criere</hi> ſtood the Orchard full of all fruit-trees, ſet and ranged in a <hi>quincuncial</hi> order. At the end of that was the great Park, abounding with all ſort of Veniſon. Betwixt the third couple of towers were the buts and marks for ſhooting with a ſnap work-gun, an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary bowe for common archery, or with a Croſſe-bowe. The office-houſes were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the tower <hi>Heſperie,</hi> of one ſtory high.

The Venerie where the Beagles and Hounds were kept, was a little farther off drawing towards the Park.</p>
                     <p>All the halls, chambers, and cloſets or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binets, were richly hung-with tapeſtrie, and hangings of divers ſorts, according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of the ſeaſons of the year.

Next to their ſmock they put on the pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty kirtle or vaſquin of pure ſilk chamlet: above that went the taffatie or tabie vardin-gale, of white, red, tawnie, gray, or of any other colour; Above this taffatie petticoat they had another of cloth of tiſſue or broca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, embroidered with fine gold, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced with needle-work, or as they thought good, and according to the temperature and diſpoſition of the weather, had their upper coats of ſattin, damask or velvet, and thoſe either orange, tawnie, green, aſh-coloured, blew, yelow, bright, red, crimſon or white, and ſo forth; or had them of cloth of gold, cloth of ſilver, or ſome other choiſe ſtuffe, inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with purle, or embroidered according to the dignity of the feſtival dayes and times wherein they wore them.</p>

                     <p>By this liberty they entered into a very laudable emulation, to do all of them what they ſaw did pleaſe one; if any of the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants or Ladies ſhould ſay, <hi>Let us drink,</hi> they would all drink: if any one of them ſaid, <hi>Let us play,</hi> they all played; if one ſaid, <hi>Let us go a walking into the fields,</hi> they went all: if it were to go a hawking or a hunting, the Ladies mounted upon dainty well-paced nags, ſeated in a ſtately palfrey ſaddle, carried on their lovely fiſts miniard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begloved every one of them, either a Sparhawk, or a Laneret, or a Marlin, and the young gallants carried the other kinds of Hawkes: ſo nobly were they taught, that there was neither he nor ſhe amongſt them, but could read, write, ſing, play upon ſeveral muſical inſtruments, ſpeak five or ſixe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral languages, and compoſe in them all very quaintly, both in Verſe and Proſe: never

                     <hi>I have known great and mighty Lords, and of thoſe not a few, who going a Deer-hunting, or a hawking after wilde Ducks, when the chaſe had not encountred with the blinks, that were caſt in her way to retard her courſe, or that the Hawk did but</hi> plaine <hi>and ſmoothly fly without moving her wings, perceiving the prey by force of flight to have gained bounds of her, have been much chafed and vexed, as you underſtand well enough; but the comfort unto which they had refuge, and that they might not take cold, was to relate the ineſtimable deeds of the ſaid</hi> Gargantua. <hi>There are others in the world, (Theſe are no flimflam ſtories, nor tales of a tub) who being much troubled with the tooth-ache, after they had ſpent their goods upon Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, without receiving at all any eaſe of their pain, have found no more ready remedy, then to put the ſaid</hi> Chronicles <hi>betwixt two pieces of

All their conſolation was to have ſome page of the ſaid Roll-book read unto them: and we have ſeen thoſe who have given themſelves to a hundred punchions of old devils, in caſe that they did not feele a manifest eaſe and aſſwage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of paine, at he hearing of the ſaid book read, even when they were kept in a purgatory of torment; no more nor leſſe then women in travel uſe to ſinde their ſorrow abated, when the life of St.</hi> Margarite <hi>is read unto them: is this nothing? finde me a book in any language, in any faculty or ſcience whatſoever, that hath ſuch vertues, properties and prerogatives, and I will be content to pay you a quart of tripes.

called <hi>Montifers,</hi> (which is as much to ſay as <hi>Hill-carriers,)</hi> of whom you ſee ſome yet in the world of divers ſexes and degrees: of this race came <hi>Aeſop,</hi> ſome of whoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent words and deeds you have in writing: ſome other <hi>puffes</hi> did ſwell in length by the member, which they call the Labourer of nature, in ſuch ſort that it grew marvellous long, fat, great, luſtie, ſtirring and Creſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſen, in the Antick faſhion, ſo that they made uſe of it as of a girdle, winding it five or ſix times about their waſte: but if it happened the foreſaid member to be in good caſe, ſpooming with a full ſaile bunt faire before the winde, then to have ſeen thoſe ſtrouting Champions, you would have taken them for men that had their lances ſetled on their Reſt, to run at the ring or tilting <hi>whintam:</hi> of theſe beleeve me the race is utterly loſt and quite extinct, as the women ſay; for they do la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment continually, that there are none extant now of thoſe great, &amp;c. you know the reſt of the ſong.

Others grew in the legs, and to ſee them, you would have ſaid they had been Cranes, or the reddiſh-long-bill'd-ſtork-like-ſcrank-legged ſea-fowles,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114744:142"/>
called <hi>Flamans,</hi> or elſe men walking upon ſtilts or ſcatches: the little Grammar ſchool-boyes (known by the name of <hi>Grimos,)</hi> called thoſe leg-grown ſlangams <hi>Jambus,</hi> in alluſion to the <hi>French</hi> word <hi>Jambe,</hi> which ſignifieth a leg.

But that we may fully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the cauſe and reaſon of the name of <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> which at his Baptiſm was given him, you are to remark, that in that yeare there was ſo great drought over all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Affrick,</hi> that there paſt thirty and ſix moneths, three weeks, foure dayes, thirteen houres, and a little more without raine, but with a heat ſo vehement, that the whole earth was parched and withered by it: neither was it more ſcorched and dried up with heat in the dayes of <hi>Eliah,</hi> then it was at that time; for there was not a tree to be ſeen, that had either
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114744:145"/>
leafe or bloom upon it: the graſſe was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out verdure or greenneſſe, the rivers were drained, the fountaines dried up, the poore fiſhes abandoned and forſaken by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per element, wandring and crying upon the ground moſt horribly: the birds did fall down from the aire for want of moiſture and dew, wherewith to refreſh them: the wolves, foxes, harts, wild-boares, fallow-deer, hares, coneys, weeſils, brocks, badgers, and other ſuch beaſts were found dead in the fields with their mouthes open; in reſpect of men, there was the pity, you ſhould have ſeen them lay out their tongues like hares that have been run ſix houres: many did throw themſelves into the wells: others entred within a Cowes belly to be in the ſhade; thoſe <hi>Homer</hi> calls <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libants:</hi> all the Countrey was idle, and could do no vertue: it was a moſt lamentable caſe to have ſeen the labour of mortals in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves from the vehemencie of this horrifick drought; for they had work enough to do to ſave the holy water in the Churches from being waſted; but there was ſuch order taken by the counſel of my Lords the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, and of our holy Father, that none did dare to take above one lick: yet when any one came into the Church, you ſhould have ſeen above twenty poor thirſty fellows hang upon him that was the diſtributer of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that with a wide open throat, gaping

for ſome little drop, (like the rich glutton in <hi>Luke,)</hi> that might fall by, leſt any thing ſhould be loſt. O how happy was he in that yeare, who had a coole Cellar under ground, well pleniſhed with freſh wine!</p>
                     <p>The Philoſopher reports in moving the queſtion, wherefore it is that the ſea-water is ſalt? that at the time when <hi>Phoebus</hi> gave the government of his reſplendent chariot to his ſonne <hi>Phaeton,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Phaeton,</hi> unskilful in the Art, and not knowing how to keep the ecliptick line betwixt the two tropicks of the latitude of the Sunnes courſe, ſtrayed out of his way, and came ſo near the earth, that he dried up all the Countreys that were under it, burning a great part of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, which the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> call <hi>via lactea,</hi> and the <hi>Huffſnuffs,</hi> St. <hi>James</hi> his way, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the moſt coped, lofty, and high-creſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Poets affirme that to be the place where <hi>Juno's</hi> milk fell, when ſhe gave ſuck to <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The earth at that time was ſo exceſſively heated, that it fell into an enormous ſweat, yea ſuch a one as made it ſweat out the ſea, which is therefore ſalt, becauſe all ſweat is ſalt; and this you cannot but confeſſe to be true, if you will taſte of your own, or of thoſe that have the pox, when they are put into a ſweating, it is all one to me. Juſt ſuch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other caſe fell out this ſame yeare: for on a

certain <hi>Friday,</hi> when the whole people were bent upon their devotions, and had made goodly Proceſſions, with ſtore of Letanies, and faire preachings, and beſeechings of God Almighty, to look down with his eye of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon their miſerable and diſconſolate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, there was even then viſibly ſeen iſſue out of the ground great drops of water, ſuch as fall from a puff-bagg'd man in a top ſweat; and the poore Hoydons began to rejoyce, as if it had been a thing very profitable unto them; for ſome ſaid that there was not one drop of moiſture in the aire, whence they might have any rain, and that the earth did ſupply the default of that.

                     <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Of the Infancie of</hi> Pantagruel.</head>
                     <p>I Finde by the ancient Hiſtoriographers and Poets, that divers have been borne in this world, after very ſtrange manners, which would be too long to repeat; reade therefore the ſeventh chapter of <hi>Pliny,</hi> if you have ſo much leiſure: yet have you never heard of any ſo wonderful as that of <hi>Pantagruel;</hi> for it is a very difficult matter to beleeve, how in the little time he was in his mothers belly, he grew both in body and ſtrength. That which <hi>Hercules</hi> did, was nothing, when in his Cradle he ſlew two ſerpents; for thoſe ſerpents were but little and weak: but <hi>Pantagruel</hi> being yet in the Cradle, did farre more admirable things, and more to be amazed at. I paſſe by here the relation of how at every one of his meales he ſupped up the milk of foure thouſand and ſix hundred Cowes: and how to make him a skellet to boil his milk in, there were ſet a work all the Braſiers of <hi>Somure</hi> in <hi>Anjou,</hi> of <hi>Villedieu</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> in <hi>Lorraine:</hi> and they ſerved in this whitepot-meat to him in a huge great Bell, which is yet to be ſeen in the City of <hi>Bourge</hi>
                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:114744:150"/>
in <hi>Berrie,</hi> near the Palace; but his teeth were already ſo well grown, and ſo ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened in vigour, that of the ſaid Bell he bit off a great morſel, as very plainly doth appeare till this houre.</p>
                     <p>One day in the morning, when they would have made him ſuck one of his Cows, (for he never had any other Nurſe, as the Hiſtory tells us) he got one of his armes looſe from the ſwadling bands, wherewith he was kept faſt in the Cradle, laid hold on the ſaid Cow under the left fore hamme, and graſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to him, ate up her udder and half of her paunch, with the liver and the kidneys, and had devoured all up, if ſhe had not cried out moſt horribly, as if the wolves had held her by the legs, at which noiſe company came in, and took away the ſaid Cow from <hi>Pantagruel;</hi> yet could they not ſo well do it, but that the quarter whereby he caught her was left in his hand, of which quarter he gulp't up the fleſh in a trice, even with as much eaſe as you would eate a ſalcige; and that ſo greedily with deſire of more, that when they would have taken away the bone from him, he ſwallowed it down whole, as a Cormorant would do a little fiſh; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards began fumblingly to ſay, <hi>Good, good, good,</hi> for he could not yet ſpeak plaine; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them to underſtand thereby, that he had found it very good, and that he did lack
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:114744:150"/>
but ſo much more; which when they ſaw that attended him, they bound him with great cable-ropes, like thoſe that are made at <hi>Tain,</hi> for the carriage of ſalt to <hi>Lyons;</hi> or ſuch as thoſe are, whereby the great <hi>French</hi> ſhip rides at Anchor, in the Road of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haven</hi> in <hi>Normandie.</hi> But on a certain time, a great Beare which his father had bred, got looſe, came towards him, began to lick his face, for his Nurſes had not throughly wiped his chaps, at which unexpected approach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a ſudden offended, he as lightly rid himſelf of thoſe great cables, as <hi>Samſon</hi> did of the haulſer ropes wherewith the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines</hi> had tied him, and by your leave, takes me up my Lord the Beare, and teares him to you in pieces like a pullet, which ſerved him for a gorge-ful or good warme bit for that meale.</p>
                     <p>Whereupon <hi>Gargantua</hi> fearing leſt the childe ſhould hurt himſelf, cauſed foure great chaines of iron to be made to binde him, and ſo many ſtrong wooden arches unto his Cradle, moſt firmely ſtocked and mortaiſed in huge frames: of thoſe chaines you have one at <hi>Rochel.</hi> which they draw up at night betwixt the two great towers of the Haven: Another is at <hi>Lyons:</hi> A third at <hi>Angiers:</hi> And the fourth was carried away by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils to binde <hi>Lucifer,</hi> who broke his chaines in thoſe dayes, by reaſon of a cholick that did
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114744:151"/>
extraordinarily torment him, taken with eating a Serjeants ſoule fried for his break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, and therfore you may beleeve that which <hi>Nicolas de Lyra</hi> ſaith upon that place of the <hi>Pſalter,</hi> where it is written, <hi>Et Og regem Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan,</hi> that the ſaid <hi>Og</hi> being yet little, was ſo ſtrong and robuſtious, that they were faine to binde him with chaines of iron in his Cradle; thus continued <hi>Pantagruel</hi> for a while very calme and quiet, for he was not able ſo eaſily to break thoſe chaines, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially having no room in the Cradle to give a ſwing with his armes. But ſee what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, once upon a great Holiday, that his father <hi>Gargantua</hi> made a ſumptuous banquet to all the Princes of his Court: I am apt to beleeve, that the menial officers of the houſe were ſo imbuſied in waiting each on his proper ſervice at the feaſt, that no body took care of poor <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> who was left <hi>a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culorum,</hi> behinde-hand all alone, and as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken. What did he? Heark what he did, good people: he ſtrove and eſſayed to break the chaines of the Cradle with his armes but coold not, for they were too ſtrong for him: then did he keep with his feet ſuch a ſtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtirre, and ſo long, that at laſt he beat out the lower end of his Cradle, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding was made of a great poſt five foot in ſquare: and aſſoon as he had gotten out his feer, he ſlid down as well as he could,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114744:151"/>
till he had got his ſoales to the ground; and then with a mighty force he roſe up, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Cradle upon his back, bound to him like a Tortoiſe that crawles up againſt a wall; and to have ſeen him, you would have thought it had been a great <hi>Carrick</hi> of five hundred tunne upon one end. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he entred into the great Hall, where they were banquetting, and that very boldly, which did much affright the companie; yet becauſe his armes were tied in, he could not reach any thing to eate, but with great pain ſtooped now and then a little, to take with the whole flat of his tongue ſome lick, good bit or morſel.</p>
                     <p>Which when his father ſaw, he knew well enough that they had left him without giving him: any thing to eate, and therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that he ſhould be looſed from the ſaid chains, by the counſel of the Princes and Lords there preſent: beſides that, alſo the Phyſicians of <hi>Gargantua</hi> ſaid, that if they did thus keep him in the Cradle, he would be all his life-time ſubject to the ſtone. When he was unchained they made him to ſit down, where after he had fed very well, he took his Cradle, and broke it into more then five hundred thouſand pieces with one blow of his fiſt, that he ſtruck in the midſt of it, ſwearing that he would never come into it again.</p>

                     <p>THus grew <hi>Pantagruel</hi> from day to day, and to every ones eye waxed more and more in all his dimenſions, which made hrs father to rejoyce by a natural affection: therefore cauſed he to be made for him, whileſt he was yet little, a pretty Croſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowe, wherewith to ſhoot at ſmall birds, which now they call the great Croſſebowe at <hi>Chantelle.</hi> Then he ſent him to the ſchool to learn, and to ſpend his youth in vertue: in the proſecution of which deſigne he came firſt to <hi>Poictiers,</hi> where, as he ſtudied and profited very much, he ſaw that the Scholars were oftentimes at leiſure, and knew not how to beſtow their time, which moved him to take ſuch compaſſion on them, that one day he took from a long ledge of rocks (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led there <hi>Paſſelourdin,)</hi> a huge great ſtone, of about twelve fathom ſquare, and fourteen handfuls thick, and with great eaſe ſet it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on foure pillars in the midſt of a field, to no other end, but that the ſaid Scholars when they had nothing elſe to do, might paſſe their

time in getting up on that ſtone, and feaſt it with ſtore of gammons, paſties and flag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, and carve their names upon it with a knife, in token of which deed, till this houre the ſtone is called the lifted ſtone: and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance hereof there is none entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Regiſter and matricular Book of the ſaid Univerſity, or accounted capable of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any degree therein, till he have firſt drunk in the <hi>Caballine</hi> fountain of <hi>Crouſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> paſſed at <hi>Paſselourdin,</hi> and got up upon the <hi>lifted ſtone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Afterwards reading the delectable Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles of his Anceſtors, he found that <hi>Jafrey</hi> of <hi>Luſinian</hi> called <hi>Jafrey</hi> with the great tooth, Grandfather to the Couſin in law of the eldeſt Siſter of the Aunt of the Son in law of the Uncle of the good daughter of his Stepmother, was interred at <hi>Maillezais;</hi> therefore one day he took <hi>campos,</hi> (which is a little vacation from ſtudy to play a while,) that he might give him a viſit as unto an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man: and going from <hi>Poictiers</hi> with ſome of his companions, they paſſed by the <hi>Guge,</hi> viſiting the noble Abbot <hi>Ardillon:</hi> then by <hi>Luſinian,</hi> by <hi>Sanſay,</hi> by <hi>Celles,</hi> by <hi>Coalon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> by <hi>Fontenay</hi> the <hi>Conte,</hi> ſaluting the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Tiraqueau,</hi> and from thence arrived at <hi>Maillezais,</hi> where he went to ſee the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre of the ſaid <hi>Jafrey</hi> with the great tooth; which made him ſomewhat afraid,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:114744:153"/>
looking upon the picture, whoſe lively draughts did ſet him forth in the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a man in an extreme fury, drawing his great <hi>Malchus</hi> faulchion half way out of his ſcabbard: when the reaſon hereof was demanded, the Chanons of the ſaid place told him, that there was no other cauſe of it, but that <hi>Pictoribus atque Poetis, &amp;c.</hi> that is to ſay, that Painters and Poets have liberty to paint and deviſe what they liſt after their own fancie: but he was not ſatisfied with their anſwer, and ſaid, He is not thus painted without a cauſe; and I ſuſpect that at his death there was ſome wrong done him, whereof he requireth his Kinred to take revenge: I will enquire further into it, and then do what ſhall be reaſonable; then he returned not to <hi>Poictiers,</hi> but would take a view of the other Univerſities of <hi>France:</hi> therefore go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Rochel,</hi> he took ſhipping and arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> where he found no great exerciſe, only now and then he would ſee ſome Marriners and Lightermen a wreſtling on the key or ſtrand by the river-ſide: From thence he came to <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> where he learned to dance very well, and to <hi>play</hi> with the <hi>two-handed ſword,</hi> as the faſhion of the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the ſaid Univerſity is to beſtir them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in <hi>games,</hi> whereof they may have their <hi>hands full:</hi> but he ſtayed not long there, when he ſaw that they did cauſe bury their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents</hi>

                     <p>He went then to <hi>Monpellier,</hi> where he met with the good wives of <hi>Mirevaux,</hi> and good jovial company withal, and thought to have ſet himſelf to the ſtudy of Phyſick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he conſidered that that calling was too troubleſome and melancholick; and that Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians did ſmell of gliſters like old devils. Therefore he reſolved he would ſtudie the lawes; but ſeeing that there were but three ſcauld, and one bald-pated Legiſt in that place, he departed from thence, and in his way made the Bridge of <hi>Gard,</hi> and the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheater</hi> of <hi>Neems</hi> in leſſe then three houres, which nevertheleſſe ſeems to be a more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine then humane work. After that he came to <hi>Avignon,</hi> where he was not above three dayes before he fell in love; for the women there take great delight in playing at the cloſe buttock-game, becauſe it is Papal ground; which his Tutor and Pedagogue <hi>Epiſtemon</hi> perceiving, he drew him out of that place, and brought him to <hi>Valence</hi> in the <hi>Dauphinee,</hi> where he ſaw no great matter of recreation, only that the Lubbards of the Town did beat the Scholars, which ſo incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him with anger, that when upon a certain very faire Sunday, the people being at their
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:114744:154"/>
publick dancing in the ſtreets, and one of the Scholars offering to put himſelf into the ring to partake of that ſport, the foreſaid lubbardly fellowes would not permit him the admittance into their ſociety; He taking the Scholars part, ſo belaboured them with blowes, and laid ſuch load upon them, that he drove them all before him, even to the brink of the river <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> and would have there drowned them, but that they did ſquat to the ground, and there lay cloſe a full halfe league under the river. The hole is to be ſeen there yet.</p>
                     <p>After that he departed from thence, and in three ſtrides and one leap came to <hi>Angiers,</hi> where he found himſelf very well, and would have continued there ſome ſpace, but that the plague drove them away. So from thence he came to <hi>Bourges,</hi> where he ſtudied a good long time, and profited very much in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the Lawes: and would ſometimes ſay, that the books of the Civil Law, were like unto a wonderfully precious, royal and triumphant robe of cloth of gold, edged with dirt; for in the world are no goodlier books to be ſeen, more ornate, nor more elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent then the texts of the Pandects; but the bordering of them, that is to ſay, the gloſſe of <hi>Accurſius</hi> is ſo ſcurvie, vile, baſe and unſavourie, that it is nothing but filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and villany.</p>

Going from <hi>Bourges,</hi> he came to <hi>Orleans,</hi> where he found ſtore of ſwaggering Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars that made him great entertainment at his coming, and with whom he learned to play at tennis ſo well, that he was a Maſter at that game; for the Students of the ſaid place make a prime exerciſe of it; and ſometimes they carried him unto <hi>Cupids</hi> houſes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce (in that City termed <hi>Iſlands,</hi> becauſe of rheir being moſt ordinarily environed with other houſes, and not contiguous to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,) there to recreate his perſon at the ſport of <hi>Pouſſevant,</hi> which the wenches of <hi>London</hi> call the <hi>Ferkers in and in.</hi> As for breaking his head with over-much ſtudy, he had an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care not to do it in any caſe, for feare of ſpoiling his eyes; which he the rather obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, for that it was told him by one of his Teachers, (there called Regents,) that the paine of the eyes was the moſt hurtful thing of any to the ſight: for this cauſe when he one day was made a <hi>Licentiate,</hi> or Graduate in law, one of the Scholras of his acquaintance, who of learning had not much more then his burthen, though in ſtead of that he could dance very well, and play at tennis, made the blaſon and device of the <hi>Licentiates</hi> in the ſaid Univerſity, ſaying,</p>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:114744:157"/>
there above two hundred and fourteen years; for it was ſo great that they could not by any device get it ſo much as above the ground, although they uſed all the meanes that are found in <hi>Vitruvius de Architectura, Albertus de re aedificatoria, Euclid, Theon, Archimedes,</hi> and <hi>Hero de ingeniis:</hi> for all that was to no purpoſe, wherefore condeſcending heartily to the humble requeſt of the Citizens and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the ſaid Town, he determined to remove it to the tower that was erected for it: with that he came to the place where it was, and lifted it out of the ground with his little finger, as eaſily as you would have done a Hawks bell, or Bell-weathers tingle tangle: but before he would carry it to the foreſaid tower or ſteeple appointed for it, he would needs make ſome Muſick with it about the Town, and ring it alongſt all the ſtreets, as he carried it in his hand, wherewith all the people were very glad; but there happened one great inconveniency, for with carrying it ſo, and ringing it about the ſtreets, all the good <hi>Orleans</hi> wine turned inſtantly, waxed flat, and was ſpoiled, which no body there did perceive till the night following; for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man found himſelf ſo altered, and a dry with drinking theſe flat wines, that they did nothing but ſpit, and that as white as <hi>Maltha</hi> cotton, ſaying: We have of the <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> and our very throats are ſalted.

had not obeyed the Commandment of God their Creator, they ſhould die, and by death ſhould be brought to nought that ſo ſtately frame and <hi>Plaſmature,</hi> wherein the man at firſt had been created.</p>
                              <p>But by this meanes of ſeminal propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which continueth in the children what was loſt in the Parents, and in the grand-children that which periſhed in their fathers, and ſo ſucceſſively until the day of the laſt judgement, when <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſhall have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered up to God the Father his Kingdom in a peaceable condition, out of all danger and contamination of ſin; for then ſhall ceaſe all generations and corruptions, and the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments leave off their continual tranſmutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſeeing the ſo much deſired peace ſhall be attained unto and enjoyed, and that all things ſhall be brought to their end and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod; and therefore not without juſt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable cauſe, do I give thanks to God my Saviour and Preſerver, for that he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled me to ſee my bald old age reflouriſh in thy youth: for when at his good pleaſure, who rules and governes all things, my ſoul ſhall leave this mortal habitation; I ſhall not account my ſelf wholly to die, but to paſſe from one place unto another: conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that in and by that I continue in my viſible image living in the world, viſiting and converſing with people of honour, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:114744:163"/>
other my good friends, as I was wont to do: which converſation of mine, although it was not without ſin, (becauſe we are all of us treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſers, and therefore ought continually to beſeech his divine Majeſty, to blot our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions out of his memory) yet was it by the help and grace of God, without all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of reproach before men.</p>
                              <p>Wherefore if thoſe qualities of the minde but ſhine in thee, wherewith I am endowed, as in thee remaineth the perfect image of my body, thou wilt be eſteeined by all men to be the perfect guardian and treaſure of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of our name: but if otherwiſe, I ſhall truly take but ſmall pleaſure to ſee it, conſidering that the leſſer part of me, which is the body, would abide in thee: and the beſt, to wit, that which is the ſoule, and by which our name continues bleſſed amongſt men, would be degenerate and abaſtardiſed: This I do not ſpeak out of any diſtruſt that I have of thy vertue, which I have heretofore already tried, but to encourage thee yet more earneſtly to proceed from good to better: and that which I now write unto thee, is not ſo much that thou ſhouldeſt live in this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous courſe, as that thou ſhouldeſt rejoyce in ſo living and having lived, and cheer up thy ſelf with the like reſolution in time to come; to the proſecution and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which enterpriſe and generous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:114744:163"/>
thou mayeſt eaſily remember how that I have ſpared nothing, but have ſo help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee, as if I had had no other treaſure in this world, but to ſee thee once in my life, compleatly well bred and accompliſhed, as well in vertue, honeſty and valour, as in all liberal knowledge and civility: and ſo to leave thee after my death, as a mirrour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the perſon of me thy father, and if not ſo excellent, and ſuch <hi>indeed</hi> as I do wiſh thee, yet ſuch in my <hi>deſire.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>But although my deceaſed father of happy memory <hi>Grangouſier,</hi> had bent his beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to make me profit in all perfection and Political knowledge, and that my labour and ſtudy was fully correſpondent to, yea, went beyond his deſire: nevertheleſſe, as thou mayeſt well underſtand, the time then was not ſo proper and fit for learning as it is at preſent, neither had I plenty of ſuch good Maſters as thou haſt had; for that time was dark ſome, obſcured with clouds of ignorance, and ſavouring a little of the infelicity and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> who had, whereever they ſet footing, deſtroyed all good literature, which in my age hath by the divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe been reſtored unto its former light and dignity, and that with ſuch amendment and increaſe of the knowledge, that now hardly ſhould I be admitted unto the firſt forme of the little Grammar-ſchool-boyes:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:114744:164"/>
I ſay, I, who in my youthful dayes was, (and that juſtly) reputed the moſt learned of that age; which I do not ſpeak in vain boaſting, although I might lawfully do it in writing unto thee, in verification whereof thou haſt the authority of <hi>Marcus Tullius</hi> in his book of old age, and the ſentence of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in the book intituled how a man may praiſe himſelf without envie: but to give thee an emulous encouragement to ſtrive yet further.</p>
                              <p>Now is it that the mindes of men are qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified with all manner of diſcipline, and the old ſciences revived, which for many ages were extinct: now it is, that the learned lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages are to their priſtine purity reſtored, <hi>viz. Greek,</hi> (without which a man may be aſhamed to account himſelf a ſcholar,) <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, Arabick, Chaldaean</hi> and <hi>Latine.</hi> Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likewiſe is now in uſe, ſo elegant, and ſo correct, that better cannot be imagined, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was found out but in my time by divine inſpiration, as by a diabolical ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the other ſide was the invention of Ordnance. All the world is full of knowing men, of moſt learned Schoolmaſters, and vaſt Libraries: and it appears to me as a truth, that neither in <hi>Plato</hi>'s time, nor <hi>Cicero</hi>'s, nor <hi>Papinian</hi>'s, there was ever ſuch conveniency for ſtudying, as we ſee at this day there is: nor muſt any adventure henceforward to come in publick, or preſent himſelf in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:114744:164"/>
that hath not been pretty well poliſhed in the ſhop of <hi>Minerva:</hi> I ſee robbers, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, free-booters, tapſters, oſtlers, and ſuch like, of the very rubbiſh of the people, more learned now, then the Doctors and Preachers were in my time,</p>
                              <p>What ſhall I ſay? the very women and children have aſpired to this praiſe and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Manna of good learning: yet ſo it is, that in the age I am now of, I have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to learn the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue, which I contemned not like <hi>Cato,</hi> but had not the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in my younger yeares to attend the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of it: and take much delight in the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Plutarchs</hi> Morals, the pleaſant Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues of <hi>Plato,</hi> the Monuments of <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanias,</hi> and the Antiquities of <hi>Athenaeus,</hi> in waiting on the houre wherein God my Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator ſhall call me, and command me to depart from this earth and tranſitory pilgrimage. Wherefore (my ſonne) I admoniſh thee, to imploy thy youth to profit as well as thou canſt, both in thy ſtudies and in vertue. Thou art at <hi>Paris,</hi> where the laudable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of many brave men may ſtirre up thy minde to gallant actions, and haſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for thy Tutor and <hi>Paedagogue</hi> the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Epiſtemon,</hi> who by his lively and vocal do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments may inſtruct thee in the Arts and Sciences.</p>
                              <p>I intend, and will have it ſo, that thou learn
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:114744:165"/>
the Languages perfectly: firſt of all, the <hi>Greek,</hi> as <hi>Quintilian</hi> will have it: ſecondly, the <hi>Latine;</hi> and then the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> for the holy Scripture-ſake: and then the <hi>Chaldee</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabick</hi> likewiſe, and that thou frame thy ſtilein <hi>Greek</hi> in imitation of <hi>Plato;</hi> and for the <hi>Latine,</hi> after <hi>Cicero,</hi> let there be no hiſtory which thou ſhalt not have ready in thy memory; unto the proſecuting of which deſigne, books of <hi>Coſmographie</hi> will be very conducible, and help thee much. Of the liberal Arts of <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry, Arithmetick</hi> and <hi>Muſick,</hi> I gave thee ſome taſte when thou wert yet little, and not above five or ſix yeares old; proceed further in them, &amp; learn the remainder if thou canſt. As for <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> ſtudy all the rules thereof, let paſſe nevertheleſſe the divining and judicial <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> and the Art of <hi>Lullius,</hi> as being nothing elſe but plain abuſes and vanities. As for the <hi>Civil Law,</hi> of that I would have thee to know the texts by heart, and then to conferre them with <hi>Philoſophie.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Now in matter of the knowledge of the works of Nature, I would have thee to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that exactly, and that ſo there be no ſea, river nor fountain, of which thou doeſt not know the fiſhes, all the fowles of the aire, all the ſeveral kindes of ſhrubs and trees, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in forreſts or orchards: all the ſorts of herbes and flowers that grow upon the ground: all the various mettals that are hid
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:114744:165"/>
within the bowels of the earth: together with all the diverſity of precious ſtones, that are to be ſeen in the Orient &amp; South-parts of the world, let nothing of all theſe be hidden from thee. Then faile not moſt carefully to peruſe the books of the <hi>Greek, Arabian</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Phyſicians, not deſpiſing the <hi>Talmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts</hi> and <hi>Cabaliſts;</hi> and by frequent Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomies get thee the perfect knowledge of the other world, called the Microcoſme, which is man: and at ſome houres of the day apply thy minde to the ſtudy of the holy Scriptures: firſt in <hi>Greek,</hi> the New Teſtament with the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles; and then the Old Teſtament in <hi>Hebrew</hi> In brief, let me ſee thee an Abyſſe, and bottomleſſe pit of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: for from hence forward, as thou grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt great and becomeſt a man, thou muſt part from this tranquillity and reſt of ſtudy, thou muſt learn chivalrie, warfare, and the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of the field, the better thereby to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my houſe and our friends, and to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and protect them at all their needs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the invaſion and aſſaults of evil doers.</p>
                              <p>Furthermore, I will that very ſhortly thou try how much thou haſt profited, which thou canſt not better do, then by maintaining pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly <hi>Theſes</hi> and Concluſions in all Arts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all perſons whatſoever, and by haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the company of learned men, both at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> and otherwhere. But becauſe as the wiſe
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:114744:166"/>
man <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Wiſdome entereth not into a malicious minde;</hi> and that knowledge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſcience is but the ruine of the ſoule, it behooveth thee to ſerve, to love, to feare God, and on him to caſt all thy thoughts and all thy hope, and by faith formed in charity to cleave unto him, ſo that thou mayeſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſeparated from him by thy ſins. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the abuſes of the world: ſet not thy heart upon vanity; for this life is tranſitory, but the Word of the Lord endureth for ever. Be ſerviceable to all thy neighbours, and love them as thy ſelf: reverence thy Praece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptors: ſhun the converſation of thoſe whom thou deſireſt not to reſemble, and receive not in vaine the graces which God hath beſtowed upon thee: and when thou ſhalt ſee that thou haſt attained to all the knowledge that is to be acquired in that part, return unto me, that I may ſee thee, and give thee my bleſſing before I die, <hi>My ſonne,</hi> the peace and grace of our Lord be with thee. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        <hi>PAntagruel,</hi> very well remembring his fathers letter and admonitions, would one day make trial of his knowledge. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in all the <hi>Carrefours,</hi> that is, throughout all the foure quarters, ſtreets and corners of the City, he ſet up Concluſions to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of nine thouſand ſeven hundred ſixty and foure, in all manner of learning, touching in them the hardeſt doubts that are in any ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And firſt of all, in the <hi>fodder-ſtreet</hi> he held diſpute againſt all the <hi>Regents</hi> or Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes of Colledges, <hi>Artiſts</hi> or Maſters of Arts, and Oratours, and did ſo gallantly, that he overthrew them, and ſet them all upon their tailes, he went afterwards to the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone,</hi> where he maintained argument againſt all the <hi>Theologians</hi> or Divines, for the ſpace of ſix weeks, from foure a clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, until ſix in the evening, except an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of two houres to refreſh themſelves, and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:114744:171"/>
take their repaſt: and at this were preſent the greateſt part of the Lords of the Court, the Maſters of Requeſts, Preſidents, Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, thoſe of the Accompts, Secretaries, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates and others: as alſo the Sheriffes of the ſaid town, with the Phyſicians and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the canon-law; amongſt which it is to be remarked, that the greateſt part were ſtubborn jades, and in their opinions obſtinate; but he took ſuch courſe with them, that for all their <hi>Ergo's</hi> and fallacies, he put their backs to the wall, gravelled them in the deepeſt queſtions, and made it viſibly appear to the world, that compared to him, they were but monkies, and a knot of mufled calves: Whereupon, every body began to keep a buſtling noiſe, and talk of his ſo mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous knowledge, through all degrees of perſons in both ſexes, even to the very Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, Brokers, Roſtmeat-ſellers, Penknife-makers and others, who, when he paſt along in the ſtreet, would ſay, This is he; in which he took delight, as <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Greek</hi> Oratours did, when an old crouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wife, pointing at him with her fingers, ſaid, That is the man.</p>
                     <p>Now at this ſame very time there was a proceſſe or ſuit in law, depending in Court between two great Lords, of which one was called my Lord <hi>Kiſſebreech,</hi> Plaintiffe of one ſide, and the other my Lord <hi>Suckfiſt,</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:114744:171"/>
of the other; whoſe Controverſie was ſo high and difficult in Law, that the Court of Parliament could make nothing of it. And therefore by the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King, there were aſſembled foure of the greateſt, and moſt learned of all the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments of <hi>France,</hi> together with the great Councel, and all the principal Regents of the Univerſities, not only of <hi>France,</hi> but of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> alſo and <hi>Italy,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Jaſon, Philippus-Decius, Petrus de Petronibus,</hi> and a rabble of other old <hi>Rabbiniſts:</hi> who being thus met together, after they had thereupon conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the ſpace of ſix and fourty weeks, finding that they could not faſten their teeth in it, nor with ſuch clearneſſe underſtand the caſe, as that they might in any manner of way be able to right it, or take up the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence berwixt the two aforeſaid Parties, it did ſo grievouſly vex them, that they moſt vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanouſly conſhit themſelves for ſhame. In this great extremity, one amongſt them na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Du Douhait,</hi> the learnedſt of all, and more expert and prudent then any of the reſt, whileſt one day they were thus at their wits end, all-to-be-dunced and <hi>philogrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized</hi> in their braines, ſaid unto them: We have been here (my Maſters,) a good long ſpace without doing any thingelſe, then trifle away both our time and money, and can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe finde neither brim nor bottome in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:114744:172"/>
this matter; for the more we ſtudy about it, the leſſe we underſtand therein, which is a great ſhame and diſgrace to us, and a heavy burthen to our conſciences; yea ſuch, that in my opinion we ſhall not rid our ſelves of it without diſhonour, unleſſe we take ſome other courſe; for we do nothing but doat in our conſultations.</p>
                     <p>See therefore what I have thought upon: you have heard much talking of that worthy perſonage named Maſter <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> who hath been found to be learned above the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of this preſent age, by the proofs he gave in thoſe great diſputations, which he held publickly againſt all men: my opinion is, that we ſend for him, to conferre with him about this buſineſſe; for never any man will encompaſſe the bringing of it to an end, if he do it not.</p>
                     <p>Hereunto all the Counſellors and Doctors willingly agreed, and according to that their reſult having inſtantly ſent for him, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to be pleaſed to canvaſs the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, and ſift it throughly, that after a deep ſearch and narrow examination of all the points thereof, he might forthwith make the report unto them, ſuch as he ſhall think good in true and legal knowledge: to this effect they delivered into his hands the bags where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were the Writs and Pancarts concerning that ſuit, which for bulk and weight were
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:114744:172"/>
almoſt enough to lade foure great <hi>couillard</hi> or ſtoned Aſſes; but <hi>Pantagruel</hi> ſaid unto them, Are the two Lords, between whom this debate and proceſſe is, yet living? it was anſwered him, Yes: To what a devil then (ſaid he,) ſerve ſo many paultry heapes, and bundles of papers and copies which you give me? is it not better to heare their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie from their own mouthes, whileſt they are face to face before us, then to reade theſe vile fopperies, which are nothing but trumperies, deceits, diabolical coſenages of <hi>Cepola,</hi> pernicious ſlights and ſubverſions of equity? for I am ſure, that you, and all thoſe thorough whoſe hands this proceſſe hath paſt, have by your devices added what you could to it <hi>pro &amp; contra,</hi> in ſuch ſort, that although their difference perhaps was clear and eaſie enough to determine at firſt, you have obſcured it, and made it more intricate, by the frivolous, ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, unreaſonable and fooliſh reaſons, and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of <hi>Accurſius, Baldus, Bartolus, de caſtro, de imola, Hippolytus, Panormo, Bertachin, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander, Curtius,</hi> and thoſe other old Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiffs, who never underſtood the leaſt law of the Pandects, they being but meer block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads &amp; great tithe-calvs, ignorant of all that which was needful for the underſtanding of the lawes; for (as it is moſt certain) they had not the knowledge either of the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> tongue, but only of the <hi>Gothick</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian;</hi>
                        <pb n="72" facs="tcp:114744:173"/>
the lawes nevertheleſſe were firſt taken from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> according to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Ulpian. l. poſter. de origine juris,</hi> which we likewiſe may perceive by that all the lawes are full of <hi>Greek</hi> words and ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and then we finde that they are reduced into a <hi>Latine</hi> ſtile, the moſt elegant and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that whole language is able to afford, without excepting that of any that ever wrote therein; nay, not of <hi>Saluſt, Varo, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero, Seneca, Titus Livius,</hi> nor <hi>Quintilian:</hi> how then could theſe old dotards be able to underſtand aright the text of the lawes, who never in their time had looked upon a good <hi>Latine</hi> book, as doth evidently, enough ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the rudeneſſe of their ſtile, which is fitter for a Chimney-ſweeper, or for a Cook or a Scullion, then for a Juriſconſult and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor in the Lawes.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, ſeeing the Lawes are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerpted out of the middle of moral and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philoſophie, how ſhould theſe fooles have underſtood it, that have by G—ſtudied leſſe in Philoſophie then my Mule? in reſpect of humane learning, and the knowledge of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities and Hiſtory, they were truly laden with thoſe faculties as a toad is with fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and yet of all this the Lawes are ſo full, that without it they cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as I intend more fully to ſhew unto you in a peculiar Treatiſe, which on that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:114744:173"/>
I am about to publiſh. Therefore if you will that I take any medling in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe; firſt, cauſe all theſe papers to be burnt: ſecondly, make the two Gentlemen come perſonally before me; and afterwards, when I ſhall have heard them, I will tell you my opinion freely without any feignednes or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>Some amongſt them did contradict this motion, as you know that in all companies there are more fooles then wiſe men, and that the greater part alwayes ſurmounts the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as ſaith <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> in ſpeaking of the <hi>Carthaginians:</hi> but the foreſaid <hi>Du Douet</hi> held the contrary opinion, maintaining that <hi>Pantagruel</hi> had ſaid well, and what was right, in affirming that theſe records, bills of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, replies, rejoinders, exceptions, depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, and other ſuch diableries of truth-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangling Writs, were but Engines where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to overthrow juſtice, and unneceſſarily to prolong ſuch ſuits as did depend before them; and that therefore the devil would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them all away to hell, if they did not take another courſe, and proceeded not in times coming according to the Preſcripts of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical and Philoſophical equity. In fine, all the papers were burnt, and the two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſummoned and perſonally convented; at whoſe appearance before the Court, <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel</hi> ſaid unto them, Are you they that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:114744:174"/>
have this great difference betwixt you? Yes, (my Lord) ſaid they: Which of you (ſaid <hi>Pantagruel,)</hi> is the Plaintiffe? It is I, ſaid <hi>my Lord Kiſſebreech:</hi> Go to then, my friend, (ſaid he) and relate your matter unto me from point to point, according to the real truth, or elſe (by cocks body) if I finde you to lie ſo much as in one word, I will make you ſhorter by the head, and take it from off your ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to ſhew others by your example, that in juſtice and judgement men ought to ſpeak nothing but the truth; thereſore take heed you do not adde nor impare any thing in the Narration of your caſe. <hi>Begin.</hi>

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:114744:184"/>
not fil'd with other kind of people then thoſe, we ſhall not have the final judgement theſe ſeven thouſand ſixty and ſeven jubilees yet to come; and ſo <hi>Cuſanus</hi> will be deceived in his conjecture: Remember that I have told you of it, and given you faire advertiſement in time and place convenient.</p>
                     <p>But if you have any hogſheads of good wine, I willingly will accept of a preſent of that, which they very heartily did do, in ſending him of the beſt that was in the City, and he drank reaſonably well, but poor <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi> bibbed and bowſed of it moſt villain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, for he was as dry as a red-herring, as lean as a rake, and like a poor, lank, ſlender cat, walked gingerly as if he had trod upon egges: ſo that by ſome one being admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the midſt of his draught of a large deep bowle, full of excellent Claret, with theſe words, Faire and ſoftly, <hi>Goſſip,</hi> you ſuck up as if you were mad: I give thee to the devil, (ſaid he) thou haſt not found here thy little tipling ſippers of <hi>Paris,</hi> that drink no more then the little bird called a <hi>ſpink</hi> or <hi>chaffinch,</hi> and never take in their beak ful of liquour, till they be bobbed on the tailes after the manner of the ſparrows. O companion, if I could mount up as well as I can get down, I had been long ere this above the ſphere of the Moon with <hi>Empedocles.</hi> But I cannot tell what a devil this meanes. This wine is ſo
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:114744:184"/>
good and delicious, that the more I drink thereof, the more I am athirſt; I beleeve that the ſhadow of my Maſter <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> engendereth the altered and thirſty men, as the Moon doth the catarres and defluxions; at which word the company began to laugh: which <hi>Pantagruel</hi> perceiving, ſaid, <hi>Panurge</hi> What is that which moves you to laugh ſo? Sir, ſaid he, I was telling them that theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villiſh Turks are very unhappy, in that they never drink one drop of wine, and that though there were no other harme in all <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homets Alcoran,</hi> yet for this one baſe point of abſtinence from wine, which therein is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, I would not ſubmit my ſelf unto their law. But now tell me, (ſaid <hi>Pantagruel)</hi> how you eſcaped out of their hands. By G—Sir (ſaid <hi>Panurge)</hi> I will not lie to you in one word.</p>
                     <p>The raſcally <hi>Turks</hi> had broached me upon a ſpit all larded like a rabbet, (for I was ſo dry and meagre, that otherwiſe of my fleſh they would have made but very bad meat) and in this manner began to roſt me alive. As they were thus roaſting me, I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended my ſelf unto the divine grace, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in my minde the good St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> and alwayes hoped in God that he would deliver me out of this torment, which came to paſſe, and that very ſtrangely; for as I did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my ſelf with all my heart unto God,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:114744:185"/>
crying, Lord God help me, Lord God ſave me, Lord God take me out of this pain and helliſh torture, wherein theſe traiterous dogs detain me for my ſincerity in the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of thy law: the roſter or turn-ſpit fell aſleep by the divine will, or elſe by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of ſome good <hi>Mercury,</hi> who cunningly brought <hi>Argus</hi> into a ſleep for all his hundred eyes: when I ſaw that he did no longer turne me in roaſting, I looked upon him, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that he was faſt aſleep, then took I up in my teeth a firebrand by the end where it was not burnt, and caſt it into the lap of my roaſter, and another did I throw as well as I could under a field-couche, that was placed near to the chimney, wherein was the ſtraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of my Maſter turnſpit; preſently the fire took hold in the ſtraw, and from rhe ſtraw to the bed, and from the bed to the loft, which was planked and ſeeled with firre, after the faſhion of the foot of a lamp: but the beſt was, that the fire which I had caſt into the lap of my paultry roaſter, burnt all his groine, and was beginning to ceaſe upon his cullions, when he became ſenſible of the danger, for his ſmelling was not ſo bad, but that he felt it ſooner then he could have ſeen day-light: then ſuddenly getting up, and in a great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement running to the window, he cried out to the ſtreets as high as he could, <hi>dalbaroth, dalbaroth, dalbaroth,</hi> which is as much to ſay
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:114744:185"/>
as, <hi>Fire, fire, fire:</hi> incontinently turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, he came ſtreight towards me, to throw me quite into the fire, and to that effect had already cut the ropes, wherewith my hands were tied, and was undoing the cords from off my feet; when the Maſter of the houſe hearing him cry, Fire, and ſmelling the ſmoke from the very ſtreet where he was walking with ſome other <hi>Baaſhaws</hi> and <hi>Muſtaphaes,</hi> ran with all the ſpeed he had to ſave what he could, and to carry away his Jewels; yet ſuch was his rage (before he could well reſolve how to go about it,) that he caught the broach whereon I was ſpitted, and therewith killed my roaſter ſtark dead, of which wound he died there for want of government or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; for he ran him in with the ſpit a little above the navel, towards the right flank, till he pierced the third lappet of his liver, and the blow flanting upwards from the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe or <hi>diaphragme,</hi> through which it had made penetration, the ſpit paſt athwart the <hi>pericardium,</hi> or capſule of his heart, and came out above at his ſhoulders, betwixt the <hi>ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyls</hi> or turning joints of the chine of the back, and the left <hi>homoplat,</hi> which we call the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-blade.</p>
                     <p>True it is, (for I will not lie,) that in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſpit out of my body, I fell to the ground near unto the Andirons, and ſo by the fall took ſome hurt, which indeed had
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:114744:186"/>
been greater, but that the <hi>lardons,</hi> or little ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of bacon, wherewith I was ſtuck, kept off the blow. My <hi>Baaſhaw</hi> then ſeeing the caſe to be deſperate, his houſe burnt without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and all his goods loſt, gave himſelfe over unto all the devils in hell, calling upon ſome of them by their names, <hi>Gringoth, Aſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roth, Rappalus,</hi> and <hi>Gribouillis,</hi> nine ſeveral times, which when <hi>I</hi> ſaw, <hi>I</hi> had above ſix pence worth of feare, dreading that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils would come even then to carry away this foole, and ſeeing me ſo near him would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſnatch me up too: <hi>I</hi> am already (thought <hi>I)</hi> halfe roſted, and my lardons, will be the cauſe of my miſchief; for theſe devils are very lickorous of lardons, according to the authority which you have of the Philoſopher <hi>Jamblicus</hi> and <hi>Murmault,</hi> in the Apology of <hi>Boſſuris,</hi> adulterated <hi>pro magiſtros noſtros:</hi> but for my better ſecurity <hi>I</hi> made the ſigne of the Croſſe; crying, <hi>Hageos, athanatos, hotheos,</hi> and none came: at which my rogue <hi>Baaſhaw</hi> being very much aggrieved, would in tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piercing his heart with my ſpit have killed himſelf; and to that purpoſe had ſet it againſt his breaſt, but it could not enter, becauſe it was not ſharp enough; whereupon <hi>I</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that he was not like to work upon his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the effect which he intended, although he did not ſpare all the force he had to thruſt it forward, came up to him and ſaid, Maſter <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grino,</hi>
                        <pb n="99" facs="tcp:114744:186"/>
thou doſt here but trifle away thy time, or raſhly loſe it, for thou wilt never kill thy ſelf thus as thou doeſt: well thou mayeſt hurt or bruiſe ſomewhat within thee, ſo as to make thee languiſh all thy life-time moſt pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully amongſt the hands of the Chirurgions; but if thou wilt be counſelled by me, I will kill thee clear out-right, ſo that thou ſhalt not ſo much as feel it, and truſt me, for I have killed a grear many others, who have found themſelves very well after it: Ha, my friend, ſaid he, I prethee do ſo, and for thy paines I will give thee my Codpiece, take, here it is, there are ſix hundred Seraphs in it, and ſome fine Diamonds, and moſt excellent Rubies. And where are they (ſaid <hi>Epiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon?)</hi> By St. <hi>John</hi> (ſaid <hi>Panurge)</hi> they are a good way hence, if they alwayes keep going: but where is the laſt yeares ſnow? this was the greateſt care that <hi>Villon</hi> the <hi>Pariſien</hi> Poet took. Make an end (ſaid <hi>Pantagruel)</hi> that we may know how thou didſt dreſſe thy <hi>Baaſhaw:</hi> By the faith of an honeſt man (ſaid <hi>Panurge) I</hi> do not lie in one word, <hi>I</hi> ſwadled him in a ſcurvie ſwathel-binding, which I found lying there half burnt, and with my cords tied him royſter-like both hand and foot, in ſuch ſort that he was not able to winſe, then paſt my ſpit thorough his throat, and hanged him thereon, faſtening the end thereof at two great hooks or cramp-irons, upon which they
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:114744:187"/>
did hang their Halberds; and then kindling a faire fire under him, did flame you up my <hi>Milourt,</hi> as they uſe to do dry herrings in a chimney: with this, taking his budget, and a little javelin that was upon the foreſaid hooks, <hi>I</hi> ran away a faire gallop-rake, and God he knows how <hi>I</hi> did ſmell my ſhoulder of mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>I</hi> was come down into the ſtreet, <hi>I</hi> found every body come to put out the fire with ſtore of water, and ſeeing me ſo halfe-roaſted, they did naturally pity my caſe, and threw all their water upon me, which by a moſt joyful refreſhing of me, did me very much good: then did they preſent me with ſome victuals, but <hi>I</hi> could not eat much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they gave me nothing to drink but wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter afrer their faſhion. Other hurt they did me none, only one little villainous <hi>Turkie</hi> knobbreaſted rogue, came thiefteouſly to ſnatch away ſome of my lardons, but <hi>I</hi> gave him ſuch a ſturdie thump and ſound rap on the fingers, with all the weight of my jave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, that he came no more the ſecond time. Shortly after this, there came towards me a pretty young <hi>Corinthian</hi> wench, who brought me a box full of Conſerves, of round <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabolan</hi> plums, called <hi>Emblicks,</hi> and looked upon my poor <hi>Robin</hi> with an eye of great compaſſion, as it was flea-bitten and pinked with the ſparkles of the fire from whence it
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:114744:187"/>
came, for it reached no further in length, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve me) then my knees; but note, that this roaſting cured me entirely of a Sciatick, whereunto <hi>I</hi> had been ſubject above ſeven yeares before, upon that ſide, which my roaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by falling aſleep, ſuffered to be burnt.</p>
                     <p>Now whileſt they were thus buſie about me, the fire triumphed, never ask, How? for it took hold on above two thouſand houſes, which one of them eſpying, cried out, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, By <hi>Mahooms</hi> belly all the City is on fire, and we do nevertheleſſe ſtand gazing here, without offering to make any relief: upon this every one ran to ſave his own; for my part, <hi>I</hi> took my way towards the gate. When <hi>I</hi> was got upon the knap of a little hillock, not farre off, <hi>I</hi> turned me about as did <hi>Lots</hi> wife, and looking back, ſaw all the City burning in a faire fire, whereat <hi>I</hi> was ſo glad, that <hi>I</hi> had almoſt beſhit my ſelfe for joy: but God puniſhed me well for it: How? ſaid <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel:</hi> Thus, ſaid <hi>Panurge;</hi> for when with pleaſure <hi>I</hi> beheld this jolly fire, jeſting with my ſelf, and ſaying, Ha poor flies, ha poor mice, you will have a bad winter of it this yeare, the fire is in your reeks, it is in your bed-ſtraw, out came more then ſix, yea more then thirteen hundred and eleven dogs great and ſmall, altogether out of the town, flying away from the fire; at the firſt approach they ran all upon me, being carried on by the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:114744:188"/>
ſent of my leacherous half-roaſted fleſh, and had even then devoured me in a trice, if my good Angel had not well inſpired me with the inſtruction of a remedy, very ſovereign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the tooth-ache. And wherefore (ſaid <hi>Pantagruel)</hi> wert thou afraid of the tooth-ache, or paine of the teeth? wert thou not cured of thy Rheumes? By Palme-ſunday, (ſaid <hi>Panurge)</hi> is there any greater pain of the teeth, then when the dogs have you by the legs? but on a ſudden, (as my good Angel directed me) <hi>I</hi> thought upon my lardons, and threw them into the midſt of the field a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them: then did the dogs run, and fight with one another at faire teeth, which ſhould have the lardons: by this means they left me, and <hi>I</hi> left them alſo buſtling with, and hairing one another. Thus did <hi>I</hi> eſcape frolick and lively, grammercie roaſtmeat and cookery.</p>

                        <hi>PAntagruel</hi> one day to refreſh himſelf of his ſtudy, went a walking towards St. <hi>Marcels</hi> ſuburbs, to ſee the extravagancie
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:114744:188"/>
of the <hi>Gobeline</hi> building, and to taſte of their ſpiced bread. <hi>Panurge</hi> was with him, having alwayes a flaggon under his gown, and a good ſlice of a gammon of bacon; for without this he never went, ſaying, that it was as a Yeoman of the guard to him, to preſerve his body from harme, other ſword carried he none: and when <hi>Pantagruel</hi> would have given him one, he anſwered, that he needed none, for that it would but heat his milt. Yea but (ſaid <hi>Epiſtemon)</hi> if thou ſhouldeſt be ſet upon, how wouldeſt thou defend thy ſelf? With great <hi>buskinades</hi> or brodkin blowes, anſwered he, provided thurſts were forbidden. At their return, <hi>Panurge</hi> conſidered the walls of the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> and in deriſion ſaid to <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel,</hi> See what faire walls here are! O how ſtrong they are, and well fitted to keep geeſe in a mue or coop to fatten them! by my beard they are competently ſcurvie for ſuch a City as this is; for a Cow with one fart would go near to overthrow above ſix fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms of them. O my friend (ſaid <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel)</hi> doeſt thou know what <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> ſaid, when he was asked, Why the great City of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> was not incloſed with walls? Lo here (ſaid he) the walls of the City, in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the inhabitants and Citizens there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſo ſtrong, ſo well armed, and ſo expert in military diſcipline; ſignifying thereby, that there is no wall but of bones; and that Towns
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:114744:189"/>
and Cities cannot have a ſurer wall, nor bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fortification then the proweſſe and vertue of the Citizens and Inhabitants; ſo is this City ſo ſtrong, by the great number of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like people that are in it, that they care not for making any other walls. Beſides, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever would go about to wall it, as <hi>Strasbourg, Orleans</hi> or <hi>Ferrara,</hi> would finde it almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, the coſt and charges would be ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive. Yea, but (ſaid <hi>Panurge)</hi> it is good nevertheleſſe to have an out-ſide of ſtone, when we are invaded by our enemies, were it but to ask, Who is below there? As for the enormous expence, which you ſay would be needful for undertaking the great work of walling this City about, if the Gentlemen of the Town will be pleaſed to give me a good rough cup of wine, I will ſhew them a pretty, ſtrange and new way how they may build them good cheap. How (ſaid <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel?)</hi> Do not ſpeak of it then (anſwered <hi>Panurge,)</hi> and I will tell it you. I ſee that the <hi>ſine quo nons, killibiſtris,</hi> or <hi>contrapunctums</hi> of the women of this Countrey, are better cheap then ſtones: of them ſhould the walls be built, ranging them in good ſymmetrie by the rules of Architecture, and placing the largeſt in the firſt ranks, then ſloping down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ridgewayes, like the back of an Aſſe, the middle ſized ones muſt be ranked next, and laſt of all the leaſt and ſmalleſt. This
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:114744:189"/>
done, there muſt be a fine little interlacing of them, like points of Diamonds, as is to be ſeen in the grear Tower of <hi>Bourges,</hi> with a like number of the <hi>nudinnudo's, nilniſiſtando's,</hi> and ſtiffe <hi>bracmards,</hi> that dwell in amongſt the clauſtral Codpieces. What devil were able to overthrow ſuch walls? there is no metal like it to reſiſt blowes, in ſo farre that if Culverin-ſhot ſhould come to greaſe upon it, you would incontinently ſee diſtill from thence the bleſſed fruit of the great pox, as ſmall as raine: beware in the name of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and hold off; furthermore, no thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt or lightning would fall upon it, for why? they are all either bleſt or conſecrated: I ſee but one inconveniency in it: Ho, ho, ha, ha, ha, (ſaid <hi>Pantagruel,)</hi> and what is that? It is that the flies would be ſo lickoriſh of them, that you would wonder, and would quickly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there together, and there leave their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure and excretions, and ſo all the work would be ſpoiled. But ſee how that might be remedied, they muſt be wiped and made rid of the flies with faire fox-tailes, or good great <hi>viedazes</hi> (which are Aſſe-pizzles) of <hi>Provence.</hi> And to this purpoſe I will tell you (as we go to ſupper,) a brave example ſet down by <hi>Frater Lubinus libro de compotationi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus mendicantium;</hi> in the time that the beaſts did ſpeak, which is not yet three dayes ſince.</p>

A poor Lion, walking through the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of <hi>Bieure,</hi> and ſaying his own little pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate devotions, paſt under a tree, where there was a roguiſh Collier gotten up to cut down wood, who ſeeing the Lion, caſt his hatchet at him, and wounded him enormouſly in one of his legs, whereupon the Lion halting, he ſo long toiled and turmoiled himſelf in roam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and down the forreſt to finde helpe, that at laſt he met with a Carpenter, who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly look't upon his wound, cleanſed it as well as he could, and filled it with moſſe, telling him that he muſt wipe his wound well, that the flies might not do their excrements in it, whileſt he ſhould go ſearch for ſome yarrow or millefoile, commonly called the Carpenters herbe. The Lion being thus heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, walked along in the forreſt, at what time a ſempiternous Crone and old Hag, was pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, and gathering ſome ſticks in the ſaid forreſt, whoſeeing the Lion coming towards her, for feare fell down backwards, in ſuch ſort, that the winde blew up her gown, coats and ſmock even as farre as above her ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; which the Lion perceiving, for pity ran to ſee whether ſhe had taken any hurt by the fall, and thereupon conſidering her <hi>how do you call it,</hi> ſaid, O poor woman, who hath thus wounded thee? which words when he had ſpoken, he eſpied a fox, whom he called to come to him, ſaying, <hi>Goſſip Renard,</hi> hau, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:114744:190"/>
hither, and for cauſe: when the fox was come, he ſaid unto him, My goſſip and friend, they have hurt this good woman here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the legs moſt villainouſly, and there is a manifeſt ſolution of continuity, ſee how great a wound it is, even from the taile up to the navel, in meaſure foure, nay full five handfulls and a half; this is the blow of an hatchet, I doubt me it is an old wound, and therefore that the flies may not get into it, wipe it luſtily well and hard; I prethy, both within and without; thou haſt a good taile and long, wipe, my friend, wipe, I beſeech thee, and in the mean while I will go get ſome moſſe to put into it; for thus ought we to ſuccour and help one another, wipe it hard, thus, my friend, wipe it well, for this wound muſt be often wiped, otherwiſe the Party cannot be at eaſe: go to, wipe well, my little goſſip, wipe, God hath furniſhed thee with a taile, thou haſt a long one, and of a bigneſſe proportionable, wipe hard and be not weary. A good <hi>wiper,</hi> who in <hi>wiping</hi> continually, <hi>wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth</hi> with his <hi>wipard,</hi> by waſps ſhall never be wounded: wipe, my pretty minion, wipe, my little bullie, <hi>I</hi> will not ſtay long. Then went he to get ſtore of moſſe; and when he was a little way off, he cried out in ſpeaking to the fox thus, Wipe well ſtill, goſſip, wipe, and let it never grieve thee to wipe well, my little goſſip, <hi>I</hi> will put thee into ſervice to be wiper
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:114744:191"/>
to <hi>Don Pedro de Caſtille,</hi> wipe, only wipe, and no more: the poor fox wiped as hard as he could, here and there, within and witho u: but the falſe old trot did ſo fizzle and fiſt, that ſhe ſtunk like a hundred devils, which put the poor fox to a great deal of ill eaſe, for he knew not to what ſide to turn himſelf, to eſcape the unſavoury perfume of this old womans po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern blaſts, and whileſt to that effect he was ſhifting hither and thither, without knowing how to ſhun the annoyance of thoſe unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom guſts, he ſaw that behinde there was yet another hole, not ſo great as that which he did wipe, out of which came this filthy and infectious aire. The Lion at laſt return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, bringing with him of moſſe more then eighteen packs would hold, and began to put into the wound, with a ſtaffe that which he had provided for that purpoſe, and had already put in full ſixteen packs and a half, at which he was amazed: What a devil? (ſaid he) this wound is very deep, it would hold above two cart-loads of moſſe. The fox perceiving this, ſaid unto the Lion, O goſſip Lion, my friend, I pray thee do not put in all thy moſſe there, keep ſomewhat; for there is yet here ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther little hole, that ſtinks like five hundred devils; I am almoſt choaked with the ſmell thereof, it is ſo peſtiferous and impoiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>Thus muſt theſe walls be kept from the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:114744:191"/>
flies, and wages allowed to ſome for wiping of them. Then ſaid <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> How doſt thou know that the privy parts of women are at ſuch a cheap rate? for in this City there are many vertuous, honeſt and chaſte women beſides the maids: <hi>Et ubi prenus,</hi> ſaid <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge?</hi> I will give you my opinion of it, and that upon certain and aſſured knowledge. I do not brag that I have bumbaſted four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſeventeen, ſince I came into this City, though it be but nine dayes ago: but this very morning I met with a good fellow, who in a wallet, ſuch as <hi>Aeſops</hi> was, carried two little girles of two or three yeares old at the moſt, one before, and the other behinde: he demanded almes of me, but <hi>I</hi> made him anſwer, that <hi>I</hi> had more cods then pence; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>I</hi> asked him, <hi>Good man,</hi> theſe two girles are they maids? Brother, ſaid he, <hi>I</hi> have carried them thus theſe two yeares, and in regard of her that is before, whom <hi>I</hi> ſee continually, in my opinion ſhe is a Virgin, nevertheleſſe <hi>I</hi> will not put my finger in the fire for it; as for her that is behinde, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe I can ſay nothing. Indeed (ſaid <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel)</hi> thou art a gentile companion, <hi>I</hi> will have thee to be apparelled in my liverly, and therefore cauſed him to be clothed moſt gallantly according to the faſhion that then was, only that <hi>Panurge</hi> would have the Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece of his breeches three foot long, and in
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:114744:192"/>
ſhape ſquare, not round, which was done and was well worth the ſeeing. Often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times was he wont to ſay that the world had not yet known the emolument and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility that is in wearing great Codpieces; but time would one day teach it them, as all things have been invented in time. God keep from hurt (ſaid he) the good fellow whoſe long Codpiece or Braguet hath ſaved his life: God keep from hurt him, whoſe long Braguet hath been worth to him in one day, one hundred threeſcore thouſand and nine Crowns: God keep from hurt him, who by his long Braguet hath ſaved a whole City from dying by famine. And by G—I will make a book of the commodity of long Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guets, when I ſhall have more leaſure. And indeed he compoſed a faire great book with figures, but it is not printed as yet that I know of.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>PAnurge</hi> was of a middle ſtature, not too high, nor too low, and had ſomewhat an Aquiline noſe, made like the handle of a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor: he was at that time five and thirty years
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:114744:192"/>
old or thereabouts, fine to gild like a leaden dagger; for he was a notable cheater and cony-catcher, he was a very gallant and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per man of his perſon, only that he was a little leacherous, and naturally ſubject to a kinde of diſeaſe, which at that time they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led lack of money: it is an incomparable grief, yet notwithſtanding he had chreeſcore and three tricks to come by it at his need, of which the moſt honourable and moſt ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary was in manner of thieving, ſecret pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loining and filching; for he was a wicked lewd rogue, a coſener, drinker, royſter, ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and a very diſſolute and debautch'd fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, if there were any in <hi>Paris;</hi> otherwiſe, and in all matters elſe, the beſt and moſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous man in the world: and he was ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving ſome plot, and deviſing miſchief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Serjeants and the watch.</p>
                     <p>At one time he aſſembled three or foure eſpecial good hackſters and roaring boyes, made them in the evening drink like <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plers,</hi> afterwards led them till they came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der St. <hi>Genevieve,</hi> or about the Colledge of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and at the houre that the watch was coming up that way, which he knew by putting his ſword upon the pavement, and his eare by it, and when he heard his ſword ſhake, it was an infallible ſigne that the watch was near at that inſtant: then he and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anions took a tumbrel or dung-cart, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:114744:193"/>
gave it the brangle, hurling it with all their force down the hill, and ſo overthrew all the poor watchmen like pigs, and then ran away upon the other ſide; for in leſſe then two dayes, he knew all the ſtreets, lanes and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in <hi>Paris,</hi> as well as his <hi>Deus det.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At another time he made in ſome faire place, where the ſaid watch was to paſſe, a traine of gun-powder, and at the very inſtant, that they went along, ſet fire to it, and then made himſelf ſport to ſee what good grace they had in running away, thinking that St. <hi>Antonies</hi> fire had caught them by the legs. As for the poor Maſters of Arts, he did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute them above all others: when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered with any of them upon the ſtreet, he would not never faile to put ſome trick or other upon them, ſometimes putting the bit of a fried turd in their graduate hoods: At o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times pinning on little fox-tails, or hares-eares behinde them, or ſome ſuch other ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh prank. One day that they were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all to meet in the <hi>fodder-ſtreet,</hi> he made a <hi>Borbonneſa</hi> tart, or filthy and ſlovenly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, made of ſtore of garlick, of <hi>Aſſa foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida,</hi> of <hi>Caſtoreum,</hi> of dogs turds very warm, which he ſteeped, temper'd and liquifi'd in the corrupt matter of pockie biles, and peſtife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous botches, and very early in the morning, therewith anointed all the pavement, in ſuch ſort, that the devil could not have endured it,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:114744:193"/>
which made all theſe good people, there to lay up their gorges, and vomit what was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſtomacks before all the world, as if they had flayed the fox; and ten or twelve of them died of the plague, fourteen became lepers, eighteen grew louſie, and above ſeven and twenty had the pox but he did not care a button for it. He commonly carried a whip under his gowne wherewith he whipt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remiſſion the pages, whom he found car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying wine to their Maſters, to make them mend their pace. In his coat he had above ſix and twenty little fabs and pockets alwayes full, one with ſome lead-water, and a little knife as ſharp as a glovers needle, wherewith he uſed to cut purſes: Another with ſome kinde of bitter ſtuffe, which he threw into the eyes of thoſe he met: another with clotburrs, penned with little geeſe or capons feathers, which he caſt upon the gowns and caps of honeſt people: and often made them faire hornes, which they wore about all the City, ſometimes all their life. Very often alſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the womens <hi>French</hi> hoods would he ſtick in the hind-part ſomewhat made in the ſhape of a mans member. In another he had a great many little hornes full of fleas and lice, which he borrowed from the beggars of St. <hi>Innocent,</hi> and caſt them with ſmall canes or quills to write with, into the necks of the daintieſt Gentlewomen that he could finde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:114744:194"/>
yea even in the Church, for he never ſeated himſelf above in the quire, but alwayes ſate in the body of the Church amongſt the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, both at Maſſe, at Veſpres, and at Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. In another, he uſed to have good ſtore of hooks and buckles, wherewlth he would couple men and women together, that ſate in company cloſe to one another, but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe that wore gownes of crimſon taf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faties, that when they were about to go away, they might rent all their gownes. In another, he had a ſquib furniſhed with tinder, matches, ſtones to ſtrike fire, and all other tackling neceſſary for it: in another, two or three burning glaſſes, wherewith he made both men and women ſometimes mad, and in the Church put them quite out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; for he ſaid that there was but an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtrophe,</hi> or little more difference then of a literal inverſion between a woman, <hi>folle a la meſſe,</hi> and <hi>molle a la feſſe;</hi> that is, <hi>fooliſh at the Maſſe,</hi> and <hi>of a pliant buttock.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In another he had a good deal of needles and thread, wherewith he did a thouſand little devilliſh pranks. One time at the entry of the Palace unto the great Hall, where a certain gray Friar or <hi>Cordelier</hi> was to ſay Maſſe to the Counſellors: He did help to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel him, and put on his veſtments, but in the accoutring of him, he ſowed on his alb, ſurplice or ſtole to his gowne and ſhirt, and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:114744:194"/>
then withdrew himſelf, when the ſaid Lords of the Court, or Counſellors came to heare the ſaid Maſſe; but when it came to the <hi>Ite, miſſa eſt,</hi> that the poor <hi>Frater</hi> would have laid by his <hi>ſtole</hi> or ſurplice (as the faſhion then was) he plucked off withal both his frock and ſhirt which were well ſowed together, and therby ſtripping himſelf up to the very ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſhewed his <hi>bel vedere</hi> to all the world, together with his <hi>Don Cypriano,</hi> which was no ſmall one, as you may imagine: and the Friar ſtill kept haling, but ſo much the more did he diſcover himſelf, and lay open his back-parts, till one of the Lords of the Court ſaid, How now, what's the matter? will this faire Father make us here an offering of his taile to kiſſe it? nay, St. <hi>Antonies</hi> fire kiſſe it for us. From thenceforth it was ordained that the poor Fathers ſhould never diſrobe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves any more before the world, but in their veſtry-room, or ſextry, as they call it; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the preſence of women, leſt it ſhould tempt them to the ſin of longing, and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate deſire. The people then asked, why it was the Friars had ſo long and large genito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries? the ſaid <hi>Panurge</hi> reſolved the <hi>Probleme</hi> very neatly, ſaying, That which makes Aſſes to have ſuch great eares, is that their dams did put no biggins on their heads, as <hi>Alliaco</hi> mentioneth in his <hi>ſuppoſitions:</hi> by the like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that which makes the genitories or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration-tooles
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:114744:195"/>
of thoſe faire <hi>Fraters</hi> ſo long is, for that they ware no bottomed breech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and therefore their jolly member having no impediment, hangeth dangling at liberty, as farre as it can reach, with a wigle-wagle down to their knees, as women carry their <hi>patinotre</hi> beads: and the cauſe wherefore they have it ſo correſpondently great, is, that in this conſtant wig-wagging the humours of the body deſcend into the ſaid member: for according to the <hi>Legiſts,</hi> Agitation and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual motion is cauſe of attraction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> he had another pocket full of itching powder, called <hi>ſtone-allum,</hi> whereof he would caſt ſome into the backs of thoſe women, whom he judged to be moſt beautiful and ſtately, which did ſo tickliſhly gall them, that ſome would ſtrip themſelves in the open view of the world, and others dance like a cock upon hot embers, or a drumſtick on a taber: others again ran about the ſtreets, and he would run after them: to ſuch as were in the ſtripping veine, he would very civilly come to offer his attendance, and cover them with his cloak, like a courteous and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gracious man.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> in another he had a little leather bottle full of old oile, wherewith, when he ſaw any man or woman in a rich new hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſuit, he would greaſe, ſmutch and ſpoil all the beſt parts of it under colour and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:114744:195"/>
of touching them, ſaying, This is good cloth, this is good ſattin, good taffaties; <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> God give you all that your noble heart deſireth; you have a new ſuit, <hi>pretty Sir;</hi> and you a new gown, <hi>ſweet Miſtris,</hi> God give you joy of it, and maintain you in all proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and with this would lay his hand upon their ſhoulder, at which touch ſuch a villain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpot was left behinde, ſo enormouſly engraven to perpetuity in the very ſoule, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and reputation, that the devil himſelf could never have taken it away: Then upon his departing, he would ſay, <hi>Madam,</hi> take heed you do not fall, for there is a filthy great hole before you, whereinto if you put your foot, you will quite ſpoile your ſelf. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had all full of <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> very fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pulveriſed, in that powder did he lay a faire handkerchief curiouſly wrought, which he had ſtollen from a pretty Seamſtreſſe of the Palace, in taking away a lowſe from off her boſome, which he had put there himſelf: and when he came into the company of ſome good Ladies, he would trifle them into a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of ſome fine workmanſhip of bone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, then immediately put his hand into their boſome, asking them, And this work, is it of <hi>Flanders,</hi> or of <hi>Hainault?</hi> and then drew out his handkerchief, and ſaid, Hold, hold, look what work here is, it is of <hi>Foutiman</hi> or of <hi>Foutarabia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> and ſhaking it hard at their noſe,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:114744:196"/>
made them ſneeze for foure houres without ceaſing: in the mean while he would fart like a horſe, and the women would laugh and ſay, How now, do you fart, <hi>Panurge?</hi> No, no, <hi>Madam</hi> (ſaid he,) I do but tune my taile to the plain ſong of the Muſick, which you make with your noſe. In another he had a picklock, a pellican, a crampiron, a crook, and ſome other iron tooles, wherewith there was no door nor coffer which he would nor pick open. He had another full of little cups, wherewith he played very artificially, for he had his fingers made to his hand, like thoſe of <hi>Minerva</hi> or <hi>Arachne,</hi> and had here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore cried <hi>Triacle.</hi> And when he changed a teſton, cardecu, or any other piece of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, the changer had been more ſubtil then a fox, if <hi>Panurge</hi> had not at every time made five or ſix ſols, (that is ſome ſix or ſeven pence) vaniſh away inviſibly, openly and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly, without making any hurt or leſion, whereof the changer ſhould have felt nothing but the winde.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XVII. <hi>How</hi> Panurge <hi>gained the pardons, and married the old women, and of the ſuit in law which he had at</hi> Paris.</head>
                     <p>ONe day I found <hi>Panurge</hi> very much out of countenance, melancholick and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, which made me ſuſpect that he had no money; whereupon I ſaid unto him, <hi>Panurge,</hi> you are ſick, as I do very well perceive by your phyſiognomie, and I know the diſeaſe, you have a flux in your purſe; but take no care I have yet ſeven pence half penny, that never ſaw father nor mother, which ſhall not be wanting, no more then the pox in your neceſſity: whereunto he anſwered me, Well, well, for money, one day <hi>I</hi> ſhall have but too much; for I have a Philoſophers ſtone, which attracts money out of mens purſes, as the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant doth iron; but will you go with me to gaine the pardons, ſaid he? By my faith (ſaid he) I am no great pardon-taker in this world; if <hi>I</hi> ſhall be any ſuch in the other, <hi>I</hi> cannot tell: yet let us go in Gods Name, it is but one farthing more or leſſe. But (ſaid he) lend me then a farthing upon intereſt. No, no, (ſaid I) <hi>I</hi> will give it you freely,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:114744:197"/>
and from my heart, <hi>Grates vobis dominos,</hi> ſaid he.</p>
                     <p>So we went along, beginning at St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſe,</hi> and I got the pardons at the firſt boxe only, for in thoſe matters very little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenteth me: then did I ſay my ſmall ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and the prayers of St. <hi>Brigid,</hi> but he gained them at all the boxes, and alwayes gave money to every one of the <hi>Pardoners;</hi> from thence we went to our <hi>Ladies</hi> Church, to St. <hi>Johns,</hi> to St. <hi>Antonies,</hi> and ſo to the other Churches, where there was a banquet of pardon, for my part, I gained no more of them: but he at all the boxes kiſſed the relicks, and gave at every one: to be brief, when we were returned, he brought me to drink at the Caſtle-tavern, and there ſhewed me ten or twelve of his little bags full of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, at which I bleſt my ſelf, and made the ſigne of the Croſſe, ſaying, Where have you recovered ſo much money in ſo little time? unto which he anſwered me, that he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it out of the baſins of the pardons; For in giving them the firſt farthing (ſaid he) I put it in with ſuch ſlight of hand, and ſo dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly that it appeared to be a three-pence; thus with one hand I took three-pence, nine-pence or ſix-pence at the leaſt, and with the other as much, and ſo thorough all the Churches where we have been. Yea, but (ſaid I) you damn your ſelf like a ſnake, and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:114744:197"/>
are withal a thief and ſacrilegious perſon. True (ſaid he) in your opinion, but I am not of that minde; for the Pardoners do give me it, when they ſay unto me in preſenting the relicks to kiſſe, <hi>Centuplum accipies,</hi> that is, that for one penny I ſhould take a hundred; for <hi>accipies</hi> is ſpoken according to the manner of the Hebrewes, who uſe the future tenſe in ſtead of the imperative, as you have in the law, <hi>Diliges Dominum,</hi> that is, <hi>dilige:</hi> even ſo when the Pardon-bearer ſayes to me, <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuplum accipies,</hi> his meaning is, <hi>centuplum ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipe;</hi> and ſo doth <hi>Rabbi Kimy,</hi> and <hi>Rabbi Aben Ezra</hi> expound it, and all the <hi>Maſſorets, &amp; ibi Bartholus.</hi> Moreover, Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> gave me fifteen hundred francks of yearly penſion (which in <hi>Engliſh</hi> money is a hundred and fifty pounds) upon his Eccleſiaſtical revenues and treaſure, for having cured him of a canc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>krous botch, which did ſo torment him, that he thought to have been a Cripple by it all his life. Thus I do pay my ſelf at my owne hand (for otherways I get nothing) upon the ſaid Eccleſiaſtical treaſure. Ho, my friend, (ſaid he) if thou didſt know what advantage <hi>I</hi> made, and how well <hi>I</hi> feathered my neſt, by the Popes bull of the Croiſade, thou wouldeſt wonder exceedingly. It was worth to me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſix thouſand <hi>florins</hi> (in <hi>Engliſh</hi> coine ſix hundred pounds,) and what a devil is become of them? (ſaid <hi>I)</hi> for of that money
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:114744:198"/>
thou haſt not one half penny. They returned from whence they came (ſaid he,) they did no mote but change their Maſter.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>I</hi> employed at leaſt three thouſand of them (that is, three hundred pounds <hi>Engliſh,)</hi> in marrying (not young Virgins; for they finde but too many husbands) but great old ſempiternous trots, which had not ſo much as one tooth in their heads; and that out of the conſideration <hi>I</hi> had, that theſe good old women had very well ſpent the time of their youth in playing at the cloſe-buttock-game to all commers, ſerving the foremoſt firſt, till no man would have any more dealing with them. And by G<hi>—I</hi> will have their skin-coat ſhaken once yet before they die; by this meanes, to one I gave a hundred florins, to another ſix ſcore, to another three hundred, according to that they were infamous, deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and abominable; for by how much the more horrible and execrable they were, ſo much the more muſt I needs have giventhem, otherwayes the devil would not have jum'd them. Preſently I went to ſome great and fat wood-porters, or ſuch like, and did my ſelf make the match, but before I did ſhew him the old Hags, <hi>I</hi> made a faire muſter to him of the Crownes, ſaying, Good fellow, ſee what <hi>I</hi> will give thee, if thou wilt but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to dufle, dinfredaille, or lecher it one good time: then began the poor rogues to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:114744:198"/>
gape like old mules, and I cauſed to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for them a banquet, with drink of the beſt, and ſtore of ſpiceries, to put the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in rut and heat of luſt. To be ſhort, they occupied all like good ſoules, only to thoſe that were horribly ugly and ill-favoured, I cauſed their head to be put within a bag, to hide their face.</p>
                     <p>Beſides all this, I have loſt a great deal in ſuits of law: And what law-ſuits couldeſt thou have? (ſaid I) thou haſt neither houſe norlands. My friend, (ſaid he) the Gentlewomen of this City had found out, by the inſtigation of the devil of hell, a manner of high-mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bands, and neckerchiefs for women, which did ſo cloſely cover their boſomes, that men could no more put their hands under; for they had put the ſlit behinde, and thoſe neck-cloths were wholly ſhut before, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the poor ſad contemplative lovers were much diſcontented. Upon a faire <hi>Tueſday,</hi> I preſented a Petition to the Court, making my ſelf a Party againſt the ſaid Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ſhewing the great intereſt that I pretended therein, proteſting that by the ſame reaſon, <hi>I</hi> would cauſe the Codpeece of my breeches to be ſowed behinde, if the Co ur would not take order for it. In ſumme, the Gentlewomen put in their defences, ſhewed the grounds they went upon, and conſtituted their Atturney for the proſecuting of the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:114744:199"/>
cauſe, but <hi>I</hi> purſued them ſo vigorouſly, that by a ſentence of the Court it was decreed, thoſe high neckclothes ſhould be no longer worne, if they were not a little cleft and open before, but it coſt me a good ſumme of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. <hi>I</hi> had another very filthy and beaſtly proceſſe againſt the dung-farmer (called Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Fifi)</hi> and his Deputies, that they ſhould no more reade privily the pipe, punchon, nor quart of ſentences, but in faire full day, and that in the fodder ſchools, in face of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Sophiſters, where <hi>I</hi> was ordained to pay the charges, by reaſon of ſome clauſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in the relation of the Serjeant. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time <hi>I</hi> framed a complaint to the Court, againſt the mules of the Preſidents, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors and others, tending to this purpoſe, that when in the lower Court of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, they left them to champ on their bridles: ſome bibs were made for them, that with their drivelling they might not ſpoile the pavement, to the end, that the Pages of the Palace might play upon it with their dice, or at the game of coxbody, at their own eaſe, without ſpoiling their breeches at the knees; and for this <hi>I</hi> had a faire decree, but it coſt me deare. Now reckon up what expence <hi>I</hi> was at in little banquets, which from day to day <hi>I</hi> made to the Pages of the Palace, and to what end, ſaid <hi>I?</hi> My friend (ſaid he) thou haſt no
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:114744:199"/>

But <hi>I</hi> laugh yet further, to think how at his home-coming the Maſter-page is to be whipt like green rie, which makes me not to repent what I have beſtowed in feaſting them. In brief, he had (as <hi>I</hi> ſaid before) threeſcore and three wayes to acquire mony, but he had two hundred and fourteen to ſpend it, beſides his drinking.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XVIII. <hi>How a great Scholar of</hi> England <hi>would have argued againſt</hi> Pantagruel, <hi>and was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by</hi> Panurge.</head>
                     <p>IN that ſame time, a certain learned man, named <hi>Thaumaſt,</hi> hearing the fame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown of <hi>Pantagruels</hi> incomparable know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, came out of his own countrey of <hi>England,</hi> with an intent only to ſee him, to try thereby, and prove, whether his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in effect was ſo great as it was reported to be. In this reſolution, being arrived at <hi>Paris,</hi> he went forthwith unto the houſe of the ſaid <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> who was lodged in the Palace of St. <hi>Denys,</hi> and was then walking in the garden thereof with <hi>Panurge,</hi> philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing after the faſhion of the Peripateticks. At his firſt entrance he ſtartled, and was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt out of his wits for feare, ſeeing him ſo great, and ſo tall, then did he ſalute him cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly as the manner is, and ſaid unto him, Very true it is, (ſaith <hi>Plato</hi> the Prince of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,) that if the image and knowledge of wiſdom were corporeal and viſible to the eyes of mortals, it would ſtirre up all the world to admire her: which we may the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:114744:200"/>
beleeve, that the very bare report there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſcattered in the air, if it happen to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in to the eares of men, who for being ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, and lovers of vertuous things, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Philoſophers, doth not ſuffer them to ſleep nor reſt in quiet, but ſo pricketh them up, and ſets them on fire, to run unto the place where the perſon is, in whom the ſaid knowledge is ſaid to have built her Temple, and uttered her Oracles, as it was manifeſtly ſhewen unto us in the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> who came ſtom the utmoſt borders of the Eaſt and Perſian ſea, to ſee the order of <hi>Solomons</hi> houſe, and to heare his wiſdom; in <hi>Anachar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> who came out of <hi>Scythia,</hi> even unto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> to ſee <hi>Solon;</hi> in <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled farre to viſit the <hi>Memphitical</hi> Vatici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators; in <hi>Platon,</hi> who went a great way off to ſee the <hi>Magicians</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Archit as</hi> of <hi>Tarentum;</hi> in <hi>Apollonius Tianeus,</hi> who went as farre as unto Mount <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> paſſed along the <hi>Scythians,</hi> the <hi>Maſſagetes,</hi> the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and ſailed over the great river <hi>Phiſon,</hi> even to the <hi>Brachmans</hi> to ſee <hi>Hiarchas;</hi> as likewiſe unto <hi>Babybon, Chaldea, Media, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyria, Barthia, Syria, Phoenicia, Arabia, Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> even unto <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> to ſee the <hi>Gymnoſoph ſts:</hi> the like example have we of <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> whom to ſee and heare, divers ſtudious perſons came to <hi>Rome,</hi> from the Conſines of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine; I</hi>
                        <pb n="128" facs="tcp:114744:201"/>
dare not reckon my ſelf in the number of thoſe ſo excellent perſons, but well would be called ſtudious, and a lover, not only of learning, but of learned men alſo: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, having heard the report of your ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable knowledge, <hi>I</hi> have left my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, my friends, my kindred and my houſe, and am come thus farre, valuing at nothing the length of the way, the tediouſneſſe of the ſea, nor ſtrangeneſſe of the land, and that only to ſee you, and to conferre with you about ſome paſſages in Philoſophy, of <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancie,</hi> and of the Cabaliſtick Art; whereof <hi>I</hi> am doubtful, and cannot ſatisfie my minde, which if you can reſolve, <hi>I</hi> yield my ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you for a ſlave henceforward, together with all my poſterity; for other gift have <hi>I</hi> none, that I can eſteem a recompence ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for ſo great a favour: I will reduce them into writing, and to morrow publiſh them to all the learned men in the City, that we may diſpute publickly before them.</p>
                     <p>But ſee in what manner, I mean that we ſhall diſpute: I will not argue <hi>pro &amp; contra,</hi> as do the ſottiſh <hi>Sophiſters</hi> of this town, and other places; likewiſe I will not diſpute after the manner of the <hi>Academicks</hi> by declamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: nor yet by numbers, as <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was wont to do, and as <hi>Picus de la mirandula</hi> did of late at <hi>Rome:</hi> but <hi>I</hi> will diſpute by ſignes only without ſpeaking, for the matters are ſo
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:114744:201"/>
abſtruſe, hard and arduous, that words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the mouth of man, will never be ſufficient for unfolding of them to my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. May it therefore pleaſe your Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to be there, it ſhall be at the great Hall of <hi>Navarre</hi> at ſeven a clock in the morning. When he had ſpoke theſe words, <hi>Pantagruel</hi> very honourably ſaid unto him, Sir, of the graces that God hath beſtowed upon me, <hi>I</hi> would not deny to communicate unto any man to my power; for whatever comes from him is good, and his pleaſure is, that it ſhould be increaſed, when we come amongſt men worthy and fit to receive this celeſtial Manna of honeſt literature: in which number, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in this time (as <hi>I</hi> do already very plainly perceive,) thou holdeſt the firſt rank, <hi>I</hi> give thee notice that at all houres thou ſhalt finde me ready to condeſcend to every one of thy requeſts, according to my poor abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: although <hi>I</hi> ought rather to learn of thee, then thou of me, but as thou haſt proteſted, we will conferre of theſe doubts together, and will ſeek out the reſolution, even unto the bottom of that undrainable Well, where <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclitus</hi> ſayes the truth lies hidden: and <hi>I</hi> do highly commend the manner of arguing which thou haſt propoſed, to wit, by ſignes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking; for by this means thou and <hi>I</hi> ſhall underſtand one another well enough, and yet ſhall be free from this clapping of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:114744:202"/>
hands, which theſe blockiſh Sophiſters make, when any of the Arguers hath gotten the better of the Argument: Now to morrow <hi>I</hi> will not faile to meet thee at the place and houre that thou haſt appointed, but let me intreat thee that there be not any ſtrife or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roare between us, and that we ſeek not the honour and applauſe of men, but the truth only: to which <hi>Thaumaſt</hi> anſwered, The Lord God maintain you in his favour and grace, and inſtead of my thankfulneſſe to you, poure down his bleſſings upon you, for that your Highneſſe and magnificent greatneſſe, hath not diſdained to deſcend to the grant of the requeſt of my poor baſeneſſe, ſo farewel till to morrow? Farewel, ſaid <hi>Pantagruel.</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, you that read this preſent diſcourſe, think not that ever men were more elevated and tranſported in their thoughts, then all this night were both <hi>Thaumaſt</hi> and <hi>Pantagruel;</hi> for the ſaid <hi>Thaumaſt,</hi> ſaid to the Keeper of the houſe of <hi>Cluny,</hi> where he was lodged, that in all his life he had never known himſelf ſo dry, as he was that night. <hi>I</hi> think (ſaid he) that <hi>Pantagruel</hi> held me by the throat; Give order, <hi>I</hi> pray you, that we may have ſome drink, and ſee that ſome freſh water be brought to us, to gargle my palat: on the other ſide <hi>Pantagruel</hi> ſtretched his wits as high as he could, entring into very deep and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meditations, and did nothing all that
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:114744:202"/>

                        </gap>: and a rabble of others, ſo long, that <hi>Panurge</hi> ſaid unto him,</p>
                     <p>My Lord, leave all theſe thoughts and go to bed; for <hi>I</hi> perceive your ſpirits to be ſo troubled by a too intenſive bending of them, that you may eaſily fall into ſome Quotidian Fever, with this ſo exceſſive thinking and plodding: but having firſt drunk five and twenty or thirty good draughts, retire your ſelf and ſleep your fill: for in the morning I will argue againſt, and anſwer my Maſter the <hi>Engliſhman;</hi> and if I drive him not <hi>ad metam non loqui,</hi> then call me Knave: Yea, but (ſaid he) my friend <hi>Panurge,</hi> he is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly learned, how wilt thou be able to anſwer him? Very well, (anſwered <hi>Panurge)</hi> I pray you talk no more of it, but let me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; is any man ſo learned as the devils are? No, indeed (ſaid <hi>Pantagruel,)</hi> without Gods eſpecial grace: Yet for all rhat (ſaid <hi>Panurge)</hi> I have argued againſt them, gravel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and blanked them in diſputation, and laid rhem ſo ſquat upon their tailes, that I have
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:114744:203"/>
made them look like Monkies; therefore be aſſured, that to morrow I will make this vain-glorious <hi>Engliſhman</hi> to skite vineger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the world. So <hi>Panurge</hi> ſpent the night with tipling amongſt the Pages, and played away all the points of his breeches at <hi>primus ſecundus,</hi> and at peck point (in <hi>French</hi> called <hi>Lavergette.)</hi> Yet when the condeſcended on time was come, he failed not to conduct his Maſter <hi>Pantagruel</hi> to the appointed place, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which (beleeve me) there was neither great nor ſmall in <hi>Paris</hi> but came; thinking with themſelves that this devilliſh <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> who had overthrown and vanquiſhed in diſpute all theſe doting freſh-water Sophiſters, would now get full payment and be tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to ſome purpoſe; for this <hi>Engliſhman</hi> is a terrible buſtler, and horrible coyle-keeper, we will ſee who will be Conquerour, for he never met with his match before.</p>
                     <p>Thus all being aſſembled, <hi>Thaumaſt</hi> ſtayed for them, and then when <hi>Pantagruel</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi> came into the Hall, all the School-boyes, Profeſſors of Arts, Senior-Sophiſters and Batchelors began to clap their hands, as their ſcurvie cuſtome is. But <hi>Pantagruel</hi> cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out with a loud voice, as if it had been the ſound of a double canon, ſaying, Peace. with a devil to you, peace: by G—you rogues, if you trouble me here, I will cut off the heads of every one of you: at which words
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:114744:203"/>
they remained all daunted and aſtoniſhed, like ſo many ducks, and durſt not do ſo much as cough, although they had ſwallowed fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen pounds of feathers: withal they grew ſo dry with this only voice, that they laid out their tongues a full half foot beyond their mouthes, as if <hi>Pantagruel</hi> had ſalted all their throats. Then began <hi>Panurge</hi> to ſpeak, ſaying to the <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> Sir, are you come hither to diſpute contentiouſly in thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions you have ſet down, or otherwayes but to learn and know the truth? To which anſwered <hi>Thaumaſt,</hi> Sir, no other thing brought me hither, but the great deſire I had to learn, and to know that of which <hi>I</hi> have doubted all my life long, and have neither found book nor man able to content me in the reſolution of thoſe doubts which I have propoſed: and as for diſputing contentiouſly, I will not do it, for it is too baſe a thing, and therefore leave it to thoſe ſottiſh <hi>Sophiſters,</hi> who in their diſputes do not ſearch for the truth, but for contradiction only and debate. Then ſaid <hi>Panurge,</hi> if I who am but a mean and inconſiderable diſciple of my Maſter my Lord <hi>Pantagruel;</hi> content and ſatisfie you in all and every thing, it were a thing below my ſaid Maſter, wherewith to trouble him: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it fitter that he be Chair-man, and ſit as a Judge and Moderator of our diſcourſe and purpoſe, and give you ſatisfaction in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:114744:204"/>
things, wherein perhaps <hi>I</hi> ſhall be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your expectation. Truly (ſaid <hi>Thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſt)</hi> it is very well ſaid: begin then. Now you muſt note that <hi>Panurge</hi> had ſet at the end of his long Codpiece, a pretty tuft of red ſilk, as alſo of white, green and blew, and within it had put a faire orange.</p>

                     <p>EVery body then taking heed, and heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening with great ſilence, the <hi>Engliſhman</hi> lift up on high into the aire his two hands ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally, clunching in all the tops of his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, together after the manner which <hi>(alachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonneſe)</hi> they call the hens arſe, and ſtruck the one hand on the other by the nailes foure ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times: then he opening them, ſtruck the one with the flat of the other, till it yielded a claſhing noiſe, and that only once: again in joyning them as before he ſtruck twice, and afterwards foure times in opening them; then did he lay them joyned, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the one towards the other, as if he had been devoutly to ſend up his prayers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. <hi>Panarge</hi> ſuddenly lifted up in the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:114744:204"/>
aire his right hand, and put the thumb there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of into the noſtril of the ſame ſide, holding his foure fingers ſtreight out, and cloſed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly in a parallel line to the point of his noſe, ſhutting the left eye wholly, and making the other wink with a profound depreſſion of the eye-brows and eye-lids. Then lifted he up his left hand, with hard wringing and ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth his foure fingers, and elevating his thumb, which he held in a line directly correſpondent to the ſituation of his right hand, with the diſtance of a cubit and a halfe between them. This done, in the ſame forme he abaſed towards the ground, both the one and the other hand; Laſtly, he held them in the midſt, as aiming right at the <hi>Engliſh</hi> mans noſe: And if <hi>Mercurie,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Engliſh</hi> man: there <hi>Panurge</hi> interrupted him, and ſaid, You have ſpoken <hi>Mask.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then made the <hi>Engliſh</hi> man this ſigne, his left hand all open he lifted up into the aire, then inſtantly ſhut into his fiſt the foure fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers thereof, and his thumb extended at length he placed upon the griſtle of his noſe: Preſently after, he lifted up his right hand all open, and all open abaſed and bent it down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, putting the thumb thereof in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place where the little finger of the left hand did cloſe in the fiſt, and the foure right hand fingers he ſoftly moved in the aire: then contrarily he did with the right hand what he
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:114744:205"/>
had done with the left, and with the left what he had done with the right.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Panurge</hi> being not a whit amazed at this, drew out into the aire his <hi>Triſmegiſt</hi> Codpiece with the left hand, and with his right drew forth a trunchion of a white oxe-rib, and two pieces of wood of a like forme, one of black eben, and the other of incarnation braſil, and put them betwixt the fingers of that hand in good ſymmetrie: then knocking them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, made ſuch a noiſe as the Lepers of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanie</hi> uſe to do with their clappering click<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, yet better reſounding, and farre more harmonious; and with his tongue contracted in his mouth, did very merrily warble it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes looking fixedly upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> man. The Divines, Phyſicians and Chirurgions that were there, thought that by this ſigne he would have inferred that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> man was a Leper: the Counſellors, Lawyers and Decretaliſts conceived, that by doing this he would have concluded ſome kinde of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal felicity to conſiſt in Leproſie, as the Lord maintained heretofore,</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> man for all this was nothing daunted, but holding up his two hands in the aire, kept them in ſuch forme, that he cloſed the three maſter-fingers in his fiſt, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his thumbs thorough his indical, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt and middle fingers, his auricularie or little fingers remained extended and ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:114744:205"/>
out, and ſo preſented he them to <hi>Panurge;</hi> then joyned he them ſo, that the right thumb touched the left, and the left little finger touched the right. Hereat <hi>Panurge,</hi> without ſpeaking one word, lift up his hands and made this ſigne.</p>
                     <p>He put the naile of the forefinger of his left hand, to the naile of the thumb of the ſame, making in the middle of the diſtance as it were a buckle, and of his right hand ſhut up all the fingers into his fiſt, except the forefinger which he often thruſt in and out through the ſaid two others of the left hand: then ſtretched he out the forefinger, and middle finger or medical of his right hand, holding them aſunder as much as he could, and thruſting them towards <hi>Thaumaſt.</hi> Then did he put the thumb of his left hand upon the corner of his left eye, ſtretching out all his hand like the wing of a bird, or the finne of a fiſh, and moving it very daintily this way and that way, he did as much with his right hand upon the corner of his right eye. <hi>Thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſt</hi> began then to waxe ſomewhat pale, and to tremble, and made him this ſigne.</p>
                     <p>With the middle finger of his right hand, he ſtruck againſt the muſcle of the palme or pulp, which is under the thumb: then put he the forefinger of the right hand in the like buckle of the left, but he put it under and not over, as <hi>Panurge</hi> did. Then <hi>Panurge</hi> knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:114744:206"/>
one hand againſt another, and blowed in his palme and put again the forefinger of his right hand into the overture or mouth of the left, pulling it often in and out; then held he out his chinne, moſt intentively looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Thaumaſt.</hi> The people there which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood nothing in the other ſignes, knew ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well what therein he demanded (without ſpeaking a word to <hi>Thaumaſt,)</hi> What do you mean by that? In effect, <hi>Thaumaſt</hi> then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſweat great drops, and ſeemed to all the Spectators a man ſtrangely raviſhed in high contemplation. Then he bethought himſelf, and put all the nailes of his left hand againſt thoſe of his right, opening his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers as if they had been ſemicircles, and with this ſigne lift up his hands as high as he could. Whereupon <hi>Panurge</hi> preſently put the thumb of his right hand under his jawes, and the little finger thereof in the mouth of the left hand, and in this poſture made his teeth to ſound very melodiouſly, the upper againſt the lower. With this <hi>Thaumaſt</hi> with great toile and vexation of ſpirit roſe up, but in riſing let a great bakers fart, for the bran came after, and piſſing withal very ſtrong vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger, ſtunk like all the devils in hell: the company began to ſtop their noſes; for he had conskited himſelf with meer anguiſh and perplexity. Then lifted he up his right hand, clunching it in ſuch ſort, that he brought the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:114744:206"/>
ends of all his fingers to meet together, and his left hand he laid flat upon his breaſt: whereat <hi>Panurge</hi> drew out his long Codpiece with his tuffe, and ſtretched it forth a cubit and a half, holding it in the aire with his right hand, and with his left took out his orange, and caſting it up into the aire ſeven times, at the eight he hid it in the fiſt of his right hand, holding it ſteadily up on high, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſhake his faire Codpiece, ſhewing it to <hi>Thaumaſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After that <hi>Thaumaſt</hi> began to puffe up his two cheeks like a player on a bagpipe, and blew as if he had been to puffe np a pigs blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; whereupon <hi>Panurge</hi> put one finger of his left hand in his nockandrow, by ſome cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led St. <hi>Patricks</hi> hole, and with his mouth ſuck't in the aire, in ſuch a manner as when one eats oyſters in the ſhell, or when we ſup up our broth; this done, he opened his mouth ſomewhat, and ſtruck his right hand flat upon it, making therewith a great and a deep ſound, as if it came from the ſuperficies of the midriffe through the <hi>trachiartere</hi> or pipe of the lungs, and this he did for ſixteen times; but <hi>Thaumaſt</hi> did alwayes keep blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like a gooſe. Then <hi>Panurge</hi> put the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finger of his right hand into his mouth, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it very hard to the muſcles thereof; then he drew it out, aud withal made a great noiſe, as when little boyes ſhoot pellets out

                     <p>Then <hi>Thaumaſt</hi> cried out, Ha, my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, a great ſecret; with this he put in his hand up to the elbow; then drew out a dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that he had, holding it by the point down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; whereat <hi>Panurge</hi> took his long Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, and ſhook it as hard as he could againſt his thighes; then put his two hands intwined in manner of a combe upon his head, laying out his tongue as farre as he was able; and turning his eyes in his head, like a goat that is ready to die. Ha, I underſtand (ſaid <hi>Thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſt)</hi> but what? making ſuch a ſigne, that he put the haft of his dagger againſt his breaſt, and upon the point thereof the flat of his hand, turning in a little the ends of his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; whereat <hi>Panurge</hi> held down his head on the left ſide, and put his middle fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger into his right eare, holding up his thumb bolt upright; then he croſt his two armes upon his breaſt, and coughed five times, and at the fifth time he ſtruck his right foot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ground: then he lift up his left arme, and cloſing all his fingers into his fiſt, held his thumbe againſt his forehead, ſtriking with his right hand ſix times againſt his breaſt. But <hi>Thaumast,</hi> as not content therewith, put the thumb of his left hand upon the top of his noſe, ſhutting the reſt of his ſaid hand:

whereupon <hi>Panurge</hi> ſet his two Maſter-fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers upon each ſide of his mouth, drawing it as much as he was able, and widening it ſo, that he ſhewed all his teeth: and with his two thumbs pluck't down his two eye-lids very low, making therewith a very ill-favour'd countenance, as it ſeemed to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>

                     <p>THen <hi>Thaumaſt</hi> roſe up, and putting off his cap, did very kindly thank the ſaid <hi>Panurge,</hi> and with a loud voice ſaid unto all the people that were there, My Lords, Gentlemen and others, at this time may I to ſome good purpoſe ſpeak that Evangelical word, <hi>Et ecce plus quàm Salomon hîc:</hi> You have here in your preſence an incomparable trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that is, my Lord <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> whoſe great renown hath brought me hither, out of the very heart of <hi>England,</hi> to conferre with him about the inſoluble problemes, both in <hi>Magick, Alchymie,</hi> the <hi>Caballe, Geomancie, Aſtrologie</hi> and <hi>Philoſophie,</hi> which I had in my minde: but at preſent I am angry, even with
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:114744:208"/>
fame it ſelf, which I think was envious to him, for that it did not declare the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandth part of the worth that indeed is in him: You have ſeen how his diſciple only hath ſatisfied me, and hath told me more then <hi>I</hi> asked of him: beſides, he hath opened unto me, and reſolved other ineſtimable doubts, wherein I can aſſure you he hath to me diſcovered the very true Well, Fountain and Abyſſe of the <hi>Encyclopedeia</hi> of learning; yea in ſuch a ſort, that I did not think I ſhould ever have found a man that could have made his skill appear, in ſo much as the firſt elements of that concerning which we diſputed by ſignes, without ſpeaking either word or half word. But in fine, I will reduce into writing that which we have ſaid and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that the world may not take them to be fooleries, and will thereafter cauſe them to be printed, that every one may learne as I have done. Judge then what the Maſter had been able to ſay, ſeeing the diſciple hath done ſo valiantly; for, <hi>Non eſt diſcipulus ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Magiſtrum.</hi> Howſoever God be praiſed, and <hi>I</hi> do very humbly thank you, for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that you have done us at this Act: God reward you for it eternally: the like thanks gave <hi>Pantagruel</hi> to all the company, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from thence, he carried <hi>Thaumaſt</hi> to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with him, and beleeve that they drank as much as their skins could hold, or, as the

                     <head>CHAP. XXI. <hi>How</hi> Panutge <hi>was in love with a Lady of</hi> Paris.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>PAnurge</hi> began to be in great reputation in the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> by means of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, wherein he pre vailed againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, and from thenceforth made his Codpiece to be very uſeful to him, to which effect he had it pinked with pretty little Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broideries after the <hi>Romaneſca</hi> faſhion; And the world did praiſe him publickly, in ſo farre that there was a ſong made of him, which little children did uſe to ſing, when they went to fetch muſtard: he was withal made wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in all companies of Ladies and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, ſo that at laſt he became preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and went about to bring to his lure one of the greateſt Ladies in the City: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed leaving a rabble of long prologues and proteſtations, which ordinarily theſe dolent contemplative Lent-lovers make, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meddle with the fleſh; one day he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, <hi>Madam;</hi> it would be a very great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to the Common-wealth, delightful to you, honourable to your progeny, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for me, that I cover you for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:114744:209"/>
of my race, and beleeve it, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience will teach it you: the Lady at this word thruſt him back above a hundred leagues, ſaying, You miſchievous foole, is it for you to talk thus unto me? whom do you think you have in hand? be gone, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to come in my ſight again; for if one thing were not, I would have your legs and armes cut off. Well, (ſaid he) that were all one to me, to want both legs and armes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided you and <hi>I</hi> had but one merry bout to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, at the brangle buttock-game; for here within is (in ſhewing her his long Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece) Maſter <hi>John Thurſday,</hi> who will play you ſuch an <hi>Antick,</hi> that you ſhall feel the ſweetneſſe thereof even to the very mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of your bones: He is a gallant, and doth ſo well know how to finde out all the corners, creeks and ingrained inmates in your carnal trap, that after him there needs no broom, he'l ſweep ſo well before, and leave nothing to his followers to work upon: whereunto the Lady anſwered, Go, villain, go, if you ſpeak to me one ſuch word more, <hi>I</hi> will cry out, and make you to be knocked down with blowes. Ha, (ſaid he) you are not ſo bad as you ſay, no, or elſe <hi>I</hi> am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in your phyſiognomie, for ſooner ſhall the earth mount up unto the Heavens, and the higheſt Heavens deſcend unto the Hells, and all the courſe of nature be quite
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:114744:210"/>
perverted, then that in ſo great beauty and neatneſſe as in you is, there ſhould be one drop of gall or malice: they ſay indeed, that hardly ſhall a man ever ſee a faire woman that is not alſo ſtubborn: yet that is ſpoke only of thoſe vulgar beauties, but yours is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, ſo ſingular, and ſo heavenly, that I beleeve nature hath given it you as a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, and maſter-piece of her Art, to make us know what ſhe can do, when ſhe will imploy all her skill, and all her power. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in you but honey, but ſugar, but a ſweet and celeſtial Manna: to you it was, to whom <hi>Paris</hi> ought to have adjudged the golden Apple, not to <hi>Venus,</hi> no, nor to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> nor to <hi>Minerva;</hi> for never was there ſo much magnificence in <hi>Juno,</hi> ſo much wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in <hi>Minerva,</hi> nor ſo much comelineſſe in <hi>Venus,</hi> as there is in you. O heavenly <hi>gods</hi> and <hi>goddeſſes!</hi> how happy ſhall that man be to whom you will grant the favour to embrace her, to kiſſe her, and to rub his bacon with hers? by G—that ſhall be I, I know it well; for ſhe loves me already her belly full, I am ſure of it, and ſo was I predeſtinated to it by the <hi>Fairies:</hi> and therefore that we loſe no time, put on, thruſt out your gamons, and would have embraced her, but ſhe made as if ſhe would put out her head at the window, to call her neighbours for help. Then <hi>Panurge</hi> on a ſudden ran out, and in his running away,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:114744:210"/>
ſaid, <hi>Madam,</hi> ſtay here till I come again, I will go call them my ſelf, do not you take ſo much paines: thus went he away not much caring for the repulſe he had got, nor made he any whit the worſe cheer for it. The next day he came to the Church, at the time that ſhe went to Maſſe, at the door he gave her ſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the holy water, bowing himſelf ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry low before her, afterwards he kneeled down by her very familiarly, and ſaid unto her, <hi>Madam,</hi> know that I am ſo amorous of you, that I can neither piſſe nor dung for love: <hi>I</hi> do not know <hi>(Lady,)</hi> what you mean, but if <hi>I</hi> ſhould take any hurt by it, how much would you be too blame? Go, ſaid ſhe, go, <hi>I</hi> do not care, let me alone to ſay my prayers. <hi>I</hi> but (ſaid he) equivocate upon this; <hi>a Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon le viconte,</hi> or to faire mount the pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunts: <hi>I</hi> cannot, ſaid ſhe: It is, ſaid he, <hi>a beau con le vit monte,</hi> or to a faire C... the pr... mounts: and upon this pray to God to give you that which your noble heart deſireth, and <hi>I</hi> pray you give me theſe patenotres. Take them (ſaid ſhe) &amp; trouble me no longer: this done, ſhe would have taken off her pate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notres, which were made of a kinde of yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſtone called <hi>Ceſtrin,</hi> and adorned with great ſpots of gold, but <hi>Panurge</hi> nimbly drew out one of his knives, wherewith he cut them off very handſomly, and whileſt he was going away to carry them to the Brokers, he
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:114744:211"/>
ſaid to her, Will you have my knife? No, no, ſaid ſhe: But (ſaid he) to thepurpoſe, <hi>I</hi> am at your commandment, body and goods, tripes and bowels.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, the Lady was not very well content with the want of her patinotres; for they were one of her implements to keep her countenance by in the Church: then thought with her ſelf, this bold flowting Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, is ſome giddy, fantaſtical, light-headed foole of a ſtrange countrey; <hi>I</hi> ſhall never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover my patenotres again, what will my husband ſay, he will no doubt be angry with me; but I will tell him that a thief hath cut them off from my hands in the Church, which he will eaſily beleeve, ſeeing the end of the riban left at my girdle. After dinner <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi> went to ſee her carrying in his ſleeve a great purſe full of Palace-crowns called counters, and began to ſay unto her, Which of us two loveth other beſt, you me, or I you? whereunto ſhe anſwered, As for me, I do not hate you; for as God commands, I love all the world: But to the purpoſe, (ſaid he) are not you in love with me? I have (ſaid ſhe) told you ſo many times already, that you ſhould talk ſo no more to me, and if you ſpeak of it again, I will teach you, that I am not one to be talked unto diſhoneſtly: get you hence packing, and deliver me my pate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notres, that my husband may not ask me for them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="149" facs="tcp:114744:211"/>
How now, <hi>(Madam)</hi> ſaid he, your pate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notres? nay, by mine oath I will not do ſo, but I will give you others; had you rather have them of gold well enameled in great round knobs, or after the manner of love-knots, or otherwiſe all maſſive, like great <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots,</hi> or if you had rather have them of <hi>Ebene,</hi> of <hi>Jacinth,</hi> or of <hi>grained</hi> gold, with the marks of fine <hi>Turkoiſes,</hi> or of faire <hi>Topazes,</hi> marked with fine <hi>Saphirs,</hi> or of <hi>baleu Rubies,</hi> with great marks of <hi>Diamonds</hi> of eight and twenty ſquares? No, no, all this is too little; I know a faire bracelet of fine <hi>Emeraulds,</hi> marked with ſpotted <hi>Ambergris,</hi> and at the buckle a <hi>Perſian pearle</hi> as big as an Orange: it will not coſt above five and twenty thouſand ducates, I will make you a preſent of it, for <hi>I</hi> have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy coine enough, and withal he made a noiſe with his counters as if they had been <hi>French</hi> Crownes.</p>
                     <p>Will you have a piece of velvet, either of the violet colour, or of crimſon died in graine: or a piece of broached or crimſon ſattin? will you have chaines, gold, tablets, rings? You need no more but ſay, Yes, ſo farre as fifty thouſand ducates may reach, it is but as nothing to me; by the vertue of which words he made the water come in her mouth: but ſhe ſaid unto him, No, I thank you, <hi>I</hi> will have nothing of you. By G—ſaid he, but I will have ſomewhat of you; yet ſhall
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:114744:212"/>
it be that which ſhall coſt you nothing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall you have a jot the leſſe, when you have given it, hold, (ſhewing his long Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece) this is Maſter <hi>John Good fellow,</hi> that askes for lodging, and with that would have embraced her; but ſhe began to cry out, yet not very loud. Then <hi>Panurge</hi> put off his counterfeit garb, changed his falſe viſage, and ſaid unto her, You will not then otherwayes let me do a little, a turd for you, you do not deſerve ſo much good, nor ſo much honour: but by G—I will make the dogs ride you, and with this he ran away as faſt as he could, for feare of blowes, whereof he was natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fearful.</p>

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:114744:213"/>
Oratory of the ſaid Church, to ſee the ſport; for theſe villainous dogs did compiſſe all her habiliaments, and left none of her attire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſprinkled with their ſtaling, in ſo much that a tall grey-hound piſt upon her head, others in her ſleeves, others on her crupper-piece, and the little ones piſſed upon her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines: ſo that all the women that were round about her had much ado to ſave her. Whereat <hi>Panurge</hi> very heartily laughing, he ſaid to one of the Lords of the City, <hi>I</hi> beleeve that the ſame Lady is hot, or elſe that ſome grey-hound hath covered her lately. And when he ſaw that all the dogs were flocking about her, yarring at the retardment of their acceſſe to her, and every way keeping ſuch a coyle with her, as they are wont to do about a proud or ſalt bitch, he forthwith departed from thence, and went to call <hi>Pantagruel:</hi> not forgetting in his way alongſt all the ſtreets, thorough which he went, where he found any dogs to give them a bang with his foot, ſaying, Will you not go with your fellowes to the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding? Away, hence, avant, avant, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil avant: And being come home, he ſaid to <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> Maſter, <hi>I</hi> pray you come and ſee all the dogs of the countrey, how they are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled about a Lady, the faireſt in the City, and would dufle and line her; whereunto <hi>Pantagruel</hi> willingly condeſcended, and ſaw the myſtery, which he found very pretty and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:114744:214"/>
ſtrange: But the beſt was at the Proceſſion, in which were ſeen above ſix hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and fourteen dogs about her, which did very much trouble and moleſt her, and whitherſoever ſhe paſt, thoſe dogs that came afreſh, tracing her footſteps, followed her at the heeles, and piſt in the way where her gown had touched. All the world ſtood ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing at this ſpectacle, conſidering the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of thoſe dogs, who leaping up got about her neck, and ſpoiled all her gorgeous accoutrements, for the which ſhe could finde no remedy, but to retire unto her houſe, which was a Palace: Thither ſhe went, and the dogs after her; ſhe ran to hide her ſelf, but the Chamber-maids could not abſtaine from laughing. When ſhe was entered into the houſe, and had ſhut the door upon her ſelf, all the dogs came running, of halfe a league round, and did ſo well bepiſſe the gate of her houſe, that there they made a ſtream with their urine, wherein a duck might have very well ſwimmed, and it is the ſame current that now runs at St. <hi>Victor,</hi> in which <hi>Gobelin</hi> dieth ſcarlet, for the ſpecifical vertue of theſe piſſe-dogs, as our Maſter <hi>Doribus</hi> did heretofore preach publickly.

                     <p>A Little while after <hi>Pantagruel</hi> heard newes that his father <hi>Gargantua</hi> had been tranſlated into the land of the Fairies by <hi>Morgue,</hi> as heretofore were <hi>Oger</hi> and <hi>Arthur</hi> together, and that the report of his tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being ſpread abroad, the <hi>Dipſodes</hi> had iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued out beyond their borders, with inrodes had waſted a great part of <hi>Utopia,</hi> and at that very time had beſieged the great City of the <hi>Amaurots;</hi> whereupon departing from <hi>Paris,</hi> without bidding any man farewel, for the buſineſſe required diligence, he came to <hi>Rowen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Pantagruel</hi> in his journey, ſeeing that the leagues of that little territory about <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> called <hi>France,</hi> were very ſhort in regard of thoſe of other Countreys, demanded the cauſe and reaſon of it from <hi>Panurge,</hi> who told him a ſtory which <hi>Marotus</hi> ſet down of the <hi>lac Monachus,</hi> in the acts of the Kings of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narre,</hi>
                        <pb n="156" facs="tcp:114744:215"/>
ſaying, that in old times Countreys were not diſtinguiſhed into leagues, miles, furlongs, nor paraſanges, until that King <hi>Pharamond</hi> divided them, which was done in manner as followeth. The ſaid King choſe at <hi>Paris</hi> a hundred faire, gallant, luſtie, briske young men, all reſolute and bold adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in <hi>Cupids</hi> duels, together with a hundred comely, pretty, handſome, lovely and well complexioned wenches of <hi>Picardie,</hi> all which he cauſed to be well entertained, and highly fed for the ſpace of eight dayes; then having called for them, he delivered to every one of the young men his wench, with ſtore of money to defray their charges, and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction beſides, to go unto divers places here and there, and whereſoever they ſhould biſcot and thrum their wenches, that thy ſetting a ſtone there, it ſhould be accounted for a league: thus went away thoſe brave fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows and ſprightly blades moſt merrily, and becauſe they were freſh, and had been at reſt, they very oftenjum'd and fanfreluched almoſt at every ſields end, and this is the cauſe why the leagues about <hi>Paris</hi> are ſo ſhort; but when they had gone a great way, and were now as weary as poor devils, all the oile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in their lamps being almoſt ſpent, they did not chink and dufle ſo often, but content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves, <hi>(I</hi> mean for the mens part,) with one ſcurvie paultry bout in a day, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:114744:215"/>
this is that which makes the leagues in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany, Delanes, Germany,</hi> and other more remote Countreys ſo long: other men give other reaſons for it, but this ſeems to me of all other the beſt. To which <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel</hi> willingly adhered. Parting from <hi>Rowen,</hi> they arrived at <hi>Honfleur,</hi> where they took ſhipping, <hi>Pantagruel, Panurge, Epiſtemon, Euſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes</hi> and <hi>Carpalim.</hi>

                     <p>In which place, waiting for a favourable winde, and caulking their ſhip, he received from a Lady of <hi>Paris</hi> (which <hi>I</hi> had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept, and entertained a good long time,) a letter directed on the out-ſide thus, <hi>To the beſt beloved of the faire women, and leaſt loyal of the valiant men,</hi>

                     </head>
                     <p>WHen <hi>Pantagruel</hi> had read the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, he was much amazed, and therefore demanded of the ſaid meſſenger
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:114744:216"/>
the name of her that had ſent it: then open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he the letter, and found nothing written in it, nor otherwayes incloſed, but only a gold ring, with a ſquare table-diamond. Wondering at this, he called <hi>Panurge</hi> to him, and ſhewed him the caſe; whereupon <hi>Panurge</hi> told him, thar the leafe of paper was written upon, but with ſuch cunning and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that no man could ſee the writing at the firſt ſight, therefore to finde it out he ſet it by the fire, to ſee if it was made with <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> ſoaked in water; then put he it into the water, to ſee if the letter was written with the juice of <hi>Tithymalle:</hi> after that he held it up againſt the candle, to ſee if it was written with the juice of white onions.</p>
                     <p>Then he rubbed one part of it with oile of nuts, to ſee if it were not written with the lee of a fig-tree: and another part of it with the milk of a woman giving ſuck to her el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt daughter, to ſee if it was written with the blood of red toads, or green earth-frogs: Afterwards he rubbed one corner with the aſhes of a Swallowes neſt, to ſee if it were not written with the dew that is found within the herb <hi>Alcakengie,</hi> called the winter-cherry. He rubbed after that one end with eare-wax, to ſee if it were not written with the gall of a Raven: then did he dip it into vineger, to try if it was not written with the juice of the garden <hi>Spurge:</hi> After that he greaſed it with
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:114744:216"/>
the fat of a bat or flittermouſe, to ſee if it was not written with the ſperm of a whale, which ſome call ambergris: Then put it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fairly into a baſin full of freſh water, and forthwith took it out, to ſee whether it were written with ſtone allum: But after all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, when he perceived that he could finde out nothing, he called the meſſenger, and asked him, Good fellow, the Lady that ſent thee hither, did ſhe not give thee a ſtaffe to bring with thee? thinking that it had been according to the conceit, whereof <hi>Aulus Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> maketh mention, and the Meſſenger an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, <hi>No, Sir.</hi> Then <hi>Panurge</hi> would have cauſed his head to be ſhaven, to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Lady had written upon his bald pate, with the hard lie whereof ſope is made, that which ſhe meant; but perceiving that his hair was very long, he forbore, conſidering that it could not have grown to ſo great a length in ſo ſhort a time.</p>
                     <p>Then he ſaid to <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> Maſter, by the vertue of G—I cannot tell what to do nor ſay in it; for to know whether there be any thing written upon this or no; <hi>I</hi> have made uſe of a good part of that which Maſter <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſco di Nianto,</hi> the <hi>Tuſcan</hi> ſets down, who hath written the manner of reading letters that do not appear; that which <hi>Zoroaſtes</hi> publiſhed, <hi>peri grammaton acriton;</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurnius Baſſus de literis illegibilibus:</hi> but <hi>I</hi>

can ſee nothing, nor do I beleeve that there is any thing elſe in it then the Ring: let us therefore look upon it, which when they had done, they found this in <hi>Hebrew</hi> written with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <hi>Lamach ſabathani;</hi> whereupon they called <hi>Epiſtemon,</hi> and asked him what that meant? to which he anſwered, that they were <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> words, ſignifying, <hi>Wherefore haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> upon that <hi>Panurge</hi> ſuddenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied: <hi>I</hi> know the myſtery, do you ſee this diamond? it is a falſe one; this then is the expoſition of that which the Lady meanes, <hi>Diamant faux,</hi> that is, falſe lover, why haſt thou forſaken me? which interpretation <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel</hi> preſently underſtood, and withal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering, that at his departure he had not bid the Lady farewel, he was very ſorry, and would faine have returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> to make his peace with her; but <hi>Epiſtemon</hi> put him in minde of <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s departure from <hi>Dido,</hi> and the ſaying of <hi>Heraclitus</hi> of <hi>Tarentum,</hi> That the ſhip being at anchor when need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, we muſt cut the cable rather then loſe time about untying of it, and that he ſhould lay aſide all other thoughts to ſuccour the City of his Nativity, which was then in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and indeed within an houre after that, the winde aroſe at the North-north-weſt, wherewith they hoiſed ſaile, and put out, even into the maine ſea, ſo that within few dayes, paſſing by <hi>Porto Sancto,</hi> and by the <hi>Maderas,</hi>
                        <pb n="161" facs="tcp:114744:217"/>
they went aſhore in the <hi>Canarie</hi> iſlands; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from thence, they paſſed by <hi>Capobianco;</hi> by <hi>Senege,</hi> by <hi>Capoverde,</hi> by <hi>Gambre,</hi> by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gres,</hi> by <hi>Melli,</hi> by the <hi>Cap di buona Speranza,</hi> and ſet aſhore againe in the Kingdom of <hi>Melinda;</hi> parting from thencc, they ſailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with a tramoutan or northerly winde, paſſing by <hi>Meden,</hi> by <hi>Uti,</hi> by <hi>Uden,</hi> by <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſim,</hi> by the iſles of the Fairies, and alongſt the Kingdome of <hi>Achorie,</hi> till at laſt they arrived at the port of <hi>Utopia,</hi> diſtant from the City of the <hi>Amaurots</hi> three leagues and ſomewhat more.</p>
                     <p>When they were aſhore; and pretty well refreſhed, <hi>Panurge</hi> ſaid, Gentlemen, the City is not farre from hence, therefore were it not amiſſe before we ſet forward, to adviſe well what is to be done, that we be not like the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi> who never took counſel until after the fact: Are you reſolved to live and die with me?

they all ſaid, Let us go thither and ſee, and ſtay you here for us, for this very day, without further reſpite do we make account to bring you a certain report thereof.</p>
                     <p>My ſelf (ſaid <hi>Panurge)</hi> will undertake to enter into their camp, within the very midſt of their guards, uneſpied by their watch, and merrily feaſt and lecher it at their coſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being known of any, to ſee the Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and the Tents of all the Captaines, and thruſt my ſelf in with a grave and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick carriage, amongſt all their troops and companies, without being diſcovered; the devill would not be able to peck me out with all his circumventions: for I am of the race of <hi>Zopyrus.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>I (ſaid <hi>Euſthenes)</hi> will enter and ſet upon them in their trenches, in ſpight of their Sentries, and all their guards; for <hi>I</hi> will tread upon their bellies, and break their legs and armes, yea though they were every whit as ſtrong as the devil himſelf; for I am of the race of <hi>Heroules.</hi>

And I (ſaid <hi>Carpalin)</hi> will get in there, if the birds can enter, for I am ſo nimble of body, and light withal, that I ſhall have leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over their trenches, and ran clean through all their camp, before that they perceive me; neither do I feare ſhot, nor arrow; nor horſe, how ſwift ſoever, were he the <hi>Pega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> of <hi>Perſee,</hi> or <hi>Pacolet;</hi> being aſſured that <hi>I</hi> ſhall be able to make a ſafe and ſound eſcape before them all, without any hurt: <hi>I</hi> will undertake to walk upon the eares of corne, or graſſe in the meddows, without making ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them do ſo much as bow under me; for <hi>I</hi> am of the race of <hi>Camilla</hi> the <hi>Ama-Zone.</hi>

                     <p>AS he was ſpeaking this, they perceived ſix hundred and threeſcore light horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, gallantly mounted, who made an out-rode thither, to ſee what ſhip it was that was newly arrived in the harbour, and came in a
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:114744:219"/>
full gallop to take them if they had been able: Then ſaid <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> my Lads, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire your ſelves unto the ſhip, here are ſome of our enemies coming apace, but I will kill them here before you like beaſts, although they were ten times ſo many, in the meane time withdraw your ſelves, and take your ſport at it. Then anſwered <hi>Panurge,</hi> No, Sir, there is no reaſon that you ſhould do ſo, but on the contrary retire you unto the ſhip, both you and the reſt; for I alone will here diſcomfit them, but we muſt not linger, come, ſet forward; whereunto the others ſaid, It is well adviſed, Sir, withdraw your ſelf, and we will help <hi>Panurge</hi> here, ſo ſhall you know what we are able to do: Then ſaid <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> Well, I am content, but if that you be too weak, <hi>I</hi> will not faile to come to your aſſiſtance. With this <hi>Panurge</hi> took two great cables of the ſhip, and tied them to the kemſtock or capſtane which was on the deck towards the hatches, and faſtened them in the ground, making a long circuit, the one further off, the other within that. Then ſaid he to <hi>Epiſtemon,</hi> Go aboard the ſhip, and when <hi>I</hi> give you a call, turn about the capſtane upon the orlop diligently, drawing unto you the two cable-ropes: and ſaid to <hi>Euſthenes,</hi> and to <hi>Carpalin, My Bullies,</hi> ſtay you here, and offer your ſelves freely to your enemies, do as they bid you, and make as if you would
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:114744:219"/>
yield unto them: but take heed you come not within the compaſſe of the ropes, be ſure to keep your ſelves free of them; and preſently he went aboard the ſhip, and took a bundle of ſtraw, and a barrel of gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſtrowed it round about the compaſſe of the cordes, and ſtood by with a brand of fire or match lighted in his hand. Preſently came the horſemen with great fury, and the foremoſt ran almoſt home to the ſhip, and by reaſon of the ſlipperineſſe of the bank, they fell they and their horſes, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of foure and fourty, which the reſt ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, came on, thinking that reſiſtance had been made them at theit arrival: But <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi> ſaid unto them, My Maſters, <hi>I</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that you have hurt your ſelves, <hi>I</hi> pray you pardon us, for it is not our fault, but the ſlipperineſſe of the ſea-water, that is alwayes flowing; we ſubmit our ſelves to your good pleaſure; ſo ſaid likewiſe his two other fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, and <hi>Epiſtemon</hi> that was upon the deck; in the mean time <hi>Panurge</hi> withdrew himſelfe, and ſeeing that they were all within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of the cables, and that his two compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions were retired, making room for all thoſe horſes which came in a croud, thronging up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the neck of one another to ſee the ſhip, and ſuch as were in it cried out on a ſudden to <hi>Epiſtemon,</hi> Draw, draw: then began <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtemon</hi> to winde about the capſtane, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:114744:220"/>
whereof the two cables ſo intangled and impeſtered the legs of the horſes, that they were all of them thrown down to the ground eaſily, together with their Riders: but they ſeeing that, drew their ſwords, and would have cut them: whereupon <hi>Panurge</hi> ſet fire to the traine, and there burnt them up all like damned ſouls, both men and horſes, not one eſcaping ſave one alone, who being mounted on a fleet <hi>Turkie</hi> courſer, by meere ſpeed in flight got himſelf out of the circle of the ropes; but when <hi>Carpalin</hi> perceived him, he ran after him with ſuch nimbleneſſe and celerity, that he overtook him in leſſe then a hundred paces; then leaping cloſe behinde him upon the crupper of his horſe, claſped him in his armes, and brought him back to the ſhip.</p>
                     <p>This exploit being ended <hi>Pantagruel</hi> was very jovial, and wondrouſly commended the induſtry of theſe Gentlemen, whom he called his fellow-ſouldiers, and made them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh themſelves, and feed well and merrily upon the ſea-ſhore, and drink heartily with their bellies upon the ground, and their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner with them, whom they admitted to that familiarity: only that the poor devil was ſomewhat afraid that <hi>Pantagruel</hi> would have eaten him up whole, which, conſidering the wideneſſe of his mouth, and capacity of his throat, was no great matter for him to

To which <hi>Panurge</hi> anſwered, God confound him that leaves you: I have already bethought my ſelf how I will kill them all like pigs, and ſo, that the devil one leg of them ſhall eſcape: but I am ſomewhat troubled about one thing: And what is that? ſaid <hi>Pantagruel:</hi> It is (ſaid <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge)</hi> how I ſhall be able to ſet forward to the juſling and bragmardiſing of all the whores that be there this afternoon, in ſuch ſort, that there eſcape not one unbumped by me, breaſted and jum'd after the ordinary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of man and woman, in the Venetian conflict.

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:114744:225"/>
little women, crouching down, as you ſhall ſee in divers places, which never grow but like Cowes tailes downwards, or like the <hi>Limoſin</hi> radiſhes, round. How now (ſaid <hi>Panurge)</hi> are your farts ſo fertile and fruitful? by G—here be brave farted men, and fisgued women, let them be married together, they will beget fine hornets and dorflies; ſo did <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> and called them Pygmies; thoſe he ſent to live in an iſland thereby, where ſince that time they are increaſed mightily: but the cranes make warre with them conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, againſt which they do moſt couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly defend themſelves; for theſe little ends of men and dandiprats, (whom in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> they call whiphandles, and knots of a tarre-barrel) are commonly very teaſtie and cholerick: the Phyſical reaſon whereof is, becauſe their heart is near their ſpleen.</p>
                     <p>At this ſame time, <hi>Panurge</hi> took two drinking glaſſes that were there, both of one bigneſſe, and filled them with water up to the brim, and ſet one of them upon one ſtool, and the other upon another, placing them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five foot from one another: then he took the ſtaffe of a javelin, about five foot and a half long, and put it upon the two glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſo that the two ends of the ſtaffe did come juſt to the brims of the glaſſes: This done, he took a great ſtake or billet of wood, and ſaid to <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> and to the reſt: <hi>My

                     <p>AFter all this talk, <hi>Pantagruel</hi> took the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to him, and ſent him away, ſaying, Go thou unto thy King in his Camp, and tell him tidings of what thou haſt ſeen, and let him reſolve to feaſt me to morrow about noon; for aſſoon as my galleys ſhall come,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:114744:226"/>
which will be to morrow at furtheſt; I will prove unto him by eighteen hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fighting men, and ſeven thouſand Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, all of them greater then I am; that he hath done fooliſhly and againſt reaſon, thus to invade my countrey, wherein <hi>Pantagruel</hi> feigned that he had an army at ſea; but the Priſoner anſwered, that he would yield him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be his ſlave, and that he was content never to return to his own people, but rather with <hi>Pantagruel</hi> to fight againſt them, and for Gods ſake beſought him, that he might be permitted ſo to do: whereunto <hi>Pantagruel</hi> would not give conſent, but commanded him to depart thence ſpeedily, and be gone as he had told him, and to that effect gave him a box full of <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> together with ſome grains of the black <hi>chameleon thiſtle,</hi> ſteeped into <hi>aqua vitae,</hi> and made up into the condiment of a wet ſucket, commanding him to carry it to his King, and to ſay unto him, that if he were able to eate one ounce of that without drinking after it, he might then be able to reſiſt him, without any feare or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of danger.</p>
                     <p>The Priſoner then beſonght him with joynt hands, that in the houre of the battel he would have compaſſion upon him: whereat <hi>Pantagruel</hi> ſaid unto him, After that thou haſt delivered all unto the King, put thy whole confidence in God,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:114744:226"/>
and he will not forſake thee; becauſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though for my part <hi>I</hi> be mighty, as thou mayeſt ſee, and have an infinite number of men in armes, I do nevertheleſſe truſt neither in my force nor in mine induſtry, but all my confidence is in God my Protectour, who doth never forſake thoſe that in him do put their truſt and confidence. This done, the Priſoner requeſted him that he would afford him ſome reaſonable compoſition for his ran ſome: to which <hi>Pantagruel</hi> anſwered, that his end was not to rob nor ran ſom men, but to enrich them, and reduce them to total liberty; Go thy way (ſaid he) in the peace of the living God, and never follow evil company, leſt ſome miſchief befall thee. The Priſoner being gone, <hi>Pantagruel</hi> ſaid to his men, Gentlemen, I have made this Priſoner believe that we have an army at ſea, as alſo that we will not aſſault them till to morrow at noon, to the end, that they doubting of the great arrival of our men, mayſpend this night in providing and ſtrengthening themſelves, but in the mean time my intention is, that we charge them about the houre of the firſt ſleep.</p>
                     <p>Let us leave <hi>Pantagruel</hi> here with his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and ſpeak of King <hi>Anarchus</hi> and his army. When the Priſoner was come, he went unto the King, and told him how there was a great Giant come, called <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> who had overthrown, and made to be cruelly roaſted
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:114744:227"/>
all the ſix hundred and nine and fifty horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and he alone eſcaped to bring the news: beſides that, he was charged by the ſaid Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, to tell him, that the next day about noon he muſt make a dinner ready for him, for at that houre he was reſolved to ſet upon him: then did he give him that boxe wherein were thoſe confitures; but aſſoon as he had ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down one ſpoonful of them, he was taken with ſuch a heat in the throat, together with an ulceration in the flap of the top of the winde-pipe, that his tongue peel'd with it, in ſuch ſort that for all they could do unto him, he found no eaſe at all, but by drinking only without ceſſation, for aſſoon as ever he took the goblet from his head, his tongue was on a fire, and therefore they did nothing but ſtill poure in wine into his throat with a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, which when his Captains, <hi>Baſhawes,</hi> and guards of his body did ſee, they taſted of the ſame drugs, to try whether they were ſo thirſt-procuring and alterative or no: but it ſo befell them as it had done their King, and they plied the flaggon ſo well, that the noiſe ran throughout all the Camp, how the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner was returned, that the next day they were to have an aſſault, that the King and his Captains did already prepare themſelves for it, together with his guards, and that wiah carowſing luſtily, and quaffing as hard as they could, every man therefore in the army
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:114744:227"/>
began to tipple, ply the pot, ſwill and guzzle it as faſt as they could. In ſumme, they drunk ſo much, and ſo long, that they fell aſleep like pigs, all out of order throughout the whole Camp.</p>
                     <p>Let us now return to the good <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> and relate how he carried himſelf in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, departing from the place of the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies,</hi> he took the maſt of their ſhip in his hand like a Pilgrims ſtaffe, and put within the top of it two hundred and ſeven and thirty poinſons of white wine of <hi>Anjou,</hi> the reſt was of <hi>Rowen,</hi> and tied up to his girdle the bark all full of ſalt, as eaſily as the <hi>Lans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennets</hi> carry their little panniers, and to ſet onward on his way with his fellow-ſouldiers.

                     </p>
                     <p>Hereunto <hi>Pantagruel</hi> very willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, and they drank ſo neat, that there was not ſo much as one poor drop left, of two hundred and ſeven and thirty punchons, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one <hi>Boracho</hi> or leathern bottle of <hi>Tours,</hi> which <hi>Panurge</hi> filled for himſelf, (for he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that his <hi>vade mecum,)</hi> and ſome ſcurvie lees of wine in the bottom, which ſerved him in ſtead of vineger. After they had whitled

and curried the canne pretty handſomely; <hi>Panurge</hi> gave <hi>Pantagruel</hi> to eate ſome devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh drugs, compounded of <hi>Lithotripton,</hi> (which is a ſtone-diſſolving ingredient,) <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrocatarticon,</hi> (that purgeth the reines) the marmalade of the Quinces, (called <hi>Codinias)</hi> a confection of <hi>Cantharides,</hi> (which are green flies breeding on the tops of olive-trees) and other kindes of <hi>diuretick</hi> or piſſe-procuring ſimples.

Yea, but, ſaid <hi>Carpalin,</hi> were it not good to cloy all their ordnance? No, no, (ſaid <hi>Pantagruel)</hi> only blow up all theit powder. <hi>Carpalin</hi> obeying him, departed ſuddenly, and did as he was appointed by <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> and all the Combatants came forth that were in the City, and when he had ſet fire in the tents and pavillions, he paſt ſo lightly through them, and ſo highly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly did they ſnort and ſleep, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver perceived him. He came to the place where their Artillery was, and ſet their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:114744:228"/>
on fire: but here was the danger, the fire was ſo ſudden, that poor <hi>Carpalin</hi> had almoſt been burnt; and had it not been for his wonderful agility, he had been fried like a roaſting pig: but he departed away ſo ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that a bolt or arrow out of a Croſſebowe could not have had a ſwifter motion. When he was clear of their trenches, he ſhooted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud, and cried out ſo dreadfully, and with ſuch amazement to the hearers, that it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the devils of hell had been let looſe: at which noiſe the enemies awaked, but can you tell how? even no leſſe aſtoniſhed then are <hi>Monks,</hi> at the ringing of the firſt peale to <hi>Matins,</hi> which in <hi>Luſonnois</hi> is called <hi>Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balock.</hi>

                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Pantagruel</hi> began to ſowe the ſalt that he had in his bark, and becauſe they ſlept with an open gaping mouth, he filled all their throats with it, ſo that thoſe poor wretches were by it made to cough like foxes. Ha, <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> how thou addeſt great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er heat to the firebrand that is in us.

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:114744:229"/>
been a more enormous deluge then that of <hi>Deucalion;</hi> for ſhe did never piſſe, but ſhe made a river, greater then is either the <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> or the <hi>Danow,</hi> which thoſe that were come out of the City ſeeing, ſaid, They are all cruelly ſlain, ſee how the blood runs along: but they were deceived in thinking <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruels</hi> urine had been the blood of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; for they could not ſee but by the light of the fire of the pavillions, and ſome ſmall light of the Moon.</p>
                     <p>The enemies after that they were awaked, ſeeing on one ſide the fire in the Camp, and on the other the inundation of the urinal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, could not tell what to ſay, nor what to think; ſome ſaid, that it was the end of the world, and the final judgement, which ought to be by fire: Others again thought that the ſea-gods, <hi>Neptune, Protheus, Triton,</hi> and the reſt of them did perſecute them, for that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they found it to be like ſea-water and and ſalt.</p>

Giants, By G—they will hurt one another, if they be not parted; but the Giants were as merry as if they had been at a wedding: then <hi>Carpalin</hi> would have riſen from thence to help his Maſter; but one of the Giants ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, By <hi>Golfarin</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Mahoon,</hi> if thou ſtir hence I will put thee in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of my breeches, in ſtead of a Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, which cannot chuſe but do me good; for in my belly I am very coſtive, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well <hi>eagar,</hi> without gnaſhing my teeth, and making many filthy faces. Then <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel,</hi> thus deſtitute of a ſtaffe, took up the end of his maſt, ſtriking athwart and alongſt upon the Giant, but he did him no more hurt then you would do with a filip upon a Smiths Anvil. In the time <hi>Loupgarou</hi> was drawing his mace out of the ground, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving already plucked it out, was ready there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to have ſtruck <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> who being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry quick in turning, avoided all his blowes, in taking only the defenſive part in hand, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til on a ſudden he ſaw that <hi>Loupgarou</hi> did threaten him with theſe words, ſaying, Now, villain, will not I faile to chop thee as ſmall as minced meat, and keep thee henceforth from ever making any more poor men athirſt; for then without any moreado, <hi>Pantagruel</hi> ſtruck him ſuch a blow with his foot againſt the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he made him fall backwards, his heels over his head, and dragged him thus along at

flay-buttock above a flight-ſhot. Then <hi>Loupgarou</hi> cried out, bleeding at the throat, <hi>Mahoon, Mahoon, Mahoon,</hi> at which noiſe all the Giants aroſe to ſuccour him: but <hi>Panurge</hi> ſaid unto them, Gentlemen, do not go, if you will beleeve me, for our Maſter is mad, and ſtrikes athwart and alongſt, he cares not where, he will do you a miſchief; but the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants made no account of it, ſeeing that <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel</hi> had never a ſtaffe.</p>
                     <p>And when <hi>Pantagruel</hi> ſaw thoſe Giants ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach very near unto him, he took <hi>Loupga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou</hi> by the two feet, and lift up his body like a pike in the aire, wherewith (it being harniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Anvils) he laid ſuch heavy load a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe Giants, armed with free ſtone, that ſtriking them down as a Maſon doth little knobs of ſtones, there was not one of them that ſtood before him, whom he threw not flat to the ground, and by the breaking of this ſtony armour there was made ſuch a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible rumble, as put me in minde of the fall of the butter-tower of St. <hi>Stephens</hi> at <hi>Bourge,</hi> when it melted before the Sunne. <hi>Panurge,</hi> with <hi>Carpalin</hi> and <hi>Euſthenes,</hi> did cut in the mean time the throats of thoſe that were ſtruck down; in ſuch ſort that there eſcaped not one. <hi>Pantagrnel</hi> to any mans ſight was like a Mower, who with his ſithe (which was <hi>Loupgarou,)</hi> cut down the meddow graſſe (to wit the Giants,) but with this fencing of <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruels,

                     <p>Nevertheleſſe <hi>Panurge</hi> gave him very good comfort, ſaying, If I do not heale him, I will be content to loſe my head (which is a fooles wager,) leave off therefore crying and help me. Then cleanſed he his neck very well

with pure white wine, and after that, took his head, and into it <hi>ſynapiſed</hi> ſome powder of <hi>diamerdis,</hi> which he alwayes carried about him in one of his bags.

In this faſhion was <hi>Epiſtemon</hi> finely healed, only that he was ſomewhat hoarſe for above three weeks together, and had a dry cough of which he could not be rid, but by the force of continual drinking: and now he began to ſpeak, and ſaid that he had ſeen the divel, had ſpoken with <hi>Lucifer</hi> familiarly, and had been very merry in hell, and in the <hi>Elyſian</hi> fields, affirming very ſeriouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them all, that the devils were boone companions, and merry fellowes: but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:114744:239"/>
into the City, where innnumerable bone-fires were ſet on, thorough all the parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and faire round tables which were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with ſtore of good victuals, ſet out in the middle of the ſtreets; this was a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the golden age in the time of <hi>Saturn,</hi> ſo good was the cheere which then they made.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Pantagruel</hi> having aſſembled the whole Senate, and Common Councel-men of the town, ſaid (My Maſters) we muſt now ſtrike the iron whileſt it is hot; it is therefore my will, that before we frolick it any longer, we adviſe how to aſſault and take the whole Kingdom of the <hi>Dipſodes:</hi> to which effect let thoſe that will go with me provide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt to morrow after drinking; for then will I begin to march, not that <hi>I</hi> need any more men then I have to help me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer it; for I could make it as ſure that way as if <hi>I</hi> had it already, but <hi>I</hi> ſee this City is ſo full of inhabitants, that they ſcarce can turn in the ſtreets; <hi>I</hi> will therefore carry them as a Colonie into <hi>Dipſodie,</hi> and will give them all that Countrey, which is fair, wealthie, fruitful and pleaſant, above all other Countreys in the world as many of you can tell who have been there heretofore every one of you therefore that will go along, let him provide himſelf as <hi>I</hi> have ſaid.

there aſſembled in the <hi>piazza,</hi> before the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, to the number of eighteen hundred fifty ſix thouſand and eleven, beſides women and little children: thus began they to march ſtraight into <hi>Dipſodie,</hi> in ſuch good order as did the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they departed out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to paſſe over the red-ſea.</p>
                     <p>But before we proceed any further in this purpoſe, I will tell you how <hi>Panurge</hi> handled his priſoner the King <hi>Anarchus:</hi> for having remembred that which <hi>Epiſtemon</hi> had rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, how the Kings and rich men, in this world were uſed in the <hi>Elyſian</hi> fields, and how they got their living there by baſe and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble trades; he therefore one day apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his King in a pretty little canvaſs doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, all jagged and pinked like the tippet of a light horſemans cap, together with a paire of large Mariners breeches, and ſtockins without ſhoes; For (ſaid he) they would but ſpoile his ſight; and a little peach-coloured bonnet, with a great capons feather in it: I lie, for <hi>I</hi> think he had two: and a very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome girdle of a sky-colour and green, (in <hi>French</hi> called <hi>pers &amp; vert)</hi> ſaying, that ſuch a livery did become him well, for that he had alwayes been <hi>perverſe:</hi> and in this plight bringing him before <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> ſaid unto him, Do you know this royſter? No indeed, ſaid <hi>Pantagruel:</hi> It is (ſaid <hi>Panurge)</hi> my Lord, the King of the three batches, or thread-bare
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:114744:240"/>
ſovereign: <hi>I</hi> intend to make him an honeſt man. Theſe devilliſh Kings which we have here are but as ſo many calves, they know nothing, and are good for nothing, but to do a thouſand miſchiefs to their poor ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and to trouble all the world with warre for their unjuſt and deteſtable pleaſure: I will put him to a trade, and make him a Crier of green ſauce: Go to, begin and cry, <hi>Do you lack any green ſauce?</hi> and the poor devil cried: That is too low (ſaid <hi>Panurge;)</hi> then took him by the eare, faying, Sing higher in <hi>Goſolreut:</hi> So, ſo, (poor devil) thou haſt a good throat: thou wert never ſo happy as to be no longer King: and <hi>Pantagruel</hi> made himſelf merry with all this; for I dare bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, that he was the beſt little gafer that was to be ſeen between this and the end of a ſtaffe. Thus was <hi>Anarchus</hi> made a good Crier of green ſauce, two dayes thereafter <hi>Panurge</hi> married him with an old Lanterne-carrying Hag, and he himſelfe made the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with fine ſheeps-heads, brave haſlets with muſtard, gallant ſalligots with garlick, of which he ſent five horſe-loads unto <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel,</hi> which he ate up all, he found them ſo appetizing: and for their drink, they had a kinde of ſmall well-watered wine, and ſome ſorbapple-cider: and to make them dance he hired a blinde man, that made muſick to them with a windbroach.</p>

After dinner he led them to the Palace, and ſhewed them to <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> and ſaid, pointing to the married woman, You need not feare that ſhe will <hi>crack:</hi> Why? ſaid <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel:</hi> Becauſe, ſaid <hi>Panurge,</hi> ſhe is well ſlit and broke up already; What do you mean by that? ſaid <hi>Pantagruel:</hi> Do not you ſee? ſaid <hi>Panurge,</hi> that the cheſtnuts which are roaſted in the fire, if they be whole, they <hi>crack</hi> as if they were mad; and to keep them from <hi>cracking,</hi> they make an inciſion in them, and ſlit them; ſo this new Bride is in her lower parts well ſlit before, and therefore will not crack behinde.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pantagruel</hi> gave them a little lodge near the lower ſtreet, and a mortar of ſtone wherein to bray and pound their ſauce, and in this manner did they do their little buſineſſe, he being as pretty a Crier of green ſauce, as ever was ſeene in the Countrey of <hi>Utopia:</hi> but <hi>I</hi> have been told ſince that his wife doth beat him like plaiſter, and the poor ſot dare not defend himſelf, he is ſo ſimple.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THus as <hi>Pantagruel</hi> with all his Army had entered into the Countrey of the <hi>Dipſodes,</hi> every one was glad of it, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently rendred themſelves unto him, bringing him out of their own good wills the Keyes of all the Cities where he went, the <hi>Almirods</hi> only excepted, who being reſolved to hold out againſt him, made anſwer to his Heraulds that they would not yield but upon very honourable and good conditions.</p>
                     <p>What? (ſaid <hi>Pantagruel)</hi> do they ask any better termes, then the hand at the pot, and the glaſſe in their fiſt? Come let us go ſack them, and put them all to the ſword: then did they put themſelves in good order, as being fully determined to give an aſſault, but by the way paſſing through a large field, they were overtaken with a great ſhower of raine, whereat they began to ſhiver and tremble, to croud, preſſe and thruſt cloſe to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. When <hi>Pantagruel</hi> ſaw that, he made their Captains tell them, that it was nothing,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:114744:242"/>
and that he ſaw well above the clouds, that it would be nothing but a little dew; but howſoever, that they ſhould put themſelves in order, and he would cover them: then did they put themſelves in a cloſe order, and ſtood as near to other as they could: and <hi>Pantagruel</hi> drew out his tongue only half-wayes and covered them all, as a hen doth her chickens. In the mean time I, who relate to you theſe ſo veritable ſtories, hid my ſelf under a burdock-leafe, which was not much leſſe in largeneſſe then the arch of the bridge of <hi>Montrible;</hi> but when I ſaw them thus covered, I went towards them to ſhelter my ſelf likewiſe, which I could not do; for that they were ſo (as the ſaying is) <hi>At the yards end there is no cloth left.</hi> Then as well as <hi>I</hi> could, I got upon it, and went along full two leagues upon his tongue, and ſo long marched, that at laſt I came into his mouth: but oh gods and goddeſſes, what did I ſee there? <hi>Jupiter</hi> confound me with his triſulk lightning if I lie: I walked there as they do in <hi>Sophie</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and ſaw there great rocks like the mountains in <hi>Denmark,</hi> I beleeve that thoſe were his teeth, <hi>I</hi> ſaw alſo faire meddows, large forreſts, great and ſtrong Cities, not a jot leſſe then <hi>Lyons</hi> or <hi>Poictiers,</hi> the firſt man <hi>I</hi> met with there, was a good honeſt fellow planting coleworts, whereat being very much amazed, <hi>I</hi> asked him, My
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:114744:242"/>
friend, what doſt thou make here? I plant coleworts, ſaid he: But how, and wherewith ſaid I? Ha Sir, ſaid he, every one cannot have his ballocks as heavy as a mortar, neither can we be all rich: thus do <hi>I</hi> get my poor li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and carry them to the market to ſell in the City which is here behinde Jeſus! (ſaid <hi>I)</hi> is there here a new world? Sure (ſaid he) it is never a jot new, but it is commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that without this there is an earth, whereof the inhabitants enjoy the light of a Sunne and a Moone, and that it is full of, and repleniſhed with very good commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but yet this is more ancient then that: Yea, but (ſaid I) my friend, what is the name of that City, whither thou car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieſt thy Coleworts to ſell? It is called <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharage,</hi> (ſaid he) and all the indwellers are Chriſtians, very honeſt men, and will make you good chear. To be brief, I reſolved to go thither. Now in my way, I met with a fellow that was lying in wait to catch pigeons, of whom <hi>I</hi> asked, (My friend) from whence come theſe pigeons? Sir, (ſaid he) they come from the other world: then I thought, that when <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel</hi> yawned, the pigeons went into his mouth in whole flocks, thinking that it had been a pigeon-houſe.</p>
                     <p>Then I went into the City, which <hi>I</hi> found faire, very ſtrong, and ſeated in a good aire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="212" facs="tcp:114744:243"/>
but at my entry the guard demanded of me my paſſe or ticket: whereat <hi>I</hi> was much aſtoniſhed, and asked them, (My Maſters) is there any danger of the plague here? O Lord, (ſaid they) they die hard by here ſo faſt, that the cart runs about the ſtreets; Good God! (ſaid <hi>I)</hi> and where? whereunto they anſwered that it was in <hi>Larinx</hi> and <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinx,</hi> which are two great Cities, ſuch as <hi>Rowen</hi> and <hi>Nants,</hi> rich and of great trading: and the cauſe of the plague was by a ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and infectious exhalation, which lately vapoured out of the abiſmes, whereof there have died above two and twenty hundred and threeſcore thouſand and ſixteen perſons within this ſevennight; then <hi>I</hi> conſidered, calculated and found, that it was a rank and unſavoury breathing, which came out of <hi>Pantagruels</hi> ſtomack, when he did eat ſo much garlick, as we have aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>Parting from thence, I paſt amongſt the rocks, which were his teeth, and never left walking till <hi>I</hi> got up on one of them; and there <hi>I</hi> found the pleaſanteſt places in the world, great large tennis-Courts, faire gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries, ſweet meddows, ſtore of Vines, and an infinite number of banqueting ſummer out-houſes in the fields, after the <hi>Italian</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, full of pleaſure and delight, where I ſtayed full foure moneths, and never made better cheer in my life as then. After that I
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:114744:243"/>
went down by the hinder teeth to comt to the chaps; but in the way <hi>I</hi> was robbed by thieves in a great forreſt, that is in the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory towards the eares: then (after, a little further travelling) <hi>I</hi> fell upon a pretty pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty village, (truly <hi>I</hi> have forgot the name of it) where <hi>I</hi> was yet merrier then ever, and got ſome certain money to live by, can you tell how? by ſleeping; for there they hire men by the day to ſleep, and they get by it ſix pence a day, but they that can ſhort hard get at leaſt nine pence. How <hi>I</hi> had been robbed in the valley <hi>I</hi> inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Senators, who told me that in very truth the people of that ſide were bad li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and naturally theeviſh, whereby I perceived well, that as we have with us the Countreys <hi>ciſalpin</hi> and <hi>tranſalpine,</hi> that is, behither and beyond the mountains, ſo have they there the Countreys <hi>cidentine</hi> and <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentine,</hi> that is, behither and beyond the teeth: but it is farre better living on this ſide, and the aire is purer. There <hi>I</hi> began to think, that it is very true which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, that the one half of the world know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not how the other half liveth; ſeeing none before my ſelf had ever written of that Countrey, wherein are above five and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Kingdomes inhabited, beſides deſerts, and a great arme of the ſea: concerning which purpoſe, <hi>I</hi> have compoſed a great book inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled

                     <p>At laſt I was willing to return, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by his beard, I caſt my ſelf upon his ſhoulders, and from thence ſlid down to the ground, and fell before him: aſſoon as I was perceived by him, he asked me, Whence comeſt thou, <hi>Alcoſribas?</hi> I anſwered him, Out of your mouth, <hi>my Lord?</hi> and how long haſt thou been there? ſaid he. Since the time (ſaid I) that you went againſt the <hi>Almirods;</hi> That is, about ſix moneths ago, ſaid he: and wherewith didſt thou live? what didſt thou drink? I anſwered, My Lord, of the ſame that you did, and of the daintieſt morſels that paſt through your throat I took toll: Yea, but ſaid he, where didſt thou ſhite? In your throat (my Lord) ſaid I: Ha, ha, thou art a merry fellow, ſaid he. We have with the help of God conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the land of the <hi>Dipſodes,</hi> I will give thee the <hi>Chaſtelleine,</hi> or Lairdſhip of <hi>Salmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gondin;</hi> Grammercy, my Lord, ſaid I, you gratifie me beyond all that I have deſerved of you.</p>

then that which is to be ſeen on the top of St. <hi>Peters</hi> needle at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in ſuch ſort, that they did open in the midſt, and ſhut with a ſpring. Into one of them entered one of his men carrying a Lanterne and a torch lighted, and ſo <hi>Pantagruel</hi> ſwallowed him down like a little pill: into ſeven others went ſeven Countrey-fellows, having every one of them a ſhovel on his neck: into nine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers entred nine wood-carriers, having each of them a basket hung at his neck, and ſo were they ſwallowed down like pills: when they were in his ſtomack, every one undid his ſpring, and came out of their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins: the firſt whereof was he that carried the Lantern, and ſo they fell more then half a league into a moſt horrible gulph, more ſtinking and infectious then ever was <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitis,</hi> or the mariſhes of <hi>Camerina,</hi> or the abominably unſavoury lake of <hi>Sorbona,</hi> whereof <hi>Strabo</hi> maketh mention. And had it not been, that they had very well an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidoted their ſtomach, heart and wine-pot, which is called the noddle, they had been altogether ſuffocated and choaked with theſe deteſtable vapours.

                     <p>NOw (my Maſters) you have heard a beginning of the horriſick hiſtory of my Lord and Maſter <hi>Pantagruel:</hi> Here will I make an end of the firſt book; My head akes a little, and I perceive that the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of my braine, are ſomewhat jumbled and diſordered with this ſeptembral juice. You ſhall have the reſt of the hiſtory at <hi>Franckfort mart</hi> next coming, and there ſhall you ſee how <hi>Panurge</hi> was married and made a Cuckold within a moneth after his wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: how <hi>Pantagruel</hi> found out the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers ſtone, the manner how he found it, and the way how to uſe it: how he paſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Caſpian</hi> mountaines, and how he ſailed thorough the <hi>Atlantick</hi> ſea, defeated the <hi>Cannibals,</hi> and conquered the iſles of <hi>Perles,</hi> how he married the daughter of the King of <hi>India,</hi> called <hi>Preſian,</hi> how he fought againſt the devil, and burnt up five cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of hell, ranſacked the great black chamber, threw <hi>Proſerpina</hi> into the fire,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:114744:247"/>
broke five teeth to <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and the horne that was in his arſe. How he viſited the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the Moon, to know whether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Moon were not entire and whole, or if the women had three quarters of it in their heads, and a thouſand other little mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments all veritable. Theſe are brave things truly; Good night, Gentlemen, <hi>Perdonate mi,</hi> and think not ſo much upon my faults, that you forget your own. If you ſay to me, (Maſter) it would ſeem that you were not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wiſe in writing to us theſe flimflam ſtories, and pleaſant fooleries.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> anſwer you, that you are not much wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer to ſpend your time in reading them: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe, if you read them to make your ſelves merry, as in manner of paſtime <hi>I</hi> wrote them, you and <hi>I</hi> both are farre more worthy of pardon, then a great rabble of ſquint-minded fellowes, diſſembling and counterfeit Saints, demure lookers, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, pretended zealots, tough Fryars, bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin-Monks, and other ſuch ſects of men, who diſguiſe themſelves like Maskers to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the world, for whileſt they give the common people to underſtand, that they are buſied about nothing but contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and devotion in faſtings, and maceration of their ſenſuality; and that only to ſuſtain and aliment the ſmall frailty of their humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: It is ſo far otherwiſe, that on the contrary
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:114744:247"/>
(God knows) what cheer they make, <hi>Et Curios ſimulant, ſed bacchanalia vivunt.</hi> You may reade it in great letters, in the colouring of their red ſnowts, and gulching bellies as big as a tun, unleſſe it be when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume themſelves with ſulphur; as for their ſtudy it is wholly taken up in reading of <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruelin</hi> books, not ſo much to paſſe the time merrily, as to hurt ſome one or other miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievouſly, to wit, in <hi>articling, ſole-articling, wry-neckifying, buttock-ſtirring, ballocking,</hi> and <hi>diabliculating,</hi> that is, calumniating; wherein they are like unto the poor rogues of a village, that are buſie in ſtirring up and ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in the ordure and filth of little children, in the ſeaſon of cherries and guinds, and that only to finde the kernels, that they may ſell them to the druggiſts, to make thereof po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander-oile. Fly from theſe men, abhorre and hate them as much as <hi>I</hi> do, and upon my faith you will finde your ſelves the better for it. And if you deſire to be good <hi>Pantagru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eliſts</hi> (that is to ſay, to live in peace, joy, health, making your ſelves alwayes merry) never truſt thoſe men that alwayes peep out at one hole.</p>
