            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F formerly the English Catholiques by their <hi>Apology</hi> did in treat your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion to our Gratious Monarch, in ſuſpending the execution of tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe ſeverities then proclaimed: I (a member of that faithful Body) muſt now beſeech your Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice againſt the malice of a Parſon, who not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106777:3"/>
only ſtrives to oppreſs the Loyal, but alſo (by the inferences of his Diſcourſe) would ſtifle hereafter zeal, and mitigate, if he could, the fire, that reſides in the breaſts of all generous Subjects. Can any thing touch men of Honour more, then after the loſs of ſo many Lives and Eſtates, inſultingly to have it ſaid, <hi>It was but your Duty?</hi> Nay, to go yet farther, even in a barbarous falſity, that Neceſſity only forc'd us to what we did, and that at all times you would rather far have had our room then Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. What Preacher preacht this in the days of old? Or who told us when <hi>Cromwel</hi> lived, <hi>Be gone, you are no friends to Caeſar?</hi> It was our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I confeſs, and a Duty which no good man can refuſe his Soveraign, neither shall we ever be shockt in the fervour of it, by the Doctrine of ſuch a <hi>Rabby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſon why I now take up the Gantlet of this <hi>Goliah,</hi> is to shew the candour of our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, being yet purer then his words are black: which though many could do far better then I, yet here I appear challenged into the Liſt, as <hi>Author</hi> of the late <hi>Apology.</hi> Author I can call my ſelf, if plain words may create that Title; but the Duty and Submiſſion is the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the whole Catholique Party; and for the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106777:3"/>
matter of Fact, Books are the preſervers of it, which will for ever record our Innocence, in deſpite of ſuch detraction and calumny.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> the Miniſter is pleas'd to call me, though I had not the happineſs to be bred in their learned Schools: but the trick of this poor man plainly appears, that thus he hopes to make Truth it ſelf ſuſpected, becauſe by the Preaching of ſuch <hi>Paſtors,</hi> the ignorant (as children conſider <hi>Sarazens</hi>) have moſt fond <hi>Ideas</hi> of the Society and of all Prieſts in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> Before I go any farther, I think it moſt neceſſary to tell you what moved me to write that <hi>Pamphlet;</hi> which wken you have well weighed, you will find in the intention, perchance that Piety, which is uſually lodged in an English Heart: and that you may aſſure your ſelves of the ſincerity of my thoughts, Know, that if my Arm was too weak to weild a Sword in the late juſt War, I had then a paſſion to wish my years greater. But though I thus loſt the Honour of laying my life at the feet of the injured Father, I had yet the ſatisfaction to hazard it for the Son, even before and ſince his happy Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. For my neer Relations, they all ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106777:4"/>
in the Common Cauſe, which as it brought death to ſome, ſo to others the ſale of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Eſtates, and the beſt Fortune that any could expect, was to be crowded into the dre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>adful Liſt for Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſition. I am ſure my zeal to the Royal Family has been as forward (to my power) as the beſt, more then which no body certainly can do; nor have I ever been farther Satyrical againſt thoſe that ſtand at Helm, then by innocently ſaying, <hi>We Catholiques are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways moſt unfortunate.</hi> This is the Profeſſion I have lived in, and in the ſame loyal Faith will I end my days. Doubtleſs then I could have no ſiniſter deſign in publiſhing the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy;</hi> the good end I had, let the World con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My first Motive</hi> was the Law of Nature, which gives the Needy leave to call for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: nor was there at any time a Nation ſo cruel, that ever yet denied this favour.</p>
            <p>Could there be a more frightful ſight, then to ſee the whole English World on a ſudden, point and cry, <hi>Fie on them, Fie on them?</hi> What ſcoffing Blaſphemies did the Seditious utter? How did Tenants begin to confront their Landlords? Nay, (omitting ſeveral inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Rabble) I knew ſome Juſtices, by
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106777:4"/>
reaſon of private ſpleen to their Neighbours, ſeize on a Servant, threatning his commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unleſs he made Oath what his Maſter daily did. Thus then in a trice we became an Eye-ſore to our Friends, and a by-word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Common Ennemies.</p>
            <p>But now my Miniſter will nimbly demand, <hi>Is not this accuſing the King, and blaming the whole Parliament for their Advice and Counſel?</hi> To which I anſwer, firſt, with the great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador of Heaven, <hi>God forbid:</hi> Nor is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a man, who would hazard whatever is dear to him on Earth for the glory of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to harbour ſuch thoughts againſt lawful and juſt Authority. Pray, <hi>Maſter Parſon,</hi> let me ask you, Whether Laws in all places are executed by inferiour Officers, according to the intent of the Legiſlator? Remember, Sir, the infinitely wiſe Bill of purging Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and you will find how private revenge converted it into quite another thing. This is a Flayl, againſt which perchance no wiſdom can make defence; but nevertheleſs, 'tis Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and may force a shriek from the oppreſt, without offence to Government.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> I do with all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion acknowledge that Counſellors (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106777:5"/>
the Supream) may adviſe their Soveraign to put Laws in force, without giving a reaſon to the Publick; and moreover, I do farther ſay, that it was mercy that they were till then ſuſpended: yet it is no crime, even when they are revived, humbly to beg for favour. And to illuſtrate this, conſider, I beſeech you, an Example.</p>
            <p>Imagine that his Majeſty being returned, an honeſt Cavalier was reſtored to his Houſe, which with two parts of his Lands lay round about a City, the prime Jewel in the Royal-Diadem. Here the good man ſitting now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his own vine, daily bleſſes God for the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the Nation; and here each moment he conceives fresh joys, by conſidering how ſuperlative his late ſufferings were. If now on a ſudden both Houſes (upon mature delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) should beſeech his Majeſty to make uſe of old Laws, to new fortifie this his moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable place (which conſequently would deſtroy this Subjects Eſtate) no body, I think, could wonder to ſee him amazed and troubled. Suppoſe then, to diuert this ruine, the poor ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should beſeech his friends to intercede, should shew his ſufferings, should urge reaſons that his houſe would be a ſtrength to the Town,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106777:5"/>
and that the Kings Enemies have certainly ſome bad deſign by his calamity. For all this the Prince is no way neceſſitated to grant his requeſt, Becauſe reaſons which ſeem ſtrong to a Party concerned, may yet in themſelves be frivolous, when they are weighed by judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments who know far better the ſtate of things, then private men can be conceived to do. But yet, it were ſevere to indite this man for a Libeller, or ſay (becauſe he begs) that he mutinies againſt Obedience and Rule.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Niniveh</hi> might call for mercy without affronting Heaven, even after ſentence was given; nor has ever the King of Kings, when he punishes, forbad his children to cry, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Abraham, Remember Iſaac, Remember Jacob; O Lord remember the promiſes that thou haſt made of old.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My ſecond Reaſon,</hi> was as a Subject to keep the Peace, and to the utmoſt of my power to prevent all ſtrife and diviſion. This is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation which no ſon of <hi>Adam</hi> can plead ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from: for ſeeing all men are under ſomme Government or other, and Quiet the ſole end of that, everybody muſt uſe the beſt means he can (ſo it contradict not Laws) to preſerve the thing for which Magiſtracy it ſelf
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106777:6"/>
was eſtablished. No Creature, I am ſure, can be ignorant of the diſtraction then in <hi>England:</hi> for he that was in the City, fled to his Farm, frightned with the noiſe of a new fire; and he that got into the Country, poaſted again to Town, to eſcape the Maſſacre, which deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whiſpers dayly threatned.</p>
            <p>If this diſorder was amongſt Proteſtants, what dreadful confuſion muſt you imagine amongſt Catholiques, who are but a handful comparatively to the whole, and yet the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Authors of theſe two Conſpiracies! Was it unbeſeeming then an English Chriſtian to wish a better underſtanding among his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, and to deſire the Royal-Party should not be disjoyned, eſpecially when an Invaſion was menaced by our Confederate Neighbours; and a Rebellion newly broke out within the Circuit of our own Iſland? If remedies were needful, what Medicament could be better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied then the gentle balm of true perſwaſion? By this men ſaw <hi>the Tares which the Enemy ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed whilſt they ſlept;</hi> and thus they began to reknow their often tried friends, deſcended (according to Nature and Grace) from thoſe Anceſtors, who like ſo many <hi>Atlas's</hi> upheld the Grandeur of our Kings, whilſt the whole
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106777:6"/>
World from Eaſt to Weſt admired their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories.</p>
            <p>Conſider then, I beſeech you, (Great Patriots) in whom the Prince of darkneſs reigns; whether in me that am termed a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> and would banish all diſcord from among my Brethren; or in this ſtrange Miniſter, who to ſow Sedition, plows with perverted Storie, and then harrows with downright falſities and untruths.</p>
            <p>How does this poor man rip up old tales of Popes, and by diſcovering his paſſion and fancy, infer, that it is a check to the Glory of Kings, and utter loſs of Soveraignty, to be under the ſpiritual Juriſdiction of this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Bishop? Why do not the Kings of <hi>France, Spain, Portugal</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi> ſee this? How comes it to paſs alſo, that the Emperor (who is Abſolute Monarch of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Boheme</hi>) and the other great Princes of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> are ignorant of a thing of ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment? This I much wonder at indeed, eſpecially ſince their Countries have ſo ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with theſe Reformed Evangeliſts: But it may be they are careleſſe of their intereſt, and ſo is the <hi>ſimple Florentine,</hi> who with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Italian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulets,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:106777:7"/>
want as much wit as they do Authority and Power.</p>
            <p>Theſe Princes, even theſe very laſt, live, as I may ſay, juſt under his Holineſs his Noſe; and yet (when they pleaſe) diſpute about Temporals, not only with Sword in hand, but are ſo abſolute and arbitrary in their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that <hi>England</hi> would groan to bear once in many ages, what their Subjects daily ſuffer.</p>
            <p>Reflecting thus on the premiſes, might not I well wonder in our Apology, how ſo wild a calumny could be laid to our charge, as that our Principles are deſtructive to Soveraignty? Truly, I did wonder, and that not a little, eſpecially ſince our fore-fathers were ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in Religion, and yet our Kings rather Monarchs of <hi>Europe,</hi> then of half an Iſle, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Laws whereſoever they pleaſed. If ſome Popes have been exorbitant, 'tis no more our Faith to believe their actions iuſt, then that humane tranſgreſſions are the true Precepts of Chriſtianity. As ſome wicked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dealt ill with Gods Anointed; ſo on the other ſide, who de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fended theſe Princes againſt pretended illegal impoſitions of <hi>Rome? were they not Papiſts?</hi> Yes, and ſo fervent for that Truth, that the next day they would take the <hi>Croiſado</hi> next

            <p>'Tis no breach in our Religion to ſay, that Popes in their private Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations may erre, much leſs, that they ſin like men. A Pope and Council in matters of Faith I confeſs Infallible; and therefore I look upon the Decrees of <hi>Trent,</hi> as divine as thoſe of <hi>Nice:</hi> nor were there, I am ſure, more tricks againſt Proteſtants pretended in this, then in the former againſt the ſtrong and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous <hi>Arrians.</hi> No man abominates Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latick inſolencies more then I: Bring out then the Glorious Roll, and upon examination you will find, that our braveſt Catholique Princes have been the beſt ſons of the Church: nor is yet a King by our Tenets the worſe Child for defending his Rights and Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. <hi>Caeſar muſt have what is Caeſars,</hi> and <hi>to God we muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>Shall Notions then convince Experience, when as Demonſtration it ſelf often gives way to Practice? Let us now ſummon for witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to this great Truth, the preſent Kings of our Profeſſion; and though their thoughts towre far higher then Eagles, they will not only deride the contrary, but unanimouſly proclaim, that their people are not rebellious

by reaſon of Eccleſiaſtical dependence abroad, nor do they think themſelves leſs abſolute then that very Prince, who cries, <hi>There ought to be no other Pope then Me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What shall I ſay then to ſuch a man, who will yet affirm our Principles inconſiſtent with Obedience? To adviſe him to <hi>Anticyra</hi> is vain, for no <hi>Ellebore</hi> can purge that madneſs, which firſt taking root by ignorance, has afterward been quite transformed, through intereſt, into an obſtinate, and ſelfdeceiving wilfulneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> As malice has forced the Anſwerer thus ill to apply his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſo alſo it hath ſtained his face with ſo deep a dye, that now he blushes at nothing, nor regards any more whatever he ſays. Well might I have pardoned him his rude upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>That our ſufferings were but Duties,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a real Truth: yet no Subject takes pleaſure in the ſound, when in rancour and deſpite it is uſed againſt him. I ſay, well might I with ſilence have ſwallowed this, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwards I was to hear him with impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce proclaim, That Papiſts were forc'd to their bravery, and like a hard-hunted-Deer, we threw our ſelves into the Herd, glad to be sheltered under the Royal covert. Glad, we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſs, as Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106777:8"/>
men graſp the occaſion of expreſſing zeal; but that we could not ſit quietly at home, I flatly here deny: nay, day is not clearer then this, that had not our Loyalty forbad, we might with triumph have been received even into the very embraces of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>Had this Miniſter peruſed Books any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then their <hi>Indices</hi> againſt Catholiques, he would have ſeen, that let Rebels declare what they will, they'll ſoon find excuſes, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickly make uſe of thoſe very things (when tis for their advantage) againſt which in the beginning they openly profeſt. Was not <hi>Godlineſs, Godlineſs,</hi> the cry of all the Saints? yet becauſe dexterity was needful, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into their league <hi>H. Martin</hi> and others, who were then as notorious for their Vices, as afterwards eminent in all the abominations of the Land.</p>
            <p>Again, if the Papiſts were purſued, againſt <hi>Bishops</hi> there was as fierce a Chaſe; and ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Prelacy</hi> were continually plac'd in the ſame <hi>Parentheſis.</hi> For my part, I belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve the <hi>English Epiſcopacie</hi> ſtuck more in their ſtomacks then we; becauſe Hereticks hate moſt that Religion which is but one remove above them, and from which they are ever

iuſtly taxt rebelliouſly to have gone out. Beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, the Catholikes (being of a Faith for which the People had a prejudice) could no ways obſtruct the Reformation, which they ſo earneſtly intended. 'Tis plain then, againſt <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats</hi> they had as great, if not a greater Pique: yet when it conduced to the reducing of <hi>North Wales,</hi> and ſubduing of Sir <hi>John Owen,</hi> they made commander of their Forces not onely a <hi>Bishop,</hi> but an Arch- bishop alſo, I mean (that <hi>real Chimaera</hi>) his graceleſs <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why do I trouble you with theſe proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble arguments to prove the poſsibility of our reception, when as the matter of fact is certain, not done in a corner, but in the Palace of a King, and in the ſight of all his Nobles? Sir <hi>Arthur Aston,</hi> a Catholick of Quality and Experience, offered our late Souveraign his ſervice, and the ſervice of many more, upon the firſt preparations of War. The good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce ſincerely gave him thanks; but told him, that by reaſon of their <hi>Religion,</hi> he durſt not admit them into the Army: for the Rebels (who never omitted a pretence), would make uſe of this, to diſcredit him among the people. This Knight being refuſed thus, rode in all haſte to <hi>London,</hi> and made the like tender to <hi>Eſſex.</hi> The Earl upon
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106777:9"/>
the propoſal conſults the <hi>Cabal,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently adviſed him to accept the offer; and ſo a formal Commiſſion was given Sir <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur.</hi> He immediately poſted back to the Court, and there shewed the Commiſſion to his Majeſtie; which when he ſaw, and together with it the Intrigue of theſe Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers, he not onely gave Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but from that time declared all Catholicks welcome, who thereupon from every Quarter haſtned to his help and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour.</p>
            <p>The Deſignes which the Rebels had herein, were many: for by this they not onely hoped to get to themſelves a Party well verſed in War, great in Bloud, and of Eſtates anſwerable to that Bloud; but alſo were ſure at the ſame inſtant to weaken as much the King, as they brought ſtren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gth to themſelves: and beſides, they far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſidered, that this might adde a gloſs to their proceedings abroad, becauſe all Neighbouring Princes (being Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques) would then probably look on their actions with a more partial eye. <hi>Scripture</hi> alſo, which is the ſtalking-horſe of all Sects, could not be wanting to them, who
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106777:10"/>
had already, with a <hi>Curſe ye Meroz,</hi> invited all to Rebellion. That very Example might have been a Warrant, that the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; Profane may joyn in a Confederation.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> Thus ſtood our Caſe, and thus are we now reviled by a Miniſter, after ſuch true and faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices: Yes, ſo Loyal have we been, that I defie all mankinde to shew one that was falſe, unleſs perchance thoſe that renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their God, and shaking hands with Religion, were owned as Converts by the people.

            <p>Certainly, nothing can more fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the ſincere and diſintereſted meaning of the Catholiques, then the Kings miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Eſcape from <hi>Worceſter:</hi> for he fell not there into the hands of men of Qualitie onely, but among Papiſts of all ranks and conditions. There were <hi>Prieſts,</hi> there were <hi>Trades-men,</hi> there were <hi>Labourers,</hi> there were <hi>old women,</hi> there were <hi>young,</hi> fully acquainted with his miſery: and though at the ſame time death was proclaimed to the Concealer, and to the Diſcoverer a reward (able to make a poor man <hi>Emperour</hi> in his own thoughts) yet no danger, no gain could make them betray him, whom by their Faith they were commanded to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal. Men of education and parts may ſometimes have by deſignes, even in the beſt of their doings; but they of low degree
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106777:11"/>
(being unacquainted with the artifices of the World) declare the full reality of their hearts, having nothing lodged there, but the religious Principles, which from their youth they received from their Ghoſtly Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> I muſt here conjure you not to put any forc'd inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation upon my words: for I do not now Apologize for any Extravagancies done by our Predeceſſours in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Reformation; onely let me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you to look on their Caſe at that time with the gentleſt aſpect that may be. Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght of temptation may perchance move pitie in Magiſtrates, though not pervert their Juſtice: and let me deſire him that will judge, to lay his hand on his owne breſt, and truly examine there, what he himſelf would do in this condition.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106777:14"/>
for that's a double death to men of Honour, to have their Enemies not onely Accuſers, but their inſulting Judges alſo.

            <p>Of all Calumnies againſt Catholicks, we have admired at none ſo much, as that their Principles are ſaid to be inconſiſtent with Government, and they themſelves thought ever prone to Rebellion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> Had this been a new Sect not known before, ſomething perchance might have been doubted: but to lay this at their doors, that have governed the Civilized World, is the Miracle of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to us.</p>

Be pleaſed that <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth be remembred alſo, who did thoſe Wonders of which the whole World does ſtill reſound; and certainly all History will agree in this, that 'twas <hi>Old Caſtle</hi> he feared, and not thoſe that believed the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> to be Head of the Church. We will no longer trouble you with putting you in minde of any more of our mighty Kings, who have been feared ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>road, and as ſafe at home as any ſince the Reformation of Religion. We shall onely adde this, that if Popery be the enſlaving of Princes, <hi>France</hi> ſtill believes it ſelf as abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te as <hi>Denmark</hi> or <hi>Sweden:</hi> nor will ever the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> abjure the Pope, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themſelves of the fidelity of their Subiects.

               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> We know who were the Authors of this laſt Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and how generouſly you ſtrove against the raging Torrent; nor have we any other ends to remember you of it, but to shew that all Religions may have a corrupted ſpawn, and that God hath been pleaſed to permit ſuch a Rebellion which our progenitors never ſaw, to convince you perchance (whom for ever may he proſper) that Popery is not the only Source of Treaſon.</p>
            <p>Little did we think (when your Prayers and ours were offered up to beg a Bleſſing on the Kings Affairs) ever to ſee that day, in which <hi>Carlos, Gifford, Whitgrave,</hi> and the <hi>Pendrels</hi> should be punished by your deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res for that Religion, which obliged them to ſave their forlorn Prince; and a ſtigmatized man (for his offences against King and Church) a chief promoter of it. Nay, leſs did

we imagine, that by your Votes <hi>Hudleſtone</hi> might be hanged, who again ſecured our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign; and others free in their fat poſſeſſions, that ſat as Judges, and ſealed the Execution of that great Prince of happy Memory. We confeſs, we are unfortunate, &amp; you juſt Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dges, whom with our lives we will ever main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to be ſo; nor are we ignorant the neceſſity of affairs made the King and you do things, which formerly you could not ſo much as fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: yet give us leave to ſay we are ſtill Loyal; nay, to deſire you to believe ſo, and to remember how <hi>ſynonymous</hi> (under the late Rebellion) was the word Papiſt and Cavalier; for there was no Papist that was not deemed a Caualier, nor no Caualier that was not call'd a Papiſt, or at leaſt thought to be Popishly affected.</p>
            <p>We know, though we differ ſomething in Religion, (the truth of which let the last day judge) yet none can agree with your inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or are fitter for your converſe then we; for as we have as much birth among us as <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> can boaſt of, ſo our breeding leans your way both in Court and Camp. And therefore had not our late Sufferings united us in that firm tie, yet our like humors must needs have joyned our hearts. If we erre, pity our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106777:16"/>
and remember what your great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors were; and make ſome difference between us that have twice converted <hi>England</hi> from Paganiſm, and thoſe other Sects that can chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge nothing but intruſion for their impoſed Authority.</p>
            <p>But't is generally ſaid, That Papiſts cannot live without perſecuting all other Religions within their reach.</p>
            <p>We confeſs, where the name of Protestant is unknown, the Catholick Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes (believing it erronious) do uſe all endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to keep it out: Yet in thoſe Countreys where Liberty is given, they have far more Priviledges then we under any Reformed Government whatſoever. To be short, we will only inſtance <hi>France</hi> for all, where they have publick Churches, where they can ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke what Proſelytes they pleaſe, and where 't is not againſt Law to be in any Charge or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. Now <hi>Holland,</hi> which permits every thing gives us 'tis true our Lives and Eſtates, but takes away alle Truſt and Rule, and leaves us alſo in danger of the Scout, whenſoever he pleaſes to moleſt our Meetings.</p>
            <p>Becauſe we have named <hi>France,</hi> the Maſſacre will perchance be urged againſt us.

But the World muſt know that was a Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net-Plot, condemned as wicked by Catholick Writers there, and of other Countries alſo. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it cannot be thought they were murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for being Proteſtants, ſince 'twas their powerful Rebellion (let their Faith have been what it would) that drew them into that ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machinated destruction.</p>
            <p>May it not as well be ſaid in the next Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Kings Reign, that the Duke of <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe,</hi> ande Cardinal (Heads of the League) were killed for their Religion alſo? Now no body is ignorant, that 't was their factious Authority, which made that jealous Prince deſign their deaths, though by unwarrantable means.</p>
            <p>If it were for Doctrine that the <hi>Hugonots</hi> ſuffered in <hi>France,</hi> this haughty Monaroh would ſoon destroy them now, having neither Force nor Towns to reſiſt his Might and Puiſſance. They yet live free enough, being even Members of Parliament; and may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Kings Brother too, if he thinks fit to be ſo. Thus you may ſee how well Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants live in a Popish Country under a Popish King: Nor was <hi>Charlemaign</hi> more Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick then this; for though he contends ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metimes
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106777:17"/>
with the Pope, 'tis not of Faith, but about <hi>Gallicane</hi> Priviledges, which perchance he may very lawfully do. Judge then, Worthy Patriots, who are the beſt uſed, and conſider our hardship here in <hi>England,</hi> where 'tis not only a Fine for hearing Maſs, but death to the Maſter for having a Prieſt in his houſe; and ſo far we are from preferment, that by Law we cannot come within ten mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of <hi>London;</hi> all which we know your great Mercy will never permit you to exact.</p>
            <p>It has been often urged, that our miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> and King <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes's</hi> time, were the cauſe of our punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>We earneſtly wish that the Party had had more patience under that Princeſs: But pray conſider (though we excuſe not their faults) whether it was not a Question har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then that of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter</hi> (the cauſe of a War of ſuch length, and death of ſo many Princes) who had most right, Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en <hi>Elizabeth</hi> or <hi>Mary Stuart.</hi> For ſince the whole Kingdom had crowned and ſworn Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance to Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> they owned her as the legitimate daughter to <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Eighth;</hi> and therefore 'twas thought neceſſarily to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106777:17"/>
follow by many, that if <hi>Mary</hi> was the true Child, <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was the Natural, which muſt needs give way to the thrice noble Queen of Scots. 'Twas for the Royal Houſe of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> that they ſuffered in thoſe days, and 'tis for the ſame illustrious Family we are ready to hazard all on any occaſion. Nor can the conſequence of the former procedure be but ill, if a <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Eighth</hi> (whom <hi>Sir W. Rawleigh</hi> and my Lord <hi>Cherbury,</hi> two famous Proteſtants, have ſo homely charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terized) should after twenty years co-habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, turn away his wife, and this out of ſcruple of Conſcience (as he ſaid) when as Hiſtory declares, that he never ſpared woman in his lust, nor man his fury.</p>
            <p>Now for the fifth of <hi>Nove<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber,</hi> with ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds lifted up to Heaven, we abominate and deteſt, and from the botto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our hearts, ſay, may they fall into irrecoverable perdition, who propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate that faith by the blood of Kings, which is to be planted in truth and meekneſs only. But let it not diſpleaſe <hi>(Men, Brethren, and Fathers)</hi> if we ask whether <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> be no better known? or who has forgot the Plots of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> framed in his Cloſet, not only to deſtroy many faithful Cavaliers; but alſo
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106777:18"/>
to put a luſtre upon his Intelligence, as if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be done without his knowledge? Even ſo did the then great Miniſter, who drew ſome few ambitious, men into this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration, and then diſcovered it by a Miracle. This will eaſily appear, <hi>viz.</hi> how little the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Party underſtood the deſign, ſeeing there were not a ſcore of guilty found, though all imaginable induſtry was uſed by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Lords, and Privy Councel too. But ſuppoſe (<hi>my Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> which never can be granted) that all the Papists of that age were conſenting, Will you be ſo ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re then to still punish the Children for their Fathers faults? Nay, ſuch Children that ſo unanimouſly joyned with you in that glorious Quarrel, wherein you and we underwent ſuch ſufferings, that needs we muſt have all ſunk, had not our mutual love aſſisted.</p>
            <p>What have we done, that we should now deſerve your Anger? Has the Indiſcretion of ſome few incenſt you? 'Tis true, that is the thing Objected.</p>
            <p>Do not you know an Enemy may eaſily mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake a Maſs-Bell, for that which calls to Dinner; or a Sequeſtrator glad to be affronted being Conſtable? when 'twas the hatred to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106777:18"/>
his perſon, and not preſent Office, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance egg'd a rash man to folly. We dare with ſubmiſſion ſay, let a publick Invitation be put up againſt any Party whatſoever; nay, againſt the Reverend Bishops themſelves, and ſome malicious Informer or other will alledge that which may be far better to conceal. Yet all mankind by a Manifeſto on the Houſe-door are encouraged to accuſe us; Nor are they upon Oath, though your Enemies and ours take all for granted and true.</p>
            <p>It cannot be imagined, where there are ſo many men of heat and youth (overjoy'd with the happy Restauration of their Prince, and remembring the Inſolencies of the former Grandees) that they should all, at all times prudently carry themſelves; for this would be more then men: And truly we eſteem it as a particular bleſſing, that God has not ſuffer'd many, through vanitie or frailty to fall into greater faults, ther are yet as we underſtand laid to our charge.</p>
            <p>Can we chuſe but be diſmay'd (when all things fail) that extravagant Crimes are fathered on us? It is we that muſt be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, ſome ſay, of firing the Citie, even we that have loſt ſo vaſtly by it. Yet truly in this
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106777:19"/>
our ingenuity is great, ſince we think it no Plot, though our Enemie, an <hi>Hugonot</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant acknowledged the fact, and was iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly executed for his vain Confeſſion. Again, if a Merchant of the Church of <hi>England</hi> buy Knives for the buſineſs of his Trade, this alſo preſently is a Popish contriuance to destroy the well-affected.</p>
            <p>We muſt a little complain, finding it by experience, that by reaſon you diſcontenance us, the people rage: and again, becauſe they rage, we are the more forſaken by you. Aſſured we are that our Converſation is affable, and our Houſes ſo many hoſpitable receipts to our Neighbours. Our acquaintance therefore we fear at no time, but it is the ſtranger we dread (that taking all on hear ſay) zealouſly wounds, and then examines the buſineſs when 'tis too late, or is perchance confirmed by another, that knows no more of us then he himſelf.</p>
            <p>'Tis to you we muſt make our applications, beſeeching you (as Subjects tender of our King) to intercede for us in the execution, and weigh the <hi>Dilemma,</hi> which doubtleſs he is in, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to deny ſo good a Parliament their requeſt, or elſe run counter to his Royal inclinations, when he punishes the weak and harmleſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:106777:19"/>

Why may not we, Noble Country-men, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe for favour from you, as well as the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants find from theirs? A greater duty then ours none could expreſs, we are ſure. Or <hi>why</hi> should the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> and other Magiſtrates (that are harsh both in mind and manners) refrain from violence againſt our 

Religion, and your, tender breaſts ſeem not to harbour the leaſt compaſſion or pity? Theſe neighboring people ſequeſtrer none for their Faith, but for tranſgreſſion againſt the State; Nor is the whole party involved in the crime of a few, but every man ſuffers for his own and proper fault. Do you then the like, and he that offends let 

him die without mercy, And think always (we beſeech you) of <hi>Cromwels</hi> injustice, who for the actions of ſome against his pretended Laws, drew thouſands into Decimation (even ignorant of the thing) after they had vaſtlie paid for their ſecuritie and quiet.</p>
            <p>We have no ſtudie but the Glory of our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, and juſt libertie of the Subjects; nor was it a mean argument of our dutie, when every Catholique Lord gave his voice for the Reſtoration of Bishops; by which we could pretend no other advantage, but that 26. Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106777:20"/>
(ſubſisting wholly by the Crown) were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the defence of Kingship, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a check to all Anarchy and confuſion.</p>
            <p>'Tis morally impoſſible, but that we, who approve of Monarhy in the Church, muſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be fond of it in the State alſo. Yet this is a misfortune we now plainly feel, that the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the late tranſgreſſors live, the more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten are their crimes, whilſt distance in time calls the faults of our Fathers to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and buries our own Allegeance in eternal Oblivion and forgetfulneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> Conſider we beſeech you, the ſad condition of the <hi>Irish</hi> Souldiers now in <hi>England,</hi> the worſt of which Nation could be but intentionallie ſo wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cked, as the acted villanie of many <hi>English,</hi> whom your admired Clemencie pardoned. Remember how they left the <hi>Spanish</hi> ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce when they heard their King was in <hi>France;</hi> and how they forſook the emploiment of that unnatural Prince, after he had committed that never to be forgotten act of banishing his distreſſed Kinſman out of his Dominions. Theſe poor men left all again to bring their Monarch to his home, and shall they then he forgotten by You? Or, shall my Lord <hi>Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glas</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:106777:20"/>
and his brave <hi>Scots</hi> be left to their shifts; who ſcorn'd to receive Wages of thoſe that have declared War againſt <hi>England?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How commonly is it ſaid, That the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ath of renouncing their Religion is intended for theſe? which will needs bring this loſs to the King and you, that either you will force all of our Faith to lay down their Arms (though by experience, of great integrity and worth) or elſe, if ſome few you retain, they are ſuch whom Neceſſity has made to ſwear against Conſcience, and who therefore will certainly betray you, when a greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage shall be offered. By this teſt then, you can have none but whom with caution you ought to shun, and thus muſt you drive away thoſe that truly would ſerve you; for had they the leaſt thought of being falſe, they would gladly take the advantage of gain and pay, to deceive you.</p>
            <p>We know your wiſdom and generoſity, and therefore cannot imagine ſuch a thing. Nor do we doubt when you shew favour to theſe, but you will uſe mercy to us, who are both fellow-Subjects, and your owen flesh and blood alſo. If you forſake us, we must ſay, the world decays, and its final tranſmutation
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106777:21"/>
muſt needs quickly follow.</p>
            <p>Little do you think the inſolencies we shall ſuffer by Committee-men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whom chance and lot has put in to petty power. Nor will it chuſe but grieve you, to ſee them abuſed (whom formerly you loved.) even by the Common Enemy of us both. When they punish, how will they triumph and ſay. Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke this (poor <hi>Romaniſts</hi>) for your love to King ship; and again, this for your long doa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the Royal Party; all which you shall receive from us, Commiſſioned by your deareſt friends, and under this cloak we will gladly vent our private ſpleen and malice.</p>
            <p>We know, <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> that from your hearts you do deplore our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet permit us to tell you, your bravery must extend thus far, as not to ſit still with pity only, but each is to labour for the diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as far as in reality his ablity will reach: ſome muſt beſeech our Gracious Soveraign for us, others muſt again undeceive the Good, though deluded Multitude. Therefore all are to remember who are the prime raiſers of the Storm, and how through our ſides they would wound both the KING and You; for though their hatred to our ſelves is great,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106777:21"/>
yet the enmity out of all meaſure encreaſes, becauſe we have been yours (and ſo shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue) even in the fiery day of trial.</p>
            <p>Protect us we entreat you then upon all your former Promiſes, or if that be not ſufficient, for the ſakes of thoſe that loſt their Estates with you; many of which are now fallen a ſleep. But if this be ſtill too weak, we muſt conjure you by the ſight of this Bloody Catalogue, which contains the Names of your mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Friends and Relations, who in the heat of Battail, perchance ſaved many of your Lives, even with the joyful loſs of their own.</p>

            <p>ABout the middle of <hi>Novem.</hi> 1666. when the known Enemies of the Kingdom had enflamed the minds of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral honeſt and well-meaning people, I put out this ſincere Apology. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons therein (having nothing but truth and reallity in them) ſatisfied many: for every body of themſelves ſaw there was no ground, and moſt confeſt they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered becauſe they ſaw others ſo. 'Twas after <hi>Christmas</hi> before I left <hi>London;</hi> and truly, I ſuppos'd that if any body could be ſo malitiouſly impertinent, as by an Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to cavil at ſo innocent a thing, he would have done it in two moneths, it being but a sheet of Paper againſt which he was to write; and then (being neer at
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106777:22"/>
hand) I should have been as quick in my Reply. Though the worthy Anſwerer took much more time for his ſolid Piece, yet in the interval mine was egregiouſly confuted: Nor was ever <hi>Gonvil</hi>'s plain Teſtament ſo tore and repiec'd as this Pamphlet, by the wiſe and numerous Aſſailants. One ſaid, that the whole thing was harmleſs and reaſonable; but that <hi>Magna Charta ſeemed to be ſtruck at.</hi> His fellow anſwered, that <hi>Magna Charta</hi> was <hi>Magna Farta,</hi> and of it ſelf Popish; and that all was well, <hi>had not Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth been abuſed.</hi> To this a third anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was now no more to them then <hi>William Rufus,</hi> and all that was ſaid was out of Proteſtant Hiſtory; but the only thing he blamed was, <hi>that the fifth of Nov.</hi> (which was ſtill a Feſtival) <hi>was defamed, and conſequently they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves jeer'd at in their Annual obſervation.</hi> At him another preſently laugh'd, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kt, whether any people ever reverenc'd a Solemnity againſt themſelves: for his own part, he cared not whether the Papiſts were guilty or not, let them look to that; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was ſufficiently ſatisfied with the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106777:23"/>
Apology, <hi>had the Catalogue been omitted of thoſe that died in the War:</hi> for by it, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as if the whole Royal Army were Papiſts, becauſe ſo many Popish Officers, and men of great Condition, were killed in that Service. To this a Neighbour ſaid, that he knew many more of the Party, then were mentioned, that thus fell for their Allegiance; and that it was hard, that ſo cheap recompence should be denied men for their lives: but the ſole thing which he ſtumbled at, <hi>was the timing &amp; publication of it.</hi> Againſt whom the whole Company concluded, <hi>that if ever the time was fit,</hi> 'twas <hi>then when the flame appeared, and that't would have been ridiculous to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logize, when there was no ſtir or clamour.</hi> Thus have I been vindicated by my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenders, and thus have I both read and ſeen in matters of Religion, where the ſeveral Antagoniſts have ſolved the Popish difficulties themſelves.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> Reader (as I ſaid before) I not only went out of Town, but have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince been many ſcore of miles diſtant from it, which is the cauſe I ſaw not this Anſwer ſo ſoon as otherwiſe I should have
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:106777:23"/>
done: at laſt it was ſent me by a Proteſtant Gentleman who had ſeen the Apology be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was printed. When I had read it, I began to admire, not only at the malice of the thing, but alſo at the weakneſs of the man, that thus needleſly took up the Cudgels. Who the Author is, to this day I know not; nor can any man deſire his Acquaintance, unleſs it be to ſay, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve ſeen the Eighth Wiſe man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I do not ſay, that he may not be a man of Wit; but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, I am ſure, he is neither of Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gment nor Principles.</p>
            <p>For had he been a Royalliſt, he would have had more Gratitude and good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then to have forgotten faithful friends in a ſtorm, and added (as he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped) fuel to the flame, when we were underhand beſpattred by Enemies to us both. Nor was there any drift in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology, but to ſettle a Diſtemper, raiſed without either cauſe or reaſon.</p>
            <p>A Presbyterian I can never think him, becauſe they being men of depth and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, know that the effects of their crying againſt Papiſts in 1640. are too fresh in memory; nor can it be an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:106777:24"/>
for them to haraſs mens Conſciences, while their own are within reach of Law.</p>
            <p>I can alſo as little fancy that an Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant, or any real member of that many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed and uncompacted Body, could ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly by writing wish a Perſecution for Religion, being them ſelves obnoxious upon all accounts; and if ſeverity should univerſally fall, they cannot imagine but that men of Birth, men of Breeding, men of Loyalty, muſt needs at all times find more friends then they. Who he is, God knows, a man of Principles (as I ſaid) I am ſure he is not, nor do I doubt but his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs will at laſt find its reward: and ſince he has called me <hi>Turk,</hi> and worſe, as you shall ſee by and by, I ſuppoſe he will not take it amiſs, if I ſpeak my thoughts, <hi>viz.</hi> that though he carps in a Miniſters Dialect, yet doubtleſs he is a <hi>Jew</hi> of the Dukes Place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> When I received this Anſwer, both by my Letters and Friends neer me, I was perſwaded not to reply, becauſe it had no force in it ſelf, nor had any applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe at <hi>London.</hi> I could not upon this infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation but aſſent; but now lately I have
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106777:24"/>
been awak'd by a new occaſion. I had ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me days ago ſent me a Pamphlet, called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>A Diſcourſe of the Religion of England;</hi> a ſimpler thing was never yet writ, I am ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re; and take this for a proof, for he ſays a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many hundred of his ſilly things, that <hi>Holland, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Geneva</hi> brought in the Reformed Religion without Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. He has been well whipt by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, but deſerves much more. For <hi>Scroop</hi> was excepted out of the Act of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion, and hanged, for excuſing to Sir <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Brown</hi> after mercy, inſtead of being contrite for his crime: yet this man that owns himſelf a Presbyterian (which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as much as that my Miniſter was a Cavalier) ſays, The <note n="a" place="margin">c. 20. p. 40.</note> 
               <hi>Non-conformiſts were only eager Aſſertors of Legal Liberties.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Chapters of his Treatiſe are againſt Papiſts, and all taken out of the <hi>Anſwerer of the Apology:</hi> therefore ſince I find it hath weight in the opinion of one, leſt more weak Brethren should fall, I thought fit to take ſome pains thus to remove the cauſe.</p>
            <p>I was forced to go the inſipid way of Section by Section, well knowing that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106777:25"/>
ſome people not finding the Solution to follow the Objection, would ſooner haeſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and doubt Inſipid; I call this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, becauſe there is no art or contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce in it; nor is it poſſible but the beſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in the World muſt be then frigidly ſtiff, when the Adverſary in the Paragraph has no Spirit in him. I have not Printed the Anſwer verbatim, for that would be too tedious, but have ſo contracted it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I challenge the Author himſelf to find any thing left out, that might have added force to the Argument. The Books I uſe in Citations are all Proteſtant, except <hi>Davi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah,</hi> impartial, as the reformed confeſs: for though he is acknowledged to be a Creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re and adorer of <hi>Katherine de Medices,</hi> yet concerning her he ſpeaks home, even in many private intrigues, which might ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve been well omitted. Him only I quote about the <hi>Hugonots</hi> Rebellion; but their actions are ſo villanouſly notorious, that any Author shall be-ſufficient for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>I muſt needs ſay, I have had no little trouble in this Compoſition, fearing the Bulk would be voluminous; for by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106777:25"/>
I hate ſuperfluities and always ſtrive to crowd my matter into the narroweſt room imaginable. In this Work I had ſtill the diſguſtful vexation, how to omit, and yet be ſtill intelligible: For I dare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, had I writ all I could upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and followed to the utmoſt the diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious digreſſions of the Anſwerer, I should have ſwell'd to the bigneſs of any Folio extant. I have nevertheleſs paſt by nothing material; and hope this thin Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavo will be both uſeful and ſatisfactory to you, ſince it contains <hi>the whole accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in practice, charged upon the English Catholicks;</hi> I have urged nothing (as I ſaid before) but what I prove out of the Record of a violent <hi>Protestant,</hi> or a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral deduction from it: and that you may upon occaſion find each particular matter, here follow the Contents themſelves in order.</p>

Nor did thoſe Monarchs thinke themſelves in a worſe condition for this Ordination. Moreover we never heard that any Catholique King ſince ever did Proteſt, or exclaim againſt the Councel; which doubtleſs they would have done, had they been in any dangerby it.

if the Princes and States (that own themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves Chriſtians) should now in an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly agree (by reaſon they ſaw <hi>Judaiſm</hi> or <hi>Turciſm</hi> encreaſing) that every one of them muſt do what he could to hinder this growth, and in caſe any was found favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, his Dominions should be given to another.

                  <p>What therefore was here ordered, was to oblige the Kings, who by compact ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledg'd the procedure; and 'twas alſo imagined, that ſucceeding Catholique Princes would be more careful to keep their people from error, when they should call to mind that this was agreed to <hi>in a Councel where the East and West met,</hi> (<note n="a" place="margin">Matt.

                  <p>Concerning King <hi>John,</hi> I have told you before, that Popes as private Doctors may err, nay it is not certaine, that without a Councel they are infallible even in their interpretations of faith; much more ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are liable to err in their actions.

                  <p>To this I ſay, Let the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> anſwer for their own Doctrine, for I am ſure they are of age, and able alſo; neither did they ever tell me otherwiſe, but that I might reject ſuch and the like opinions, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only the private fancies of ſome of their Order. It has never been my ſtudy to pore upon Schoolmen, nor is it worth my pains now to ſearch Libraries, whether they have ſaid ſo or no; which truly I do very much doubt of.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:106777:43"/>
Kings would then hate them; when as on the contrary we ſee all Princes careſs them, and make them their <hi>Confeſſors.</hi> At this time the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> are in this Office to the <hi>Emperor,</hi> the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> the King of <hi>France,</hi> the Queen Regent of <hi>Spain,</hi> the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and as I take it, to the now King of <hi>Portugal;</hi> for they belonged thus to the late old <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen</hi> of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: the Dukes of <hi>Bavary, Newburgh,</hi> and many other great Princes of Germany are alſo their Penitents; all which conſidered, I muſt look upon <hi>Jeſuites</hi> in general to be faithfuller Subjects then Proteſtants ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; for <hi>Kings</hi> though <hi>Papiſts</hi> are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways fools. But, ſuppoſe <hi>Jeſuites</hi> were Villains; what is that to the Catholick Faith? muſt <hi>Cambridge</hi> be <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the <hi>English</hi> Religion falſe, becauſe the Me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of one Colledge (ſuppoſe <hi>Emanuel</hi>) were thought knaves and hypocrites?</p>
                  <p>The other Divines and Canoniſts whom the Miniſter urges, are <hi>Baronius, Bertrand; Lancelotus, Peron, Roſſaeus,</hi> who ſay (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his citations) things to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me purpoſe about depoſing of Kings.</p>
                  <p>All this put together, <hi>Reader,</hi> is the force of his Argument. The Objection ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

Councels and Bulls, you ſee is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; about Divines I have already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you a touch, but now I will handle it a little fuller.

In the like manner Caſuiſts (thinking it a diſgrace not to be able to anſwer ſomething to whatever can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed) treat in their Books about all Caſes which their nimble fancies can ſtart.

Thanks be to God, there is no danger of a breach between <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>France in matters of Faith;</hi> for (as the very <hi>Gazets</hi> told us <hi>An.</hi> 1664) when the <hi>French</hi> Army was in <hi>Italy, The King</hi> (having owned the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of <hi>Janſenius) even then ſent to the Pope to proſecute the Janſeniſts in France.

                  <p>And by the way, <hi>Reader,</hi> be pleaſed to remember, that had not this King of ours deſtroyed Religious Houſes, all the truly devout Sectaries at preſent would have vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily been cloiſter'd there, who now diſtract both the Kingdom &amp; themſelves; for having no quiet place to vent that zeal which boyls within, they become a prey to

                  <p>To this I reply, That the <hi>Spaniard</hi> being now in actual poſſeſſion, can as well defend theſe places (were he a Proteſtant) as <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan, Flanders,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which are not the Popes gift;</hi> or as well as other Reformed Princes have done their Countries. And for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects being Papiſts, that is nothing, <hi>For all ſubjects before Luthers time were Papists alſo.</hi> The Miniſter therefore grants me here all that from the firſt I deſired. For if our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Kings were conſiderable abroad, and as ſafe at home, as ſince the change of Religion: If the King of <hi>France</hi> be as abſolute as <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marck</hi> or <hi>Sweden;</hi> and if the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> cannot better ſecure the fidelity of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects by becoming Proteſtants, then by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing Papiſts: I ſay, it muſt neceſſarily follow, That Kings and Kingdoms by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:106777:53"/>
Papiſts are not leſs abſolute then if Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: and by the ſame Conſequence, their Subjects not one whit faithfuller to their Lords by being Proteſtants, then if they we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Papiſts. Tell me then, where is the Temporal advantage of Reformation? and whether our Anſwerer has not bauld long in vain; ſince he now by this grants me, that Kings may be abſolute, and Subjects faithful under Popery: and yet lately he affirmed, That Popery is inconſiſtent with Government, by reaſon of Princes depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on the <hi>Pope</hi> in Eccleſiaſtical matters; and that all <hi>Papists</hi> are prone to Rebellion, <hi>by the Determination of our Councels, Bulls and Divines.</hi>

                  <p>But the Miniſter ſays, What is all this to <hi>England,</hi> where Prince and people are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants? I anſwer, 'tis thus much to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> That now it is plain, 'tis an errour that Popery is inconſiſtent with Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and it alſo shews that Princes get no power (in the long-run) by reforming, but on the contrary, perpetual diſorders follow.

                  <p>After the Rebels had trampled down Monarchy, and enſlaved the whole Nation by force; it happened that a Lay-Gentleman (with whom I have no manner of acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but have heard him ever eſteemed of much wit and integrity) ſeeing the then ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Grandees pretend by their Principles to be againſt all Perſecution for Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce; thought it would not diſoblige the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques or any body elſe, if he ſtickled a little for a private Toleration. The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Cavaliers had many daily Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:106777:64"/>
at <hi>London,</hi> which, the conſtancy and courage of Dr. <hi>Wild,</hi> Dr. <hi>Gunning,</hi> Dr. <hi>Thriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſſ,</hi> &amp;c. (with ſome ſweet words alſo) forc'd the Rebels to a kind of connivence at; but the Papiſts could not follow the ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod: For whereas the Proteſtant Miniſters (if the Governement had on a ſudden fell to ſeverity) knew they should be but car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the <hi>White Hart,</hi> or at moſt impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for a day or two; a Popish Prieſt was ſure to be hanged, and all his Auditory fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neable alſo by the known Laws of the Land. This Gentleman therefore, to try the pulſe of the Rebels, that juggled in all their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, writ two Books, called the <hi>Firſt and Second Moderators:</hi> the thing in it ſelf could not be diſcommended; but for the wording, he (I mean the Author) is to anſwer for it. The Books I have not by me, but you may be ſure the Miniſter has quoted the worſt things in them; and I queſtion not a little whether all be true he mentions, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving already found him falſe, as you ſee in many particulars.</p>
                  <p>I need not vindicate the Gentleman, for he can do it himſelf to the purpoſe: My bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſ at preſent only is to admire the folly of my Adverſary, who hand over head lays
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:106777:65"/>
as a crime, the indiſcretion (which is the moſt that can be ſaid of it) of a private man to all his Party. Would not this Logick then make the whole Church of <hi>England guilty of Phanatick Principles,</hi> becauſe Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> writ for <hi>liberty of Propheſie?</hi> And if our Gentleman may be thought to have shewed his Papers to ſome Catholiques befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re they were published, 'tis every jot as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, the Dr. made Proteſtants acquainted with his Book before it was ſent to the Preſſ. It is very ſevere doubtleſſ, if the inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateneſſ of one, should not only be fathered on us all, but urged againſt us, equal to the Treaſon of the late Tranſgreſſors. No peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on Earth can be ſafe at this rate: nay, all the Proteſtant Cavaliers themſelves (thoſe <hi>great patterns of Loyalty</hi>) would be involved, if ſuch conſequences were allowed. Every body knows, that ſome Great men got out of <hi>Decimation</hi> by favour, and that many Gentlemen (it may be out of prudence, knowing the end of Plots) refuſed to recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve <hi>Letters,</hi> much leſs <hi>Commiſſions</hi> from the King. How many Souldiers alſo were the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re that ſerved <hi>Cromwel</hi> at <hi>Jamaica</hi> and other Places: neither failed there a compliance in Poets too, as in <hi>Cowly</hi> and <hi>Cleveland</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:106777:65"/>
and for <hi>Lawyers</hi> there was no want of them in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> wſenſoever a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier</hi> had need. The <hi>Ministry</hi> alſo of the Nation had ſome among them that were not able to reſiſt Temptation; for there were not a few that took the <hi>Covenant;</hi> and Dr. <hi>Martin</hi> in his printed Letters taxes a great One for complying with the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> abroad. But why does my <hi>Miniſter</hi> lay the taking of the <hi>Engagement</hi> as a crime againſt us, ſeeing it was generally taken through the whole Kingdom, no body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing capable of Law that had not done it? Nor did any body fail of calling the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Supream Authority of the Nation,</hi> if they had Law-ſuits Petitions or any thing elſe of that Nature. Is this a blemish to the Cavaliers in general? No, 'tis ſo far from it, that even the moſt of theſe I mention, when occaſion ſerved, were ever forward in the Kings concerns. But all things perchance are lawful to all men, ſo they be not Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.</p>

                  <p>I could not imagine the Miniſter would have diſcover'd ſo great a Truth: for now, Reader, you ſee that he confeſſes that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is ſaid of Papiſts is generally belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. How are Papiſts traduced! What Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are told of Popes! How many things of the whole body of Papiſts! and all taken for Goſpel, as the adverſary himſelf acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:106777:69"/>
Thus people are poſſeſt with a horrour of Qu. <hi>Mary</hi>'s days, as if all were really true; and yet, as I have treated before, there has been more bloud Judicially ſpilt about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by thoſe that have excluded the Pope, then has been by Papiſts from the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Nation to its fall. What does the Miniſter mean by Proteſtants known, and no liberty given? <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> know Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants; nay, the Turk himſelf knows them, and is obliged to the diſturbances made by <hi>Luther</hi> and his fellows in <hi>Germany.</hi> For were the Government of that Country united, an not ſo <hi>rent into factions with diverſities of Religions</hi> (as <note n="a" place="margin">Sir Ed. S. p. 170</note> Sir <hi>Edwin Sandys</hi> obſerves) <hi>breeding endleſſ jealouſies, heart-burnings and hatred, it needed no other help to affront the Great Turk, and to repulſe all his forces, to the ſecurity of Christendom.</hi> This therefore was one of the advantages which the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion brought.</p>
                  <p>Certainly I ſpoke plain enough, and that without deceit, <hi>viz.</hi> Where the name of Proteſtant is unknown, (that is, where it has not been yet planted) the Catholike Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates take care to keep it out: But where their number or rebellion has moued their natural Prince to grant them terms, in
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:106777:69"/>
thoſe places I ſay they live with more liberty then Catholikes under any Proteſtant Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. <hi>Flanders,</hi> was never compelled to let the Reformed have extraordinary privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges; Nevertheleſſe there are many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in that Province, and particularly in the <hi>Wallon Countries:</hi> nor have they their Miniſters hanged, though theſe places are under the obedience of the moſt Catholike King. What reaſon has the Miniſter to ſay I could<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> name no other Country But <hi>France,</hi> where Proteſtants have open Churches? has he forgot <hi>Poland,</hi> even <hi>Crakaw it ſelf, where theire Orthodox Socinian Cathechiſm was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de?</hi> Let him alſo think on <hi>Hungary,</hi> both which are Popish Kingdoms, under Popish Kings. Nay, in <hi>Piedmont</hi> it ſelf they have open Churches; yet a man may legally be hanged in <hi>England,</hi> if he have but a private Chappel. Beſides this, Reader, there is much difference between Papiſts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, becauſe all Countries were poſſeſt by us, and the Reformed had no pretence to Government, (except in <hi>England,</hi> and in a ſmall Province or two in <hi>Germany</hi>) but what they got by Rebellion.

                  <p>To make it appear it was not for Rebellion they were maſſacred, he cites K. <hi>James, who ſays, I could never learn by any good and true intelligence, that in</hi> France <hi>thoſe of the Religion took Arms againſt their King.

World; and theſe cauſes were expreſt for at, <hi>viz.</hi> To give thanks to God for deſtroying in <hi>France</hi> the Enemies of the Truth and of the Church: That in the evening the Guns were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at St. <hi>Angelo,</hi> Bonfires made, and all things performed uſual in the greateſt Victories of the Church: That ſome days after, there was a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Proceſſion to St. <hi>Louis,</hi> and an Inſcription ſet over the Church-door by the Cardinal of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> to congratulate his Holineſſ and the Colledge in the Kings name, for the ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious effects and incredible events of their Counſels given him, and of their aſſiſtance ſent, and of their twelve years wishes and prayers. Soon after, he ſays, the Pope ſent Cardinal <hi>Urſini</hi> to congratulate the King, to commend and bleſſ them that had to do in the Maſſacre, and to perſwade the reception of the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> by this Argument; That the memory of the late glorious action (to be magnified in all ages, as conducing to the Glory of God and Dignity of the Holy Roman Church) might be ſealed by the approbation of the Holy Synod; for ſo it would be manifeſt, that the King conſented to the deſtruction of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, not of hatred or revenge, but ardent deſire to propagate the Glory of God (which could not be expected while the Proteſtants ſtood) through

But though <hi>Thuanus</hi> be
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:106777:73"/>
thus reputed, yet this Miniſter will pervert the Divel himſelf to do us a miſchief. He has told us that the Pope ordered a Jubilee through Chriſtendom, to give God thanks for deſtroying in <hi>France</hi> the Enemies of the Church; by which he would have the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der believe, that the Maſſacre was the cauſe of this Jubilee; when as <note n="a" place="margin">Th. p. 1065.</note> 
                     <hi>Thuanus</hi> tells us, <hi>That the Jubilee was to thank God for the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory at</hi> Lepanto <hi>againſt the</hi> Turk, <hi>for the ſucceſſ of</hi> Spain <hi>againſt the Rebels in</hi> Belgium, <hi>and to beſeech God for the election of a Catholick King in</hi> Poland; <hi>as well as for the buſineſſ in</hi> France. But truly, I need not complain, for <hi>ſuch Preachers of Gods word</hi> may ſay any thing (ſo it diſcredit the Papiſts) let it be never ſo improbable in it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>For my part I can believe not, that the Pope and Conſiſtory (who are by Proteſtants repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted dexterous and ſubtle) would make pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike Proceſſion and Triumph for Murther in cold blood, which could bring them no farther good (for the advantages were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obtained) but might occaſion much ſcandal, which, by reaſon it was the cauſe of <hi>Luthers</hi> revolt, was the more carefully to be avoided for the future. It may be they were not ſorry in their hearts: For
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:106777:73"/>
what men are ſo at the death of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? Yet we ſee often, that thoſe which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve a titillation the thing being done, would nevertheleſs looſe rather their own lives, then give the leaſt conſent to the fact. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vila</hi> tells us in one place of his Fifth Book, <hi>That the King and Queen-Mother contrived the deſtruction of the Rebels; and communicated their deſign only to the Duke of Anjou, the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and the Count of Rhetz,</hi> and this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Maſſacre, we ſee there was, a pretty <hi>while before Pius V. died.</hi> In another place of this Book, I <hi>find this Pope died ſome three months before the execution.</hi> In another place of this Book I find that <hi>this Pope would never conſent to the marriage of Margaret to the King of Navar, by reaſon of his Religion;</hi> and yet in the time of this Marriage Ch. 9. had determined this Butchery: Therefore put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all this together, it was plain the Pope had no hand in the wicked contrivance. <hi>Gregory</hi> 13. who ſucceeded, and before who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Election this Maſſacre was deſigned, was at laſt brought to diſpence with the Match, it being made appear to him how dangerous it might be in thoſe Schiſmatical times, if the King should in anger ſolemnize the Marriage without leave; for ſo this <note n="a" place="margin">Dav. l. 5.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>Reader, We have no other way to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the errors of Hiſtorians, but by conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, after we have compared times and circumſtances. The reaſons that I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laſt mentioned, aſſure me that the Pope had no hand in the deſign: yet ſuppoſe he had been of the Plot with the King, as 'tis plain he was not, I am ſure that can be no excuſe to the <hi>Hugonots</hi> for their former Rebellion, and unſpeakable abominations, as you shall preſently ſee. But let the Pope have what deſign he would, 'tis ſtill evident (<hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Apology</hi>) that the King and Queen-Mother (who could only perform this Murther) were moved to this Maſſacre for <hi>Intereſt of State, and not Religion.</hi> For the King was not ſuch a Bigot or Pious man, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a Spiritual account to draw ſuch a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, or at leaſt a ſcandal on his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: and for the Queen-Mother (that great intriguer) she valued Religion little; for ſometimes she favoured Proteſtants, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times again perſecuted them: Nay, when it was for her advantage, she gave great and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:106777:74"/>
ſuſpitious ſigns <hi>that she would be of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion alſo,</hi> as may be ſeen in <hi>Davi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> in the ſecond Book.</p>
                  <p>My Miniſter will not perchance be yet ſatisfied that I call it a Cabinet-Plot, but ſays <hi>they died for their Religion,</hi> and that the King had not better Subjects then thoſe that were maſſacred. <hi>Brave Coligni</hi> being the firſt that fell. Now, Reader, that you may ſee what kind of Subject our Miniſter is (and ſuch a one I always doubted him) I will briefly shew you how theſe <hi>Hugonots</hi> behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, among whom <hi>Coligni</hi> was a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, and who is honoured with the title of <hi>Brave,</hi> by this moſt Loyal Parſon.</p>
                  <p>In the time of <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt <hi>Calvin</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and dedicated his <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> to him. The preaching, of this man pleaſed the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable humor of many <hi>French;</hi> but the Sect was kept under by the King, and eſpecially by his Son <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. who like wiſe Governours were unwilling to let an unheard-of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion get root in their Country, well kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing that Rebellion would follow, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards it happened to the purpoſe. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> the 2. ſucceeded <hi>Hen.</hi> who was althoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther governed by the Houſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> by reaſon of the great power they had in the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:106777:75"/>
late Kings Reign, and more eſpecially now, becauſe the Queen-Conſort was the glorious <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> daughter to the Siſter of this ambitious Duke. The Houſe of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> (being the firſt Princes of the Blood) were greatly troubled they had no intereſt in affairs, and tried all manner of ways to get into play. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> (a hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed man) ſeeing he could not ruine the <hi>Guiſes</hi> by ordinary means, calls all his partiza<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s together (`among whom <hi>Coligni</hi> was the Chief) to <hi>la Ferte</hi> an Apennage of his, and there he told them, <hi>they must take Arms</hi> to free themſelves from the ſlavery they were in by the ruling Party. The fiery youth were all of the Princes opinion, to begin the War without delay: But, <hi>Brave Coligni</hi> (as the Miniſter calls him) replied, <hi>That this were to ruine them all, ſeeing that though their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences were fair, yet few of the Nation would follow them; and on the other ſide, all forreign Princes were in amity with</hi> France <hi>by the late agreement of the Kings Father. If they had a mind, he ſaid, to do their buſineſs home, the ſole way were to pretend Religion, which in it ſelf had an honourable appearance; and beſides, the</hi> Calviniſts <hi>in</hi> France <hi>were many, hating the</hi> Guiſes, <hi>and wanting only a Head; nor</hi>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:106777:75"/>
                     <hi>would the Princes of</hi> Germany <hi>or</hi> Q. Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth <hi>fail to aſſiſt them on this ſcore, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe could not be done on any account.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>Brave man</hi> not only conſented to <hi>Rebellion,</hi> but put them in a holy method effectually to perform it. All the Aſſembly applauded the Counſel of this <hi>Achitophel,</hi> and there-upon <hi>Andelot</hi> his Brother (<hi>a moſt turbulent man</hi>) and the Vicedame of <hi>Chartres (rich and debauch</hi>) were apponted to execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te their determinations. The manner of the Plot was this: To get a great company of unarmed <hi>Hugonots</hi> to go to Court, and there clamour for Liberty of Conſcience, and free Temples: theſe poor men (they imagined) should preſently be ill treated by the Duke of <hi>Guiſe;</hi> whereupon the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Souldiers (which for that purpoſe they were to provide) would immediately come to their aſſiſtance; and under pretence that the <hi>Hugonots</hi> were abuſed, they might fall on the Court, and wholly deſtroy their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Beſides this, 'twas reported, that in the diſorder the King and his three Brethren were to be made away, and God knows whether this laſt part were not as true as the firſt, ſeeing after the death of theſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon</hi> (Heads of the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:106777:76"/>
deſign) should ſucceed in the Throne.</p>
                  <p>But now ſee how far the Conſpiracy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded: The Provinces were divided to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the moſt conſiderable in each divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, who were to make ready their Levies againſt the 15. of <hi>March</hi> 1560. at <hi>Blois,</hi> a Town unfortified, where then the Court reſided. <hi>Godfry de la Barre (a Gentleman of Perigort, who had left his Country by reaſon of forgery in a Law-ſuit and turned Calviniſt</hi>) was made Commander in Chief; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their ſucceſs, the Prince, Admiral, and the reſt would order affairs. The Kings Councel, having at laſt notice of this, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the King without noiſe to <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> the better to ſecure him on a ſudden, with the preſent little force they had in readineſs. On the day appointed the Conſpirators come, and finding the King gone, follow him to <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> and aſſault the Caſtle; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too ſtrong to be preſently their's, they were by the Mareſchal of St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> and others wholly defeated and taken. Upon this trayterous attempt, the King ſummons an Aſſembly of the Nobles at <hi>Fountain-Bleau,</hi> where the <hi>brave Coligni</hi> grave the King a Paper, and ſaid, <hi>That the Protestants</hi> (hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by his Majeſties Edict, that every Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:106777:76"/>
might make known his Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce in this Aſſembly) <hi>did preſent that Petition to him; &amp; though it were not ſigned, yet when his Majesty pleaſed, it should be by 150000. hands.</hi> The Aſſembly, for all this arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, adviſed againſt a Toleration; but the <hi>Hugonots</hi> encouraged by theſe procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, roſe in Arms in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeveral places, and filled the Court with complaints of their many inſolencies; and on the other ſide, the Prince with his Complices ſet upon <hi>Lyons.</hi> After this the three Eſtates met at <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi> where the Prince was condemned to be executed and in this diſorder the King died.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Charles</hi> the 9 was about eleven years old when he began his Reign; ſo that in his minority (the faction of the Proteſtants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo great) the Prince was acquitted, and liberty granted for publike preaching. Then the Hugonots became ſo inſolent, that <hi>they maſſacred many people in Paris, burnt the Church of St.</hi> Medard, <hi>rifled Monasteries, and committed many ſuch exorbitances.</hi> The Prince would have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeiſed on the Kings Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at <hi>Fountain-Bleau,</hi> but the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> got the King of <hi>Navar</hi> (firſt Prince of the Blood, and prime Commander of State) to bring him and the Queen-Regent to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris;</hi>
                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:106777:77"/>
which when the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and ſaw himſelf defeated of his deſign, he told <hi>brave Coligni,</hi> that he had plunged himſelf ſo deep, <hi>that now</hi> he <hi>must drink or drown;</hi> and thereupon attackt <hi>Orleans</hi> and took it, uſing all the inhumane barbarities that can be thought of. After this (as Rebels are accuſtomed) a Manifeſto is ſet out, <hi>That</hi> he <hi>took up Arms to free the Kings Perſon from the ſlavery in which the Catholick Lords held him.</hi> This was directed to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; who again anſwered, <hi>That they won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered how it could be ſaid, the King was priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, being in his own Capital City, of which</hi> Charles <hi>of</hi> Bourbon <hi>the Princes own Brother was Governour; where was preſent the King of</hi> Navar <hi>Chief Administrator of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, where the Parliament ſat; and in fine; where all the great Officers of the Crown re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But why do I go to the particulars of this notorious Rebellion? To be short, <hi>brave Coligni</hi>'s own words (a little before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ath) will ſufficiently declare how great a Traytor he was; for juſt before the Marriage (like another <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in his pride) he ſaid to ſome of his confidents, <hi>That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Alexander <hi>nor</hi> Caeſar <hi>could be compared to</hi>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:106777:77"/>
                     <hi>him, becauſe Fortune was their friend, but that he dad loſt four Battles, yet by his wit, he ſtil became more formidable to his Enemies.</hi> If then this brave man, that began the Rebellion, as you have heard, that loſt four Battels againſt his Prince, that ſeiſed on ſo many Towns, that diſſwaded Peace ſo often when deſired, and that did ſo many infamous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions all along, shall paſs and not be thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght a Rebel, then I will aver there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Rebel ſince the Creation of the World. The things, Reader, which I have here laid down, you many find diſperſt in the firſt five Books of <hi>Davila</hi>'s Hiſtory, who is an Author thought by Proteſtants ſo <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick and ſo impartial</hi> (ſparing no body of what Rank or Faction ſoever) that among Hiſtorians none hath a clearer fame.</p>
                  <p>Having given you a short occount how theſe Potent <hi>Hugonots</hi> plagued theſe two Kings, be pleaſed now to tell me, whether it was not <hi>their powerful Rebellion (let their Religion have been what it would) that drew them into this ill-machinated destruction.</hi> And by the way, ſee how ſimple the cavil of this Miniſter is, who ſays, I call it <hi>ill-machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> becauſe it was done by halves. The action was wicked, and a <hi>Cabinet-Plot,</hi> or
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:106777:78"/>
elſe there is no ſuch thing in Nature: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did it want condemning by ſeveral fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Catholiques themſelves; who would doubtleſs have been ſilent, had the Pope ſo publickly rejoyced at the news, as the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter would fain have us believe.</p>
                  <p>The King in Vindication of the cruelty laid to his charge, gives theſe Reaſons to the World: <hi>That though every body ſaw how horribly the Rebels had uſed him, yet it was not his deſign to Maſſacre ſo many</hi> Hugonots, <hi>but only to cut off ſome Heads of the Party, who ſo highly fomented the Sedition: this made him cauſe</hi> Coligni <hi>to be shot, the chief Rebel of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all; but the bullet only breaking his arm, his Partizans grew to ſuch a rage, that they threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tned a preſent War, and deſtruction to him and his; therefore he was neceſſitated to what he did,</hi> viz. <hi>immediately to deſtroy thoſe that had vowed his ruine.</hi> Now to demonſtrate that is was not his intention, the Kings friends farther ſaid, <hi>That had he intended a general Maſſacre from the beginning, it had been folly to</hi>

vindicate the proceedinghs, and cite thoſe Acts with as much confidence, as if they had been obtained without Force in time of Peace and quiet.

Now no body is ignorant, that 'twas their factious Authority, which made the jealous Prince deſign their deaths, though by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable means.</p>

                  <head>ANSWER XIX.</head>
                  <p>He ſays the <hi>Guiſes</hi> were not killed for their
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:106777:79"/>
Religion, for they were killed by one of their own Religion, as much bent againſt Proteſtants as they. That Papiſts hated <hi>Hen. 3.</hi> only for ſparing the Blood of Proteſtants, and not decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Proteſtant Heir uncapable of Succeſſion. That for theſe cauſes the <hi>Guiſes</hi> by the Popes conſent (who calls them the <hi>Macchabees</hi> of the Church) entred into the Holy League, and called in the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Savoyards</hi> to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain War againſt him, and deprive him of his Kingdom and Life. Whereupon the jealous Prince, as I favourably call him, dealt with them, as they had done with the Proteſtants. But their caſe, he ſays, was ſo different from the Proteſtants, that he wonders I should menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
                  <p>Then he tells us, the Pope excommunicated the King for this action, and gave nine years Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to his Subiects to fight againſt him, foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as a Pope might do without Astrology, that ere long he should come to a fearful end; and this he ſays hapned: for the Subjects earned the Indulgence, and a <hi>Frier</hi> fulfilled the Propheſie. This action the Pope in a Speech called the work of God, and (for its wonderfulneſs) compared it with the Incarnation or Reſurrection; prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his courage before <hi>Eleazars</hi> or <hi>Iudiths,</hi> and declaring the King (who profeſt he died in
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:106777:80"/>
the Faith of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Church) to have died in the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, He asks, whether it may not be ſaid, Papiſts cannot live without perſecuting Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Popish King is stab'd and damned for not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting them enough.</p>

                  <p>Here is a great deal of cry, and little wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol; for I have often ſaid, the Pope may ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve his frailties, as well as other men; and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es not the Miniſter know he is a Temporal Prince alſo, and in that capacity may have intrigues with his Neighbours? What is this to our Religion, more then if the King of <hi>Spain</hi> should make uſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Politicks too far? Again, if the Pope as our Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop (all Countries being in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince) should commit humane indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Why were we to be more blamed for it, then <hi>Durham, Chester</hi> and <hi>Carliſle</hi> ought to be for their Religion, becauſe their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan <hi>Williams</hi> joyned with the Rebels againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> of happy Memory?</p>
                  <p>I never approved the procedure of the <hi>Guiſes</hi> in their League, and have always ſaid they were moſt inſolent Miniſters of State to <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. but when the Duke and Cardinal
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:106777:80"/>
were murthered at <hi>Blois</hi> by the King, their Succeſſors learnt of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> to run into a formal and open War. And truly, my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, I conceive, was pertinent concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Maſſacre of the one, and murther of the other, though the Parſon thinks it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſtrange. For in this Example the <hi>Outers and the Outees</hi> (the <hi>Hugonots and Guiſes</hi>) were killed by their Kings. Now ſince both Parties were prodigious in power, able to cope with the Prince; 'twould be as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to ſay, that (becauſe the <hi>Hugonots</hi> were deſtroyed) they <hi>ſuffered for their Faith,</hi> as that the Heads of the League <hi>were killed for their Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Davila</hi> tells us, That the Pope only <hi>refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to abſolve</hi> Henry <hi>the</hi> Third, <hi>ſaying, that he could not be contrite for killing a Cardinal, ſince he kept another ſtill in priſon.</hi> Nor does this famous Author ſay any thing of giving nine years Indulgence to his Subjects that should fight againſt him; and yet if the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe had done ſo, he muſt anſwer for his own actions to God Almighty, and not all the Members of the Catholique Church.</p>
                  <p>But why does this poor Miniſter continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally harp upon <hi>James Clement,</hi> whom the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel had ſeduced for this work? The Miniſter
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:106777:81"/>
would have called me worſe then a <hi>Turk</hi> (as he has already done) if I should lay at his door the actions of <hi>Hugh Peters, who was as I think ordained,</hi> at leaſt as bad as he were. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Popes Speech, you muſt know, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that it was a thing forged (as <hi>Tortus</hi> ſays) and never heard of but at <hi>Paris,</hi> ſome Grandees having hopes thereby to animate their Party, and others a deſign to defame the Sea of <hi>Rome:</hi> and if you conſider it, you will find the Pope had no reaſon to rejoyce at, but much to lament the death of this Prince. For <hi>Henry</hi> the Third was always a moſt firm ſon of the Church, and eaſily brought again to whatever could be deſired. But when he was gone, an apparent <hi>Hugonot</hi> was to ſucceed, whom though for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent they might think they were able to deal with, yet neceſſarily at beſt there would be a perpetual diſtraction among them; and beſides, wiſe men know, that accidents are common in ſuch caſes; and to be ſure, the leaſt ſucceſs on <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Fourth</hi>'s ſide, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uld have ruined the Popes intereſt. To his Concluſion I have anſwered before ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, <hi>viz.</hi> That Proteſtants live better under Papiſt Governments, then Papiſts do under theirs: therefore, I ſay again, who
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:106777:81"/>
the Perſecutors are, let the World judge.</p>

                  <p>Here he denies the conſequence, That if the

                     <hi>Hugonots</hi> then ſuffered for Doctrine, this hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghty Monarch would ſoon deſtroy them now: for he ſays, he may perſecute and not deſtroy them, or deſtroy them, but not ſo ſoon. Nor is this Monarch, he ſays, as Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick as <hi>Charlemaign;</hi> for if he were, he would be Patron of all Bishopricks in his Empire, make the Pope know the difference between a Prelat and an Emperor, and not chop Logick about <hi>Gallicane</hi> Priviledges: he would alſo call a Councel (as <hi>Charlemaign</hi> ded against Image-Worship) to ſeparate errours from the Faith. This he ſays were a good way to deſtroy the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> by taking away the cauſes of ſtrife; but any other way he cannot, without violation of his Laws. Then he ſays, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of hardships we feel not, and inſult over the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> who would mend their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with changing with us.

                  <p>I muſt here again, Reader, deſire your judgment, whether this conſequence in the Apology, be not as natural as can be: <hi>viz.</hi> If the <hi>Protestants</hi> ſuffered for Doctrine (when by reaſon of their ſtrength it was dangerous to diſturb them) then doubtleſs, this haughty Monarch (being as much a <hi>Papist</hi> in Faith as any of his Anceſtors) would ſoon deſtroy them now, <hi>having neither Force nor Town to reſist his might and puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance.</hi> Certainly, this is as impertinent a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, as his inſiſting upon <hi>Charlemagn,</hi> who was Emperour as well as King of <hi>France;</hi> and therefore had more Authority, then if he had been but a ſingle Monarch. Beſides, I wonder he should urge him as Quarreller with the Pope, being as great a friend as ever that Sea had. For he grave to it the <hi>Exar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chate of Ravenna,</hi> the <hi>Marca Anconitana, and the Dukedome of Spoleto,</hi> which are the greateſt part of the Church-Lands in <hi>Italy.</hi> All the power the ancient <hi>Caeſars</hi> had, I know not; if it were great, I wish they had never parted with it; but what they have granted, I think now as truly helongs to the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:106777:83"/>
                     <hi>Pope,</hi> as any <hi>Priuiledges</hi> that Towns or Royall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's can call theirs, by the Gracious conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of our famous Princes.</p>
                  <p>How shameleſs is this man, that can ſay, the <hi>Hugonots</hi> would mend their condition by changing with us! and yet he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny they have all the advantages before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. How prettily alſo (after his uſual manner) doth he pervert my meaning, in ſaying, we have free acceſs to his Highneſs; for my Argument runs thus: That the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots</hi> may convert the Kings Brother with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any prejudice to them by Law; when as it is death to a Catholique to pervert (as they call it) the meaneſt of his Majeſties Subjects. But God ſend the King may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver find more unfaithful Servants then ſuch; nor the Duke thoſe that shall wish him worſe then the worthy Abbot, whom he is pleaſed to mention. He has a fling alſo at me, becauſe the Catholique Peers ſit in the Houſe, which is quite beſides the thing I urged. For I ſaid, the <hi>Hugonots</hi> muſt needs think they live happily, enjoying not only their Religion in publike, but alſo being capable of any manner of Employment, even to be choſen Members of the three Eſtates; nor is there any Parliament of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,</hi>
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:106777:83"/>
but has many of their Religion in it. On the contrary, Catholikes are born with an incapacity of Employment, like the Villains as it were in Ancient times, who had no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in the Kingdom. If ſome few Lords ſit in their Houſe, 'tis not any favour the Nobility bear to Popery, but becauſe they have gravely conſidered, that it would be wonderful injuſtice to turn out a Party for difference in Religion, and permit other diſſenters to continue. Now (ſeeing there are ſo many Opinions in the World) to turn out all, God knows upon whoſe Children the Lot may fall next: for the Church of <hi>England</hi> is no <hi>Manna,</hi> to relish in every palate; and ſome wiſe men alſo think, that a man may do very well, though he has little Diſputes with this his holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Why does this Gentleman ſay, we never knew the Laws executed? I am ſure, there have died by theſe Laws at leaſt 300 Prieſts, beſides Laymen: and how often we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en rackt in priſon, and how infinitely our Eſtates have ſuffered for our Conſciences, no body, I think, is ignorant.

               <p>We earneſtly wish that the Party had had more patience under that Princeſs: But pray conſider (though we excuſe not their faults) whether it was not a harder Queſtion then that of <hi>Yorck</hi> and <hi>Lancaster</hi> (the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of a War of ſuch length and death of ſo many Princes) who had moſt right, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> or <hi>Mary Stuart.</hi> For ſince the whole Kingdom had crowned and ſworn Allegeance to Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> they owned her as the legitimate daughter to <hi>Henry,</hi> the <hi>Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghth;</hi> and therefore it was thought neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to follow by many, that if <hi>Mary</hi> was the true Child, <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was the Natural, which muſt needs give way to the thrice-no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Queen of Scots.</p>

                  <p>He ſays, that I wish the Catholicks had had more patience under Q. <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> but he thinks they needed none: for in the firſt ten years of her Reign (though what the Papiſts had do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time was fresh in memory) none of them fuffered death till the Northern Rebellion, raiſed againſt her meerly upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her Religion: 'twas she then that was
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:106777:85"/>
perſecuted, and had occaſion for patience, and therefore I should have wisht them more Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But it appears I account Rebellion no fault, in ſaying, 'twas a hard Queſtion, whether the right lay in Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> or the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> becauſe many thought Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> illegitimate. Here he asks, Who thought ſo? Or, when the Queſtion aroſe? For, ſays he, Firſt, Archbishop <hi>Heath</hi> a Papiſt, ſaid in his Speech, no body could doubt the justneſs of her Title. Secondly, the Kings of <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and the Emperour offered Marriage to her, and thereby hoped to get the Crown. Thirdly, the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> acknowledged her, and claimed nothing but to be her Heirs and Succeſſours. Then he tells, that <hi>Paul</hi> the Fourth was the Firſt that queſtioned her Title, becauſe the Kingdom being a Fee of the Papacy, she had audaciouſly aſſumed it without his lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve; and ſecondly, becauſe she was illegitimate. But his Succeſſour <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth would have owned her, if she would have owned him; which becauſe she would not, the next Pope <hi>Pius</hi> V. iſſued out his Bulls and depoſed her, not for Bastardy, but for being a Proteſtant, upon which the Northern-men and others of her Subjects rebelled, and were every foot plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt her. 'Tis true, he ſays, the Queen
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:106777:85"/>
of <hi>Scots</hi> Title was pretended; but he demands what would we have done if that Queen had not been Catholick, or Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> not thought illegitimate? He proceeds, That <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the Thirteenth had occaſion to conſider this, having a Baſtard of his own, and another of the Emperours to provide for: to the firſt of which he gave <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſent <hi>Stukely</hi> to win it for him; and to the other <hi>England,</hi> with leave to win it for himſelf. But what was this to the Q. of <hi>Scots?</hi> who (he ſays) might perhaps have been preferred to marry one of them, upon condition her ſon <hi>Iames</hi> might have nothing to do with the Succeſſion. For when she was dead, and her right in King <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, Sixtus</hi> V. not only took no notice of him, but curſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> again, and gave her Kingdom to <hi>Philip</hi> the Second of <hi>Spain.</hi> Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Eighth ſeeing he could do no good upon Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (to take care another Heretick should not ſucceed her) ſent his Breves both to Clergy and Layity, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to admit any but a Catholique to the Succeſſion, though never ſo neer in blood; which was in plain words to exclude King <hi>James;</hi> ſo that the Popes never ſtuck at the hard queſtion. And now he asks, What our Country men did or ſuffered for it? And anſwers himſelf, that
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:106777:86"/>
they acted for the Papal intereſt, making uſe of the Houſe of <hi>Scotland</hi> only for a cloak, while the Title was in Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> but when it was in King <hi>James,</hi> none of them ſtirred or ſuffered for it: yet they were not idle, but as buſie as Bees in contriving to haſten Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> death, and to put him by the Succeſsion.</p>
                  <p>To prove this, he urges the <hi>Spanish</hi> Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion preſently after his Mothers death, negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and defended by Papists: That the Jeſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes procured <hi>Huntly</hi> to rebel in <hi>Scotland:</hi> That they perſuaded the Earl of <hi>Darby</hi> to ſet up a Title to the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> which he revealing, was poyſoned ſoon after, as <hi>Hesket</hi> had threatned him: That when their ſingle shot failed, <hi>F. Parſons</hi> gave a broad-ſide to the Royal Houſe of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in a Book pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished under the name of <hi>Doleman,</hi> ſetting up divers Competitors; and to provide a ſure Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, he found a Title for the Earl of Eſſex (to whom he dedicated the Book) being the moſt ambitious and popular man in the Nation. But <hi>the the Book, he ſays, prefers</hi> the Title of the <hi>Infanta</hi> before all others. Then he concludes from this his Diſcourſe, in which, he ſays, <hi>nothing material can be denied,</hi> that it appears, That this hard Question was not between the Parties themſelves, in one of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:106777:86"/>
whom, we confeſs, the right was. For the Pope eaſily reſolved it, who denied both ſides of the Queſtion, aſſuming the right to himſelf, and as concerning the <hi>English</hi> Catholiques, he ſays, they ſided with the Pope againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> alſo: and laſtly, that their miſdemeanours were inexcuſable Treaſons, if any Treaſons befriended by ſuch an Apologiſt can be inexcuſable.</p>

                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:106777:88"/>The ſecond Queſtion is this: <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>eighth</hi> married his brothers wife, who was ſaid to be a Virgin; for Prince <hi>Arthur was but fifteene and a little more wen he died.</hi> By this Princeſs K. <hi>Hen.</hi> had our Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> and after he had lived with her 20 years, he fell in love with a handſome young Lady, whereupon he had in short time a ſcruple of Conſcience that it was unlawful to live lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with his old wife, becauſe she had been<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married to his brother. His Conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill tender, he cauſed the Scriptures to be ſearched, and found not only there the Marriage to be void, but that the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had no power in <hi>England;</hi> and beſides, that rich Abbies were alſo contrary to the word of God. Being thus truly informed, he threw away Wife, Pope and Monks, and married the other, by whom he had Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> while his firſt Wife lived. 'Twas thought by many curious wits, that there could be but one of the daughters le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate, becauſe both Mothers were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries, and that to <hi>Chriſtians</hi> the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture permits but one wife at a time. After the death of this King and his Son, 'twas put to the Kingdom to decide, which of theſe children were lawfully begotten:

                  <p>The Caſe being thus fancied by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts (in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) they argued, that if <hi>Mary</hi> was the true Child, then the other was the Natural: but <hi>Mary</hi> was owned Legitimate: And my Lord Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con <note n="a" place="margin">H. 7. p. 206.</note> ſay's <hi>the ligitimation of Queen Mary and Elizabeth were incompatible.</hi> Ergo the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom not being Elective, <hi>Mary Stuart</hi> (the next Legal Heir) muſt neceſſarily ſucceed her.

                  <p>But the Miniſter urges, if the Papiſts thought Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> an Uſurper, why did not they ſtir ſooner? for there was no Rebellion, he ſays, in ten years: and when after ten it broke out in the North, there was not the leaſt mention made of the Q. of <hi>Scots,</hi> or her Title.</p>

But when this Royal Gueſt had once truſted her ſelf among her Enemies, she was both denied acceſs to the Court, and alſo refuſed the liberty of retiring into another Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>This inhumanity was quickly noiſed about the World; whereupon <hi>Pius</hi> V. ſent <note n="b" place="margin">Cam. 1568. p. 146.</note>

                  <p>'Tis true, the Declaration of thoſe great Lords that were up, mentioned no other motive but Religion; becauſe this could not shock either the Queen or People ſo much, as the name of the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi>

of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> but ſomething was contrived to prevent the machinations of her unkind Kinſwoman. By all this you may ſee, that while Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> uſed her diſtreſſed Gueſt with any kindneſs, the piety of that Princeſs (which moved her ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be contented with the Succeſſion, then put <hi>England</hi> in a perpetual broyl) cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her to command the <hi>English</hi> Catholiques to lie ſtill; whom (according to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters own confeſſion) the prohibition of their Religion forten years had not exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated to Commotions. But aſſoon as their Queen was impriſoned without hopes of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and they left to the dictates of their own Loyal inclinations, they never ceaſed either at home or abroad to ſollicite the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction of their Enemies. Conſider alſo, I beſeech you, the carriage of the Popes, who uſed all fatherly and gentle means imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, becauſe they ſaw the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> whoſe right they deemed it was, of her ſelf inclining (like another <hi>Maud</hi>) to expect, till the death of her Cozen should put an end to all pretences.

'Tis true he ſays ſo, and yet confeſſes, that <hi>Paul</hi> the IV.

Does he find any ſuch record in our Hiſtories? Did Queen <hi>Mary</hi> ask his conſent? Did any Pope ſend in this manner to <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Sixth?</hi> Or laſtly, which of all our Kings uſed to entreat his favour to be Crowned? Reader, this is a pretty <hi>capricchio</hi> of the Parſon, as it had been unuſuall if the Pope had made ſuch a claim. <hi>Pius</hi> the <hi>Fourth</hi> ſucceeding the ſaid <hi>Paul</hi> (for the reaſons aforeſaid) shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as much prudence and good nature as ever man did, in hope to compoſe things without effuſion of blood: and certainly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                  <p>In this manner the Popes acknowledged her: and for the Marriages which were offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her (&amp; to very much purpoſe forſooth urged by the Miniſter) from forreign Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, it proves no more right, then that Mrs. <hi>Cleypole</hi> had been truly our Queen, if <hi>France, Spain,</hi> or the Emperor had made love to her; and I believe no body doubts, but Suiters would have flockt, had she been unmarried, and ſole Heir to her Father.</p>

                     <hi>Spaniards,</hi> yet I do not ſee, that this can touch us Catholicks in the leaſt, though the Miniſter thinks it a mighty Argument.

The Bishop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> for his ſmart endeavours againſt the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> was never blamed, but on the contrary commended by us; and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Pope is as abſolute, and as good a man as he. Kings, you ſee, may fall upon their Neigbours themſelves, and without breach of Morality, incite others to do the like; and while Popes are free Princes, they cannot be reproach'd for uſing that liberty, without great partiality and malice. This Miniſter foolishly handles all things, and you may ſee his intent is only to make a noiſe: for 'tis no advantage (in our preſent Diſpute) to him to shew, what Kingdoms Popes over-run, or give away.</p>
                  <p>That which he ought to prove was, That it is Article of Faith amongſt us, to aſſiſt the Pope in every ſuch invaſion, or Gift. That this is not ſo you may plainly ſee; for

me, that King <hi>James</hi>'s admiſsion to the Crown (a Proteſtant from his Childhood) was oppoſed by the Catholiks of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. If they ſtickled not after his Mothers death for him as they did for her, this anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is ſufficient, That he was not uſed li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke her, nor did he (for fear of prejudicing his future admittance) ever deſire any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſtir in his behalf.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, If ſome of theſe Fugitives did perſwade my Lord of <hi>Darby,</hi> it was, I ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, done like Fugitives, nor had they ever the conſent of the Catholiques for it. It was certainly a very rediculous Plot in them to make a Proteſtant Nobleman (that had ſo poor a Title) their Soveraign; and if it were really deſigned, <hi>It must, I am ſure, have been performed by the Proteſtants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;</hi> for the Papiſts had no power, not being able ſo much as to ſet up the Qu. of <hi>Scots,</hi> who had ſo plauſible a right, though they wanted not the aſſiſtance of the Pope, <hi>Spaniard</hi> and all the <hi>Guiſard</hi> Faction.

                  <p>Having thus gone through the Paragraph, I muſt come to the niceſt Queſtion of all; and nice, I may call it, becauſe it is conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral only. The propoſal by the Miniſter is this: Whether if the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> had been a Proteſtant, we should have ſtickled for her? and if Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had not been thought illegitimate, whether nevertheleſs we had not rebelled againſt her? To the firſt, I ſay, <hi>viz. We had ſided with the Q. of</hi> Scots, <hi>had she been Proteſtant.</hi> To the ſecond, No, <hi>That the Papiſts would not have oppoſed Queen</hi>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:106777:96"/>
Elizabeth, <hi>had they thought her legitimate:</hi> and of the Miniſters own aſſertions, I will make this plainly appear. For if according to him, the Papiſts would have ſet up two Proteſtants (the Lords <hi>Darby</hi> and <hi>Eſſex</hi>) who in reality had no right, then I ſay, 'tis certain they would willingly have embraced the Title of the <hi>Stuarts,</hi> that carried ſo fair a shew. To the ſecond, I anſwer, <hi>That they would never have oppoſed</hi> Queen Elizabeth <hi>had she been thought Legitimate:</hi> For if (as the Miniſter urged in the beginning) they obeyed her whom they thought an Uſurper for ten years, though she had utterly deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troyed their Religion, 'tis then more then probable, had her Title been good in their opinion, they had ſubmitted, let her Faith have been what it would. Theſe doubts being thus reſolved by the very Gentleman that propoſed them (who cares not, if he can wound us for the preſent, into what contradictions at laſt he runs himſelf) I may, I hope [ſince he hath shewed me the example) propoſe a Query alſo; and I shall thank him, if out of my Reply he gives the Solution.</p>
                  <p>I will not urge my Queſtion ſo far as to ſuppoſe the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> had been a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, but my demand shall be ſingly this,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:106777:97"/>
Whether the Reformed in thoſe days would have quietly obeyed Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> had she ſtood up for the Catholick Religion? Reader, becauſe the Parſon is not ready to give his determination, I will tell you my opinion, which is, that I think they would not, and doubtleſs this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>jecture is not rash, when we conſider what has been done here, and recorded by our Proteſtant Hiſtorians themſelves. Have we not ſeen that (for the ſafety of Religion) <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth gave away by the advice of his Councel the Kingdom to <hi>Jane Gray?</hi> and what Bees could be ſo buſie as <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Ridley,</hi> with many thouſands more, to ſet up (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their lawful Queen <hi>Mary</hi>) that poor Lady, who had not right enough by blood, and much leſs if she depended wholly upon the Will, for that was void from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, according to the known Laws of the Land? How many treaſonable Books were written againſt this Queen after she came to the Crown, by Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> and others, aſſerting, <hi>That she ought to be put to death as a Tyrant, Monſter and cruel Beast? Will Thomas</hi> alſo conſpired to murther her; and when he was to be hanged for his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he ſaid, <hi>he died for his</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Stovv. Q. <hi>M.</hi> p. 1056.</note> 
                     <hi>Countrey.</hi> By all
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:106777:97"/>
which may be gathered (the <hi>Duke of Suffolke alſo with many more proteſtants being ready, and Wiat actually in an open and dangerous rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi>) how dangerous it was then in <hi>England</hi> for a Prince to be a Papiſt; though to that day there had never ſat but one through Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant upon the Throne, and he a Child about ſixteen when he died.</p>
                  <p>But now I muſt deſcend to a far more tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical example, even to the death of the ſo often mentioned Qu. of <hi>Scots,</hi> who loſt her life barely upon the account of her <hi>Religion.</hi> 'Tis true Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> conſidered her own ſafety, but the fury of the Nobility and people, (without whoſe incitement she durſt not have been beheaded) was purely for fear she might have ſurvived Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and being then the undoubted Succeſſour, might have changed Religion as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Queen <hi>Mary</hi> had done before. If I should urge this barely upon my own word, I might be miſtruſted; therefore what I ſay shall be out of <hi>Cambden,</hi> who was not only a Proteſtant, but the acknowledged true Annaliſt of thoſe times. He will tell you, that after <hi>Babingtons</hi> Conſpiracy, in the conſultation what should be done with the Royal Priſoner, ſome were for holding
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:106777:98"/>
her in ſafe cuſtody, but others (<hi>out of care of</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Cam. 1586. p. 413.</note> 
                     <hi>Religion</hi>) would have her tried and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>executed. In purſuance then of this advice, she was condemned, and the next Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Houſe petitioned for the execution of her Sentence. The firſt reaſon in their ſupplicate was, for the preſervation of the <hi>true</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Cam. 1586. p. 432,</note> 
                     <hi>Religion of Chriſt;</hi> and after they had told Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> alſo of her own dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they harpt again upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the former ſtring, deſiring her to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber Gods fearful judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ahab,</hi> for their ſparing <hi>Benhadad</hi> and <hi>Agag,</hi> two wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Idolaters. In fine, when the fatal day came, though they were ſo very ſevere as to deny her (being a Gueſt, and a free Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs) what all Embaſſadours have, <hi>viz.</hi> a Preiſt to aſſiſt her at her death, she was again recomforted, when she knew by the Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> that she died for her Faith: for he told her, that her life would be the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their <note n="c" place="margin">Cam. 1587. p. 455.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>Reader, I muſt now here end, and cannot but ask this Queſtion, If the Reformed have for defence of their <hi>Religion</hi> effected the death of their Queen, or at leaſt undoubted Heir; and if they have ſet up <hi>Jane Gray,</hi> that had no title, becauſe their lawful Prince
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:106777:98"/>
was Catholick; who have been I would fain know in <hi>England</hi> more faulty in this caſe, they or we? Pray what advantage has this Miniſter got by loading us with crimes, of which we are innocent? And if, as he urges in the beginning, <hi>we obey'd Q.</hi> Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth <hi>ten years without ſtir,</hi> it then shows that Papiſts can be obedient to a Prince of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Religion, though they doubt their right; whenas the former Proteſtants would do any thing rather then permit a Catholick to govern, let the Title be never ſo juſt. Judge now, Reader whether it be not ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative injuſtice to incenſe the World againſt us, as if our Religion taught nothing but blood, and theirs all gentleneſs imaginable. I muſt invoke both Angels and Men to conſider our wrong, who are termed trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in our Principles, even to this day. We in our own perſons have shewed all the duty that men can fancy, and for our Anceſtors you have ſeen what their Plea is; if it be bad, they have juſtly ſuffred; if other wiſe, let them then feel your anger, who would deceive you thus with lies; and remember that 'tis not poſſible a Religion which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned <hi>England</hi> with glory ſo many years, can teach a Doctrine deſtructive to Princes,

                  <p>Here he calls me Apoſtle and Poet, full of Gravity, and Fiction. Then he ſays, I would make the World believe they were drawn into this Plot by <hi>Cecil;</hi> yet am ſo wiſe as not to offer to prove it, but would ſteal it in by the example of <hi>Cromwel.</hi> Again, he ſays (admitting this for true) they were Traytors nevertheleſs in doing what they did, had there been no <hi>Cecil</hi> in the World: and therefore the excuſe only implies, they had not wit to invent it, though they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not malice to execute it; for according to my illuſtration, as the Cavaliers whom <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> drew in, had their Loyalty abuſed, and were nevertheleſs faithful ſtill; ſo the Powder-Traytors (whom <hi>Cecil</hi> drew in) had their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty out witted, and were nevertheleſs Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ſtill: For 'tis clear, by being drawn in, both parties were ſufficiently diſpoſed for it. What I lay upon <hi>Cecil,</hi> he ſays is a groundleſs and an impudent Fiction, which I am properly

the author of for no body ever ſpoke it before but in railery. He asks by what Tradition or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation I received it ſixty years after the fact, when as neither K. <hi>James,</hi> nor <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> nor the Apologiſts of that age knew any thing of it. He deſires to know who were <hi>Cecils</hi> ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that would be hanged, that his art might not be ſuſpected, for none were ſaued; <hi>and Garnet</hi> ſaid, he would give all the World to clear his name and Conſcience of the Treaſon. Theſe are strong preſumptions for the Negative of <hi>Cecils</hi> having no hand in the Plot: but he ſays, there is only my bare word for the affirmative; which if it be enough, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

them, that it gives occaſion to ſuſpect me. I ought, he ſays, to call the Diſcovery a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, becauſe King <hi>Iames</hi> named it ſo, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince <hi>Bellarmine</hi> acknowledged it ſo: but 'tis no wonder, that I, who will not call the Plot, Treaſon, will not allow the Diſcovery to be a Miracle.</p>

                  <p>'Twas never in my heart (and ſo will all that know me teſtifie) to think that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:106777:102"/>
in this Treaſon were not Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in the higheſt degree, or that any punishment could equal the blackneſs of their offence. In the Apology I am ſure the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re are no words that can be rackt to this; for my intent there was only to shew in short that the Catholick body was inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, <hi>knowing nothing of the entreprize:</hi> That the Plot (for which theſe were executed) was made, or at leaſt fomented by the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of <hi>a great Stateſman.</hi> And laſtly, though the deſign had been ſuggeſted by Papiſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and unanimouſly approved by all, <hi>yet we that live now are guilty of no ſin,</hi> and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore 'twere ſevere to be punisht for it.</p>
                  <p>That the Catholick Body had no hand in the Treaſon, moſt plainly appears by the quality of the Actors, and by the number of them. I know there were four or five Gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemen of Ancient blood engaged; but I look upon that as no wonder: for out of the firſt twenty Catholicks accidentally met I'll lay a conſiderable wager to find as great Families as any were there, unleſs that of the <hi>Percies:</hi> yet this <hi>Percy</hi> was a man of no fortune, nor am I certain (though I well know my Lord <hi>Northumberlands</hi> Relations) whether really he was a kinſman, or only for names ſake
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:106777:103"/>
called his Cozen.</p>
                  <p>A Plot is lookt upon as general, when a good number of the Chief of a Party are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigued in the deſign. The Catholick No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen were then not only as conſiderable as any, but alſo the conſiderableſt of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for at that time there being no Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, but the late King, the firſt <hi>Marqueſs,</hi> the firſt <hi>Earl,</hi> the firſt <hi>Viſcount,</hi> and the firſt <hi>Baron</hi> were of our Profeſſion; and I believe 'twill be granted, that the Lords <hi>Winchester, Arundel, Mentacute,</hi> and <hi>Abergavenny,</hi> (and ſo proportionably the reſt of the Papal Nobility) had Eſtates able to be Partizans, if they thought fit, in any conjuration. Now none of theſe Noblemen, nay, not one of all the Peers, nor any more of the Gentry then the Traytors, whom I will by and by mention, had a hand in the deſign: therefore to call this, as the Miniſter and others do, an univerſal Popish Plot, is in it ſelf a contradiction, or at leaſt a riddle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my capacity to unfold.</p>

you ſeriouſly to conſider, and tell me whether it could be a Popish Plotter that writ this Letter. For is it poſſible that any mans hould be ſo diſtracted (after they had brought their Plot to that perfection, had ſo ſolemnly ſworn, even <note n="a" place="margin">Speed p. 917,</note> 
                     <hi>by the Trinity and Sacrament, never to discloſe it directly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly, by word or Circumstance,</hi> and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved alſo to blow up all the <hi>Catholique Lords</hi> and the reſt of their <hi>friends</hi> in both houſes) I ſay all this Conſidered, is it poſſible that a man should be ſoe diſtracted as to write a Letter, that had more in it of diſcloſing ſome Plot, then the bare ſaving of a friend. 'Twas reported that <hi>Percy</hi> writ it; but no body ever found there were ſuch ſuperlative endearments between thoſe two, or between any other of the Conſpirators and <hi>Monteagle,</hi> as that they could ſtumble at this Noblemans deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and yet diſpence with killing ſo many of their own Religion, and Relations; for <note n="b" place="margin">Speed p. 916.</note>

But ſuppoſe that <hi>little inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macies between my Lord and Percy</hi> (<note n="c" place="margin">Wil. K.

(Percies Patron and only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port) was to be ſacrificed without pity; I ſay, ſuppoſe this, what need was there to write, <hi>That God and man would punish the Parliament, and this by a blow, and that they should not know who hurt them,</hi> and a hundred ſuſpitious things to no purpoſe? If it were out of a deſire (being an extraordinary friend) to keep this Nobleman from the Houſe that day, the Epiſtle-ſender should have written in his own name and Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. That out of love to his preſervation, he deſired him to forbear the Parliament that day, becauſe ſome were reſolved to kill him: that as yet being under Oath, he could not tell him the particulars, but that shortly his promiſe would be void, and then he should know all things from him by word of mouth. Such a Letter as this would have certainly kept my Lord at home, when as the other muſt confound him and every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy elſe, coming from an unknown perſon: nor could any thing in the world (in the opinion of any fool) more naturally have endangered a diſcovery then ſuch needleſs circumſtances, and notice alſo given ſo long before the execution. For, Reader, you muſt know, that the Letter was ſent to <hi>Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eagle</hi>

Nay, this long warning was ſo far from an appearance of advantage, that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary it was quite oppoſite to all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the deſigns of a Conſpirator; for 'twas certain, either it would make my Lord careleſly contemn the admonition, ſince it came from an idle fellow in the ſtreet; or elſe if he were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive, he would neceſſarily shew it to friends, by which (as I ſaid) there might be no little hazard to have all found out. Now on the other ſide, this interval was benecifial to a <hi>Machivilian,</hi> becauſe he knew 'twould not only be more grateful to the Privy-Councel to have time to conſider on difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but alſo foreſaw, if the King and Lords (through ſurprize or otherwiſe) should not hit on the Plot, he muſt be forc'd to ſtart hints (the execution being ſo neer at hand) which might eaſily have made him ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected for contriver; and how ungrateful ſulch a wickedneſs would have been to an upright Prince, he him ſelf could not but well imagine.</p>
                  <p>Thus, Reader, you ſee the intention of
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:106777:107"/>
the Letter was to have the thing diſcover'd, and thus could he ruine his Enemies, and make his own vigilance appear; for without ſuch and the like remembrances, the wit of great Miniſters is ſoon forgotten both by their Prince and People. Nor did <hi>Cecil</hi> miſs of another reward alſo, for (as <note n="a" place="margin">K. I. p. 32<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>That which I aſſert here, does not leſſen the quickneſs of the Kings judgment; for his inſight as much appears, whether the Letter were writ by a Stateſman or a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirator.

And truly, if a ſcore of wicked Chriſtians had conſpired againſt <hi>Nero</hi> himſelf, I would not gain ſay the remembrance of the delivery, in what Countrey ſoever it were obſerved.

                  <p>Thirdly, He thinks that my comparing of <hi>Cromwels</hi> drawing in the Cavaliers with this of <hi>Cecils,</hi> is very odd, and unequal: For the Cavaliers, he ſayes, were cheated into <hi>a lawful Action,</hi> but the Powder-Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were out-witted into <hi>Treaſon.</hi> To this, I ſay, that my compariſon was never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended (as you may ſee if you look into the Apology) to make an equality of Juſtice or Honour in their ſufferings; but to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you how eaſie it is for Trapanners to draw people into <hi>Plots,</hi> and from thence to the <hi>Gallows.</hi>

                  <p>Fourthly, Concerning his deſire to know who was <hi>Cecils</hi> ſetter to decoy in the reſt; I anſwer, I cannot tell: Nor should we ever have known who was <hi>Cromwels Instrument,</hi> had not Sir S. <hi>Morland</hi> moſt Loyally diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him. There were three or four the Miniſter names diſcovered by the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators, who knew of the Plot, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards died obſcurely abroad.

                  <p>Fifthly, Becauſe he is angry with the word <hi>Deſperadoes,</hi> I have altered it in this Edition, and put in lieu <hi>Ambitious men.</hi> I am ſure the word in it ſelf is <hi>proper</hi> enough, for moſt were poor; and King James in his Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation againſt Percy <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <p>Laſtly, He ſays, few knew the manner, but moſt knew there was a deſign on foot, and prayed for the ſucceſs of it. Suppoſe, Reader, this were true, that a deſign was recommended to the prayers of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, what were they guilty of by it? for at that time the Chief of them were ſolliciting at Court to get ſome little eaſe after their long miſery; and therefore the reſt might well think their prayers were fit to be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But all this is a fiction.</p>
                  <p>Thus, Reader, I have now left nothing unanſwered that he has urged: and thus you

I was not troubled that no Oath was given; but ſeeing that no Oath could be given, 'twas hard me thought, that the whole Town should take all things as unqueſtionable truths, though the Accuſers were (as I ſaid) profeſt enemies to us, and lately to the very Kingdom alſo.

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:106777:115"/>
in behalf of it, and I remember Dr. <hi>Will was mightily for it, whem he governed his flock in Fleerſtreet.</hi> An <hi>Ave Mary</hi> is Scripture, and whoſoever reads the <hi>Salatation of the Angel and St. Elizab.</hi> does at that time actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay one, Beſides, if no body is a Proteſtant that holds peculiar opinions, then I muſt conclude there are very few Proteſtants in the World: for Proteſtants in Religion agree only in Negatives, that is, they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally <hi>deny thé Pope, Purgatory, &amp;c.</hi> but when they come to Poſitives, they jar, and then divide, and ſubdivide (as we by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſee) into a million of Sects and Factions.</p>
                  <p>Reader, before I go farther, I muſt tell you who this <hi>Harvey</hi> is: by Nation he is a Low-Countryman, but admitted among the <hi>English</hi> Jeſuites, as many Aliens are. He is an antient; quiet, and pious man; 'tis late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I knew him, but found him to be of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Angelical converſation. Many Prieſts being fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time to time impriſoned, brought him acquainted with <hi>Newgate,</hi> where ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he aſſiſted thoſe that went to die. This I call high charity in any man of any Sect, to take pains to make another of that Religion, which his Conſcience tells him is
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:106777:115"/>
moſt agreeable to God. Nor is there any humane intereſt or Policy in thus aſſiſting Malefactours, for they are poor of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſure to die the next execution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. By this occaſion Mr. <hi>Harvey</hi> met with the <hi>French Hugonot</hi> [the pretended firer of <hi>London</hi>) with whom he had diſcourſe about Religion; and after he had inſtructed him in the Catholique Doctrine, he went to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Communion to the Company; and then demanding of them, whether they received according to the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick faith, <hi>Hubert</hi> ſaid, <hi>He had nothing to do with Roman,</hi> and therefore the Sacrament was refuſed him; nor did Mr. <hi>Harvey</hi> ever ſe him after. This is the truth of the Story. But, pray, what is the <hi>Frenchman</hi> to us, had he been <hi>Papist?</hi> though (as it happened) he lived and died otherwiſe. For my part, I believe there are few <hi>Fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chmen</hi> now in <hi>London,</hi> but would be glad to ſee it afire again, either for an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſteal, or for the advantage of their Prince, were he at War with us; the like would the <hi>English</hi> wish at <hi>Paris,</hi> I dare ſay.</p>
                  <p>Conſider therefore, Reader<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I beſeech you, my Anſwerer; and though 'tis at no time my humour to give foul language, yet
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:106777:116"/>
I muſt ſay, I challenge all <hi>Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</hi> to find out one that shall excel him in ill. He has accuſed us for the <hi>Murther of King Charles; the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of the English, Irish, and Scotish War; the triumphing at ourmis fortunes at Sea; the rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing for the Enemies being upon our Coaſt; and then lastly the burning of</hi> Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>it ſelf:</hi> yet all this urged without any manner of proof, no not ſo much as the leaſt probability.</p>
                  <p>Is one detraction againſt one onely man a ſin, and punishable at the Judgment-ſeat of God hereafter; and shall ſo various aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions againſt ſo many of the beſt account in <hi>England</hi> paſs for a toy?

If then a woe be pronounc'd againſt ſuch, what will become of them that aſperſe his Members? and therefore if this Miniſter be a Chriſtian be muſt know that without ſatis-factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is no forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Nay, the effects of his crimes have riſen to this, to encourage other men to do the like; for not long after, there was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht (as I juſt now mentioned) a libell call'd the <hi>Committee of Parliaments enquiry about the firing the City;</hi> and at laſt the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs

of the Author laid it at the doors of the <hi>King, Duke, General, L. Craven, Chief Juſtice,</hi> and others of the chiefeſt account in the Nation.</p>
                  <p>All that he ſaid againſt Papiſts, was in truth to juſtifie them; for no better Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could be found, then <hi>that ſeveral Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were buſie about the fire: that a ſuppoſed Jeſuite with a Bishop-ſattin Suit (over which was a frock) came and firied a Houſe (the fire it ſelf being,</hi> as the Libeller confeſſes, <hi>within ſix doors of it) and when he was apprehended, he ſpake Latine without any neceſſity.</hi> Then he tells, <hi>that one</hi> Carpenter <hi>(who is an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Prieſt) ſpoke for the Pope; &amp; that one or tws poor women were ſollicited to be Papiſts, and told, Now was the time, for if they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected this opportunity they should not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded hereafter.</hi> Nay, when nothing could be found againſt Papiſts, the <hi>Author cites Verſes</hi> (only found as he confeſſes in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hal) to threaten Proteſtants into Popery. And another Paper</hi> (writ by a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, as he ſays, newly turned Proteſtant, and found in a Pew by a Templer) <hi>in which he deſired all Proteſtants to purſue Papiſts, for they had a deſign to cut their throats.</hi> This is the effect of the Pamphlet, which I would
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:106777:117"/>
have every body read, for nothing can be a greater Vindication to us, then ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable and ſenceleſs Lies.</p>
                  <p>And truly, when I conſider theſe with the Stories againſt Papiſts <hi>in</hi> the <hi>Anſwer to Philanax,</hi> and how both are exactly made in the ſame mode and figure, I should not doubt but that <hi>Sieur du Moulin was</hi> the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi> were not the Libel ſo ſevere againſt his <hi>Countrymen</hi> the <hi>French.</hi> And pray Reader, conſider here the Juſtice of God, who is a God of retaliation always: for as the Dr. <hi>ſtrove to incite</hi> the people by his malitious falſities, which have not the leaſt probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of truth, and which would involve all the Loyal Catholiques of <hi>England</hi> with one or two guilty men, if there had been any ſuch; ſo now there are ſpread ſuch a number of Lies about our danger from the <hi>French,</hi> that people are ready to ſtone all they meet; and should the rabble run into a ſudden fury (as God knows but they may) Mr. <hi>du Moulin and his Family</hi> may perchance alſo go sharers with his <hi>Countrymen;</hi> for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a free Denizon would be thought a weak Argument by the outragious and overheated multitude.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Fire it ſelf, Reader, I

could never, as I ſaid, think it a deſign, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding a <hi>Protestant Hugonot confest the fact;</hi> and my reaſon was, becauſe no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in his Senſes would be ſo foolish with deliberation to venture his life, when 'twas not only odds he should be found out, but the fire would be ſtopt before it came to the third houſe. How often have we ſeen it in the narrow places of <hi>London?</hi> how often in the <hi>ill-building of Kings-ſtreet?</hi> how often <hi>in the Paper-houſes of Charing Croſſ, the Strand? &amp;c.</hi> and yet for all this (whether it happened by night or by day) it was quencht with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any remarkable ſpoil. Beſides, 'tis impoſsible, if either Proteſtants, Papiſts, Presbyterians, or Phanatiques had effected ſo great a work but we should have ſeen ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me proſecution of their deſign, as either to be in Arms, or inviting in our forreing E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, or at leaſtwiſe raiſing tumults in the hurry.

In short, after a ſtrict enquiry by the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> (that Supream Court) of the occaſion of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal fire, 'twas concluded to <hi>be the hand of God alone:</hi> and therefore I shall never think otherwiſe of it, <hi>though Hubert the Hugonot acknowledged himſelf the Author,</hi> and <note n="a" place="margin">

                     <pb n="235" facs="tcp:106777:118"/>

Concerning my Catalogue in general, you muſt know, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I have been often chid at <hi>London</hi> for omitting ſo many <hi>conſiderable Catholicks;</hi> but this I could not help, for the Catalogue was collected by Mr. <hi>Blunt</hi> (as I take it) who is to be much commended for his pains. When I printed the Apology, I was in ſuch haſt that I had not time to examine it nicely among my friends: I am now, Reader, alſo a great way from <hi>London,</hi> and therefore am forc'd to print it again without amendme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts; all that I can do at preſent is, to deſire a leaf
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:106777:127"/>
or two of white paper be added, in which we may write down (as we shall from time to time be informed) the names of thoſe <hi>Heroick men, that died in defence of their King and Country.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I wonder very much that this Miniſter is not ashamed to urge ſuch a foolish thing, <hi>viz. That more Protestants dyed in this War then of our Religion.</hi> This no body doubts of, and may well be, ſeeing we are not the hundredth part of the Nation, and yet by my imperfect Liſt it appears, that there were killed 190. <hi>Catholiques of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> when as (<hi>by the Liſt called the Royal-Martyr, and printed by</hi> Thomas Newcomb 1660.) there died in the War but 212. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> the reſt there named being Papiſts, as you may ſee, if you compare their names with my Catologue. Let the Word then judge, whether we ought not to have ſome compaſſion shewed us, and not to be thus calumniated by every impertinent Scribler.</p>
                  <p>Reader, thoſe that follow are the Miniſters exhortations, which are ſo like the Pedantry of his pulpit, that they alone without the reſt would have aſſured me of the Authors cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. That you may ſee what they are, I have divided them into eight ſeveral Advices or
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:106777:128"/>
Deſires, for ſo he is pleaſed to call them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt Sect. <hi>He deſires us to be content with our condition, and not under value the Liberty we now enjoy, if it exceed what was granted our Fathers.</hi> To this I ſay, Reader, that we are contented with any favour; yet 'twould be no arrogance if we require more them our Fathers had, becauſe it ſeems the <hi>Miniſter counts them all Traytors,</hi> when as we (as all the World knows) have shewn the utmoſt duty that Subjects can do.</p>
                  <p>Second Sect. <hi>Not to proclaim about the World for the paring of our nayls that we are perſecuted.</hi> To this I will give a larger Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in the <hi>Poſtſcript;</hi> and will only ſay here, that I defie any man, to shew me in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome a Party that bears their misfortunes with more ſubmiſſion then we.</p>
                  <p>Third Sect. <hi>To abhor them that wish diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances or Invaſions to ſettle Popery.</hi> To this I ſay, I think that nothing can make it more manifeſt that we do abhor ſuch men, then to ſee that all catholicks deteſted the <hi>French,</hi> eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then when we were <hi>forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by our friends, and they</hi> (as moſt thought) <hi>upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the point of landing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourth Sect. <hi>To keep our Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to our ſelves, and not expect ſuch harveſts as we had in the late confuſions.</hi> I ſay, Truly we are like to
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:106777:128"/>
keep it to our ſelves, for 'tis too ſevere to be embraced by Worldlings: and if care be not taken, the ſame times will come again; for I am ſure, crying againſt <hi>Papiſts</hi> was then the former Prologue; and though the aim of wicked people be ſtill the ſame, I hope the Epilogue will be far different.</p>
                  <p>Fifth Sect. <hi>Not to abuſe the weakneſs of dying perſons, nor convert the condemned Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners with drink, or by hopes of an eaſier way of ſalvation.</hi> To this I anſwer, The Miniſter ought not to call the condition of dying per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons weak, becauſe he and his brethren have always found them ſtrong; for I think no man ever heard that a Catholick was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by them at his death; and all have been able to reſiſt that in their Agony, to which worldly ends made ſome in their healths yeild. But now, if Catholicks have reconciled dying perſons, it muſt be wholly attributed to the truth of their Doctrine, for then all hopes of life being taken away, men will hearken to that reaſon, which du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring health (through temporal advantages) they earneſtly oppoſed: Nay, few of theſe, if they recover, ſtart back, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary perſevere. I ſay, theſe Converſions muſt needs proceed from the conviction of
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:106777:129"/>
the Truth, and not from hopes of any eaſier way of ſalvation, becauſe the Proteſtant way is far eaſier, and naturally more ſutable to the inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of dying men; <hi>For an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary truſt in the merits of Chriſt, and an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary contrition (uſual to all people that are ſaid not to die ill) will, according to the Reformed Hypotheſis, carry a man preſently to Heaven:</hi> when as this, in the opinion of any Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, and of the Agoniſing party himſelf, will bring him at fartheſt but to <hi>Purgatory.</hi> The entrance into Heaven is not ſo eaſie a paſſage with us; for it muſt be obtained with long Mortifications, conflicts, and labours, far greater then thoſe of <hi>Hercules;</hi> or elſe in men of ill lives, by ſome unexpreſſible ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy at the laſt gaſp, <hi>like that of the Thief on the Croſs.</hi> Vain therefore is the imagination of Proteſtants, for we have no other means to convert men, but, as I ſaid, the force of truth on their Conſciences, which truth in that ſtate they can diſcern (as men fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to miſerie, do oftentimes the vanities of the World) when as in ſtrength of body (through humane deſigns) <hi>like the adder, they stop their ears, let the Charmer charm never ſo ſweetly.</hi> Many advantages more (were it not time ho have done with the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:106777:129"/>
Miniſter) could I shew, that the Proteſtants have naturally over Catholicks, in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of dying people, but they never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted one (as I heard of) yet he confeſſes many have been by us.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this, I beſeech you, Reader, to look upon the lives of thoſe that leave the Proteſtant Religion to come to us, and then shew me any one of them, that lives <hi>worſe then he did before.</hi> Some perchance there b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> (and thoſe almoſt as rare as black ſwans them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) <hi>that mend not the depravity of their firſt manners, though none,</hi> as I ſaid, <hi>fall to worſe:</hi> but for the reſt, they apparently caſt off the old man, and shew the wonderful fruits of Grace by their holy life and converſation. On the other ſide, good Proteſtant Reader, name me that man amongſt you, <hi>who left the Catholique Church, and fell not immediately into all licentiouſneſs and vice;</hi> call but to mind <hi>Gage, Cary, Rookwood, Carpenter, Macedo</hi> the late converted <hi>Portugeze,</hi> or any other whom you pleaſe, and ſee, if they had <hi>one unclean ſpirit</hi> in them when they were Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, whether <hi>ſeven Divels,</hi> each worſe then the former, afterward entered not into them.</p>
                  <p>Truly, this is no wonder, becauſe they,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:106777:130"/>
forſook their Religion for liberty, and follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed the pattern of Luther their firſt Maſter and Teacher. For, <hi>he while he was a Monk pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht his body with watching and fasting,</hi> as <note n="a" place="margin">Catal. Doct<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 180.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>Sixth Sect. <hi>Not to hinder the courſe of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice on Criminals becauſe they are Papiſts.</hi> To this I ſay, I underſtand not what he means; but if any <hi>Papist</hi> has ſollicited for another of his Religion which was to die, I think 'tis not unlawful: No man of any Religion being denied to uſe their endeavours to ſave their Friends and Relations, that fall by chance into theſe misfortunes. But herein we shall obey his advice, for (unleſs it be by ſome unphappy duells) the Catholicks come ſeldome within the the reach of Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Laws.</p>
                  <p>Seventh Sect. <hi>That Priests diſguize not themſelves like Hectors, and poyſon Clubs and Coffee houſes with Phanatick diſcourſes.</hi> To this I anſwer, that if Phanaticiſm be the diſcourſe of a Prieſt, I doubt this Miniſter
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:106777:130"/>
is one alſo; for never did <hi>Jacob Behmen, Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fler,</hi> or any of the <hi>Fraternity</hi> write more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious, ſelf contradicting things then he; or that have in them more inferences of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and diſorder. In the next place, if <hi>Prieſts diſguize themſelves,</hi> I think 'tis not their faults; and if the Miniſter will get them liberty to wear their habit, I will be bound they shall never go more in <hi>Maſcara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de.</hi> Beſides, being thus known by every body, we then shall plainly ſee, who they be that at Taverns and Meeting-places corrupt the Youth. And truly, Reader, I am very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally certain, that this <hi>Anſwerer</hi> is a haunter of them, for the old Proverb tells us <hi>who calls Whore first.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eighth Sect. <hi>That Prieſts and Ieſuites fill not the World with Pamphlets,</hi> Philanaxes, <hi>Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, Apologies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which ſer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

If we come into the fair field of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, we shal not be declined; and the Minister thinks his party not indebted to us upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</hi> Good Mr. Parſon, you very well know that the <hi>Philanaxes, Exhortations, Apologies,</hi> &amp;c. were writ by <hi>Lay-m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n,</hi> and therefore you might have ſpared this laſt advice, ſince 'twas as needleſs as the reſt of your
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:106777:131"/>
falſe and malitious writing.</p>
                  <p>And by the way remember how you have perverted and falſely commented on a Loyal mans learned work, <hi>this very Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which you mention.</hi> His words, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, are theſe: <hi>As for the Roman Paſtors indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect power over Kings</hi> in ordine ad Spiritualia, <hi>by which the Sea Apoſtolical in ſome rare Caſes hath (at the requeſt of all Chriſtians) procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to cenſure, and deprive Kings (a thing ſo much talkt of, and ſo little underſtood by the Reformed Divines) I leave that Question to be decided by the two Supream Powers when occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion shall be for it' which may not happen to the end of the World: It being a very rare Caſe, in which it were not better that ſuch matters were wholly left till the day of Judgment.</hi> Now the ſum of this is, as the Miniſter ſays, that if the Pope should deprive our King, <hi>this Catholick</hi> would not meddle between them. When as his true meaning was, <hi>That this caſe between Popes and Kings</hi> will happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeldome, if ever; and should it happen, he will not as to the right (or, <hi>via juris</hi>) determine the nice pretenſions of each party; yet this does not argue, but that he would ſide, as to action (or, <hi>via facti) with his Prince against any perſon whatſoever.</hi> And thus we daily ſee the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:106777:131"/>
                     <hi>French</hi> do, who ſwear they cannot tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Law called Salique</hi> be forged; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Juſtice <hi>the now Male-Line,</hi> or <hi>the English</hi> (becauſe deſcended from the Heirs general) ought to have the Kingdom; but ſtill they declare, they will fight for their preſent Monarch againſt all Mankind. This, I ſay, is the ſenſe of the Author of the Exhortation, and <hi>this I dare ingage</hi> he <hi>shall ſubſcribe to.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now concerning <hi>Philanax,</hi> how poorly it is anſwered, I believe the Miniſter would be ashamed to confeſs: and yet (how poorly ſoever) he has made uſe of it; <hi>Nay of the moſt contemptible and groundleſs follies in the whole Book.</hi> I am ſure, the man needed not to have challenged us into the fair field of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, having there-in been more then Combatants, ever ſince the breaking out of <hi>Luther.</hi> Nor can there be any Argument of more generous bravery then this, That though our Prieſts in <hi>England</hi> have been hunted from hole to hole, their Papers of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſeized, ſome in the midſt of their works hanged, no Library, no Preſs, and if to day well ſettled, perchance forc'd on the morrow to flie; yet for all theſe diſavantages (which no Proteſtant feels) they never omitted to
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:106777:132"/>
write things of uſe, or to anſwer all ſorts of Books, that durſt appear againſt our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or manners. Fear not therefore, good Miniſter, that either <hi>Clergy</hi> or <hi>Laity</hi> will be behindhand with you in this affair; and I think Dr. <hi>Pierce will tell you he found it to ſome purpoſe from both</hi> Nor shall you, Sir, whilſt I live (be ready again, as ſoon as you pleaſe) want an humble Servant to shew you your many willful errors and miſtakes.</p>

               <p>For my own part, I not only deteſt Blood, but find all Catholicks do; for if in many Countries (where the Prince and people, as I shewed you before, are Catholicks) the Proteſtants have not only open Churches, but <hi>alſo publick employments,</hi> and in no place this is granted by the Reformed to Papiſts; then muſt it needs follow, that we are much kinder to you, then you to us, even in the matters of Religion. Beſides this, Catholicks are ſo tender, that the <hi>Inquiſition it ſelf</hi> is permitted in no Kingdom where Hereſie is numerous: nor ought we to be blamed, if (in a Country wholly obedient to the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:106777:134"/>
Church) we ſtrive to keep out all other Sects and opinions.</p>
               <p>This cannot be jniuſtice, becauſe to all Mankind we grant the ſame liberty. Who is it, that morally blames the <hi>Moors of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick (being of one Profeſſion</hi>) for keeping out even the Goſpel it ſelf?

they may percha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce all ſuffer according to the eſtablishtt Laws of a Natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but if they grow numerous, pity cauſes us now to punish nobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with death, but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prayers, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preaching, then Books &amp;c. are <hi>the fitteſt Arms</hi> to deſtroy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

'Tis not we that proclaim our perſecution (as this Miniſter taxes us) in forreign parts, but the <hi>Agents of Princes,</hi> who comment as they pleaſe on things, and fill <hi>Europe</hi> with noiſe, that the <hi>English</hi> of all people are moſt ungrateful, being earneſt to have that done againſt their <hi>tried friends,</hi> which <hi>Cromwel</hi> was almoſt ashamed to do, <hi>though we were his profes't and ſworn Enemies.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:106777:135"/>I shall never omit to render my thanks to Almighty God, that I know not one who ſtaggers the leaſt in duty for all this our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and ſuffering: Who is it that now loves the <hi>Dutch</hi> one whit the more? or who is it that contemns not a <hi>Frenchman</hi> whilſt he is an Enemy to <hi>England?</hi> Nor did ever any Party in this Iſle (<hi>That deemed it ſelf op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt by Laws</hi>) before fail of favouring thoſe, that were in hoſtility with the Kingdom.

And for the <hi>Independants,</hi> all who were in pay in <hi>Holland, openly abjured their Countrey,</hi> and many of them headed by <hi>Doleman,</hi> did us the <hi>miſchief at Chattam:</hi> for forreign Nations muſt never hope to foil the <hi>English,</hi> without the additional courage of <hi>English.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Juſt contrary to this has been the proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure of Catholicks; for not only the <hi>Scotish Papiſts</hi> with their Commander my Lord <hi>Douglas</hi> left <hi>France</hi> upon the breach, but valiantly alſo fought with the loſs of many of their lives, when thoſe <hi>Traytors</hi> (as I ſaid at <hi>Chattham</hi>) aſſiſted the <hi>Dutch</hi> laſt ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. I need not repeat how zealous the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:106777:135"/>
                  <hi>Popish Guards</hi> were in all theſe three years Wars, every body being an eye-witneſs of it; and for the <hi>Papiſts abroad,</hi> I am ſure they have been ſo earneſt for the Honor of the Nation, that at <hi>Paris, Flandres, Rome, Liege,</hi> &amp;c. they were ſtill detecting the <hi>Dutch forgeries,</hi> and proclaiming our Victories to all People. Nay the <hi>Holla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders</hi> were ever ſo ſenſible of the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the <hi>English</hi> Catholicks in behalf of their <hi>Country,</hi> that when <hi>De Wit</hi> was ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for a Guard, he cauſed it to be published in the <hi>Gazzets of Amſterdam,</hi> that he was in danger of his life, <hi>for that two of our Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits had undertaken to kill him.</hi> Conſider therefore (Loyal Sirs) our ſervices: and though in themſelves they are but Duties, yet Duties may ſometimes merit a reward, at leaſt for the inciting of others.</p>
               <p>Nothing aſſuredly can ever ſettle more our Country in peace, then the <hi>free liberty of Religion:</hi> and if the tenderneſs of the Kings heart (as all the world knows him merciful) should move him to hear the cry of his late Enemies, and grant them the enjoyment of their Conſciences; certainly no body could think it ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, if he gave the ſame freedom to us his friends, who never yet deſerted him or his Father in their greateſt misfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

Nay, moreover, if there be ſtill pity left amongſt mankind, upon that ſcore alſo (<hi>had Papiſts no other Plea</hi>) we might more juſtly pretend to <hi>Indulgence</hi> then any <hi>Nonconformiſt</hi> whatſoever For none of the <hi>Sects</hi> can in reality alledge more, then <hi>that the Proteſtant manner of worship is nauſeous, and of no edification to them:</hi> my Reaſon is, becauſe we ſee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t leaſt the Rich in all Countries <hi>go often to Church,</hi> and yet are owned ſtill members by the Party. Now ſuch a Conformity is diametrically oppoſite to the Conſcience of a Catholick, <hi>and any ſuch Communion is a deadly ſin.</hi> We are not here to Diſpute, whether Papiſts are not too ſcrupulous: for this Argument may be uſed againſt any one of a contrary Judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. But ſuppoſing ſuch and ſuch things are the points of a <hi>Religion,</hi> and favour deſired in the ſuſpenſion of Laws; I ſay, Mercy is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them, that according to the <hi>profeſſion of their Faith,</hi> cannot comply without ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, then for thoſe that do it without ſuch offence: and truly, I am not ſo diſingenious as to believe, that were this Conformity in their own Opinion a ſin, that ſo many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of all Orders amongſt the <hi>Presbiterians</hi> and <hi>Independents</hi> would have gone to <hi>Church,</hi>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:106777:136"/>
or that their reſpective <hi>Congregations</hi> would have ſtill received them as theirs.</p>
               <p>This favour I crave, I wish for all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as well as for my ſelf: for I cannot be ſo partial as to think my Conſcience ought not to be forced, and yet that my Neighbour may diſpence with the ſcruples he finds in his. Punishment never leſſens the Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but always heightens <hi>Zeal,</hi> and draws ſometimes wellmeaning men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe Leagued <hi>Factions,</hi> which eaſe and favour would aſſuredly have prevented.</p>
               <p>What thoughts can men have when they find not themſelves oppreſt, but the publick intereſt of their Country? It follows not alſo, that Toleration prejudices the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht <hi>Religion of a Nation;</hi> for experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally we ſee, the <hi>Calviniſts of France</hi> never had fewer <hi>Proſelytes</hi> then when they were ſecureſt from Maſſacres, and the like. Whilſt the Houſe of <hi>Valois</hi> was in being, which uſed the great rigour they ſpeake of, their Hiſtory declares how <hi>numerous</hi> they grew; but ſince thoſe of <hi>Burbon</hi> were Kings, who toucht neither Life nor Eſtate (only took away Gariſons, the Neſts of Rebellion) I never found they much <hi>vaunted</hi> in theire <hi>Converſions</hi> and increaſe.</p>

                  <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> Religion is God Almightie's own Cauſe, and (for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the Elect) <hi>Hereſies</hi> are permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. 'Tis he only (and that at the laſt day alſo) that shall ſatisfactorily convince us all, who is in the right: <hi>Perſecution</hi> therefore may eaſily diſioint a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> but can never deſtroy this <hi>Hydra</hi> when she is fully rouz'd.</p>
               <p>But now afore I end, I muſt here declare, if any other ill men (ſuch as this Miniſter and his <hi>Momentous friend</hi> who writ the <hi>Diſcourſe of the Religion of England</hi>) hope by Perſecution of Papiſts, to make us the leſs paſſionate for the Government when their Plots are ripe, they cozen themſelves, and reckon without their Hoſt: for the Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers-Cloak (<hi>which is our tried Allegeance to lawful Power</hi>) can never be blown up by a Wind. And if Papiſts were ſo fleeting, as for affliction to renounce a duty, which they hold be the Command of God; why should they, do you think, ſuffer for Conſcience, ſince by going to Church, or taking Oaths, they may, when they pleaſe, enjoy the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Priviledges of their Birthright? Take this therefore for a certain Maxime, <hi>That be who is faithful to God, can never be unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his Country:</hi> and I am ſure in all kinds of

               <p>But to conclude, no Kingdom (I dare ſay) looſes-ſo much as ours by their cry againſt Catholicks: for 'tis very certainly true, were not this a Bar (and he who doubts it, will ſoon be convinc'd, let him ſtep but beyond Sea) that the <hi>Spanish Provinces in the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds</hi> (and for a ſmall matter with their Kings conſent, as his caſe lately ſtood) would joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully put themſelves under the <hi>gentle yoak</hi> of our eaſie Government: nor are they in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi> shie to say, that had not <hi>Papiſts</hi> been ſo harraſſed with us, they would not have ſlipt ſo many late oportunities of returning to their <hi>Lawful Duke and Soveraign.</hi>
