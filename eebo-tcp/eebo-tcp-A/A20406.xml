            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

had recouered their former flouriſh by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yeres timely alteration, but his deſperate fortune had no hope of an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie ſpring to calme the winter of his woe. Drowned in this déepe meditation, he procéeded penſiue, but he had not walked farre, when he eſpied a faire broade Oake, whoſe ſpatious branches enuirond the ground lying vnderneath with a ſhady circle. There hée determined to reſt awhile his bodie wearied by long iourneyes, and ſomewhat diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthen his ſoule by diſplaying his ſorrowes.

O that I might equall <hi>Orpheus</hi> in arte as I excéede him in anguiſh: the powerfull vertue of his heauenly tunes, amaſed furious beaſtes, ſtayed fluent ſtreames, rayſed ſtones, aſſembled trées, mouing ſenſe in ſenſeleſſe things. Deſcending to the ſilent vauts of <hi>Acheron,</hi> hee cauſed ghoſts to grone, ſhadowes to ſighe, effecting relen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoughts in hels remorſeleſſe iudges: but were I his péere in that profeſſion, I would do more, enforcing the tyrant not touched then with ſuch a ſympathy, to leaue his luſt, and graunt me my loue.

But aye me, what comfort can <hi>Arcadia</hi> affoord, from whoſe coaſts the windes fury did violently driue her? Hath then the Sea gréedie of ſuch rare gaine ſwallowed her, not ſatiſfied with <hi>Helle,</hi> nor glutted with <hi>Hero?</hi> No, but <hi>Neptune</hi> deſirous of change, hath receyued her into his watrie Palace, and crowned her Empreſſe of his liquide Monarchy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding the Sea-Nymphs to attend on her, the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens to delight her with the ſwéeteneſſe of their enchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting harmonie, Dolphins to wafte her Chariot, <hi>Phocae</hi> to gard her, and the <hi>Tritons</hi> to ſound her Maieſtie.

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5639:7"/>Friend, (for ſo I may tearme you without offence) the day is almoſt ſpent, and the night dangerous for ſuch as you are, or at leaſt ſeeme to bée, I meane a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Accept then a ſimple lodging in my Cottage, with ſuch homely fare, as Shepheards houſes yeelde, and when to morrowes Sunne ſhall diſplay his faire (though late forceleſſe) beames, you may proſecute your enten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded iourney, wherein, if my directions may further you, you ſhall finde me ready to afford them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arisbas</hi> wondering at ſuch rare humanitie harbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in thoſe contemptible wéedes, made a long pauſe as if he had enioynde his mouth to perpetuall ſilence, at laſt ſhapt this reply.</p>
            <p>Friend, (for ſo your proffered courteſie bindes me to tearme you) muſe not that ſobs interrupt my wordes, or ſorrowes ſeaſon my diſcourſe, which onely comfort my fates haue aſſignde mée. What I was, I liſt not now repeate: what I am, you ſée, I grieue. A lodging in your Cottage I gladly accept: your countrey fare ile thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully receiue. Your directions will be as néedefull as my diſtreſſe is notable. My bodie wearied much through tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, requires longer reſt then one nightes repoſe. My minde wrapped in a Chaos of confuſions, expects eaſe by earneſt conference. I haue a ſecret to diſcloſe, a ſorrowe to diſciphre, which while I ſmother in priuate paſſions, I ſhall in ſtead of comfort reape diſcontent, but by diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my fortune, I may diſcharge my fancie. And if this double fauour doe procéede from you, then in requitall of your courteſie, firſt, I beſéech <hi>Iupiter Xenius,</hi> the patrone of hoſpitalitie, and protector of ſtrangers, to bleſſe your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, proſper your attempts, &amp; enrich your ſtore with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped plentie. Next, I vowe by that bright lampe heauens ornament, that if fortune (as ſhe is neuer ſtable) rayſe me from ſo lowe an ebbe to the wonted height of my good hap, I will remunerate your kindneſſe with moſt ample re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence.

            <p>
               <hi>Damon</hi> (ſuch was the Shepheards name) ſéeing maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie in his lookes, grauitie ſeated in diſguiſe, royaltie ſuted in baſe attire, gathered by theſe probable coniectures, that he could be of no meane degrée: mooued therefore with a déeper remorſe, he curteouſly intreated him to repaire to his ſimple lodging, and remayne there till fortune ſhould conuert her frowns into fauors, proteſting, that though he could not entertaine him as the qualitie of his condition required, yet he would ſupply in good will the diſabling defects of his lowe eſtate. Which wordes wrought ſuch chéerefulneſſe in the heart of <hi>Arisbas,</hi> that he yéelded him millions of thanks, and accompanyed him to his houſe: which, when he entred, he found not gorgeouſly emboſt, yet gayly trimmed, not courtly, yet comely, though home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet handſome, and he was kindly welcommed by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> wife, who gréeted him with a merry countenance, being by her huſband certified of his fortune. Soiourning there ſome ſmall time, he ſought by ſundry meanes to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh the impreſſion of his ſorrowe, but being vnable to finde eaſe in eaſe, he reſolued to depart, and finiſh his ſearch by finding his loue, or ending his life. Thus ready to effect his reſolution, he determined to enforme <hi>Damon</hi> at full of his eſtate, knowing that he being both borne and brought vp in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> could not be ignorant of ſuch acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents as fortune there had acted. As they walked together on a day through <hi>Damons</hi> ground conferring of ſundry matters, the heate growing exceſſiue, they haſted to a coole ſhade, &amp; there ſate downe. <hi>Arisbas</hi> loth to omit ſo méete oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, ſéeing opportunitie friend to his deſire, began thus.</p>
            <p>Friend <hi>Damon,</hi> ſith many reſpects ſhorten my intended reſidence, I haue reſolued with ſpeede to leaue you, though for euer bound to loue you, my fortune enforceth the one, your courteſie cauſeth the other. But before my departure, I will diſcloſe to you a ſecret, which may moue
<pb facs="tcp:5639:8"/>
you to meruaile, and me to melancholy. A ſecret ſo rare, ſo ruthfull, that euery periode may effect a paſſion, each clauſe a corroſiue, wherein you ſhall ſée a world of wonders plotted by loue, and perfourmed by fortune. For know, that you haue lodged a Prince, whoſe maieſtie maſking in diſguiſe of miſerie, droupt in a lower ebbe then might ſéeme a <hi>decorum</hi> in my former dignitie. If you muſe at this, then marke the reſt, and lend attentiue eare to my tale.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyprus</hi> of all neighbour Iles the nobleſt, is my fathers Kingdome, the ſucceſſion of whoſe eſtate, right of birth, and title of inheritance, will by due claime after his deceaſe, tranſferre to mée. But what auailes it to be inueſted with a diademe &amp; want delight? When the date of my nonage was expired, hee deſirous to linke me in ſome honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable alliance, determined to prouide a wife with an ample dowrie, and large hopes of future good haps. Many Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Ionia,</hi> and Péeres of <hi>Europe,</hi> deſirous to inſert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into ſo royall a kinred, and to haue intereſt in ſo noble a Familie, offered their daughters with large por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But onely the Prince of <hi>Lemnos</hi> ſped in his ſuite, whoſe allyance my Father accepted, ſhadowing his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which was aymed at hoped profit, for the match was concluded with this condition, that if the Prince dyed without heire Male (as he then had none, nor may by any likelihoode hope of any) then the enioying of his eſtate, and poſſeſſion of his Crowne, ſhould in right of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſcend to mée. This compact thus ſubtilly contriued, was by agréement of both our Parents confirmed, ſo that nothing wanted to finiſh the bargaine and ſtrengthen the contract, but my conſent, whereof my Father ſeeming to conceiue no doubt, made me priuie to his proceedings, commanding me to deliuer my reſolution in briefe and playne tearmes. I, who miſliking his choiſe, would not conforme my thoughts to an others direction, perceiuing the old mans drift, yet diſſembling my intent, anſwered
<pb facs="tcp:5639:9"/>
in effect thus, that my yeares were fewe, my experience ſmall, my affections frée, a ſole life beſt fitting my fancie. Yet did I in humilitie ſubmit me to his diſpoſing, onely crauing a little reſpit to ſummon my ſenſes, and conceite a change, deſiring him to impute the not liking of ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable an eſtate, to the imperfections of my youth. He ſuſpecting no fraude in theſe faire ſpeaches, thought it ſufficient that I was ſo flexible, and referd the times appointment to mine owne choiſe. But I déeming nothing more diſhonourable then to meaſure affection by money, or leuell the eye, fancies herault, at a gainefull, though inglorious obiect, pronounced lucre an hereſie in loue, and eſtéeming ſuch mercenary thoughts méeter for a pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant than a Prince, would rather neuer marry then ſo marre. For ſhould I wed mine owne woe? Should I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept her a ſpouſe, whoſe beautie I beheld not, whoſe beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour I knewe not, of whoſe worth I was vncertaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was vnſéene? How could that loue be conſtant, that affection permanent, which had no déeper roote then the parents naked conſent, no ſurer ſeale then a bare ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the firſt fight? Yet, (ſuch was the inclination of my youth) I earneſtly deſired to fixe my fancy on ſome fortunate obiecte worthie of a Princes fauour. Many both gorgeous and gallant Dames attended in my Fathers Court, yet none fit, though all faire. While fancy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced ſuch tumults in my thoughts, there arriued in <hi>Cyprus</hi> a noble Epirote, ſurnamed <hi>Ariſtophon,</hi> a man noble in déede, graced with all ornaments which nature might afford, or vertue challenge. He was baniſhed from his natiue ſoyle by tyrannous doome of his vnnaturall Souereigne, being falſely accuſed to attempt an innoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the State, and plot ſome treacherous practiſe with the King of <hi>Macedon.</hi> For it was vniuſtly ſurmiſed by ſome, and beléeued by all, that he had conſpired to betray to him the countrey of <hi>Ambracia,</hi> whereof he was Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and had annexed it by force of Armes to the Crowne
<pb facs="tcp:5639:9"/>
of <hi>Epirus.</hi> Although his integritie ſhould haue cleared him from ſuch a crime, yet, (as it commonly happens) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie oppreſſed by iniurie could not preuaile: leauing therefore his vnkinde countrey, deſpairing of returne, yet bearing with manlike patience the burthen of his exile, he repaired to my Fathers Court, who reléeued him with princely liberalitie, allowing him an honourable penſion for maintenance of his eſtate: for hauing oft employd him in weightie affaires, and finding him fortunate in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieuements, he perceiued by theſe experiments that he was garniſhed with all glories of nobilitie, graue in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, valiant armes: of dauntleſſe courage, ſpotleſſe truth. But leauing this digreſſion, I will returne to the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed entent of my diſcourſe. Hée brought with him his daughter and onely childe named <hi>Timoclea,</hi> a creature endued with ſuch ornaments of the bodie, graced with ſuch qualities of the minde, that it ſeemed nature and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue concurring in one, had conſpired to make her a péere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe proofe-péece of their vnited perfections: and though fortune fretting at their fauours ſo largely beſtowed ſought to croſſe their courteſies with her cruelties, yet could ſhe not blemiſh the bright-ſhining worth of ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous a wonder. But as a ſmall cloude in a cleare day may ſomewhat ſtayne, not wholy ſtop the Sunnes light, ſo fortunes malice did rather darken then drowne her merits, in whoſe Iuory browes Chaſtitie ſate enthronizde as gardian of her lookes, Modeſtie teinting her chéekes with a vermilian dye of Virgin-red maiden-bluſhes, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blaſond her a map of mirrors. Maieſtie whiche beautie claymed, birth challenged, loue commaunded, guided her geſtures with ſuch decent proportion, as <hi>Iuno</hi> wanted in the pride of her glorie, or <hi>Minerua</hi> in the prime of her pompe. Theſe gifts theſe glories did ſo enchaunt, enthrall, enforce me, that hauing ſcarce viewde her, I vowde her mine, or my ſelfe not mine owne, ſuch déepe impreſſions were wrought in mine affections. Loue hauing wonne
<pb facs="tcp:5639:10"/>
and wounded me with mine owne weapons, finding an eaſy entrance into mine heart through mine eyes, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of my diſeaſe, and diſcouerers of my deſire, diſgari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſond my thoughts of wonted fancies, conuerting my ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace into ſobs, my delights into deſpaire. I vnable to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteine ſo grieuous a burthen, perceiuing that the more I ſtroue to allay the heate, the more thoſe ſmothered cinders reuiude in quenchleſſe flames, Flames which <hi>Aetna</hi>-like boild in my breſt, reſembling the horrors of Mount <hi>Ghi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belloes</hi> firie rage, which vomits millions of vapors, and darts heapes of ſulphur from the glowing centre, being I ſay torturde with troubles, I reſolued to finde eaſe for my loue, or end for my life, ſuing to her bountie which had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done me by her beautie. I am ſo briefe in relating my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, as I was then loth to defer the execution of mine enterpriſe that ſo highly concernd the hope of my good hap. Finding her on a time in company with other, I ſingled her from the reſt, my intent not ſuſpected by any. When we were alone, I hauing awhile dallyed with common deuiſes to enterteine her with varietie of talke, in the end though I could not Orator-like paynt my paſſions in figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue tearmes, nor contriue them with rhetoricall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, yet did I playnely diſcouer my affection, proteſting my preſent loue, vowing my future loyaltie, producing cauſes, deſiring comfort, alleadging her worth, my wants, ſeaſoning my words with many ſighes. She in a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerike humor (but it was a pretty choler) framde a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous yet cruell anſwere, courteous in her words, enterla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with reuerent ſpeaches, cruell in that vnkinde repulſe, yet kinde rebukes, not omitting to inſert the reſpect of her owne honor, and the regard of her fathers ſafetie: but concluding her friendly anger in a calmer veine, ſhe prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in ſubmiſſion all ſeruice loue excepted and her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour reſerued. Although the laſt clauſe afforded ſufficient matter for a freſh reply, yet did her conſtancie ſo confound me, that being vnable to vtter one word, I brake off our
<pb facs="tcp:5639:10"/>
parle abruptly, and ſummoning my fancies to a retreate, I reſolued to attempt a ſecond onſet, wherein being like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe vanquiſhed by her vertues, yet rather animated then amated (theſe kinde conflicts kindling not quenching my flaming paſſions) I attached a third onſet: but hauing therein receiued a ſharper foyle, I proceeded to a fourth, of all moſt fatall, for ſhe taunted me with contemptuous tearmes, and yéelding a full denyall, ſealed with a ſtorme of frownes, ſhe departed, leauing me amid my diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent plunged in a ſea of dangerous conceipts, muſing on my miſhaps, meditating on her rigor, deſperate of all hope, deſtitute of all delights: but my paſſions were ſuch that I could not conceale them vndiſcouered: ſuch my ſorrows, that I could not ſmother them in ſilence: thus therefore I vtt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:5639:11"/>
thwarted with ſorrowe, can hatch no pleaſant conceipts ſeaſoned with ſwéetneſſe, and where ſadneſſe houers, no Muſes harbour, but to our purpoſe. This melancholy (whereof I ſpake before) procured a grieuous maladie, which ſhe at the firſt ſuppoſed feigned, knowing that I would plot all ſleights, and leaue no ſubtilties vnaſſaide to circumuent her, but when the Phyſicions report, my Fathers ſorrowe, the generall rumor bruted through the Courte had aſſured her of mine eſtate, ſhe thinking it enough to cauſe but too much to continue my danger, came with her Father to viſit me. How then I was affected, I refer to their cenſures whoſe fortunes haue reſembled mine. All the powers of my bodie being tranſferd into mine eyes the contriuers of my then-ſéeing diſcontent, were employed in viewing her outward glories, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing her inward graces. When I remembred her laſt tearmes, I trembled at each thought, but weighing that being endued with all vertues, ſhe could not want that of clemency hauing the other of courteſie nor be voide of gentleneſſe being garniſhed with far-deriued gentilitie, I ſuppoſed this the fitteſt time to ſpéede if now I ſpake. When her father tooke leaue, I craude his daughters longer preſence vnder pretence of paſſing away the time, ſhe not vnwillingly aſſented though ſmelling the drift of my demaund, and he both accepted and ratified my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, commaunding her to tarrie. When we were alone, I pleaded in effect thus, though not ſo boldly as before, Firſt, I alleadged that my preſent ſickneſſe ſo dangerous, my former vowes ſo ſerious, might warrant the truth of mine vnfeigned paſſions. Next, that I meant not to diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour her by affecting her, ſith I craude onely to make her my lawfull ſpouſe, which fauor if ſhe would vouchſafe to afforde, I vowed to incurre all hazards for the preſeruing of her honor, proteſting to leaue <hi>Cyprus,</hi> to fruſtrate the pretended mariage with the Prince of <hi>Lemnus</hi> his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and liue with her the onely bliſſefull heauen of my

life, and ſtay of mine happineſſe, as baniſht in ſome other countrey till my Fathers anger were appeaſed and his conſent obteyned, whoſe royall eſtate to me as eldeſt by right belonging, when I ſhould by ſucceſſion in that farre-renowned Kingdome fully enioy, I promiſed to inueſt her with a Diademe, and Crowne her Quéene of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, as ſhe was already ſouereigne of my content. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my plaints with an humble petition, deſiring her to pittie mine eſtate, accept my ſeruice, and compaſſionate my ſorrowes, ſith in loue-diſeaſes they onely can heale which cauſde the hurt. She ſhowring a ſtreame of ſiluer-teares from thoſe chriſtall fountaines bright lamps of loues light, ſuch as might beſeeme <hi>Venus</hi> to ſhead on her déere <hi>Adonis, Aurora</hi> on her Sonne <hi>Memnon,</hi> ſhapt this anſwere.</p>
            <p>Pardon (deareſt Lord) the follies of a ſelly mayde, or rather weigh with indifference the cauſes of her coyneſſe, for ſo you tearme my denyall, which if folly had effected, or diſdeigne cauſed, I had merited more blame then a world of puniſhments might expiate. But ſith the reſpect of my Fathers ſafetie, and the regard of mine owne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour moued me to be ſo rigorous in my replyes, I hope to finde the more fauour in the offer of my ſatiſfaction, which with all ſubmiſſion I humbly preſent. As it grieues me to be the author of your preſent danger, ſo it glads me not a little that in me it reſts (as you affirme) to cure your diſcontent, and be the happy author of your health, wherein if mine endeuors may further you, I will not faile in diligence, nor be ſlacke in my deuoire, but with this condition, that you obſerue your promiſe of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing mine honour from all preiudice: then leauing all, and onely louing you, I will for euer liue with you, but if you violate that vowed couenant, then is the bargaine cancelled by ſo heinous a forfeit.</p>
            <p>Theſe words conteining ſuch comfort, affoording ſuch content to my halfe-withered hope, did ſo relieue my fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

ſpirits, that they recouered their wonted vigor, and I my former ſtrength, being within ſhort time reſtored to mine health by this good hap.

Being loth to defer time, or dally with fortune, I obſerued this order in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmance of my plotted enterpriſe.

moſt willingly to vndertake it, but requeſted a round ſumme, which I granting, gaue him part in hand, with ſufficient aſſurance for the reſt. Thus the bargaine being ſolemnly knit betwéene vs, hée wilde mée that I ſhould come with my ſuppoſed Siſter the next night very late, béeing the time prefixed for his departure, and tolde me ſecretly in friendly ſort, as one ſtranger to an other, that hée had aboord certayne vnlawfull and vncuſtomed wares, the ſale whereof would be very gaynefull to him, but if it were reuealed, would worke his vtter vndoing, which cauſed him attempt meanes to launch thence by ſtealth.

Leauing him therefore and returning to the Court, I repaired to <hi>Timoclea,</hi> certified her of my procéedings in all points, willed her to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber her vowed promiſe and plighted faith, enfourmed her of all things néedefull to be done. She not failing mine expectation, promiſed her readineſſe at the appointed time. I leauing her, packt ſuch treaſure as I could gather in haſte, and attended the aſſigned houre, which being come, taking her with me, I came to the Hauen, and béeing ſpéedily conueyed aboord, found all things ready, anchors weighed, ſayles ſpread at our comming: within ſhort ſpace we got out of the Hauen, and before morning were farre enough from the coaſt of <hi>Cyprus.</hi> Foure dayes wée ſayled merrily, hauing a luſty gale in the poope, which draue vs gallantly forward.

I of all moſt deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to leaue the ſea, fearing purſuite of my fathers po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, condeſcended to his requeſt. Being ſet on land, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing vp and downe a while, I was drowned in viewe of
<pb facs="tcp:5639:13"/>
thoſe delights which that fertile ſoyle yéelded, déeming that it was <hi>Arcadia,</hi> or ſome place bordering on it, partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating like pleaſures with it. Then began I to conceit varieties of imagined bliſſe, iudging this a fit place for mée and my <hi>Timoclea</hi> to reſt in a while, till ſhe had reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered her health, being much impaired by her ſea-iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Hetherto Fortune ſéemed friendly to mine attempts, but now, leaſt ſhe ſhould be vnlike her ſelfe, ſhe obſcurde the ſun-ſhine of my happineſſe with clouds of her incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, for the wauering Goddeſſe doomd my ſolace to be thwarted with eternall ſorrowes. In a moment the windes rayſing the Sea in billowes, ſecluded mée from returne. He which attended my comming in the Boate, fearing to be intercepted by the ſtorme, rowed backe in haſte, leauing me, yet did hée hardly eſcape drowning. I though too late weighing the weathers change, haſted backe, but miſſed the Boate, and him that guided it. Then I beheld the Ship toſſed amid thoſe tempeſtuous waues, ſometimes hoiſed to heauen, preſently plunged in the <hi>Oceans</hi> deapth. Accurſed eyes the vnhappy beholders of my deareſt <hi>Timocleas</hi> troubles whereof ſhe was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, I too worthy which brought her to this perill, for whoſe danger drouping more then dreading mine owne, I made ſignes to them aboord, which anſwered me with the like, intimating as I did gueſſe their deſire and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to take me in when the ſtorme ſhould ceaſſe. I ſomewhat comforted with this colde hope, ſate downe néere the ſhore looking for a calme. Dayes light decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, nights darkeneſſe ſhadowed the earth, but in this obſcuritie of all things I continued my abode, expecting dayes returne. But when <hi>Phoebus</hi> poſting from the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes</hi> had remounted the Eaſterne hill, and burniſhed heauen with his glittering beames, I hoping to ſee my wiſhed obiect, viewed onely the voyd Sea. What ſhould I then do? exclaime? I did it: accuſe? whome? the Gods? I would not: Fortune? I durſt not, for I hoped her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
<pb facs="tcp:5639:14"/>
might be regayned. But ay me, my hope was force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, becauſe fruteleſſe. The windes fury was aſſwaged, but no Ship ſéene, no hope of returne. I ſpent the ſecond night in this booteleſſe expectation, which being paſt, and day reſtored, I ſummond my thoughts to conſult, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termind ſith vaine ſorrowe without ſearch could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle, to ſéeke her my loſt loue, and finde her if the earth affoorded her. Riſing in this reſolution, and haſting by the coaſt, hauing mine eyes alwayes towards the Sea, I came to a deſolate and almoſt diſpeopled Hauen, where finding a <hi>Cretan</hi> Pinneſſe ready rigd, and furniſhed for departure, I ſpéedily embarqued my ſelfe therein, but neither in my paſſage at Sea, nor in my ſearch on land after my arriuall, could I finde any certaintie of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. Paſſing thence by Ship to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> I had like ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, for expecting there moſt comfort, I found leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Though there diſcouraged, yet I drouped not, but proceeded: no Ile in the <hi>Ionian</hi> or <hi>Aegaean</hi> Seas was by me vnſéene or vnſearched. Failing in theſe, I came by Sea to <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> thence to <hi>Epirus,</hi> thence to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> then forward into <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> from <hi>Theſſaly</hi> to <hi>Thrace,</hi> enquiring diligently in all the Port townes of theſe Prouinces, and not finding any comfort, not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any newes of what I moſt deſired, I entred into <hi>Arcadia,</hi> and met happily with you amid my laments. Thus haue you heard the ſumme of my ſorrowes briefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly related, whereto if you can affoord ſuch eaſe as I expect, you ſhall not onely ſaue the life and ſalue the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a diſtreſſed Prince, but make him of all moſt fortunate. Héere words melted into teares, teares that made a periode to his plaints. <hi>Damon</hi> halfe in a paſſion after ſome pauſe replyed thus.</p>
            <p>The ſtrangenes of your diſcourſe hath ſo amazed me, that I ſcarce knowe howe to anſwere. I ſhould deriue my beginning from crauing pardon for ſo homely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terteyning ſo great a perſonage: but the ignorance of
<pb facs="tcp:5639:14"/>
your eſtate affoords ſufficient matter of excuſe to ſhield mée from reproach. Yet if the ſequele of my report doe in any ſort ſatiſfye you, I requeſt that the ſolace which you get thereby, may in part recompence thoſe former defects.</p>
            <p>When our laſt <hi>Autumne</hi> the yeares moſt deſired ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, had rendered Earths tribute with heaped plentie of encreaſe, <hi>Aegon</hi> and <hi>Damaetas,</hi> both <hi>Arcadians,</hi> by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion Shepheards as I am, walking on the downes not farre from the Sea, while <hi>Titan</hi> poſting to plunge his firie Chariot in <hi>Thetis</hi> lappe had gladded <hi>Oceanus</hi> with his returne, walking I ſay and ouerlooking their Swaynes that gathered the flockes to pen them in the foldes, they ſawe a farre off one running towards them, ſéeming by ſignes to requeſt their tarriance. At his approach they behelde him a goodly youth of comely feature, and endued with ſuch rare beautie, as is ſéel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſéene in any of our ſexe. The ſelly lad breathleſſe with running, ſpeachleſſe, and almoſt heartleſſe through feare, fell downe at their féete. They hauing graunted him ſome reſpit to ſettle and recouer himſelfe, gently tooke him vp and courteouſly demaunded his eſtate, and the cauſe of his ill hap. He which panting for breath ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped oft in his tale, and could not make a long diſcourſe, briefely told them, that hauing by hard fortune left his Countrey, he was taken by Pirats, amongſt whome he had long led a miſerable life, being moſt barbarouſly handled, they ſometimes alluring him with faire promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſometimes terrifying him with ſharpe menaces, but no way able to winne him to their wills, or moue him to ſatiſfye their beaſtly luſt. Oft he curſed his worthleſſe beautie, ſo he tearmed it, that had cauſed that wretched bondage, wherein he had endured ſo many troubles, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing reſolutely in his chaſt conſtancie. Thus much he diſcouered, and deſired them to queſtion no farther of his eſtate, but earneſtly beſought one of them, whome
<pb facs="tcp:5639:15"/>
it ſhould ſo pleaſe, to enterteyne him as his ſeruant, and promiſed to doe his duetie with all deuoire of dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. <hi>Aegon</hi> the wealthier of the two, a man of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued honeſtie enterteined him, tooke him home, and ſince that time hath vſde him not as a ſeruant but a ſonne, for hauing no childe he purpoſeth to make him his heire. When the fame of this wonder, and the fortune of his arriuall was bruted through the countrey, <hi>Aegons</hi> houſe was frequented with troupes of <hi>Arcadians</hi> luſty Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, and dainty Girles. Raniſhed with the viewe of ſo rare a creature, they all ſayde that eyther <hi>Hyalus</hi> béeing retranſformed, had returned to grace <hi>Arcadia,</hi> or <hi>Cupid</hi> ſhrowded in diſguiſe of mortall ſhape, was come to fire their hearts with newe flames. Thus was this wonder admired of all, loued of Shepheards, and liked of Laſſes. Happy ſéemed the Swayne that could enioy his company, prowde was the Girle that could for a louers glaunce receiue a friendly looke. Among the reſt, <hi>Dorylus</hi> an Heard-man, doting more déepely then became a Neateheard, aſſaying all meanes poſſible, yet finding no meanes poſſible to compaſſe his deſire, at laſt reſolued to woe him with offers, try him with preſents, and tempt him with gifts: for déeming loue a couetous humor, hée thought this the onely point for his purpoſe. Béeing in ſo odde a veyne, preſuming to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſée his owne ſucceſſe, he plotted his ſuppoſed fortune in a Poeme, which béeing common in euery Shepheards mouth, I will nowe recite, that you may iudge howe cunningly he could contriue his fancy in a fiction.</p>

Hauing thus prepared a path-way, he fancying greater glories due to his diuelliſh deitie, diſcouered himſelf in the Weſt, ſuppoſing that theſe Coyne-cormorants, theſe Money-mongers his godheads chiefe pillers, would runne in heapes to adore him, and fill the earth with Temples erected in honor of his name: But his hope wanted ſucceſſe, for theſe odde companions hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that his iollitie had aſcended from his infernall lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to frollike with them, contriued meanes to catch him, and hauing layd hold on him, they hampred him ſo, euerie one catching a péece, that he erſt in hell a god, was now on earth a priſoner, mangled and martired by thoſe his fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, locked in great cheſts ſtrengthned with yron barres, kept ſo cloſe that the poore god was almoſt ſtifeled, gaſping oft for breath, but being blinde, he felt no want of light, though cloſed in darkeneſſe where the glorie of his former beautie was blemiſhed by ruſt.

But if <hi>Hyalus</hi> by hap came by (as oft he did) they would abruptly breake off theſe diſcourſes, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him gréedily, gazing on ſo glorious an obiect. Nor was this vniformitie of affections only in humane hearts, for the rurall powers were touched with like ſimpathy: <hi>Pan</hi> ſighed to ſée him, remembring by him his <hi>Syrinx,</hi> though of an other ſexe. The <hi>Hamadryades</hi> flocked to view him, wiſhing him one of their troupe. <hi>Faunes, Siluans, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres,</hi> ſéeldome ſéene before, were oft beheld by men, while they left the hallowed groues to gaze in the open fields on that eye-<hi>Syren,</hi> alluring not with the ſound, but at the ſight. Amongſt other, <hi>Pomona,</hi> Goddeſſe and patroneſſe of fruite did ſo deepely affect him, that <hi>Venus</hi> could not more dote on her <hi>Adonis.</hi> She deſirous to winne him with ouer-cloying kindneſſe, fed him with Apples, gaue him Plums, preſented him Peares. Hauing made this entrance into her future ſolace, ſhe would vſe oft his company, kiſſe him, coll him, check him, chuck him, walke with him, wéepe for him, in the fields, neere the fountaines, ſit with him, ſue to him, omitting no kindes of dalliance to woe him, winne him, feyning to droupe, to dye for him. But he which would not liſten to loues lore, nor obey his heſts, nor abide his lawes, tooke no pleaſure in her paſſions, loathed her embraces, liked not theſe amorous combats, and oft ſhunning her ſight, would repaire to the vnhappy Shepheard, diſdaind by <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryllis,</hi> and ſit with him and ſing, tying his angels voyes to the obſeruations of muſick, recording the ſkilfull Swaines ſwéete ditties in heauenly notes: for he loued him for his pleaſing grace in paſſionate Sonets. While theſe things chaunced, <hi>Zephyrus</hi> that glads <hi>Arcadia</hi> with friendly gales, ſawe him, and ſighed for him: nor did hée only ſée him, but by oft breathing coole gales into him, felt the many ſwéetes lodged in that louely ſubiect. While he
<pb facs="tcp:5639:20"/>
thought of no fellowe in his affection, his paſſions were moderate, but when he knew that <hi>Pomona</hi> was his riuall, he loath to brooke a partner in his pleaſure, or a compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his content, reſolued to ſequeſter his delight from hazard of ſurpazing, and thus effected his reſolution. As on a day <hi>Hyalus</hi> parched with ſommers heate, and tyrde with faintneſſe, repoſed his weary lims on a gréene banke, <hi>Zephyrus</hi> not omitting this oppertunitie, gently heaued him from the ground, and ſoftly conueyed him muſing much, into the worlds Weſterne coaſts, wafting this wonder to the fortunate Ilands, the bleſſed ſoyle not annoyde with rough blaſts, nor ouerwhelmd with immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate raynes, but ſometimes (though ſeldome) touched with a ſuperficiall moyſture of ſhowres. There he layde him downe in a medowe on a bed of floures, gathered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his comming by his ayrie ſeruants, to whome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had intimated his intent. When the boy was layde, being in a pretie chafe, he ſcolded and exclaymed, though not knowing whome he might accuſe. <hi>Zephyrus</hi> which felt freſh coales kindled in his heart by this louers combat, ſpake thus. Scolde not my wanton with thy friend, whoſe name if thou deſire, know that it is he which for thy ſake hath oft mantled <hi>Arcadia</hi> with <hi>Floras</hi> pride to delight thine eies, &amp; comforted thée with a pleaſing coole in extreame heate, to relieue thy faintneſſe, euen <hi>Zephyrus,</hi> Lord of the Weſterne blaſts, whome if thou canſt affect, thou ſhalt want nothing which the world can affoorde: try me, truſt me, employ me, impute to me thy deſires, thy delights. This ſayd, reſoluing himſelfe into ayre, he diued into his dearling, on his eyes, on his lips he ſeazd, he ſurfeited: then rayſing him thence, he carried him to his Palace, a moſt pleaſant coole edifice.

Oft he walked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade to viewe the perfections planted in that ſoyle, and being weary or wanton, roade backe in an ayrie Chariot. But all this could not content him, who wanting his wonted companions, ſeemed to leade a life voyde of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Hée did therefore ſo importune <hi>Zephyrus</hi> with chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh complaints, that he vnable to deny him any thing, graunted the boyes moſt earneſt deſire, and ratified his graunt with ſpéedie performance. Truce was taken, and the compoſition ſealed with many kiſſes: the ſumme of their agréement was, that <hi>Hyalus</hi> after his arriuall in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> ſhould ſhunne the ſight of <hi>Pomona,</hi> and leaue all other that pretended loue. On theſe conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyd backe, and layd in the place whence he was lifted.

So ſoone as <hi>Pomona</hi> heard theſe happy tidings, ſhe erecting tropheys in her fancy, vowde to preuent like future miſfortune. Hauing gotten a ſight of him, ſhe ran, he ran, he fled, ſhe followed, and followed ſo faſt, that ſhe ouertooke him in his courſe, and ſtayd him from ſtarting: then ſhe began thus.

O beautie nourſe of bondage, faire ill, ſowre ſwéete. O moſt prepoſterous eſtate of all things, that he ſhould be captiue to them whome his lookes had conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Vngentle Fortune, what malice did ſelly <hi>Hyalus</hi> merite, that hauing perfections worth, he ſhould féele pleaſures want? was he therefore faire that he ſhould be infortunate? this by the way, but ile procéede. <hi>Zephyrus</hi> renewing his olde wont, romde through <hi>Arcadia,</hi> and miſſing his choiſe, marueiled at the change. Did he vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late his vowe? tuſh, he was a childe that could not value the vertue of an oath. Was he vrged by others? why not? for he was faire. Did he loue an other? he might, for he was yong. Thus dreading many doubts, he ſwallowed his diſcontent, but when he knewe that <hi>Hyalus</hi> was <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monaes</hi> priſoner, he was ſo enraged with furious paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that he ruminated on nothing ſaue reuenge, and being vnable to hurt ſo power-full a riuall, vowd to inflict vengeance on the whole countrey of <hi>Arcadia.</hi> In this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient humour, he haſted to the Northren regions, and méeting there with <hi>Boreas,</hi> ſaluted him thus.

places quiet, ſaue where ſhe was preſident, was forced to bridle her affection, and releaſe her priſoner, leaſt for a fickle humor ſhe ſhould looſe her honor. <hi>Hyalus</hi> ſet frée, raunged in a childiſh rage, but being weary with wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, he reſted néere a pleaſant Spring, and hauing wept fréely, ſlept ſoundly. In this ſléepe, ſtrange ſléepe, the late ſexe was changed, and of a faire boy a fairer maide faſhioned. Awaking and muſing much at this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſis, ſhe was in the midſt of her dumps raiſde with a ſtrong gale, &amp; carried to a place néere the ſtreights of <hi>Thermopyles,</hi> where was a Temple dedicated to <hi>Aeolus,</hi> wherein the louely maide was conſecrated a Prieſt to that God, and continued there the whole tearme of her life a ſpotleſſe virgin. Our aunceſtors deſirous to celebrate the remembrance of this rare accident with eternall honor, appointed the day of her change to be for euer, memorizd in a yearely feaſt called <hi>Parthenia,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Prieſt of <hi>Aeolus</hi> accompanyed with the faireſt of the youth of both ſexes, offers a noble Sacrifice, diſpoſing all things with due Ceremonies.

After long tumbling on the floud, we deſcried a litle deſolate Iland, and packing on all the ſailes, made towards it amaine, when ſodeinly the Pilot cauſing them to ſtrike the late-ſpred ſailes, kept aloofe from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coaſt, and willed the boat-ſwain to ſound the depth, for he vehemently feared to be driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on ſome ſhelues in that vnknowne current, but finding all ſure in the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a wide chanell, we approached néerer.

The ſame night they frolliked with great iollitie for ioy (as they ſaide) of obteining me: when the wine had fired their enflamed luſt, they ſollicited thogh ſucceſſeſſe, their former motions, and ſtroue ſo long for kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes but got none, that they left their kindneſſe towards me and fell to contention among themſelues. Their Captaine enuying them, the publike poſſeſſion of his priuat pleaſure though but ſuppoſed, déeming me a praie fitter for himſelfe and iudging a common good not currant, appeaſed the fraie through his authoritie, &amp; did countermaund their paſſions, but priuately he would aſſaile me with all the engines of loue-plotted pollicies, adding cruell threats to kind words, ſometimes entreating, ſometimes menacing, now ſuing, then ſwearing, to obtaine his will, or augment my woe: now praying, then proteſting to enioy me, or enioyne me perpetuall ſlauery.

But ere time winged with thoughts ſwiftneſſe had touched the prefixed point of my then-immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent perill, I was happily freed from feare of his force, and deliuered from dread of that danger by <hi>Anaxander,</hi> a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Gentleman of <hi>Sparta,</hi> who hauing charge of a Galley ſcoured thoſe ſeas, being ſent by the <hi>Ephori,</hi> and bounde by ſtrict commandement to execute ſeuere iuſtice on ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors which infeſted the ſeas with piracies, and landing oft on the coaſt of <hi>Laconia,</hi> for raged the Country, tooke rich pillage, &amp; committed many ſpoils.

all that crue of caitiues to the ſword, accounting mercy to ſuch offenders an high blemiſh of iuſtice.

But co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerting their mones into mad fury, they confederated themſelues in a bloudy league, vowing extreame reuenge on that worthie Gentleman whome they opprobriouſly tearmed the proud Iuſticier of <hi>Lacedaemon.</hi> They had got togither ſixe veſſels, &amp; Reſicles a <hi>Cretan</hi> was Admirall of this accurſed fléete: fortune ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome foe to worſt attemptes, ſuted their expectation with hoped ſucceſſe.

The ſouldiers of <hi>Reſicles</hi> taking me, brought me to their Captaine, who fancying in his fond thoughts a world of future imagined pleaſures, entertained me kindly, and
<pb facs="tcp:5639:33"/>
wooed me with many curteſies, I filled him with vaine hopes, limiting my conſent with delaie of time as I vſed the other before, and meane while plotted meanes for my eſcape, which thus I effected. At the very time wherin the feaſt of <hi>Theſmophoria</hi> was celebrated at <hi>Eleuſis</hi> with my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall obſeruations by the Prieſts of <hi>Ceres, Reſicles</hi> hauing left his fellow-Pyrats which diſperſed themſelues to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe booties, tooke a veſſell of <hi>Samos</hi> returning from <hi>Syria,</hi> a rich prize. The day enſuing, he &amp; his accurſed companions applied themſelues wholly to myrth and belly-chéere for ioy of their good fortune, ſeeming to celebrate the <hi>Baccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi> in their diſordred dyet, dyet I terme it, becauſe they oft vſed ſuch exceſſe. When the wine had preuailed, and fumes aſcending from their ſtomaches had beſieged their ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed braines, ſummoning their diſtempered ſenſes to reſt, they laie as drowned in a ſléepie charme, without feare or regard, in euery corner ſome. The winde and ſea the one quiet, the other calme, did fauour them: fortune their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon friend did not annoy them with approach of enemies: for if a tempeſt had bene raiſed, or the foe aſſailed them, doubtleſſe they had receiued a full reward of their diſſolute demeanours. I iudging this a fit time for my eſcape, ſlily conueied my ſelfe into the long boat, and cutting the roape rowed ſo well as I could, to the ſhore which was not farre off: leaping on land, I left my boat to the ſeas direction, and running with haſted ſteppes diſcryed two <hi>Arcadians,</hi> both which are now preſent, the one a friendly relieuer of my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe. I entreated their tariance by ſigns, and being come to them, was kindly comforted by them.

            <p>Thus haue I contriued the rehearſall of my troubles into a briefe diſcourſe. <hi>Timoclea</hi> would faine haue procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but a generall murmure of admiration raiſed by the whole aſſembly hindred her entended purpoſe. <hi>Aegon</hi> ſtood vp, &amp; ſuing for ſilence by ſignes, hauing obtained audience

ſpake thus.

For next the rare hap of <hi>Hyalus</hi> whoſe memory we now celebrate, what other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent could ſo directly fit the feaſt of <hi>Parthenia?</hi> As his ſexe was miraculouſly changed from a faire ladde to the faireſt girle that euer liued in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> ſo this lampe of royaltie, the Paragon of womans perfections, found in this place at this time, the onely occaſion of diſcloſing of her diſguiſe, and being ſuppoſed by all the mirror of our ſexe, may now be tearmed the wonder of woman-kinde. The whole aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly applauded his words, arguing hereby, that they confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his opinion by their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſenting cenſures. Many floures were throwne on thoſe two louers, the floures of true af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and each departing, filled his natiue prouince with report of this rare accident: ſo that the miraculous meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſis of <hi>Hyalus</hi> was almoſt drowned in obliuion.</p>

pardon of his departure, was preuented by his oft redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled fatherly welcomes and embraces: with like kindneſſe he entertained trembling and bluſhing <hi>Timoclea,</hi> &amp; ſpake curteouſly to <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Aegon.</hi> Returning to the palace he tooke great delight in hearing his ſonne relate the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and daungers with oft changes of Fortune endured by him and his deareſt <hi>Timoclea,</hi> and iudging it inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piable impietie to hinder the ſucceſſe of ſo rare affection reſolued to giue loue his right and marrie them honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably. For this purpoſe hee ſent Herauldes to all the Ilandes adiacent, and Prouinces ſcituate in the maine of <hi>Greece,</hi> which publiſhed in his name leaue and libertie of acceſſe to all whom ſoeuer, eſpecially ſtrangers of account which would repaire to his Court, and be preſent at the nuptiall of his ſon, &amp; honour him in ſuch princelike exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as might beſt beſéeme the worth of that intended ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnitie, not omitting to expreſſe the time. Theſe meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges had ſuch ſucceſſe, that beſides a troupe of meaner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the moſt worthie <hi>Heroes</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> appeared at the appointed time, &amp; being preſent at the ceremonies of <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> rytes, gaue honourable teſtimonie of their perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. The <hi>Cyprian</hi> Kings ſecond ſonne then ſoueraigne of <hi>Lemnos,</hi> and his faire Princeſſe, were part of that royall aſſembly, whereat the Nobles of <hi>Cyprus</hi> did gliſter in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt-kingly pompe. Forthwith many honourable ſportes and déeds of chiualry were exerciſed, in which <hi>Arisbas</hi> and <hi>Anaxilas</hi> were chiefe challengers, ſuted both in pureſt white, mounted both on milke-white Courſers, richly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parraſoned. The old King entending farther fauour to his ſonne, and deſirous to diſburthen himſelfe of the heauie charge of gouernment, and inueſt his age with eaſe, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred his eſtate, &amp; reſigned y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> regiment to <hi>Arisbas,</hi> whom he cauſed to be adorned with the royall Diademe, and he entending like fauour to his deareſt <hi>Timoclea,</hi> cauſed her to be likewiſe crowned Queene of <hi>Cyprus.</hi>

ſtrangers and others departed, bruting an honourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the <hi>Cyprian</hi> Courts royaltie. <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Aegon</hi> hauing receiued rare entertainment and rich rewards for their former courteſies, ſhipped themſelues for <hi>Arcadia.</hi> Fortune ending frownes with fauours, did thus abſolue the cataſtrophe of this roial Comedy, which was yet imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. The old Cing of <hi>Epirus</hi> deceaſing, his ſonne <hi>Soſtratus</hi> a man of milder diſpoſition, ſuccéeded him in the Crowne, who remembring the former good ſeruice of baniſhed <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtophon,</hi> and knowing his innocencie, ſent immediatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his coronation, an honourable Ambaſſage to conclude a league with the yoong King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and reduce thence guiltleſſe <hi>Ariſtophon</hi> from exile. The Ambaſſadour was royally receiued and entertained in the Court of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and hauing declared the cauſe of his comming, ſped in both his demands. For the league of amitie betwéene thoſe two mightie Princes was ſolemnely concluded by oath, and <hi>Ariſtophon</hi> deſirous to laie his bones in the mother-ſoyle that brought him forth, was ſoone perſuaded to return. Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his leaue therfore of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old prince, the yong King &amp; his daughter raiſed to ſuch royall eſtate, he returned into his Country, hauing with him the other Péere of <hi>Epyrus,</hi> and a noble man of <hi>Cyprus</hi> ſent by <hi>Arisbas,</hi> to cauſe King <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratus</hi> to ſweare likewiſe, that the league might be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by their mutuall othes. Such was the ſucceſſe of this rare oft-thwarted loue which my ouerbold penne hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed thus rudely to diſcyper, If any <hi>decorum</hi> be omitted, or <hi>indecorum</hi> committed, I can not otherwiſe excuſe it (curteous Gentlemen) then by your fauours which wil (I hope) beare with ſuch imperfections, &amp; not impute it to mine owne deſert, which was loth to polliſh a toy, whereon I neuer beſtowed more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, then ſometimes an idle houre of recreation.</p>
