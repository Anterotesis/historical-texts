         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Ualour, and the former Glory of this Isle, amongst which was
King <hi>Vter Pendragon,</hi> lineally descended from the <hi>Brittish</hi> Kings,
who in the Year <hi>Anno</hi> 500. began to Raign over the <hi>Brittains</hi> that
possessed the Mountainous Country with great success, giving the
<hi>Saxons</hi> many defeats, and gaining greatly upon them; till at last fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in love with a fair Lady named <hi>Igrayin,</hi> wife to <hi>Alfridus</hi> Duke of
<hi>Cornwall,</hi> he so doted on her Beauty, that not finding her to be won
by perswasion to yield her chastity to his disposal, he plotted with <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyn</hi>
a famous Necromancer of that age, to bring his designs about by
policy. This Necromancer undertaking the matter, the better to
ease his Princes labouring thoughts, with Spells, and by Magick
Inchantment so wrought, that either deluding the Ladies sight, or
transforming the King into the shape of her Lord, she received him as
such, and suffered him in the absence of <hi>Alfridus</hi> to injoy her a whole
night, on whom he got our famous <hi>Arthur:</hi> For her Lord being in
War against the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> was slain e're his return; of which the
King hearing, though greatly grieved at the loss of so renowned a
Subject, yet as much rejoyced that fate gave him opportunity to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb facs="tcp:110123:3"/>
the love of the fair Dutchess in an honourable way, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting
after the days of mourning were over, so dealt with her by
fair words and rich presents, that being now at liberty, she was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be his Wife, and was married to him by the Bishop of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lile</hi>
with great pomp and splendour; all the Lords and Nobles subject
to his Scepter; together with their Ladies adorning their Nuptials,
and assisting at the Ceremony: And so great was the joy, that east<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Turnament, and all manner of disports to recreate the sences, were
held for twenty daies: Yet the Queen was troubled to find the fruits
of her womb increase so fast, as fearing to be suspected of Adultry, for
well she knew she had been deceived, when she computed the time of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fridus</hi>
death with the time she supposed him in her embraces: but the
King, to put her out of doubt, and to prevent melancholly thoughts,
in loving wise unrevealed the whole mistery; yet it was agreed between
them, that it should be kept secret, and that the Child should as soon
as born, be conveyed to a trusty Guardian to prevent obloquie.</p>
               <p>The Queen, about six months after the Ceremony of the Wedding
was over, being brought to bed of a Son, the Child named <hi>Arthur</hi> as
it was before resolved, was conveyed by trusty hands to a Lady of good
repute, named <hi>Marilda,</hi> Wife to Sir <hi>Ector,</hi> one of the Kings
Knights, who brought him up in such learning as was meet for his
Years: When as his Father worn out with the continual toiles of
War, and much distempered through the many wounds he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
died, leaving him sole-Heir of his Dominions; who thereupon
was proclaimed by most of the Nobility, and Crowned King, though
some taking the advantage of his green years, rebelled, &amp; raised divers
Commotions; but he growing up, and getting the Reins of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into his hands, did many great Exploits, as will in the series
of this History appear.</p>

               </head>
               <p>KIng <hi>Arthur</hi> by this time being grown up, became exceeding tall &amp;
strong, insomuch that he seemed more than man, and in many
Iusts and Turnaments so well behaved himself, that none could stand
before him: A Horse he had which he called <hi>Beaucephalus,</hi> after the
name of the Great <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Horse; and he in all Exploits proved
<pb facs="tcp:110123:3"/>
the best in the world: His Sword was of a large size, viz. five foot in
length; and in breadth eight inches; cutting with two fearful edges,
on which hung death and destruction: His Launce was eight cubits,
and the head thereof formed of Massy Steel, weighing six pound: His
Armour was of the highest prooff, shining with Gems and burnished
Gold: And the better to inure him to War and great Exploits, he
frequently rode thus accutered; and often in places of greatest dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
glorying in nothing more than his strength and manly prowess,
delighting in nor fancying none but such as were truly valiant, and
feared not Death in any of his dreadful shapes, but to such he was
lavish to Excess; retaining no other for his Counsellor, but <hi>Merlyn</hi>
the famous Necromancer, from whom, as from an Oracle, he received
the certainty of future events, and at his request recreated him with
strange and wonderful sights, the Representation of Magick; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the rest, upon a great Plain before the Kings Palace at <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digan,</hi>
he raised a stately Tower, and round it a pleasant Garden a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned
with Fruits and fragrant Flowers, Fish-ponds, Fountains,
pleasant Bowers, and Umbrages, into which he led the King and all
his Nobility, feasting them after a sumptuous manner, as they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined;
but he had no sooner re-conveyed them thence, but looking back,
they saw all vanish in Thunder, Lightning, and a prodigious Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,
to their great amazement; yet knowing before it was but delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
they rested somewhat more satisfied, yet could not but think of
what had passed.</p>
               <p>The day being spent in viewing this Piece of Recreation, and the
King ruminateing many things in his mind, at last laying him down
upon his Couch, he fell into a slumber, and then dreamed that he was
carried into a spacious Hall, in which stood a Table of great circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
out of the middle of which grew an Oak and a Laurel, with
Crows, Scepters, Swords, and Ensigns hanging on them, and
that they were guarded by many valiant Knights, high in prowess,
and terrible to the whole World, which made him desirous to become
their Associate; nor did he sooner demand it, but they joyfully received
him, and placeing him in a Chair of Ivory and Gold, made him their
Chief, and gave him a Banner with a Lyon rampant portruyed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and this Motto written, viz. <hi>EVER VICTORIOUS:</hi> upon
which, the sound of Trumpets, noise of Drums, clattering of Arms,
<pb facs="tcp:110123:4"/>
shouts, and cries, saluted his Ears: And he supposed he beheld Armies
in rout and slaughter scattered through the whole World, and that the
Conquorers laid the Trophies at his feet, and with an vniversal shout
saluted him <hi>Great Monarch of the Western World.</hi> At what time
awakeing, he found it but a Dream, yet revolving in his mind the
strangeness of the fancy, the next morning he related to his Nobles,
who assured him of happy presages, and advised him to make inquiry
into the interpretation thereof; whereupon sending for his Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick
Counsellor, he related it to him, who promised within a day
to give him the signification of his Dream, which he did as followeth.
<hi>viz.</hi> That by the Table was signified his Kingdom; by the Knights
the Pillars and Strength thereof; by Oak and Laurel, strength,
victory, and durance; the Crowns, Scepters, Swords, and Ensigns,
the spoiles of the Nation he should be possess'd of; and the Schene of
War, the representations of the many dreadful Battels he should
fight, wherein he should ever remain victorious; and the making him
Chief, giving him the Standard, and placeing him in a Chair of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory
and Gold, denoted him deep in his Subjects love; and that no
Treason should prosper against him. This interpretation highly
pleased the King and raised his towring imaginations to such a pitch
that he resolved to spread the terrour of his Arms throughout the
world; wherefore he made great preparation for all manner of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
provision, but above all of hardy and couragious Knights, invite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them from all parts to his Court, and for their better incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
caused a spacious Hall. 300 Foot in length, and Twenty in
breadth, to be built, with Glass Turrets on the top, ceiled with Fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work
and Gold, wainscoted with Cedar, and paved with Marble, in
the midst of which he placed a Round Table, at which 400 Knights
might sit, and caused it daily to be furnished with great store of choice

thither, and shortly after constituted the Order of the Round Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
allowing a Yearly Pension of 100 Mark to such as were truly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
and would inrole themselves to attend his service when occasion
required, making himself the Head or Soveraign of the Order, so
that by this means the valiant men of the neighbouring Nations ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
their service to him, and were admitted into the noble Order, but
not before they had been proved in some great Exploit.</p>

a Chair like a Throne placed on that part of the Table that was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the upper end of the Hall, but no Musick suffer'd, except the
Martial sounds of Drums, Trumpets, and Clarions, in which most
of all our Heroick Prince delighted. And now being furnished with
mighty men, that might compare to <hi>Davids</hi> worthies (if not exceed
them) in dreadful Feats of Arms; he passionately desired to have an
honourable occasion to try his and their valours, which was not long
wanting: For the <hi>Mercian</hi> King of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and the King of the
<hi>East Angles</hi> presuming upon their strength broke into <hi>Cornwall,</hi> part
of King <hi>Arthurs</hi> Dominions, and committed divers outrages, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
plundering, ravishing, and slaughtering in such a dreadful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that the people (with such substance as they could convey) fled e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where before them; the News of which rouzed our Lyon-like
Prince, who taking with him his Guard of 400 Knights, and 8000
common Souldiers, the flower of his Dominions by swift Marches
passed on to give UUar the meeting, whose approach the Enemy
(being treble the number) little regarded, not doubting to give him
the overthrow, trusting greatly to the force of one <hi>Cingeterox</hi> a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
Gyant, nine cubits high, six in circumference, and armed with
a huge Battel-Axe and Coat of Mael; but the undaunted Prince,
whom fear could not dismay, having animated his Souldiers and set
them in Battel-Array, attended by his Knights, broke through the
Ramparts, killing such as guarded the Camp, and setting upon the
Infidels, for so at that time they were, and cutting through the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of them made such slaughter that all the way he passed was strewed
with dead bodies; yet on he pressed through <gap reason="illegible: smudged" extent="1 letter">

Champions following, as animated by the Martial deeds of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
Leader; nor did they less annoy the Enemy, who by this
time, taking the Alarum in all parts, came running to oppose them,
and began to make some slaughter of his men, especially where the
Gyant fought, which the King perceiving by the cry that arose, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
his Stander with the great Lyon to advance that way, beating
down all before him till he came to the place where he found <hi>Cingeterox</hi>
and <hi>Ethwaldus</hi> the <hi>Mercian</hi> King bathing their Axes in the blood of
his men, of which they had slain 300, when as King <hi>Arthur</hi> with a
loud voice cried, <hi>Turn this way Infidels, spare the weak, and bend
your force against the strong:</hi> upon which the Gyant stairing on him,
with a dreadful voice replied, <hi>Who art thou that comes to seek thy
Death? I am a Souldier,</hi> said the King, <hi>and one that am come to
fetch thy Head by way of reprizal for the mischiefs thou hast done in
my Country. But you must get it first,</hi> said the Gyant. <hi>That shall
not be long,</hi> said the King; and thereupon charged on the Monster so
furiously with his Sword, that e're he could wield his Battel-Axe
with a full stroke on his Helme, which made the fire spring from thence,
he made him stagger three huge Paces and bend with his knee to the
ground: then the Gyant (inraged) made at him and struck the King,
so that the blow dazled him, and made his eyes swim, but soon recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;
he that had never been so used before, resolved revenge, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
(after a full stroke) wheeling his dreadful Sword about, he struck
the Monster on the Helme with such force, that cutting it through
the Sword entered six inches, whereupon with a terrible groan he fell
to the Earth, at what time the King stood on him and divided his Head
from his Trunk, the which he delivered to his <abbr>Esq</abbr> that bore his bow
and quiver: Nor were the Knights of the Order idle, for Sir <hi>Lance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot</hi>
had by this time grievously wounded the <hi>Mercian</hi> King, and taken
him Prisoner; and Sir <hi>Tristriam</hi> slain 7 Captains, besides 36 com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Souldiers; so that the King of the <hi>East Angles</hi> seeing all go to
wrack, and his men were disordered, caused the Retreat to be sounded,
whereupon his Captains endeavoured to bring off their men, but they
being in great consternation, and the <hi>Brittains</hi> pressing on them,
(fearful of death) fled in all parts, and left all the booty they had gotten
to the Conquerors, who fiercely pursuing the flying Foe, made terrible
slaughter, insomuch <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:110123:5"/>
This overthrow being noised abroad, brought a great fear upon all
the <hi>Saxon</hi> Princes, so that the <hi>Mercians</hi> wholly submitted and sent a
great ransome for their King, who upon his swearing to become Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary
and Uassal to King <hi>Arthur</hi> was set at liberty. Nor were
there any of their petty Kings that then possessed this Island, which
they had divided into a Heptiarthey, but sent their Ambassadors with
great Presents to intreat a Peace, the which, upon their acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him their supream Prince, and paying each 200 Mark, a brace of
Geldings, a Faulcon, and a Grey-hound yearly, was accorded to.
And thus flourished this Renowned King in the beginning of his
Reign, but more dreadful and re-doubted were his future deeds, as
by the sequel will appear.</p>

being a strong Garrison therein, they returned answer, <hi>That they
kept the City for</hi> Burnamissa <hi>King of</hi> Danemark, <hi>and would in no

slaughter of such as opposed, cutting off Arms, Legs, and Helmed
Heads, placed it on the chief Bulwark, which the rest seeing, on all
sides strove to imitate him, so that within less than six houres the City
was won, which the conquered perceiving, retired to the Market-place,
and throwing down their Arms begged mercy, which the King gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously

reserving any part to himself, which so hightened them, that

received, and for the mischiefs his Country had sustained; to which
<hi>Burnamissa</hi> replyed, <hi>That whatever had hapned in that nature, had
been without his knowledge; but however knowing him to be a
Prince of great Clemency, he would be well content to submit to what
ever he should think fit:</hi> The King overcome by meekness of the

to what Award she should make, which was joyfully accepted by
<hi>Burnamissa,</hi> who expected before, that no less than his Kingdom of

whereupon the Princess was sent for, who came, attended by divers
Ladies of Honour, in most sumptuous attire, glittering in Gold and
Gems, which were out-vied by her incomparable beauty; when making
her approach, King <hi>Arthur</hi> arose from his Chair of State and saluted
her; as likewise his Knights did her Ladies: Then <hi>Burnamissa</hi>
made her acquainted with the pleasure of King <hi>Arthur,</hi> but she in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
refused to be Arbitress in so waighty a matter, till the King
pressed it, and desired her to do him so great an Honour; whereupon

love: Nor did the Feaver of his desire less afflict her, though she durst not

her, who humbly told him with a demure countenance, <hi>That she
could not conceive her self worthy the thoughts of so great a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,

such dignity, she had no argument against his pleasure, if her Brother
would consent.</hi> This pleasing answer overjoyed the King, insomuch

<hi>Nay,</hi> replied <hi>Burnamissa, your Majesty may command even what you
please, since to your clemency I owe so much.</hi> Then said King <hi>Arthur,
'Tis this fair Pledge of lasting peace that I with low submission do
request. If my Sister be contented,</hi> said the King, <hi>I am overjoyed at
what I hear, and have long desired to be allyed unto so great a Prince,

blushing like a Rosey Bloom that opens in <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July</hi> to the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Sun)
<hi>for I have already parted with that heart that needs would

in his Throne, exactly came to pass: And now the joy being great
throughout the <hi>Brittish</hi> Dominions, all the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings came to
King <hi>Arthur</hi>'s Court, then removed to the then flourishing City of
<hi>Hereford</hi> and made their Homage, complementing him highly on his
Marriage, and the birth of his Son, presenting the Queen and Royal
Infant with great Presents, as Iewels, Gold, and fragrant Spice of
<hi>Arabia,</hi> promising for them and their Heirs to be obedient to the

the Kingdomes of the <hi>Mercians</hi> and <hi>East-Angles</hi> with so hard a hand,
that during his Life, they could not wrest them from him, but to our

eldest Son of Fame, began to inlarge the splendor of his Court, and
increase the number of the Knights of the <hi>Round Table,</hi> in whom
consisted his chief strength, for scarce was there any one of them, but
durst encounter ten ordinary men hand to hand; and as he increased
<pb facs="tcp:110123:9"/>
them, so he inlarged their pensions, which drew the most valiant of all
Nations to serve him, though none were admitted before they were
tryed: The habit the ordinary wore, when without their Armour, was
a Uest lined with Sables, and on the back of it a red Cross, and on
their Thighs Cushes of highest prooff; their Stockings were in the
manner of Buskins, and their Shooes of Camels skin, the Hair ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
outward; on their Heads they wore Caps made of Seal-skins
lined with Silk and Cotten; and about their neck Silk of divers
colours; each of them in UUar carrying a double Faulchion, a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel-Axe,
a Bow and Quiver, and a Launce being severally allowed
a <abbr>Esq</abbr> or Armour-bearer, who attended them in all Battels.</p>

he might imploy it abroad, and whilst he was musing thereon, an Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
in poor aray came to the Court, and filled it at once with pitty and
desire of revenge upon the dismal Relation he made, which was,</hi> That
the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Sarazens</hi> had fallen upon <hi>Iudea</hi> and <hi>Palastine</hi> with
an Army of 100000 men, and made such slaughter of the Christians
in those parts, that such as escaped were forced to fly into Rocks and
Caves of the Earth, and there were either starved to death, or became
a prey to wild Beasts: And that they had taken the Holy City of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
after thirty days Siege, and put almost all the Christians
they found therein to the sword, polluting the Temple and Holy Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre
with their Heathenish Worship: As also, that they impailed
the Patriarch alive for refusing to worship <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This story coming to the Kings ear, he could not refrain from shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
tears; when sending for the Hermit, in the presence of his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
he most strictly examined him to all particulars, and finding he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
nothing but what (as he said) himself had been an eye-witness
to; the King turning to his Lords, said, <hi>Hear you this, my Lords,
shall we suffer the Enemies of our Lord and Saviour thus to triumph
over the professors of his Name?</hi> to which they with one voice reply'd,
<hi>That it was intollerable, and that they were ready to venture their
Lives and Fortunes in that Holy War, and in his service:</hi> whereat
the King highly commending their resolutions, vowed by the Passion
<pb facs="tcp:110123:10"/>
of his blessed Lord, whom those Infidels defied and blasphemed, he
would not take pleasure in any thing till he had faced those barbarous
Nations, and tryed his Fortune to free the Holy City from its pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and thereupon he sent to all the neighbouring Princes for aid,
resolving to set saile early in the Spring, it being now the middle of
<hi>August:</hi> He likewise layed double Taxes upon his own Subjects, and
demanded double Tribute of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Princes, who did not so wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
pay it at that time as was expected, by reason most of them were
unconverted, and therefore secretly rejoyced at the prosperity of their
brother Infidels: But however the King raised a great Mass of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and caused his Navy to be augmented; so that from <hi>France,
Danemark,</hi> and other Ports of <hi>Spain,</hi> hauing received fifty ships of
War, most of them Manned with Voluntiers of those Nations, he
with 200 saile, on board of which he had 50000 men, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of <hi>April</hi> waighed Anchor, and having a fair wind, coasting <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Spain,</hi> he joyned likewise divers other ships, who were ready to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
him, for the noise of this War had overspread all <hi>Christendome;</hi>
when passing through the <hi>Straits</hi> into the <hi>Mediteranian</hi> Sea, he
brought such a fear upon the Sea-towns, that the Infidels inhabiting
them fled with their substance to the Mountains, into which the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
entering, found yet some booty; but (desirous to pass on to
<hi>Jerusalem</hi>) the King sayled to the Isle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> then governed by one
<hi>Emanuel</hi> a Christian, where having refreshed his Army, he again im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued,
and sayling through that tract of Seas, arrived at <hi>Joppa,</hi> a
famous Sea-Port, and the in let of <hi>Palastine,</hi> which he found strongly
fortified, as likewise <hi>Salmanezer</hi> King of the <hi>Turks</hi> incamped with a
Host of 100000 <hi>Turks, Jews,</hi> and <hi>Sarazens</hi> about six miles from
thence; yet landing his men, he resolved to besiege the City, and by
taking it, secure the Port; whereupon causing his Enginers to make
divers batterings after the <hi>Roman</hi> fashion, which under the favour of
the night (notwithstanding the besieged hurled down wild-fire and
stones in great abundance) they set to the Walls on the North side,
and by force of Cords battered with such fury, that they rent the Ua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mures
in divers places, making the City tremble, which so alarum'd
the Infidels, that they sallyed 10000 strong upon the quarter guarded
by the Earl of <hi>Merionoth,</hi> but coming to handy-strokes, were forced to
retire 5000 less than they came, and the next morning, by King <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thurs</hi>

as the <hi>Brittains</hi> with their shot of Arrows beating the besieged from
<pb facs="tcp:110123:10"/>
their defences, mounted &amp; planted the Kings Standard upon the wall,
entering and killing the Infidels in great number, so that all the
streets ran blood, till such time as the King (upon their throwing

               <p>THe Infidels being greatly troubled at the loss of <hi>Joppa,</hi> desired

any further, to which after many delays he consented, and on the

and disgrace, he divided his Army into three parts, the first (contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
40000 men,) he lead himself; the second (containing 36000,) he
committed to his Brother <hi>Albamazer,</hi> a Gyant of great stature, fierce
and cruel; and the third (containing 24000,) to <hi>Gouzeles,</hi> Governour
of <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> Nor did King <hi>Arthur</hi> delay to Marshal his Battel in
the best manner, leading the first Battalian, consisting of 20000 choice
Souldiers, and an hundred Knights of the Order for the guard of his
person; the second battle (consisting of 10000,) he committed to <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanius</hi>
Duke of <hi>Cornwall;</hi> the third battel (consisting of 10000,) he
committed to Sir <hi>Lancelot du Lake;</hi> the fourth (consisting of the
like number) was lead by <hi>Frovonius</hi> a noble <hi>Dane:</hi> When as both
Armies (marching in this posture) came face to face, leaving a little
space between, a monstrous <hi>Pagan</hi> stepping forth, demanded (e're the
Charge was sounded) a man to fight him hand to hand, and that the
combate should be for no less than the City of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> or the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Christians, if King <hi>Arthur</hi> durst agree to it: whereupon
the King having sent to the <hi>Turk</hi> to know if he would stand to what
his proud Champion propos'd, and finding him inclinable thereto, he
thought no sword more fit than his own to chastise the daring; when
(contrary to the mind of his Nobles) disguising himself in the Armour
of one of his Knights, he stepped forth, and without much ceremony,
charged him with such fury, that at one full blow he broke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Helme,
<pb facs="tcp:110123:11"/>
and made him stagger six paces back, yet recovering his station, he the
more inraged resolved to obliter the disgrace that he had sustained, in
the sight of his Prince and his whole Army, came on with double fury,
foaming and storming for shame and anger to be so foiled, he smote the
King with such force, that he loosed his Helme and made his eyes swim
dazie; but he nothing daunted thereat, as the Gyant was about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>double
his stroke, struck him so full on the right arm that his Battel-Axe
fell to the Ground, when pursuing his stroke, he struck him as he
bended to recover it on the neck, so that the sword entering caused a
deep wound, out of which issued great quantity of blood, so that the
King finding that through loss thereof he must needs faint, kept
him off, as not thinking it safe to hazard too eagerly his person when
the Conquest was already made; nor did his expectation fail; for the
Gyant finding his strength decay, like a Lamp, which at going out
gives the greatest blaze, taking his Axe in both hands, smote upon the
King with great fury, and with a full stroke upon the shoulder crushed
his Armour, and much bruised him; at what time the King with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted
courage gave him another wound on the left arm between the
joynts of his Harness, and pursuing it with a thrust, pierced his Coat
of Mael and high-prooffed Cushies, so that the sword entring a foot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his bowels, he with a dismal groan fell to the Earth: whereupon
the <hi>Pagans,</hi> contrary to the promise of their King, sounded the Charge,
refusing to stand to what had been sworn, the which so inraged the
Christian Souldiers, that re-doubling their fury upon the signal gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
the charged so furiously upon the Infidels, that the Battel where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>Abumazer</hi> fought was by King <hi>Arthur</hi> and his Squadron over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,
and pierced even to the middle, where Sir <hi>Gawen</hi> a Knight of
the Order having killed ehe Standard-bearer, took the Standard even
in the Infidel-King's sight, which made him advance with all his
strength to recover it; but finding great resistance, after he had fought,
and by words strove to animate his men, labouring in vain to stay
their flight, he turned furiously upon his second Battel that was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing;
being hotly pursued by the Christians, and finding no place
to retreat, he put them into great disorder; when as Sir <hi>Lancelot</hi>
fetching a compass about, charged them in the Flank on the right,
and so gauled them with shots of Arrows, that after many were slain
and wounded, and nothing but the crys of the vanquished, and the
shouts of the vanquishers, to be heard, the rest of King <hi>Arthur</hi>'s Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels
advanting, and charging them in the left, they (after making
<pb facs="tcp:110123:11"/>
what resistance they were able, and the loss of 40000 of their best
Souldiers, their King being sore wounded and carried out of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel)
fell into disorder, and in great confusion fled, every one as he
could shifting for himself, so that the Execution following with great
fury, scarce 20000 escaped the sword.</p>
               <p>The Uictory thus happily gained, the Christians found such store of
Treasure in the Camp, that it was wonderfull, the which the King
sharing amongst his Souldiers, according as every one had deserved,
and well refreshed his Army, sending the wounded of his part to <hi>Jop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa,</hi>
and buryed the slain; he with Banners spread, marched towards
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> bringing a great fear on all the Citys in his way, most of
which surrendred upon the first Summons; so that coming before the
Holy City, whither the greatest part of the scattered Army was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired,
he having summoned the Infidels to yield and save their lives,
but receiving no answer, he battered it with his Rams, War-Woolfes,
and other fearfull Engines, till a great part of the wall on the South
side fell, upon which a furious assault was given, insomuch, that the
Infidels having drawn their greatest strength to defend the breach, a
great slaughter was made; yet the Christians resolving to carry the
City, which then was but small, and very ravenous, pressed on with
such violence, that the fearful Enemy being over-born, were every
where slain; and the Christians entering, placed King <hi>Arthur</hi>'s
Standard upon the Bulwarks, which so dismayed the Infidels, that
such as could, fled by the Posterns, and over the Brook <hi>Cedron,</hi> others
hid themselves in Caves till the fury of the Souldiers were over, and
such as could not do either, fell for the most part by the Sword.</p>
               <p>This famous City, being the first time thus taken by the Christians,
a great number of miserable men and women were released out of
Dungeons, who had for a long time been fed with Bread of Affliction,
half starved, and miserably used by the Infidels, for publikely owning
the Name of the Lord, who, not far from thence, purchased them
with his precious blood to their unspeakable joy.</p>

three parts of the Army he brought, returned to his ships, the other
part being either slain in the battel, perished by sickness, or left in the
Garrison; yet e're he could imbarque, 27000 <hi>Turks, Sarazens,</hi> and
