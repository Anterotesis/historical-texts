            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Ends</hi> of publiſhing this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation are no other than truly to ſtate <hi>matter of fact</hi> concerning this poor Maid, whoſe unhappy Tragedy has occaſioned ſo many <hi>various</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports both in City and Countrey; To cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all others, and particularly thoſe of her <hi>condition,</hi> as ſervants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to beware of heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to any the like <hi>deſtructive</hi> inſinuations, ſuggeſted either immediately by <hi>Satan,</hi> or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by any of his <hi>Popiſh Imps;</hi> but ſtill more eſpecially to promote the <hi>glory of God,</hi> in recording how he was graciouſly pleaſed both to blaſt or fruſtrate by ſignal <hi>Providence</hi> the miſchievous deſign ſhe was engag'd in; and alſo to <hi>turn</hi> the ſame by his infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, into the greateſt and moſt unſpeakable <hi>good</hi> for her ſoul, as in the judgment of <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> from her words and deportment we are bound to hope.</p>
            <p>Needs muſt he be a <hi>ſtranger in our Iſrael,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:52244:3"/>
nay indeed a <hi>Rebel</hi> to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and Renegado from <hi>common ſenſe,</hi> that is not ſenſible of the reſtleſs accurſed endeavours of <hi>Papiſts</hi> to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine theſe Nations, and eſpecially this famous <hi>City</hi> and all its <hi>Suburbs;</hi> their <hi>Fire-works</hi> in <hi>Sixty-ſix</hi> we hope will never be forgot; nor yet their practiſes afterward, when ſo great a part of the Burrough of <hi>Southwark,</hi> after ſeveral defeated attempts, was at laſt laid in <hi>Aſhes</hi> by the Helliſh induſtry of <hi>Grove</hi> and his <hi>Iriſh</hi> Ruffians, How often have they ſince carried on the like practices in ſeveral parts of the Town? How frequently endeavoured to <hi>debauch</hi> ſervants, and with promiſes of large ſums of <hi>money</hi> tempt them to ſet fire to their Maſters houſes, or give their Inſtruments opportunity to do it; eſpecially in ſuch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where by reaſon of the <hi>old cloſe</hi> buildings, or variety of combuſtible matter, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt miſchief was like to enſue? Whence ſo many attempts have been made on <hi>Smithfield,</hi> the back-ſide of St. <hi>Clements,</hi> this very place of <hi>Pepper-Alley,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>We mention <hi>this</hi> to ſhew that 'tis nothing new nor infrequent, for theſe <hi>Enginiers of miſchief</hi> to be concerned in ſuch practiſes and
<pb facs="tcp:52244:3"/>
temptations; yet ſo <hi>ſubtil</hi> and politick they are for the moſt part to make uſe of others to <hi>execute</hi> the Villanies of this kind which they themſelves <hi>contrive,</hi> to the end that if it be diſcovered, whilſt the <hi>immediate Agents</hi> are enquired after, and under examination, they that ſet them on may have better op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to <hi>eſcape;</hi> or if apprehended, yet the Tranſactions being <hi>private,</hi> Confidence ſhall out-face <hi>Truth;</hi> and for want of <hi>proof,</hi> not <hi>guilt,</hi> they may avoid the ſtroke of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: For our merciful <hi>Engliſh Laws</hi> (far different from the Tyranny of a Popiſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſiton) allow of no <hi>Racks</hi> nor Tortures to extort Confeſſions. Nor will our Proteſtant Courts of Juſtice condemn any upon ſurmiſe, without <hi>legàl evidence</hi> of the Fact.</p>
            <p>Whether there were any ſuch <hi>Temptations</hi> uſed to this Maid, as ſhe alledged, we ſhall not undertake to determine, having nothing to juſtifie it but her <hi>Aſſeverations,</hi> which have only this confirmation, That as they were <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,</hi> ſo they were pronounced with her <hi>laſt breath,</hi> and ſealed with her <hi>death.</hi> And cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tainly thoſe people who are ſo importunate with us to believe <hi>dying mens words</hi> againſt
<pb facs="tcp:52244:4"/>
evident proof, will allow us not altogether to contemn thoſe of a dying woman, in a matter doubtful at leaſt, if we may not ſay attended with ſome <hi>ſuſpitious</hi> probabilities. And indeed ſo much was ſhe the rather to be credited than <hi>they,</hi> becauſe ſhe pretended to no <hi>cauſe</hi> that might improve a <hi>lye</hi> into <hi>merit;</hi> was furniſht with no <hi>Abſolution</hi> or <hi>Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> that might lay <hi>Conſcience</hi> to ſleep, nor had any hopes to <hi>ſcour off</hi> the <hi>falſhood</hi> by any ſlight <hi>purging</hi> Flames in the other world. And as it cannot well be imagined, That ſhe who durſt not tell a <hi>Lye</hi> to reſpite puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or to ſave her <hi>own</hi> Life, ſhould yet without any hopes of <hi>advantage</hi> perſiſt in a <hi>falſe Accuſation</hi> of another whom ſhe could have <hi>no malice</hi> againſt; ſo 'tis wonderful to conceive, if ſhe continued guilty of ſuch wickedneſs, how ſhe ſhould be ſo joyfully ſupported with <hi>Courage</hi> againſt the terrors of <hi>death,</hi> and pray and diſcourſe ſo heartily and affectionately as ſhe was obſerved to do.</p>
            <p>As for the truth of what is herein related, both touching her <hi>Behaviour</hi> and <hi>Expreſſions,</hi> the ſame is atteſted and confirmed by a great number of perſons of Credit beyond any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
<pb facs="tcp:52244:4"/>
The Original of her Confeſſion or Proteſtation here ſet forth, remains under her own hand in the cuſtody of that honourable and worthy Gentleman Sir <hi>Robert Hatton,</hi> Knight, High Sheriff of the County of <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey;</hi> and indeed, all that multitude that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther viſited her in priſon, or was preſent at her death, can in a great meaſure bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the reality of this Narrative.</p>
            <p>This poor Creature has paid her <hi>debts</hi> to <hi>Justice</hi> in this world, and is now gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an All-ſeeing Judg, who in due time will reward every one according to his Works.</p>
            <p>We have intituled the Relation, <hi>A Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Servants,</hi> as hoping this her <hi>ſad Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> may caution all thoſe of that condition who ſhall read or hear it, to <hi>abominate</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void, as they love their <hi>lives,</hi> ſuch wicked practiſes, and not to be <hi>inveigled</hi> by any fair words or great promiſes to be aiding or abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereunto.</p>

            <head>THE PENITENT INCENDIARY: OR, <hi>An Impartial and Exact NARRATIVE of the Crime, Confeſſion, and Behaviour of</hi> Margaret Clark, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>MARGARET CLARK</hi> (the unhappy ſubject of this Narrative) was born (as we are cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly inform'd) at <hi>Croydon</hi> in the County of <hi>Surrey,</hi> of <hi>honeſt</hi> though but <hi>mean</hi> Parentage. Somewhat above a Quarter of a year before this miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Contrivance ſhe had become a Servant to Mr. <hi>Delanoy,</hi> a worthy <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> Perſon in <hi>Southwark,</hi> by Profeſſion a Dyer, where ſhe behaved her ſelf ſo fairly, that they had no ſuſpicion of her, but very much intruſted her in their Houſe, whereupon ſhe might have had ſufficient opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to have done them conſiderable Dammage in that kind, without taking the deſperate courſe of Firing their Houſe, which muſt in all probability have occaſion'd a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ruine to moſt of the Neighbourhood: She ſeem'd to be a Wench of a competent underſtanding, rather <hi>above</hi> than <hi>below</hi> what could be expected from her Education and Circumſtances, of a free familiar humour; which poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly might give ſome occaſion to that Temptation, which (as ſhe ſtedfaſtly alledged) was put upon her.</p>
            <p>But becauſe we would render this Narrative as plain and perſpicuous as may be, and yet affirm nothing but what is certainly and notoriouſly true, as to matter of Fact; and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52244:6"/>
for that the Relation of the Intrigue, and means uſed to draw her into this Buſineſs, depends chiefly on the account given by her ſelf, which can challenge no further Credit than what it may derive from Probabilities, violent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions, and her conſtant and dying Aſſeverations; we ſhall firſt ſtate the matter as it happen'd.</p>
            <p>The before mentioned Mr. <hi>Delanoy</hi> having a Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe at <hi>Lee</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> was wont frequently to retire thither; with the greateſt part of his Family; and particularly was gone thither (whereof moſt probably the original Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers might have obtain'd ſome notice before they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the Maid) when this horrid attempt was made, which was on <hi>Sunday</hi> the firſt day of <hi>February,</hi> there being none left then at home in <hi>Southwark,</hi> belonging to him, but this Maid and one young Man. Now ſo it was, That on the ſaid Lords-day at Night, about Eleven of the Clock, ſome of the Neighbours perceiving an extraordinary ſmell of fire, and being there at much affrighted, miſchiefs of that kind having for divers years paſt been ſo over-frequent, and particularly the beſt part of that eminent Burrough having not long ſince been reduced to Aſhes, and that by treacherous Contrivance of the Jeſuits and Papiſts, as hath been ſatisfactorily proved; They thereupon began to look out, to obſerve whence this terrible ſmell proceeded, and finding it to come from Mr. <hi>Delanoy</hi>'s Houſe, and knowing the Maſter and Miſtreſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be out of Town, one <hi>John Parret</hi> knockt at the Door, and <hi>Margaret Clark</hi> let him in the Houſe was found to be on fire in three diſtinct and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places; That is to ſay, firſt juſt by the Pump (which 'tis rationally ſuppoſed was purpoſely done by the ſubtle Contrivers, to hinder getting of water to quench it) next in two ſeveral places in the Buttery, (near which was ſome hundreds of Faggots,) which was much furniſh'd with wooden Conveniences, and things eaſily combuſtible,

and alſo in the Garret, where there was great a quantity of wood and old Lumber laid together and ſet on fire; all which confirming them in an Opinion that it muſt be done purpoſely and by deſign, and obſerving this <hi>Margaret Clark</hi> come and let them in, having ſet her own Box in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, which at firſt ſhe told them was her Maſters, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending ſhe was endeavouring to preſerve it; but provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially a Smith being preſent, who but the day before had mended it for her, knew it to be her own, and ſo had greater reaſon to believe ſhe had ſome hand in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery; they thereupon entertained a ſtrong ſuſpicion of her; but good ſtore of help coming in, and the ſeveral fires not yet being grown to a maſterleſs head, they with little pains and the bleſſing of God on their Endeavours, made ſhift to ſubdue and extinguiſh them all, without any great difficulty or dammage. The danger being pretty well over, upon conſideration of the Circumſtances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-recited, as alſo the ſtrange confuſed behaviour of the Maid, they thought fit to take her into Cuſtody, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. At firſt ſhe endeavoured reſolutely to deny any privity or knowledge how or by what means this diſaſter happened, yet her very Looks, amazed Countenance, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Speech, and ſtrange Behaviour, ſeem'd to give the Lye to her words, and ſhew that her Tongue did but in vain ſtrive to falſifie the dictates of her heart. At laſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome Conflict between Confidence and Conſcience, the latter prevailed, ſo that before two or three a Clock on the <hi>Munday</hi> morning ſhe ingenuouſly confeſſed her ſelf to be Acceſtory in promoting this wicked Deſign and that ſhe had been ſeduced and hired to conſent unto it for a great ſum of money promiſed to be paid her for this helliſh ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: Being Examined who it was that had put her upon it, ſhe declared ſhe could not tell his name, but only that it was a Gentleman, of whoſe Perſon, Stature, Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52244:7"/>
Habit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhe gave a very particular deſcription, withall declaring the manner of his addreſſing himſelf to her, and the ſeveral importunities and inducements he uſed to prevail with her, juſt in the ſame Method and Order as herein after is ſet forth, (for we will not clog this brief Narrative with needleſs repetition.) And moſt obſervable it is, That from this her firſt Confeſſion ſhe did not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, either in Priſon before her Trial, nor after her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to the minute of her death, in the leaſt make any variation. But as ſhe firſt ſet it forth upon Oath before Juſtice <hi>Reading</hi> and Juſtice <hi>Freeman,</hi> ſo ſhe perſiſted with her laſt breath to atteſt the Truth thereof.</p>
            <p>This Declaration as ſhe delivered with the greateſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and aſſurance that could be; ſo after ſhe had made it, though directly tending to her own deſtruction, as to this World, by acknowledging her ſelf Guilty of a Crime, for which, by the Law, ſhe muſt certainly ſuffer Death; her Spirit ſeem'd more compoſed, and leſs troubled, as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing disburthen'd her Conſcience, whoſe ſecret Torments appear'd more terrible and inſupportable to her than Death it ſelf.</p>
            <p>This frank ingenuous Confeſſion, did not a little prevail with moſt that heard her, to believe that there was much of Truth in what ſhe delivered; the rather for that it could not eaſily be imagined, what other motive beſides that of the Temptation of a Bribe, or reward from ſome ill diſpoſed Perſons, ſhould induce her to the Act; for if ſhe had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to Rob her Maſter (of which there did not appear any convincing Arguments) ſhe might, however, having ſuch an opportunity of acceſs to all the Rooms in the Houſe, more eaſily have done it, without this Aggravation of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the deteſtable Crime of <hi>Firing,</hi> to that of a ſimple Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony; and that ſhe might be ſo tempted, was more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as well becauſe 'tis too apparent that the Jeſuits (thoſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52244:7"/>
grand <hi>Incendiaries</hi> in all ſenſes) do carry on ſuch miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous deſigns, and have Actually made uſe of Perſons of her Condition, for that purpoſe; witneſs, their engaging <hi>Elizabeth Oxley,</hi> by the means of Mr. <hi>Stubbs,</hi> to fire the houſe of her Maſter, Mr. <hi>Birdan,</hi> Attorney in <hi>Fetter-Lane April</hi> 10th. 1679. Confeſſed both by her and the ſaid <hi>Stubbs;</hi> for which upon a Candid diſcovery of <hi>Gifford,</hi> the Prieſt, <hi>Molrayn,</hi> and others, that put them upon it (and who fled for the ſame) they obtain'd their Pardon: As alſo for that there was no place about the whole Town, where a Fire could probably do more miſchief: Mr. <hi>Delanoys</hi> Houſe being ſcituate near <hi>Pepper</hi> Alley, on the backſide of the <hi>Bear-Tavern,</hi> amongſt abundance of old wooden, cloſe Buildings, whence the devouring Flames (had they once got head, eſpecially the Houſe being fired in ſo many places) would eaſily have diſpers'd themſelves round about, and not only the Contiguous Alleys, and Courts, but St. <hi>Mary Overies</hi> ſtately Church, and the Houſes on the Bridge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would ſoon in all probability have been ſacrificed in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Devaſtation.</p>
            <p>Theſe and the like were Arguments, at leaſt to caution the Neighbouring Inhabitants to a moſt diligent inquiſition and vigilancy to find out, if they could poſſibly, the Perſon or Perſons that might inſtigate this Maid herein; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, ſeveral ſuſpicious people were taken, and brought to her, whom ſhe not knowing, honeſtly acquitted; but about nine, or ten of the Clock on the next day (being <hi>Munday)</hi> in the Fore-noon, a Gentleman came in all alone into the <hi>Bear-Tavern,</hi> at the Bridge foot, and called for a Pinte of <hi>Port,</hi> where ſitting by himſelf, the people of the Houſe obſerved him to be much in diſorder, and Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mind, as they apprehended; he ſeeming to matter ſomething to himſelf, and tearing into ſmall pieces certain papers that he had about him. But eſpecially (having 'tis
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52244:8"/>
probable) heard what kind of man <hi>Margaret Clark</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the Perſon to be, that had ſo Corrupted her, they fancyed that the ſame agreed (as indeed it did in a great meaſure) with this Gentleman, and therefore upon all theſe preſumptions, reſolved to apprehend him upon ſuſpicion, that he might give an account of himſelf before a Magiſtrate which was done accordingly: And as ſhe had preſently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged others that had been taken and brought to her, and they particularly askt, <hi>Is this be,</hi> or, <hi>is this he,</hi> ſtill ſhe replying, <hi>no;</hi> whereupon they were ſet at Liberty: So on the contrary, as ſoon as ever this Perſon entred the Room, and ſhe had caſt her Eye upon him, in a ſeeming ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſre, or tranſport mixt with rage, and joy, ſhe Cry'd out, <hi>O'Lard, that's the Man, that's the man, this is the man:</hi> repeating thoſe words ſeveral times with the greateſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs in the world, lifting up her hands towards Heaven; whereupon the Juſtices demanded<hi>—Are you ſure this is the man? may you not be miſtaken?</hi> To which ſhe anſwered, <hi>I am ſure this is He, and I am not miſtaken.</hi> Then was he taken into Examination, who ('tis ſaid, with many Oaths, and Execrations) denyed that he had ever ſeen her in his Life before (thought 'tis credibly reported ſome Perſons ſince affirmed they would prove that he had been ſeen with her, nay to go into Mr. <hi>Delanoy's</hi> Houſe, ſome few dayes before.) And being queſtion'd what he was, and where he lived; he gave the Juſtices an account, that his name was <hi>John Satterwait,</hi> and that he belonged to his Royal Highneſs the Duke of Yorks Guard, under the Command of the Earl of <hi>Feverſham,</hi> and that his Lodging was near St. <hi>Giles:</hi> The Juſtices proceeding to enquire, where he was, and how he ſpent the <hi>Sunday,</hi> and where he was all <hi>Sunday-</hi>Night. He anſwered, he was in Bed all day; but upon their inſiſting on an account, where he was in the Evening, and how he ſpent all the Night; he then trembled, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52244:8"/>
began to falter in his ſpeech, ſaying, <hi>I am ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd, and diſtracted, and know not what to ſay,</hi> (which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a very odd behaviour to the Juſtices, that a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of his Education, and Profeſſion, ſhould be ſo aſtoniſht that he could not remember, or ſet forth where he was but the very Night before; but his witneſſes at his Try at had much better memories, and gave a punctual account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) upon the Juſtices examining him, what buſineſs brought him that morning to the <hi>Bear-Tavern</hi> at the Bridge-foot where he was apprehended, He ſaid, that he came to meet one Mrs. <hi>Hummerſton,</hi> who lodged next door to him, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Juſtices ordered ſome perſons to attend at the Bear and obſerve if any Perſon enquired for Mr. <hi>Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwaits;</hi> and ſoon after a Gentle-Woman did come thither and ask, for him, who being carried before the Juſtices, and examined apart, did declare her name to be <hi>Hummer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi> and that ſhe came at Mr. <hi>Satterwaits</hi> Invitation ſo far to eat a Barrel of Oyſters; and there being nothing that ſeemed to affect her further in this buſineſs, ſhe was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged: But <hi>Margaret Clark</hi> perſiſted in her Accuſation of Mr. <hi>Satterwait,</hi> and charged him upon her Oath, to be the very Perſon that (with her privity and conſent) did Fire her maſters Houſe in all the three ſeveral places, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid; ſetting forth how he firſt came to her, as ſhe was ſtanding at her Maſters door, on that day was Se'nnight <hi>viz.</hi> the 26th of <hi>January</hi> laſt, and askt her if ſhe lived in that Houſe, who anſwering Affirmatively, he then inquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if her Maſter and Miſtreſs were within, and ſhe replying no, they were in the Country, he deſired to ſpeak with her about buſineſs that might be of great advantage to her; but being wholly a ſtranger ſhe ſlighted his diſcourſe and they proceeded no further that day, but ſoon after he came to her again, inveigled her to go drink, which ſhe did at a certain Ale-houſe in an Alley (the Sign or name of which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52244:9"/>
ſhe could not tell, but declared ſhe was confident ſhe could find and know it again, if ſhe might have had the Liberty to go to look it out;) that there with two other Perſons, they drank four Tankards of Ale, who made an agreement with her, to give her two thouſand Pounds if ſhe would aſſiſt in firing her Maſters houſe; that they had reſolved not to fire it till <hi>Munday</hi> Night <hi>Febr.</hi> 2. But ſhe underſtanding her Maſter and Miſtreſs would then be returned out of the Countrey, and ſeeing (as ſhe ſaid) this Mr. <hi>Satterwait</hi> again on the <hi>Saturday,</hi> they concluded <hi>Sunday</hi> night more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient; that ſhe let him in about four a Clock in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon on <hi>Sunday,</hi> hid him in the Dye-houſe, perſwaded the young man of the Houſe to go to bed by eight of the Clock, and then having all things in readineſs, about ten a Clock, he kindled the Fires, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As herein after in her Narrative, given under her hand, after her Condemnation; is more particularly, and fully ſet forth.</p>
            <p>In fine, after a large, and diligent Examination upon her Confeſſion againſt her ſelf, and charge upon Oath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Mr. <hi>Satterwait;</hi> they were both Committed to the <hi>Marſhalſea,</hi> with ſtrict charge that they ſhould be kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part: As Mr. <hi>Satterwait</hi> was carrying to Priſon, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a vaſt Tumult, or Crowd of people; the Juſtices gave a particular charge that no Violence ſhould be offered, or hurt done to his Perſon, yet the Multitude being fill'd with Indignation againſt that inſufferable, and deſtructive Crime, whereof they then imagined him to be guilty, could not forbear expreſſing their deteſtation againſt ſuch practices—Crying out, hang him, knock him on the head, ſtoning is too good for him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> At which Mr. <hi>Satterwait</hi> ſeemed much concern'd and apprehenſive that they would have done him ſome preſent harm, though indeed none did med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with him further than in words, and in this Conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and affirightment he was often heard by thoſe that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52244:9"/>
conducted him, to cry out by way of Prayer, or ſudden Ejaculation, <hi>Sancta Maria! Jeſu Maria</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Jeſu, Maria,</hi> repeating thoſe words very frequently, and with much earneſtneſs, and then reflecting upon the Crowd, and the harſh Sentences they were pleaſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon him, he would ſay, <hi>Sancta Maria!</hi> are theſe Chriſtians? <hi>Sancta Maria!</hi> are theſe Chriſtians and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants? Pagans, Pagans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His uſing theſe words confirmed many in their Opinion that he was a Papiſt, (but he denies it, and ſure a man may be allowed to know or chuſe his own Religion) inſomuch that for ſatisfaction in the point, a Reverend Divine going to viſit him in Priſon, amongſt other Diſcourſes happening to ask him, how he came ſo vehemently to call upon the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> adding further, that he believed that bleſſed Saint did not hear him: Mr. <hi>Satterwait</hi> to this only anſwered, he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred not that he uſed ſuch words, but if he did, he did not know the meaning of them: To which the Divine reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That that was ſomething unlikely, conſidering his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents had given him ſuch liberal Education.</p>
            <p>As to the Deportment of <hi>Margaret Clark,</hi> it is well known to all that viſited her, and all the Officers and Keepers belonging to the Goal, That ſhe carryed her ſelf all along during the whole time of her Confinement, which was ſeven weeks, very civilly and penitently, every day weeping abundantly, often ſending for Miniſters to come to her, to whom ſhe would moſt freely and affectionately expreſs her ſelf, much bewailing her ſins, eſpecially her great wickedneſs in complying with ſuch temptations, and conſenting to the wicked act for which ſhe was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> 1679/80, both the ſaid <hi>Margaret Clark</hi> and Mr. <hi>Satterwait</hi> were brought to their Trial at <hi>Kingſton</hi> upon <hi>Thames,</hi> where the Aſſizes for the County
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52244:10"/>
of <hi>Surrey</hi> were then held: They were both Arraigned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one and the ſame Indictment, for the wicked and fello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious entring into and ſetting on fire the Houſe and Dye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Peter Delanoy:</hi> Againſt the Maid there were Witneſſes that proved the Fire, and her own Confeſſion that ſhe was privy and conſenting to it, which (though ſhe pleaded <hi>Not Guilty</hi> for Form's ſake, yet) ſhe did not deny at Bar but only alledged that ſhe was ſo put upon it by her Fellow Priſoner but being charged in the ſame Indictment all ſhe ſaid was inſignificant and not to be regarded in Law as any Evidence againſt him. And for other proof the ſame was likewiſe altogether inſufficient: One Woman ſwore ſhe had often ſeen him in <hi>Southwark,</hi> and particularly on <hi>Thurſday</hi> before the Fire broke out, but could not ſay ſhe either ſaw him in <hi>Delanoy</hi>'s Houſe, or in Company with his Maid: The other depoſed that ſhe ſaw a man in a Red Coat go into Mr. <hi>Delanoy</hi>'s Houſe on the <hi>Sunday,</hi> but would not ſwear that the Priſoner was the perſon. On the other ſide, Mr. <hi>Satterwait</hi> had ſeveral Witneſſes, as his Mother and Uncle, to prove he was edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the Proteſtant Religion, a Certificate that he had received the Sacrament, and taken the Oaths of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, Supremacy, and Teſt; Four or five of the Guard to prove that he was at <hi>whitehall</hi> on <hi>Thurſday, Jan.</hi> 29. and at 3 a Clock went with them to the One Tun Tavern in St. <hi>Martins</hi> Lane where he ſtaid till three of the Clock on <hi>Fryday</hi> morning, <hi>January</hi> the <hi>30th.</hi> And from thence never out of their Company till two of the Clock in the Afternoon: At which time he came to a Houſe in <hi>Vine-Street,</hi> where he ſlept 'till Eight a Clock, and then came to his Mother's, and went to Bed, not riſing 'till Nine of the Clock on <hi>Saturday</hi> Morning, <hi>Jan.</hi> 31. and then went to the Guard till Three a Clock in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, then was at the Cock and Bottle in <hi>Covent-Garden</hi>

            <p>And indeed, ſhe ſeemed ſo far from any Impudence that there appeared a very great awe, and Reverence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her Spirit, not willingly to Commit any Sin; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhe gave a very Signal Example, of which ſeveral of us were Eye and Ear-witneſſes, <hi>viz.</hi> After Mr. <hi>Satterwait</hi>

Refuſe not to give mercy to a poor Sinner, I wholly reſt upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, I am reſolved to lie at his Feet. I will go in to the King: if I Periſh, I will periſh there.</q>
            </p>
            <p>One ſaid to her, what a great mercy God hath vouchſafed you, in giving you ſo long a Time of Repentance, and that he did not Cut you off in the Act. She replyed—<q>Oh! it is a great mercy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! I am ſenſible of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I bleſs the Lord for it, and hope God will enable me to ſpend theſe few</q>

            </p>
            <p>At another time one ſaid—Oh it is pitty that this man ſhould eſcape, that brought you to this: To which ſhe anſwered <q>Though he hath brought me to this, I wiſh him no more hurt than my own Soul. I did indeed deſire to ſpeak with him, Since he hath been acquitted, before he went to <hi>London;</hi> but he would not ſpeak with me;</q> whereupon one ſaid, why, what would you have ſaid to him? She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <q>Truly, nothing but Love to his Soul, I would have warned him not to undo any more, as he hath undone me: For I believe I am not the firſt, and am afraid I ſhall not be the laſt. I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid he had a hand in tempting thoſe other Maids in <hi>London.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>One telling her That he had heard many ſtrange Reports of her, and how that Mr. <hi>Satterwait</hi> had hinted in his Paper, that ſhe had been unjuſt to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of her late Maſters. She replyed. <q>As to thoſe Reports that go of me, many of them which I hear of are falſe, but I have not time, neither do I think it fit to vindicate my ſelf from them, for I have a great work to do, and have but a very little time to do it in.</q>

            <p>A day or two before her Execution, ſhe being deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give a ſincere and punctual Account, how ſhe came firſt engaged in this matter, and of all Tranſactions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

            <p>I <hi>Margret Clark</hi> being ſhortly to ſuffer Death for that which I have deſerved, and am much humbled for, and deſire to lye low before God under the ſenſe of my own Guilt, do give the World an Account of the truth of my Caſe, for I would not be guilty of a Lye now I am to appear before my Judg within a few minutes.

            <p>Upon the <hi>26th</hi> of <hi>January, John Satterthwait</hi> came to me as I was going out of my Maſters Gate, and did deſire me to tell him whether my Maſter and Miſtriſs were at home? And I anſwered him,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52244:14"/>
no; and he told me that he hoped he ſhould have an opportunity to ſpeak with me, for he had ſomething to ſay, And I anſwered him, if he had any thing to ſay, I ſhould be ſo civil to give him the hearing when I had time (for then I was in haſte). Then he came on the next day with the ſame Requeſt, and I returned the ſame Anſwer. Then he Third time; being <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> he came again, and uſed great, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and expreſſed ſome kindneſſes, as if he had been a Suitor, and prevailed with me to go into the Borrough with him to an Alehouſe, where were two Men more of his company; and after ſome little time of diſcourſe, he propounded to me this wicked and horrid Deſign which I was to have been ingaged in with them, that is, to let them into my Maſters Houſe to ſet it on Fire; and for a Reward, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed me Two thouſand pounds, which Sum I was to receive at the <hi>Fleece, Tavern</hi> in <hi>Holborn,</hi> inquiring for a Rom in the ſaid Tavern, called the <hi>Figure Nine.</hi> Then coming out of the Alehouſe, they would f<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So this <hi>John Satterthwait</hi> went homewards with meal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to my Maſters Oate; and as we went along, he charged me that I ſhould not divulge it to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the world living; for if I did, I ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly dye for it (and that quickly) in this world, and be damn'd in other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:52244:14"/>
Then he came on the next day, and gave me the ſame charge to keep it ſecret.</p>
            <p>And then on <hi>Saturday</hi> he came and inquired of me the beſt time that he might come to do this moſt horrid and devilliſh Action, ſaying, Would not four or five of the clock be a good time? And I ſaid Yes.</p>
            <p>Accordingly he came, and conveyed himſelf into the Dye-houſe, or thereabouts, while Nine or Ten of the Clock that Evening, about which time the Fire was diſcovered.</p>
            <p>Whereupon with the fear and dread he had put upon me, I did deny it to the company that came in to quench it; but after that, he was there, whom I ſaw amongſt the reſt of the company; but I had much horrour upon my Conſcience; and after ſome ſhort time I confeſt the whole Crime for which I now dye. And my Examination before Juſtice <hi>Reading,</hi> and Juſtice <hi>Freeman,</hi> was all true.</p>
            <p>And this I affirm, and do deſire all Proteſtants to believe, that <hi>John Satterthwait</hi> kindled thoſe three Fires in my Maſters Houſe. Firſt in the Dye-houſe by the Pump; ſecondly in the Buttery; and third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Garret, which laſt Fire he kindled whileſt the People were putting out the other.</p>
            <p>And I do declare in the words of a dying Maid, that I was under great trouble of Conſcience, and was many times about diſcovering it, but could not; Satans Temptations, and the wickedneſs of my own heart did ſo much prevail with me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:52244:15"/>
Oh that covetous deſign of gaining the Moneys, was that which I deſire all who read theſe Lines which I have writ, to beware of; I ſaw him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People in the Houſe very buſie, and I made ſigns at him, to diſcover him; but the people being in a great hurry, did not mind the things I then ſaid to them.</p>
            <p>I do alſo think in my conſcience, that if my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had examined me, I ſhould have declared the whole matter, for I gave out often ſuſpicious words of my fear of Fire; and on the <hi>Friday</hi> before this happened, I went out to a friends houſe, and there I was ſo afflicted and troubled in my mind, that they took notice of it; and one that went with me thither was importunate with me to know the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of my trouble; but the Devil had ſo ſubtilly ingag'd my wicked heart, that I could not tell him.</p>
            <p>But to paſs by my Conviction and Impriſonment, which you have all heard of, and to come to this one thing which fell out in the time of my Confinement in Priſon (which I bleſs God for, rather than that my moſt Loving and Honoured Maſter, with I know not how many others, ſhould have ſuffered by my wicked compliance with that Man).</p>
            <p>That which I ſpeak of is this: When I had been about three weeks in Priſon, I was then walking in the Yard, having that liberty granted me by the Jaylor, there <hi>John Satterthwait</hi> look'd out of a Window, and ſaid to me, Are you there? I wiſh I could come to you, I would ſpoil your telling of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52244:15"/>
Tales; but I gave him no anſwer; neither do I deſire his hurt or death, but beg of God while I am here in this world, Repentance for him; and oh that God would give him a ſenſe of theſe his great Sins, both in tempting me, and his deſigning the ruine of many Thouſands of Families; I can ſay before the Lord, I deſire not his Death; it would have been but a poor relief for me to have had him dyed with me: But this I muſt and will declare before I go hence, and am no more ſeen, That <hi>John Satterth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wait,</hi> though he was clear'd by the Jury, was Guilty, as I ſaid before, that is, of making thoſe three Fires, and I only did conſent, and let him in.</p>
            <p>Now I would not have you to think that I have written this to leſſen or excuſe my own fault; I deſerve Death, nay a worſer Death for conſenting to ſo horrid a wickedneſs, even eternal Death. But now I hope, that through the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt alone, not truſting to my own Works or Pardons from Men (as I fear the Papiſts do depend upon) to be ſaved from Eternal Fire; and that I ſhall be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified freely by his Grace, through the Redemption which he hath purchaſed with his own blood.</p>
            <p>Whereas there is a Report that is gone commonly about, that I had ſtol'n many of my Maſters things, as Plate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I think it fit now I am to dye, to give the World an Account of what I then took; the things which I had then put into my Box, was a little Tape, Lace, and other frivolous things, which
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52244:16"/>
now makes me wonder why I then put them up; for I might have put up Jewels and Plate, which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my Charge, to the value of ſome Hundreds of pounds; but as to the carrying out of a Box which I was met with, it is a moſt falſe report, for I was ſo full of horror and trouble of Conſcience, that I did not then think of my Box.</p>
            <p>And now I deſire all that read theſe Lines, would conſider, and have a great care how they break the Lords Day; for my neglecting thereof, was the firſt ſtep to my downfall; and I deſire this downfall of mine may be a warning to all young Men and Maids; Oh! let them be content with the places that God by his Providence places them in, and not covet after great things (as I have done) and ſo err from the Rule; and have a care of Pride and a worldly mind; for this I ſay, Pride and Sabbath-breaking hath been my downfall; and I earneſtly beg of you for the Lords ſake, and for your Souls ſake, to let theſe Lines, and my bad Example be a warning to you. Alas, I did once enjoy the means of Grace, and have lived in good Families; yea, he againſt whom I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this great offence, is a very Worthy good Man; Oh! I did once frequent the Worſhip of God, and took delight in it, and thought I underſtood ſomething of the Excellency of Chriſt, and the worth of my own Soul; but a little before I fell into this Sin, I neglected the Worſhip of God; and thoſe precious hours upon the Lords day which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly I had ſpent well.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:52244:16"/>
And thus I have fallen foully, and have offended God and Man; and my horrible Sin hath made me a publick ſpectacle to the world. I pray all whom I have offended in it, for Gods ſake to forgive me; and I forgive all men that have offended me, eſpecially I deſire to forgive this <hi>John Satterthwait,</hi> that hath brought me to this untimely and ſhameful Death, which, I hope, is brought upon me for my good; for ſurely I have obtained Mercy, and am joyful to think of my going hence; I long to be diſſolv'd, and to be with Chriſt; even ſo come Lord Jeſus, and receive me an unworthy Soul.</p>

On the Evening of the Sabbath before ſhe was Executed, Juſtice <hi>Freeman</hi> (who was of thoſe that took her firſt Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation as aforeſaid) came with many other worthy perſons, and did again ſtrictly examine her concerning the truth of what ſhe had charged upon Mr. <hi>Satterthwait:</hi> To whom ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; <q>Sir, It is all true that I ſaid concerning him, when I was before your Worſhip upon my firſt Examination, and what I have ſaid all along, and which I cannot but teſtifie to the laſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Morning before Execution, a Miniſter very ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcourſed with her about the ſame buſineſs, urging and charging her ingeniouſly and fully to disburthen her Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and if ſhe had been guilty of wronging him by a falſe Accuſation, to confeſs it, and beg pardon of God, and not mock the All-ſeeing Majeſty, before whoſe dreadful preſence ſhe muſt ſo ſuddenly appear: To which ſhe replyed; <hi>Alas! what will it avail me to accuſe any one falſly? for as I am condemned, ſo I certainly expect to ſuffer the Law, and what Revenge can I take upon him, or hurt do him, for he is acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Law; I do freely forgive him for whatſoever he hath done againſt me, and deſire of the Lord to forgive him, and that the Lord would turn his heart; For if God doth not turn it, I am afraid he will be an Inſtrument of further Miſchief.</hi>

               <p>Sir, I ſaw <hi>John Satterthwait</hi> every day of the Week before. I ſaw him on Monday, on Tueſday, he perſwaded me to conſent, on Wedneſday came to me, as alſo Thurſday and Friday, to confirm me in it, and on Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday he was with me, and then reſolved upon the firing

my honoured Maſters Houſe on <hi>Sunday;</hi> and accordingly on <hi>Sunday</hi> in the Afternoon towards Evening I let him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Maſters Houſe: Oh! why ſhould I accuſe a perſon that is not guilty? I muſt now forthwith appear before God; Oh my ſins! I deſire my worthy Maſter to forgive me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doctor.</speaker>
               <p>I do aſſure you <hi>Margaret,</hi> your Maſter and Miſtreſs have forgiven you; and <hi>Margaret,</hi> here is <hi>Arthur Adams,</hi> which was one of the witneſſes againſt you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Margaret.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>I freely forgive him and all men, and deſire him and all men to forgive me, for God hath forgiven me.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Martin.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>What aſſurance haſt thou of Gods forgiveneſs?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Margaret.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>I know in whom I have believed,</hi> I have had great Joys from the Lord, ſince Sentence paſſed upon me; bleſſed be God that ever I came into a Priſon.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Martin</hi> ſpeaking to the Two Men that ſuffered with her, ſaid; Gentlemen, you that ſuffer with this poor Maid; I wiſh I could ſee that concernedneſs and affection; I would be glad to hear you expreſs your ſelves ſomething after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Pray let us know whether it be well with you.</p>
            <p>They anſwered, <hi>Sir, It is well, we have no doubt.</hi>
            </p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doctor. <hi>Mart.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Margaret,</hi> ask that Man at your right-hand how it is with him, whether he feels any of thoſe Comforts and Joys you ſpeak of.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>
               <hi>Margaret</hi> turning to Mr. <hi>Selby,</hi> ſaid, <hi>How is it with you? look up to Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He anſwered, <hi>It is well.</hi>
            </p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doctor <hi>Martin,</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I wiſh you may ſay ſo an hour hence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Margaret.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>O Lord Jeſus, receive my poor Soul, into thy Arms I commend my Spirit; Oh! the Tranſcendent Joys; I am not able to expreſs the Joys I have had ſince I have been condemned.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then Dr. <hi>Martin</hi> prayed with them moſt excellently and affectionately; after which ſhe continued crying out; <hi>Oh the Glory! Oh the Glory!</hi> till the Executioner was going to pin the Hood down over her Face, ſhe ſaid, <hi>I, come as ſoon as you will, I care not how ſoon;</hi> but he not preſently doing it, ſhe ſpake again to the people, and ſaid, <hi>I humbly thank all the peoples of God, all good people for their prayers to God for me;</hi> and ſaid ſhe, <hi>I have given an account in a Writing, which I hope will ſatisfie the World; for I take God to witneſs, that all that</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:52244:20"/>
               <hi>I have written in that Paper is all true; O Lord thou knoweſt I would not lye, I am coming to thee!</hi> Upon which, the under Sheriff and Officers made Inquiry for it, which was quickly carried down to the High Sheriff, who was ſo affected, that his Worſhip was pleaſed earneſtly to deſire a Copy thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſame was Printed. But the Original is delivered into his Worſhips hands, as aforeſaid, and a true Copy thereof is here before Printed: The Miniſter who is Ordnary being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, did juſtifie to the Sheriff, Sir <hi>Robert Hatton</hi> Knight, and many other worthy Perſons there preſent; that he had read it before in Priſon, when ſhe deſired him to ſubſcribe it, that it might not be queſtioned whether it was hers after her Death or no.</p>
            <p>When the Executioner was pulling down her Hood, to do his laſt Office; ſhe put it up her ſelf again, and ſaid, <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, I have one thing more to ſay, I have ſeen a Paper that</hi> John Satterthwait <hi>hath put out in his vindication.</hi>
            </p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Martin.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Ah! <hi>Margaret,</hi> have you read that vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Margaret.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yes</hi> Sir, <hi>Mr.</hi> Cole <hi>read it to me.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Martin.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Cole,</hi> did you read it to her?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Cole.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Yes Sir, I did read it to her.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Martin.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Well, what ſay you to it <hi>Margaret?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Margaret.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is falſe, it is falſe, he hath added another ſin to his great wickedneſs: I wiſh I may be the laſt that he may ruin in this World. I teſtifie before you all, now I am going to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; that he is the very Man, and that that Paper is a wicked and falſe Paper.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <p>And ſo her Hood being put down again, juſt as the Cart was Drawing away, the laſt words ſhe was heard to pronounce were, <hi>Come, Lord Jeſus, receive me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have we given the World a faithful account of this poor Wretches Crime and Behaviour, and what ſhe declared and perſiſted in to the laſt; with the great Remorſe ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed for all ſin, and the mighty work of God upon her Soul, in the refreſhing Comforts which ſhe declared ſhe had given in to her from the time of Condemnation, till the laſt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52244:20"/>
moment of her Life. All which we leave to each Readers conſideration and reflection, to Credit or Disbelieve her Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverations, and make ſuch judgment thereof as he ſhall think fit. This Publication not being intended to caſt any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection or Scandal on the Gentleman, whom the Law hath Acquitted, much leſs upon the Honourable Court, or honeſt Jury, before and by whom he was Tryed, <hi>De non apparenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus &amp; non exiſtentibus eadem eſt ratio;</hi> ſecret things belong to the Omniſcient Judge, his dreadful Tribunal will clear all perplexing difficulties, and make it appear which of their Proteſtations (horrible of neceſſity on one flde) were grounded upon Truth: But Earthly Magiſtrates cannot pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the heart, but muſt proceed according to what overtly appears, and Legal Evidence.</p>
            <p>However, we cannot but take notice, that ſince this poor Maid was Executed, there has been a falſe and malicious ſtory publiſhed concerning her, in one of <hi>Nath. Thompſons</hi> ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Libels, falſly called THE TRUE DOMESTICK INTELLIGENCE. He having in that of <hi>Tueſday</hi> the <hi>30th of March,</hi> this paſſage. <q>
                  <hi>Kingſtone, March the</hi> 21. There was omitted in the <hi>Proteſtant Domeſtick Intelligence,</hi> in relating the laſt Words and Confeſſion of <hi>Mary Clark (for ſo he falſty calls her)</hi> who was Executed for Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Houſe of Mr. <hi>De la Noy</hi> Dyer in <hi>Southwark; viz.</hi> That at her Execuion, there was a Fellow, who deſigned to Marry her under the Gallows (according to the ancient Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Cuſtome) but ſhe being <gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unwilling, but when the Rope was about <gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">
                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſhe cryed, ſhe was willing, and then the Fellows friends diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him from Marrying her; and ſo ſhe loſt her Husband and her Life together.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Which lying ſtory is both a Barbarous ſcandal to the dead, and an abuſe to the living, there being nothing of it true: Nor the leaſt ground or colour for ſuch a ſuggeſtion, for as we know of no ſuch Cuſtome allowed by Law, that any Mans offering at a Place of Execution to Marry a Woman Condemned, ſhall ſave her; ſo there was no ſuch offer or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention that ever was heard of in this Caſe, and ſo far was ſhe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52244:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from being in hopes of a Reprieve, that ſhe neither expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nor deſired it. But by the ſubtle wording of this loud lye, it may be thought this Intelligencer from ſome of his great Acquaintance may have learnt a Jeſuitical Equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and alleadge, that he does not relate it as Truth that really happened; but only ſays, <hi>that ſuch a thing was left out of the Relation;</hi> becauſe indeed there was no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and therefore had no reaſon to be put in. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that Evaſion, all honeſt and good Men muſt deteſt ſuch baſe practices of promoting lies and ſcandals; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially this News-monger might the rather forbear to do it on a perſon Executed, ſince he knows not how ſoon it may be his own turn, being at this inſtant in Cuſtody charged with being privy to a Treaſonable Conſpiracy, as appears by his own ſhewing in that very Paper wherein this ſtory is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted.</p>
            <p>As for the Truth of the ſaid <hi>Margaret Clarks</hi> Behaviour and Speeches before ſet forth in this Narrative, we can appeal (as to a great part thereof) to Juſtice <hi>Reading,</hi> and Juſtice <hi>Freeman,</hi> as alſo to Dr. <hi>Martin,</hi> and ſeveral other Miniſters who viſited her; particularly, as to her Deportment, and Speeches at Execution; the ſame are Atteſted by a great number of perſons of good worth and credit, ſome of whoſe Names are as follow;</p>
