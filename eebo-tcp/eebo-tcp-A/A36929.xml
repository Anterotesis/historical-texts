            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A SERMON Preached upon the Anniversary of the Martyrdom of King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the First.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Acts 7. 60.</bibl>
               <q>—Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is the Prayer of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> the Proto-Martyr for his Persecutors and Murderers: and it was the Prayer of our late Royal Martyr for his Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Murderers too; for these were his words in his Speech at his Death, <hi>I pray God, with St.</hi> Stephen, <hi>that this be not laid to their charge.</hi> And this is one part of the Parallel may be drawn between these two Martyrs, to make the Text <hi>verbum diei,</hi> sutable to the time. Another may be taken from the 9 and 10 Verses of the foregoing Chapter, where we find <hi>the Synagogue of the Libentines</hi> and others, <hi>disputing with Stephen; and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.</hi> And did not our Royal Martyr too dispute with the <hi>Libertines?</hi> (for <hi>Liberty</hi> was the pretence both in Church and State) did he not dispute with the Kirk-men of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and others here at home, and so confound 'um, that <hi>they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake,</hi> as is notoriously known, and yet to be seen in his incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable

Works? 3. Was it not for the Cause (and <note place="margin">Non poena sed causa facit Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrem. <hi>S. Aug. Epist.</hi> 61.</note>

Some part of a parallel, by way of allusion, may be in the name: <hi>Stephen</hi> signifies a <hi>Crown,</hi> and ever since 'tis call'd the <hi>Crown</hi> of Martyrdom, <hi>Martyrium Stephani Martyrii Stephanus:</hi> 'tis not mine, but <hi>Gregory Nyssen</hi>'s in his. Encomiastic Oration upon him: <hi>Stephen</hi>

And was not the Murther of our Royal <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of a <hi>Crown?</hi> for our Regicides did not only kill the King, but the <hi>Crown</hi> it self, as much they could, not only an annointed <hi>Crowned</hi> King, but the <hi>Crown</hi> and Kingdom too. Thus they found out a way to bring <hi>Caligula</hi>'s wish to effect, and by a Compendium of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, <hi>uno ictu</hi> to decoll the whole Kingdom; for when they cut off his Head, they cut off the Head of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (so <hi>Carolus</hi> in Greek signifies <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) and they made account the People shu'd never have a <hi>head</hi> more, but be <hi>Acephali</hi> both in Church and State; not any one <hi>head,</hi> no Monarch, nor King, but I know not what; and so they shu'd have been a kind of a Hydra, or <hi>bellua multorum capitum.</hi> 5. And lastly, St. <hi>Stephen</hi> was the Proto-Martyr, or first Martyr; and so was our St. <hi>Charles:</hi> but how can this be? you'l say: is not this a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that there shu'd be two Proto-Martyrs, two first Martyrs, and those so long one after another? but my meaning is, ours was the first that ever was Murder'd or Martyr'd in the like kind: for was it ever heard of, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded or read in any Story, that there ever was in any age of the world the like horrid Barbarity, such a quint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essence of Treason, Rebellion and Cruelty, as was acted this day upon his Sacred Person? He being the first

crown'd and anointed King that was thus murder'd by his own Subjects at his own Palace-gate, and that by a Mock-High-Court of Justice, or rather by a deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dissembling Court of most high Injustice; the first ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in this kind, and so a Proto-Martyr too. But I shall leave these, and return to that part of the Parallel, which we meet withal here, <hi>viz.</hi> his praying for his Enemies, Persecutors, and Murderers, as St. <hi>Stephen</hi> does in the words of the Text, <hi>Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.</hi> In which words observ with me these five particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Here's <hi>Designatio criminis,</hi> the designation of a Crime, or Sin; the pointing out of some special, signal, remarkable Sin, <hi>this</hi> Sin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Reatus,</hi> or <hi>meritum peccati,</hi> the guilt or demerit of Sin in general, 'tis to be <hi>layd</hi> to the Sinner's <hi>charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Misericordia Dei,</hi> the mercy of God in giving a discharge to Sinners sometimes, and not <hi>laying</hi> their <hi>sins to their charge.</hi> This suppos'd, else it had been in vain for <hi>Stephen</hi> to ha' made such a Prayer.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Virtus Orationis,</hi> the efficacy and power of Prayer in procuring a pardon, and prevailing with God to grant a discharge, and not to <hi>lay sin to the charge</hi> of a Sinner.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And lastly, <hi>Officium Christiani,</hi> the <hi>duty</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians under the Cross, by St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s example to pray for their Persecutors, as he did here, <hi>Lord, lay not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Here's <hi>Designatio criminis,</hi> the pointing out of some special, signal, remarkable Sin, <hi>this</hi> Sin: some extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary great Sin sure it was, a Sin of the first magnitude, <hi>crimen majoris abollae.</hi> This appears by our Martyr's Praying, and Praying so earnestly <hi>with a loud voice,</hi> for the pardon and forgiveness of it, <hi>lay not this sin, this</hi>


               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:98012:5"/>
Sin; with an emphasis; this great, grievous, heinous Sin, lay not <hi>this</hi> Sin to their charge. 'Tis true, there's no Sin but stands in need of pardon; yet all Sins are not equal (as the <hi>Stoics</hi> wu'd have them) but some greater than others, and so require a greater measure of repentance; and men must pray and cry louder than ordinary for the pardon and forgiveness of them: Especially when we pray for the pardon of other mens Sins, making parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular mention of 'um, we do not commonly take notice of Gnats but Camels, not of Moats but Beams, not of Mole-hills but Mountains: I mean, we do not use to spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie or particularize any with a demonstrative, <hi>hoc pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, this</hi> Sin, unless it be some extraordinary heinous crying Sin; and such a one (it seems) was this here; a crying Sin, or else <hi>Stephen</hi> wu'd never have cry'd so loud for the pardon, and non-imputation of it. Indeed this was the last Sin he knew they were guilty of, and they were now flagrant in the actual commission of it, and so he might be the more concern'd for 'um, and the more sensible of it; and the rather because he felt the fruit or rather the smart of it, while the stones came ratling about his ears. But this was not it; sure there was more in it then so: for what cu'd his crying out avail him, or do him good as to that? he knew they were implacably set against him: he knew he cu'd not hold <hi>their</hi> hands from <hi>stoning</hi> him, but he hop'd God might hold <hi>his</hi> from <hi>striking</hi> them; 'twas not then his own particular interest that made him put an emphasis upon the Sin, <hi>this</hi> Sin: 'twas not the stones on his <hi>head</hi> that troubled him so much, nor the stones i'their <hi>hands,</hi> but the stone i'their <hi>hearts,</hi> their hard, and obdurate, and stony hearts; of which their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and hardness of heart, <hi>this</hi> Sin in stoning him was too evident, and pregnant a proof. And though this was the last Sin he knew of 'um, yet he


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98012:5"/>
knew 'twas not the least, but rather the greatest that ever they had committed, the most heinous, and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and bloody Sin that ever they were guilty of, next to that of crucifying their King, and Murdering his and their Lord and Saviour. And therefore in his Sermon to 'um, of all their other Sins, he only takes notice of this, and upbraids 'um with it, <hi>v.</hi> 52, <hi>As your fathers did, so do ye; which of the Prophets have not your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers persecuted?</hi> And so our blessed Saviour in that pathetical exclamation of his, where he so passionately bewails and laments the sinful estate of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> though he knew her to be guilty of many other heinous and grievous Sins, yet he singles out this Sin above all, as the most capital Crime, and chief of all, <hi>O Jerusalem,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matth. 23. 37.</note> 
               <hi>Jerusalem, thou that killest the Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. This then was the Sin, <hi>this</hi> Sin here i'the Text, killing a Prophet, stoning a Minister and Messenger of God, that was sent unto 'um to teach 'um the way of Salvation, and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering him, only for preaching Christ and the Gospel, and standing stoutly in defence of the truth. And was not this a Sin (as I may say) with a witness, thus to slay a Witness and Martyr of the Lord Jesus? Homicide in general, the murder of any man whomsoever, is a hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and bloody Sin, one of those three crying Sins, so call'd in Scripture, and I think the chief of the three, that cry loud to Heaven for vengeance. And as it was the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi>'s first-born, so it was the first-born Sin we read of next to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi>'s; and we find God setting a brand and a mark upon it (as he did upon <hi>Cain</hi> the first committer of it) and threatning it with a special curse of retaliation, <hi>He that sheddeth man's blood, by</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 9. 6.</note>

commit Murder; a Sin so foul and heinous in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and so directly against the Law of Nature, that the very Heathen by the Divine light of natural reason, saw the ugliness and deformity of it; and therefore did hate and abhor it, and made it a capital Crime, and so to be punish'd with <hi>Lex talionis,</hi> according to the fore-named Divine Law. Such is <hi>this</hi> Sin, <hi>this</hi> Sin here of Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and Murder in general, a black, foul, grievous, and horrid Crime, a crying Sin, a Sin that crys loud to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for vengeance: but much more when 'tis the shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>innocent</hi> blood, the putting of a just and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man to death: and how much more yet, when 'tis the killing of a Prophet, a Minister and Messenger of God, and that for no other cause i'the world, but for speaking the truth in the name of the Lord, and in the very act of his preaching to them the truth of God; the Murder of a Martyr and witness of Christ, yea and of his very witness too which he bare, and the thing witnessed, (what in them lay) Now such as was the stoning of <hi>Stephen,</hi> who here seals the truth of the Gospel, and of Christian Religion with his blood, and thus prays for his Murderers, <hi>Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.</hi> This the Sin i'the Text; and what think ye of the Sin o'the Day? Stoning of <hi>Stephen,</hi> the Sin i'the Text; Killing the King, the Sin o'the Day. Somthing I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd in the beginning concerning these two Martyrs and their Sufferings by way of Parallel. And though I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess the stoning of <hi>Stephen</hi> as to the ground and cause of his suffering scarce admits of any Parallel since the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying of Christ, the Martyrdom of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> being a direct Murdering of Christ again, in the first preaching of the Gospel to God's ancient people by his inspir'd Evangelist and Prophet; yet, in some respects at least, I think I may safely say, the transcript not only equals, but


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98012:6"/>
even exceeds the Proto-type, and the Copy outdoes the Original, I mean, the Sin of the Day outgoes the Sin i'the Text; whether we consider the rank and <hi>quality</hi> of the Sufferers, or the <hi>malice</hi> of the Murderers, or the <hi>manner</hi> of the proceedings, cloath'd with many black, foul, ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating circumstances; of which I shall not need now to speak particularly, they being so well known to the world. I shall only at present take notice of the rank and quality of the Sufferer, or Person of our Royal Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr; which alone is sufficient to aggravate <hi>this</hi> Sin, to enhance and heighten it to the highest point and pitch of impiety. And here I shall take a brief view of him in a double capacity, first in his <hi>Political</hi> capacity, as a King; then in his <hi>Moral</hi> or <hi>Personal</hi> capacity, as a man, or a Christian: And I hope I may make a better use of this distinction, than some have formerly done. First, look upon him as a King; he was a Royal Martyr. St. <hi>Stephen</hi> though he had a <hi>Crown</hi> in his name, and wore the <hi>Crown</hi> of Martyrdom, and that set with stones, and those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious stones (for <hi>Precious in the sight of the Lord is the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 116. 15,</note> 
               <hi>death of his Saints);</hi> yet he had no <hi>Crown</hi> on his head; I mean, he never wore a Crown of Gold, as our Royal Martyr did, who was a crowned and anointed King, and so his Person Sacred and inviolable; <hi>Sacrosanct a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum Majestas,</hi> being generally own'd and acknowledg'd by all, even the most barbarous Nations; and the Supreme Majesty having a stamp of Divinity, and so a <hi>Noli me tangere</hi> set upon it by the Laws both of God and Man. Such was the Martyr o'the day, our late dread Soveraign <hi>Charles</hi> the First of ever blessed and glorious Memory, whose Sacred Majesty cu'd not not secure it self from the malice and cruelty of blood-thirsty men, though his own natural profess'd Subjects. The Jews that ston'd <hi>Stephen,</hi> were his Enemies; but they were not


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98012:7"/>
his Subjects: they might be sworn <hi>against</hi> him, be his sworn Enemies, but they were not sworn <hi>to</hi> him, not his sworn Subjects: he was not their Leige Lord and Master; they never swore fealty nor allegeance to him as our Jews had done to our Martyr-King. Those Jews that put <hi>Stephen</hi> to death, Persecutors they were, and Murderers; but they were not Traitors nor Rebels, as ours were: they were guilty of shedding <hi>innocent</hi> blood, but yet they were not guilty of shedding <hi>Royal</hi> blood, as our Jews were: <hi>Homicides</hi> they were, yea and <hi>Propheticides</hi> (as I may say), they kill'd a Prophet, a Preacher of righteousness, a Deacon, a Church-man; but they were not <hi>Regicides,</hi> not guilty of Rebellion and Treason, as ours were to purpose. In stoning of <hi>Stephen,</hi> they did not Murder their Lord and Master, their Leige Lord and Soveraign King, as ours did this day: Traytors they were not, they did not betray him, nor did they conspire and contrive and plot his death by any premeditated malice; but transported with a rash blind zeal, and hurry'd on with a sudden impetuous fury, <hi>they ran upon him with one accord</hi> (saith the Text) <hi>and cast</hi> 
               <note place="margin">V. 57. 58.</note> 
               <hi>him out of the City, and ston'd him:</hi> but our Jews did their work in a more deliberate way; they did plot and forecast; and drive on their design by a long train and myne of mischief; they wove a curious web of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, spun a fine thread of Rebellion and Treason, and then cut it, or rather cut him, off, in a methodical way, by a Pageantry of villany, by a Mock-Court of Justice kill'd their King, and embrew'd their hands <hi>(animus me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minisse horret)</hi> in the blood o'their Soveraign, the Lord's anointed. That for his <hi>Political</hi> capacity, as King and Supreme. Now for his <hi>Moral</hi> or <hi>Personal,</hi> take him as a Man or a Christian, <gap reason="foreign">

I read in a very good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of a strange custom among a people of <hi>Scythia</hi> call'd <note place="margin">Grot. <hi>De Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fact. cap.</hi> 10.

They on the other side quite contrary, blam'd him for nothing else, at least for nothing so much, as his inclination to Popery; and all because he wu'd not dance after their pipe, nor suffer himself to be carried with the stream o'the Faction, nor swim with them down the <hi>Leman</hi> lake; but stood firm for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in opposition to both extreams. Thus he was crush'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two milstones, and Crucify'd like Christ by Jew and Gentile, and between two thievs: For 'twas resolv'd and decreed, <hi>one man must dye for the people,</hi> as <hi>Caiaphos</hi> said: for the people indeed, he must be made a Sacrifice, and a Martyr for the Laws and Liberties, and Religion too, of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it stood by Law esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd both for Doctrine and Discipline. I hope, after all this, ye do not expect, I should give you a complete Character of him, nor an exact Catalogue of all those vertues and graces, of which I nam'd but a few even now, that were so eminent and exemplary in him, and shin'd so remarkably in his Royal Person.

But I labour in vain to show you the ugliness of this most execrable and heinous Crime: to describe and portray this horrid Monster in its full proportion, in all its lineaments and lively colours, wu'd require a volume, or rather many volumes, to be writ of it: yea, he that wu'd paint out <hi>this</hi> Sin in its colours, must not do it in writing, not in black and white, but in black and red; for 'twas as black as hell, and as red as blood; as red as the <hi>red Dragon,</hi> yea as red as Scarlet, as the <hi>Scarlet whore,</hi> if <hi>Rome</hi> be <hi>she;</hi> and sure the hand of <hi>Joab,</hi> the Jesuit with his King-killing Doctrine, was in all this, and every one o'the Regicides had a Pope in his belly, to give him a Dispensation, and absolv him from his Oath of Allegiance.

               <hi>men the man Christ Jesus.</hi> I say, no other Advocates nor Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators in Heaven; yet we have a sort of inferiour Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates and Intercessors on earth, <hi>viz.</hi> our fellow. Christians, that may and do make intercession for us, and are daily Orators in our behalf at the throne of Grace; praying to God for us, that he wu'd not impute our Sins unto us. Some on earth then we have, that intercede and pray for us, but none in Heaven, but our Saviour Christ; I mean none that pray for us in particular,"though in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, the Church Triumphant in Heaven, may pray for the Church Militant here on earth; yet, I scy, no Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted pray for us in partkcular, for ought we know, and <hi>Viventes pro viventibus, ergo Defuncti,</hi> is no good consequence by the Cardinal's leav; for they that live and converse with us here on earth, may see and know our wants, or we may impart our thoughts and desires, our needs and necessities to 'um: but that the Saints in Heaven either know my wants, or hear my Prayers, I ha' no ground to believ, because no warrant at all in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; therefore I cannot in Faith call upon 'um, nor pray unto 'um to pray, and intercede for oe: and though St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Prayer might prevail for his Persecutors, while he was upon earth, yet it cannot prevail with me to say, <hi>Sancte Stephane, or a me,</hi> now he's in Heaven. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this benefit and advantage we have by that Article of our Creed, <hi>the Communion of Saints,</hi> that we who are members of the Catholic Church here on earth, reap the fruit of one anothers Prayers. Nor is this sweet perfume of the Prayers of the Saints confin'd within the verge and pale o'the Christian Church, but extends it self to the benefit even of Jews, Turks, Infidels and Heretics; so that when <hi>this alabaster box is broken,</hi> and these Prayers pour'd forth, the whole world <hi>is fill'd with the odour of the Oyntment.</hi> Though then the mediation and

intercession of Christ in Heaven be the sole meritorious cause of a <hi>nè imputes,</hi> of not <hi>laying sin to the sinner's charge:</hi> yet by the vertue of his merit and mediation, the Prayers and Intercessions of Holy men upon earth are very prevalent, and impetratorious in their kind, as motives and inducements to God to give a discharge, not as meriting, but procuring causes, or rather not cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses but occasions, of the remission of Sins; and not only of their own, but even of other mens Sins. Yet is not this done <hi>per saltum</hi> neither, but by degrees, I mean, by some previous qualifications and conditions requisite to be perform'd by the Sinner himself, to render him capable of so great a favour as this non-imputation; such as godly sorrow, and hearty repentance, and, an unfeigned purpose of amendment o'life: therefore, <hi>Qui vult fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, vult media:</hi> he that prays for another, that God wu'd <hi>not lay his sins to his charge,</hi> is presum'd to pray withal, that God wu'd give him Grace to repent of his Sins; this latter being the way and means to procure and obtain the former: for as <hi>without shedding o' blood</hi> (the blood o' Christ) so without shedding o' tears (the tears of a Sinner) <hi>i. e.</hi> without godly sorrow and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>there is no remission.</hi> So then the Prayers of the faithful are a powerful and prevalent means, whereby God is mov'd and enclin'd to give repentance to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and consequently remission of Sins. <hi>Let the Elders pray over the sick</hi> person (says St. <hi>James); and the Prayer</hi>

Thus in <hi>thesi;</hi> and thus it was no doubt in <hi>hypothesi,</hi> in St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s case: for we may well believ, that by his patient suffering, and powerful praying, some of that <hi>durum genus,</hi> of those hard stony-hearted Jews, with their <hi>stones</hi> i'their <hi>hands,</hi> and their <hi>stone</hi> i'their <hi>hearts,</hi> were mollify'd to conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and brought to repentance; and that as <hi>God</hi> was <hi>able,</hi> so he was willing, <hi>of those stones to raise up chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>

And now shall we say that our Royal Martyr's Prayer this day had the like effect upon his? we hope it had; at least upon some of 'um. 'Twas <hi>his</hi> charity to pray for 'um, and it must be <hi>our</hi> charity (and nothing else) to hope the best of 'um, that the guilt of that innocent and Royal blood (this day shed) was wash't away from 'um by the blood o' Christ, and the tears of true repentance, and so this bloody Sin <hi>not layd to their charge.</hi> However our Proto-Martyr here i'the Text, and our Princely Martyr here o'the day, have both set us a Copy, and taught us our Duty, <hi>viz.</hi> by their example to pray for our Persecutors:</p>

You'l say, this is a Doctrine and a Duty for Christians under the Cross, but (thanks be to God) we are not so; we are not with <hi>Stephen</hi> under a show'r of stones, nor with our Royal Martyr in the hands of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers.

If we look abroad, the face of things has no such pleasing nor promising aspect. But I will not <hi>malè ominari;</hi> and now especially when I am upon a theme of <hi>charity,</hi> which <hi>thinketh no evil,</hi> loth I am to <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 6.</note> suspect the worst.

But as for the Persecutors and Murderers, those 'ithe Text, and those o'the day espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, they are the objects of our Martyr's charity, and therefore of ours.

had their doom already; now they are dead, and in another world, our charity will do 'um no good, 'tis in vain to pray for 'um: The living, the living are they we must pray for, and they to whom we must extend our charity. If then there be any of 'um yet alive, who had either a head in plotting and contriving, or a hand in acting and executing the <hi>hoc peccatum,</hi> the Sin o' this day, our charity bids us pray (and we cannot do less for 'um) that God wu'd give 'um a sight o' their horrid Sin, and Grace to repent earnestly and heartily of it, that so it may never be <hi>layd to their charge;</hi> nay, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, our charity (that <hi>believeth all things, and hopeth</hi>

And this (though we may wish to see more apparent signs of it, yet) where we see no manifest signs to the contrary, this, I say, in charity we are to hope and believ. And if we thus hope and believ, then let us forgive and forget; forgive after the example of our Martyr King, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get according to the pattern of his Son, our now Gracious Soveraign, whom God long preserv; who has profess'd, as I have heard, that he that touches his Royal Act of grace and favour, I mean, that most gracious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Act of <hi>Indemnity,</hi> touches the apple of his eye. Let us then pass such an Act of Amnestie and Oblivion too in our own breasts; I mean, an Act of Oblivion as to others, but not to our selves; for we must never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, but remember, that we our selves all of us, more or less, have had a finger, if not a hand i' <hi>this</hi> Sin o'the day. I know, this will startle some: How? will some say, I hope not so; God forbid; who, I a hand i'the King's death?

I say, in some kind or other, remotely at least, if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately;


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98012:15"/>
meritoriously if not executoriously; virtually if not formally; by consequence if not directly; by a sinful connivance and complyance it may be, though not by a down-right plotting and contrivance. However accessories we are, though not the Principals; our Sins being the procuring meritorious cause of God's permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Sin, this bloody Sin, this Sin of the day. 'Twas for our Sins, our national Sins, our personal Sins, that God open'd the flood-gates, and suffer'd the banks to be broken down, and let loose those torrents of <hi>Belial,</hi> those floods of ungodliness, that deluge and inundation of wickedness, that overwhelm'd and drown'd both King and Kingdom. We abhor the very name and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of those cursed and cruel Rebels, and if we shu'd meet any of 'um, we are ready to cast dust and dirt, and throw stones at 'um: But if none but <hi>he that is without sin among us,</hi> shu'd <hi>take up the first stone to fling at 'um,</hi> truly the stones might lye still long enough for all us. Therefore let us take off our eyes a while from beholding o' them, and reflect, and look a little upon our selves, and knock at our own doors, to see whether all be well at home. Though I hope we had no direct immediate hand nor heart in the Sin of this day; yet shu'd we be called to account for it, who of us all here present (if then alive, and of ripe years) cu'd now plead not guilty? Doubtless they were the Sins of the Nation in general, and the Sins of every one of us in particular that shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd the Ax, and brought the King to his end. It was <hi>for our many and great provocations that God did suffer his Anointed to fall this day into the hands of violent and blood-thirsty men;</hi> as our Church in her Collect for this day devoutly confesses; and again, <hi>We humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that the Sins of this Nation have been the cause which hath brought this heavy judgment upon us.</hi>


               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:98012:16"/>
Many national Sins I might name, which were then rife and common among us, and so they are still; which then provok'd God's wrath against us, and so they do still (for truly the world is not much mended since). But because St. <hi>Stephen</hi> had so much to do with <hi>Libertines,</hi> and our Royal Martyr with those that cry'd out so much for <hi>Liberty,</hi> I shall therefore only take notice of that universal <hi>Libertinism,</hi> looseness, and licenciousness, that seems to overspread the whole body o' the Kingdom. Men every where taking <hi>Liberty</hi> enough, whether it be giv'n 'um or no. We ha' need of more <hi>Stephens</hi> to beat down our <hi>Libertines;</hi> such a general <hi>Libertinism</hi> possesses the Nation: An <hi>Atheistical</hi> loosness, licenciousness, and prophaneness, in point of Morality, as to life and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice: a <hi>Sceptical</hi> loosness, latitude, and indifferency in Religion, as to matter of Opinion and Doctrine: an <hi>Anarchical</hi> loosness (what shall I call it?) remisness and slackness of the reins of rule and government, in point of Order and Discipline: Every one of which is of dangerous consequence, and has a very sad aspect and malignant influence upon a Kingdom and Nation, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ruin and dissolution both of Church and State, if not timely prevented; especially that I last mention'd, that general loosness and slackness of the reins of government in point of Discipline, that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal neglect and contempt of Autority; that Epidemical undutifulness, irreverence, and disrespect to Superiors, a rust and restiveness contracted in the late lawless irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and rebellious times, and yet not rub'd off, nor worn away; the dregs and reliques of that old leaven not yet purg'd, nor wrought out of the minds and spirits of men; the seeds of Rebellion and Treason still lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among us; for all undutifulness to Superiors is a kind of petite Treason; <hi>Lex est copulativa;</hi> there's a


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98012:16"/>
concatenation o' duties; and he that breaks one link o' the chain of Subordination and Subjection to lawful autority, endangers all: and this is certain, He that is undutiful and disobedient and disrespective to his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, will not stick upon occasion, to be disloyal to the Supreme; and then, beware of <hi>hoc peccatum,</hi> the Sin o' the day. Now as for personal Sins, I must leav that to every man's Conscience in particular, to call himself to account, and see how the case stands between God and his own Soul. Let us then do so, I beseech you, every one of us, seriously and thorowly search and examin our selves in private (for that's the work of this day, and not only to pray, and hear a Sermon in public), I say, let us search our own hearts, to find out what Sins we are most guilty of, our bosom and beloved Sins; for they are the Murderers and Malefactors that must be attach't, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign'd and condemn'd this day at the bar of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; they are the Regicides, that have had so deep a hand in the Sin of this day; they are the Traytors and Rebels, that betray'd and murder'd the King. Let then every one of us put these and the like interrogatories to our own Souls; Was it not by my high-mindedness and self-conceit, <hi>pride</hi> and ambition, that God was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd to let <hi>proud</hi> aspiring Tyrants and Traitors climb so high? Was it not my uncleanness, <hi>my lusts which war in my members,</hi> that contributed to the kindling of that unnatural <hi>war</hi> between the Head and <hi>the members?</hi> Did not the heat and <hi>fire</hi> o' my lusts (among others) incense and provoke God to let <hi>fire</hi> come out o' the bramble, and devour the Cedar of <hi>Lebanon?</hi> Was it not by my envy, <hi>hatred, and malice,</hi> and uncharitableness, and <hi>hardness of heart,</hi> that God was provok'd to <hi>harden the hearts</hi> of those cruel Regicides against their lawful King, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit 'um to be fill'd brim-full with <hi>hatred and malice</hi>


               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:98012:17"/>
against his Royal person? Was it not my rash swearing and prophaneness, my false-swearing and <hi>perfidiousness,</hi> my breach of <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Covenants,</hi> Promises and <hi>engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> made in my Baptism, that mov'd God to give up those false <hi>perfidious</hi> Traitors to a reprobate mind, so as to break all those Sacred bonds and obligations, and <hi>Oaths</hi> of Allegiance to their Leige Lord and Soveraign, and in stead of them to enter into those two bonds of iniquity, the <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Engagement?</hi> Lastly, was it not my intemperance, <hi>gluttony,</hi> and <hi>drunkeness,</hi> that provok'd God to suffer such a crew of savage and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Rebels to <hi>glut</hi> themselves with the flesh of Nobles, and to be <hi>drunk</hi> with Royal blood? Thus shu'd we with sorrow of heart reflect upon our selves, who were then in being, and at years, when this horrid Sin was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But then what shall we say to our <hi>Postnati</hi> or <hi>Puines,</hi> those of the younger sort? Indeed they cannot be said to be guilty o'the Sin o'this day, or any way accessory to it, seeing they were not then <hi>in rerum natura;</hi> not so much as enter'd upon the Stage o'the world, when this sad Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy was acted; they were not born, when the King was beheaded. Yet by way of prevention of future cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, let them take heed o'those Sins, which in those times were the meritorious causes of this fearful judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and provok't God to suffer it. In a word, let all of us, both old and young, fear to commit those Sins, which as they were then, so they may be still, the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious procuring causes of as heavy and dreadful a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Land and Nation. Let us, I pray, take heed of persisting in the perpetration of our old wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses and impieties, and of acting over those Sins <hi>a fresh,</hi> by which God was provok'd to permit cruel men, Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> this day to imbrew their hands in the blood of his Anointed, and thereby to deprive us of so good and


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98012:17"/>
gracious a King. This then is the proper work o'the day; every one of us to say with <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Butler, <hi>I do remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber my faults this day,</hi> and so to humble himself before the Lord, not only in public, but in secret; to lay his hand upon his heart, and put his mouth i'the dust, and take the shame and guilt of his Sins to himself, and say, <hi>God be merciful to me a sinner;</hi> and, <hi>deliver me from blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiltiness, O God:</hi> and, <hi>Lord lay not this sin to my charge.</hi> Thus we shu'd do, and O that we cu'd do it with that brokeness of heart, and contrition o' spirit, with that true godly sorrow, and remorse o' Conscience, that God may hear in Heaven, and have mercy, and forgive and pardon, that so no one drop of that Royal blood may ever be upon the head of any one of us in this Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and much less upon the whole Kingdom and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! <hi>O gracious God, when thou makest inquisition for blood, lay not the guilt of this innocent blood (the shedding whereof, nothing but the blood of thy Son can expiate) lay it not to the charge of the people of this land, nor let it ever be requir'd of us or our posterity. Be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, be merciful unto thy people whom thou hast re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, and be not angry with us for ever; but pardon us for thy mercie's sake, through the merits of thy Son, our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi>

            <epigraph>

               <q>Fear God. Honour the King.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>FEw words, but full, and pregnant, and big with variety of matter. Two short Sentences, but long and large in sense and signification. Two breif compendious Precepts, but of a huge diffusive, and comprehensive reach. Two short Lessons, but of so grand importance, and so vast a latitude, that it will take up a man's whole life to learn them: the first of them especially, <hi>Fear God;</hi> which the Royal Preacher in the close of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, makes the <hi>Totum hominis, the whole duty of man.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eccles. 12. 13.</note> And if so, we need learn no more, but put a stop at <hi>Fear God,</hi> and go no further. For if that be <hi>the whole duty of man,</hi> then <hi>Honour the King</hi> will fall under it, as included and comprehended in it: and so he that hath learn't to <hi>fear God,</hi> hath learn't also to <hi>honour the King.</hi> And though the latter of these Duties be not so comprehensive as the former, as to the direct and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate

import of it in regard of the object; yet take it in its full extent and latitude, and in all the due qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of it as to the act prescribed and enjoyn'd, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the grounds and reasons of it, and then it implys and presupposes the other: And so he that hath learn't to <hi>honour the King,</hi> hath learn't also to <hi>fear God.</hi> And this shall be my task at this time, to shew the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the mutual coherence and connexion of these two Precepts, the reciprocal clasping and concatenation of these two Duties together.</p>
            <p>Well then, <hi>Fear God</hi> is a large Theme, and would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford matter for many Sermons: and so would <hi>Honour the King</hi> too, if one should discourse of them severally and apart, as simply and absolutely in themselves consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd: but I shall not do so, but twist them both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and so handle them joyntly, as they have a mutual <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> and reference one to another, and a mutual depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance each upon other. <hi>Juncta juvant.</hi> And so I shall speak to these two Aphorisms or Propositions: 1. <hi>No man can truly honour the King, but he that fears God.</hi> 2. <hi>No man can truly fear God, but he that honours the King.</hi> So that here in this Text St. <hi>Peter</hi> reads two Lessons, or Lectures, one to the prophane ranting Royalist, the other to the fanatic hypocritical Rebel.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>No man can truly honour the King, but he that fears God.</hi> Loyalty and subjection to the Higher Powers, is a fruit and consequent of the <hi>fear of God:</hi> where there is not this root in the heart, there can be none of that fruit in the life. 'Tis nothing but Conscience and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the fear of God, that can aw the spirits of men into a sense of their duty, and keep 'um within the bounds of loyalty and allegiance. <hi>Let every soul be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Higher Powers,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 13. but how can he be subject indeed to the Higher Powers,


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98012:19"/>
in obeying their Laws, that is not first subject to the most High in keeping his Commandments? Can I think that man religiously observes the fifth Commandment, that makes no conscience of keeping the other nine, and so pays God but the tithe of the obedience due unto him? He that would truly <hi>honour the King,</hi> and give due obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him and his Laws, must do it <hi>for conscience</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 5.</note> 
               <hi>sake</hi> (saith the Apostle), but without the <hi>fear of God</hi> where is conscience? if it be any where, it's asleep to be sure, for <hi>the fear of God</hi> will rouz it up and awaken it. <hi>There is no power but of God</hi> (saith the same Apostle in <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1.</note> the same place) <hi>the powers that be, are ordain'd of God;</hi> and so the Supreme Power, Soveraignty, or Supremacy, is the Ordinance of God, and upon that account it chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges our dutiful submission and subjection to it. Now how can he that fears not God, truly submit to the Ordinance of God? and consequently, how can he truly <hi>honour the King?</hi> Again, the King is God's Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant (as I may say) upon earth: his Vicegerent and Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: how then can he truly <hi>honour the King,</hi> that disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours God, whose Person the King represents? The Judge in the Gospel <hi>neither fear'd God, nor regarded man,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luk. 18. 2.</note> (and he was not asham'd to say so himself): Indeed if he <hi>fear'd</hi> not <hi>God,</hi> no marvel he <hi>regarded</hi> not any <hi>man</hi> in the world, so as to give him any due honour, respect, or reverence, though never so much his Superiour. <hi>Abraham</hi> (to be sure) was in the right, when he made the want of the fear of God, the root of all evil, the Parent and Nurs of all Sin and Wickedness, Adultery, and Murther, and the like. <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 17, <hi>Surely the fear of God is not in this place, and they will slay me for my wives sake;</hi> either to kill him, or abuse his Wife, he thought they would make no bones of either, as long as the <hi>fear of God</hi> was not among them. And 'tis likely


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98012:20"/>
our Common Law borrows that phrase in her form of Inditement, <hi>viz.</hi> of a Malefactor's <hi>not having the fear of God before his eyes,</hi> either from that speech of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> or else from that of the Psalmist, <hi>The transgression</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 36. 1.</note> 
               <hi>of the wicked saith within my heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes.</hi> And from thence he knew it was, <hi>viz.</hi> from the want of this fear, that all his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness did proceed. For 'tis the <hi>fear of God,</hi> that keeps all in aw, and in order; and where that is wanting, nothing is safe, nor secure, neither Money in the Chest, nor Wife in the Chamber, nor Man in his House, nor King in his Throne. It is that great wheel in the clock that sets all the other o' going; it makes a man move order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and regularly in all his relations: if that fail, the rest of the wheels will move slowly, or stand still; a man will drive heavily, or not at all. First, <hi>Fear God,</hi> then <hi>Honour the King:</hi> without the former no hope of the latter. If a man <hi>fear</hi> not <hi>God,</hi> never look he should <hi>honour the King, honour</hi> his Natural, Civil, or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Parents, or keep the fifth Commandment, or any else. By this that hath been said already, and much more that might be said, it may plainly appear, that wicked and ungodly men, men void of the <hi>fear</hi> of God, whatsoever they pretend, can never truly <hi>honour the King,</hi> nor be faithful and loyal Subjects to their Prince and Soveraign. <hi>Honour</hi> him they may from the teeth outward, and after a fashion, or rather flatter him for their own by-ends, and sinister respects, for their secular interest and worldly advantage; but they can never love and <hi>honour</hi> him, serv and obey him, from their heart and soul: they can never give him the <hi>honour</hi> due unto him, out of love or respect to his Person, out of duty to God, or <hi>for Conscience sake.</hi> We use to say, and we say truly, A thorow-pac't <hi>Jesuited</hi> Papist can never be a good


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98012:20"/>
Subject: if he would be so, he must quit and forsake his Principles. So we may say, and say as truly, A lewd and vicious, and debauch't person cannot be a good Subject; if he would be so, he must quit and forsake his practices. <hi>Take the wicked from before the King,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prov. 25. 5.</note> saith <hi>Solomon</hi> (a King, and the wisest of Kings), <hi>and his throne shall be establish'd in righteousness;</hi> and if so, then on the contrary it follows, that while the wicked stand before the King, and yeild him feigned obedience (and they can yeild him no better) <hi>his throne</hi> will not <hi>be establish'd:</hi> such wicked, and unrighteous, and ungodly Subjects and Servants, will undermine his Throne, shake his Crown, and endanger his Person. And therefore our gracious Soveraign, when presently after his happy Return, he set out that his most religious and godly Declaration against Drunkeness, Debauchery, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaness, he did not only do an act of Christian Piety, but of State-Policy: nor did he only consult the honour and glory of God, but likewise his own honour, and interest, life, and safety. For what greater honour, and safety to a King, than the godly lives of his Subjects? on the contrary, what greater enemy to the being, and well-being of the Prince, than the wicked lives of his People? What are the loud thundring ratling Oaths, and horrid Curses and Imprecations of Subjects, but as so many Cannons, or Pieces of Ordnance, not only with <hi>their mouths set against heaven</hi> (as the Psalmist speaks), <note place="margin">Psal. 73. 9.</note> but even planted and levell'd against the face of the King? What are the fightings, and feuds, and quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and duels of Subjects, but as so many Swords drawn, with their points set against their Soveraign? What are those prodigious luxuries, and excesses, riotings and revellings, debaucheries, and drunken meetings of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but as so many Conventicles, Juncto's and Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies,


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98012:21"/>
though not directly and formally, yet collaterally and by consequence, against the Lord's Anointed? In a word, what are those torrents of <hi>Belial,</hi> that inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Atheism and Prophaness, that at any time breaks in upon a Kingdom or Nation, but a deluge that threatens to over whelm and drown both Prince and People? The King is the Head of the People; I am sure, the name of our King signifies so, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: Now it's no strange thing, neither in the Natural nor Political Body, for the Head to suffer, when the Members miscarry, or any time dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order or distemper themselvs. It is no news (for we our selvs have liv'd to see it) no news to see the best of Kings cut off for the Sins of the people. So was <hi>Josiah</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> and so was <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixt our English <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi> and so was King <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr, our late Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, of ever blessed and glorious Memory, cut off, not only <hi>by</hi> the Sins and wickedness of a few cursed mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creant Rebels and Traytors, but even <hi>for</hi> the Sins and wickedness of the rest of his people, yea and of those too perhaps that counted themselves to stick closest to him, and to be his best and most loyal Subjects.</p>
            <p>But I shall not any longer, <hi>hoc ulcus tangere,</hi> rub or grate upon this sore. I have no particular reflexion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any; only this I shall add in the general, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the best caus may miscarry in bad hands, becaus the goodness of the caus, makes men more confident, and so more secure and careless of their lives: they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume so much of <hi>justitia causae,</hi> that it makes them neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect <hi>justitia personae.</hi> Well, let none presume upon their fidelity to their Soveraign, nor flatter themselvs with professions and protestations of Loyalty to the King, while they go on with their Sins and Impieties to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke and offend the King of Kings. They that rant and roar, swear and swagger, and drink the King's health,


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98012:21"/>
but seldom or never pray for it, do such men think they <hi>honour the King,</hi> or are His Majesties good friends and faithful Subjects? whatsoever these prophane Atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal people may profess or pretend, yea and boast of their good affections to His Majesty; I dare boldly affirm, they are so far from being true <hi>honourers</hi> of him, that they are no better than false Traitors to him, and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to his Royal Person, Crown and Dignity. Do such men think they can <hi>honour</hi> the King by <hi>dishonouring</hi> God, or shew themselves <hi>good Subjects</hi> by being <hi>bad Christians?</hi> For my part, I am sorry such heathenish people make such a profession of Loyalty; yea, I could almost wish that they made no profession of Christianity neither: for by their loos and vicious lives, they are a reproach and a scandal both to the one and the other, and so bring an evil report upon the good Land, and make the enemies of God and the King to blaspheme, saying, Lo, these are the men, and this their conversation, and thus they are all. Though (by the way) as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion is not the wors, for some wicked mens professing of it, no more is Loyalty neither: rather on the contrary, it shows there is some extraordinary beauty and excellency in them both, becaus hypocrites and ungodly men use them for a cloak and a cover, sheltring and shrouding themselvs and their Sins under the colour and profession of them. To draw towards a conclusion of this point: The way to <hi>honour the King,</hi> is to <hi>honour God</hi> first: the way to fear and reverence and obey the King, is first to fear the Lord. Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> puts them both together, <hi>My Son, fear thou the Lord and the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prov. 24. 21.</note> 
               <hi>King.</hi> In a word, the way to be the King's good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and Servants, is to serv the Lord. I find several godly and religious Courtiers, and Kings Servants in Scripture, as <hi>Joseph,</hi> and <hi>Mordecai,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98012:22"/>
               <hi>Daniel,</hi> and others. But I take notice of two especially above the rest; some it may be do not take so much no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them; but I mention them the rather, becaus of their names, and they are <hi>Obadiah</hi> and <hi>Ebedmelech. Obadiah</hi> was Steward of King <hi>Ahab</hi>'s house: and of him we read, that <hi>he fear'd the Lord from his youth,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Kings 18. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Ebedmelech</hi> was a great Officer in the hous of King <hi>Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi> and of him it is said, that <hi>he put his trust in the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jer. 39. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Lord.</hi> But why do I mention these two? only to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, by way of allusion, to prove that none can be a good Subject and Servant to the King, that is not the Servant of God: and for this there may be an argument drawn from the Etymology of their names. <hi>Obadiah</hi> signifies <hi>the servant of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>Ebedmelech</hi> is as much as to say, <hi>the servant of the King.</hi> He that would be an <hi>Ebed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech,</hi> a Servant of the King, must be an <hi>Obadiah,</hi> a Servant of the Lord. Except you serv and fear, honour and obey God, you can never conscientiously, nor truly serv nor fear, honour nor obey the King. And so I have finish'd St. <hi>Peter's</hi> first Lesson or Lecture, which was a Lecture to the prophane ranting Royalist, in the first Aphorism or Proposition, <hi>No man can truly honour the King, but he that fears God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to his second Lecture or Lesson, which is to the fanatic hypocritical Rebel in the second Aphorism, which is this:</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>No man can truly fear God, but he that honours the King.</hi> Hitherto we have <hi>render'd to God the things that are Gods, and fear to whom fear is due.</hi> Now let us <hi>render to Caesar, the things that are Caesar's, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to whom honour;</hi> for this <hi>due</hi> is proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 7.</note> especially, <hi>Personae Principis,</hi> says one upon the place (and he no great Royalist neither) though indeed <note place="margin">Pareus in locum:</note> in <hi>rendering</hi> to <hi>Caesar</hi> his <hi>due,</hi> we shall <hi>render</hi> to God


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98012:22"/>
his <hi>due</hi> still; and in <hi>honouring the King,</hi> we shall <hi>honour</hi> God too. For do we not <hi>honour</hi> God, when we keep his Commandments? and is not the fifth Commandment concerning <hi>honouring our Parents,</hi> part of the Decalogue? And is not the King <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> the Father of his Country, and our Political Parent? And is it not God that speaks to us here by the mouth of his Apostle St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and bids us <hi>honour the King?</hi> And 'tis well we have it here in such express terms, that our Antimonar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical rebellious <hi>Corahs,</hi> may have no subterfuge, nor evasion. And here the Chapter of Loyalty, the <hi>13th</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> comes in agen: from whence I shall fetch but this one argument. A godly man is afraid to <hi>resist the ordinance of God;</hi> The higher Powers, and so the Regal, is the ordinance of God: and consequently, he that truly <hi>fears God,</hi> will <hi>honour the King;</hi> and if he <hi>honour</hi> him, he will not resist, but obey him. To obey Magistrates, to <hi>honour the King,</hi> and to be in subjection to our Parents, and to the Higher Powers, is not only an <hi>imperat,</hi> but an <hi>elicit,</hi> act of Religion. Not that we think religious worship is due to Magistrates, (for we do not Idolize nor adore our Princes, as the <hi>Persians</hi> did of old, and as some do the Pope at this day,) but becaus the Higher Powers are certain Models and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems, Images and Representatives of the most High; and so the honour we give unto them, does more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately reflect upon God, and more directly redound to his honour and glory. And therefore some Divines have made the fifth Commandment a branch of the first Table, which concerns our duty to God; at least an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix to it, <hi>viz.</hi> becaus our Parents, whether Natural, Civil, or Ecclesiastical, are <hi>loco Dei,</hi> in the place and stead of God, and represent his Person. However, if it be not part of the first Table, it is the next to it;


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98012:23"/>
wherefore it is observed by Divines, that in Humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, as well as in the Holy Scriptures (as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 4.) honouring and obeying and requiting our Parents, is call'd Religion and Piety: Let them consider this that are undutiful, disobedient, and disrespectful to Parents: there can be no true piety, no godliness nor religion in 'um, that's certain; and the same is to be said of those that are undutiful and disobedient to Princes. And if Scripture be the rule of our Religion, as sure it is, then it must needs follow, that, as long as the Scripture commands us to <hi>be subject to Principalities and Powers, and to obey Magistrates,</hi> Tit. 3. 1. and to <hi>submit our selves to every Ordinance of man</hi> (or <hi>to every humane creature,</hi>

there be such an inseparable union and connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these two, then is it not strange, that any should neglect the one that pretends to the other? that a man should think he <hi>fears God,</hi> when he does not <hi>honour the King?</hi> yea, and that for fear of offending and displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing God, he should venture to displeas and dishonour the Supreme Magistrate by disobeying his lawful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, who is the Ordinance of God; yea, who is in the place of God, and represents his person? Is it not strange, that when the Apostle bids us <hi>be subject to the Higher Powers,</hi> and obey lawful Autority <hi>for conscience sake,</hi> any should pretend <hi>conscience</hi> for their disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? I do not love to give hard words instead of strong reasons, nor to pin odious unnecessary consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon any mens Practices or Opinions: for I desire to deal with others, as I would be dealt with my self, that is, fairly and candidly, in a way of love, and <hi>in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of meekness.</hi> But is it not so indeed as I have said?

And is not this said to proceed from tenderness of <hi>conscience,</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> of doing somthing against the will of God reveal'd in his Word? Thus men must be disobedient to lawful Autority, and so <hi>resist the Ordinance of God,</hi> even <hi>for conscience sake.</hi> And though sure they do not much <hi>honour the King,</hi> who disobey him by transgressing his Laws; yet such men think they <hi>fear God</hi> as much, yea more than any; and that they are the most, if not the only, religious and conscientious men, and all others but formalists, and time-servers, and meer moral men in comparison; <gap reason="foreign">

But now becaus there is such a nois of conscience, I would earnestly entreat and beseech such men for the love of our Lord Jesus Christ, diligently to search and examin their own hearts (for <hi>the heart is deceitful</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jer. 17. 9.</note> 
               <hi>above all things),</hi> and see whether instead of that they call conscience, and make it a plea for their disobedience, there may not be something else lying at the bottom, that looks like conscience, when indeed 'tis nothing less, but rather humour, or passion, or fancy, or faction, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, or interest, or singularity, or hypocrisie, or spiritual pride. <hi>If our heart condemn us</hi> (saith <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 20.</note> St. <hi>John), God is greater then our heart, and knows all things.</hi> I am very well aware of what follows in the next vers, from whence some would infer, that they may boldly and lawfully do whatever their conscience bids them; <hi>If our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God.</hi> But sure that must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 21.</note> of a heart and conscience truly enlightned, and rightly inform'd; otherwise we have no caus to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident; for our heart may deceiv us; and conscience, if misguided, is a dangerous thing, and will soon marr all, and make foul work, and set the whole world on a flame. Did not <hi>Paul</hi> persecute the Church out of Zeal to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? and did not they that kill'd the Disciples and Saints of Christ, <hi>think they did God good service?</hi> Thus conscience if misled, and not well guided, taught, and <note place="margin">Joh. 16. 2.</note> instructed, may do a world of mischief where it is: But then again, is it not easie to pretend it, where it is not? for have not we known the most horrid and devilish de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, carry'd on under a shew and pretence of conscience, and the Caus of God, and Religion? The truth is, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is made a sadle for every hors, a bush or sign to hang at every door: And as long as the heart is so deceitful, as long as there is so much hypocrisie in the


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98012:24"/>
world, we have little reason to trust every such show and pretence of conscience, either in our selvs, or others: Especially when we have a more clear light to guide and direct us, and a more sure rule to walk by, <hi>viz.</hi> the Word of God. Conscience is a dark, close, secret, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate thing, it has many crooked windings and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: but the Word of God (at least in things necessary to Salvation, such as is obedience to lawful Autority) is plain and easie, clear and evident, and there are no such Maeanders or ambages in it. Conscience may err, and lead us into errour, like an <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> 'tis fallible and uncertain, it may deceiv, and be deceiv'd; but the Word of God is an unerring guide, a certain and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rule. Conscience then is no sure rule to trust to; we have a more sure rule, even the sure Word of God, whereunto <hi>we shall do well to take heed, as to a light</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 19.</note> 
               <hi>that shines in a dark place,</hi> as our Apostle St. <hi>Peter</hi> speaks. In brief, the Word of God is the rule of our lives, and of our consciences both; and truly consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will play mad pranks, if not regulated and guided by this rule; and for men to pretend conscience against the express Word and Commandment of God, what is it else but to turn Antiscripturists, and so Atheists, under pretence of Religion? Does not <hi>Solomon</hi> counsel us to <note place="margin">Eccles. 8. 2.</note> 
               <hi>keep the Kings commandment, and that in regard of the oath of God?</hi> where we see, he expresly makes Religion towards God, the ground and foundation of our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the King; so that he that keeps the King's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, keeps the commandment of God. And is not this the clear and express commandment of God here in the Text, <hi>Honour the King?</hi> And shall any then plead conscience for not <hi>Honouring</hi> him? Can any man in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science truly <hi>fear God,</hi> and not <hi>honour the King?</hi> for can a man <hi>fear</hi> God, and not keep his commandments? And


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98012:25"/>
is not the fifth commandment one of the ten? or, can any one <hi>honour</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> and yet slight his Autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or refuse to obey his Laws? And are not the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Laws (by the way) the King's Laws? And have not they the impress of Regal Sanction, and the stamp of Royal autority set upon them, as well as the Civil? What plea then or excuse can men have for not keeping and observing of them, especially when they pretend to be so good Christians, to <hi>fear</hi> God, and keep his commandments? If mens consciences be misled and mistaken (which is the best can be imagin'd), yet God and the King must not loos their right. An erroneous conscience cannot cancel the bond of obedience, nor excuse any from doing his duty: Indeed it may so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snare and entangle him, that, <hi>durante illâ conscientiâ,</hi> he cannot proceed one way or other without Sin: but still <hi>datur exitus,</hi> for <hi>Nemo angustiatur ad peccandum</hi> (saith the School), still there's a way left to get out, and to extricate himself, and that is <hi>deponere errorem conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi> to rectifie his conscience, to quit and forsake his errour, which he may do, by giving all moral diligence, and using all good means for his better information: And if he would do that, let him <hi>not lean</hi> too much <hi>to his own understanding,</hi> but rather distrust his own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">Prov. 3. 5.</note> than the judgments of so many wise, grave learn'd, and godly men, his Superiors in Church and State; the King, and those that are in autority under him. And then let him in the fear of God, duly and impartially weigh and examin the grounds and reasons of his dissent and disobedience; not thinking it sufficient, that he has met with some little umbrages, and shadows of offence in <hi>general,</hi> taken at the King's Ecclesiastical Laws, the Orders and Ceremonies, and Liturgy of the Church; but let him come to <hi>particulars,</hi> and then seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98012:25"/>
and ask his own heart, whether indeed he be able to prove by Scripture or reason, any one thing enjoyn'd, to be unlawful, and repugnant to the Word of God; (for till that be done, 'tis in vain for any to plead or pretend tenderness of conscience for their contempt and disobedience). And then let him ask himself but one question more, <hi>viz.</hi> how far he thinks some few needless niceties, doubts, and scruples, about things indifferent, will bear him out and excuse him another day, for his neglect of so necessary and fundamental a duty, as <hi>honouring the King,</hi> and yeilding obedience to his Laws. That submission to lawful Autority, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience either <hi>active,</hi> or <hi>passive,</hi> is a most necessary duty, no Christian can or will deny. I say, Obedience either <hi>active or passive, active</hi> in things lawful, <hi>passive</hi> in others. Now if men bring themselves into danger, or lie under any hardship, for disobeying the King, and not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his lawful commands, what joy of heart their <hi>pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive</hi> obedience can be to them, or what great content, or comfort, they can find in their sufferings, I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv, but shall leavs it to all prudent and unprejudiced and impartial men to judge.</p>
            <p>And here I shall only add this as to the matter of Non-conforming to the Kings Ecclesiastical Laws; and so draw to a conclusion. Let men diligently take heed and beware, lest in stead of conscientious Non-conformists (for some such I believ there are, though it's pity there should be, men of of such weak and tender consciences, that for want of due instruction and right information, they are really and truly dissatisfy'd), I say, let men take heed lest in stead of being such, they prove (as too many I fear there are) pervers and stubborn and obstinate Schismatics, or (which is all one) fanatic hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical Rebels. And if so, then as I said before to


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98012:26"/>
the prophane ranting Royalists, That by their vicious and ungodly lives, they bring a scandal and reproach upon Loyalty: So I must say to these men, That by their spurning at lawful Autority, and their undutifulness to the Higher Powers, they bring a scandal and reproach upon Christianity; while they make Religion a cloak for Rebellion, and pretend conscience for their disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. I have been the longer upon this, because in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed 'tis <hi>Morbus Epidemicus,</hi> the diseas of the times: and I would fain, if possible, help to beat men out of this hold, <hi>viz.</hi> of making the <hi>fear of God</hi> a plea for not <hi>honouring the King:</hi> a pretence so directly contrary to the Doctrine of St. <hi>Peter</hi> here in the Text; where he joyns these two duties together in a bond of insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable union; I say, these two Duties, which I have hitherto prov'd to be like <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s twins, that live and dy together; <hi>Fear God; Honour the King;</hi> so that no man can do the one, and omit the other: and as he that is a prophane, wicked, and ungodly man, cannot be a true, faithful, and loyal subject: so on the other side, he that is a fals, disloyal, undutiful subject (pretend what he will) cannot be a holy, good, and godly Christian. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is the thing I have been proving all this while, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>No man can truly fear God, but he that honours the King.</hi> Now there are several ways of <hi>honouring,</hi> or giving <hi>honour</hi> to any, several sorts of <hi>honour;</hi> I mean of <hi>honour</hi> strictly taken, as here in the Text: for otherwise <hi>honour</hi> is taken in a more large ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, as oppos'd to contempt, scorn, or hatred; and so in the beginning of the vers, <hi>Honour all men,</hi> that is, have a due respect to all; do not hate, nor scorn, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise, nor contemn any. But <hi>honour</hi> strictly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly taken is only due to Superiors; and so in this sens there are several sorts of <hi>honour,</hi> these three


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98012:26"/>
especially: The <hi>honour</hi> of <hi>Obedience,</hi> the <hi>honour</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,</hi> and the <hi>honour</hi> of <hi>Maintenance;</hi> and all these comprehended, and included in the word <hi>honour,</hi> both in the fifth commandment, where we are bid to <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour our Parents;</hi> and also here in the Text (which is a branch of that commandment) where we are bid to <hi>honour the King.</hi> Of the first of these I have been speaking all this while, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>honour</hi> of <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;</hi> and for the two latter, the <hi>honour</hi> of <hi>Reverence,</hi> and the <hi>honour</hi> of <hi>Maintenance,</hi> as I have now no time, so no need (I hope) to say much of them. For that both these sorts of <hi>honour</hi> are due to the King or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Magistrate, as well as that of <hi>Obedience,</hi> is out of all question; it being so consonant to the principles both of Religion and Reason, and so agreeable to the rules both of Divinity and Policy: So that most men yeild their assent to the truth of it, as to the Theory, though in the Practice sometimes they fail and fall short. So then, besides that of <hi>Obedience,</hi> there are these two other sorts of <hi>honour</hi> more, both confessedly due to Kings and Princes, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>honour</hi> of <hi>Reverence,</hi> and the <hi>honour</hi> of <hi>Maintenance;</hi> the one for the safeguard and defenc of their Royal Persons; the other for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of their Regal Estate, Crown, and Dignity. For first, if their Persons be once slighted, undervalu'd, and disesteem'd, their lives will soon be in danger: and then again, if their <hi>jura Regalia,</hi> their Regalities, or Revenues of the Crown, be clipt and cut short, the Reverence of their Persons will not long continue. Therefore we find <hi>Honour</hi> in Scripture, sometimes put for supply or maintenance, or payment of rights and dues, as of Tithe or Tribute, and Offerings, and the like. <hi>Honour the Lord with thy substance,</hi> and so the King too: <hi>Honour widows,</hi> that is maintain them, by <note place="margin">Prov. 3. 9. 1 Tim. 5. 3.</note>

               <bibl>Psalm 124. v. 7.</bibl>
               <q>Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers, the snare is broken, and we are delivered.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS Psalm, as ye may perceiv by the tenour of it all along, is a Gratulatory or Eucharistical Hymn, or Psalm of Prais and thanksgiving to God for delivering <hi>Israel,</hi> both King and People (for it was in King <hi>David</hi>'s time, the Author of the Psalm), the Church and people of God out of the hands of their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciless and cruel enemies, the <hi>Philistins,</hi> most like, or the <hi>Ammonites.</hi> However some extraordinary preservation, some remarkable signal deliverance belike it was; and 'twas the <hi>Dominus nobiscum</hi> that did the deed, for <hi>If the Lord himself had not been on our side, when men rose up against us, they had swallowed us up quick,</hi> &amp;c. but Blessed be the Lord, <hi>who hath not given us over as a prey to their teeth.</hi>


               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:98012:30"/>
               <hi>Our soul is esaped,</hi> &amp;c. In the words we may observ these three Particulars:
<list>
                  <item>1. The Danger that the Church was in, or the Plot lay'd for her, <hi>i. e. The snare of the fowlers.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. The Prevention of the Danger, or the Defeating and Disappointing of the Plot, <hi>The snare is broken.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. The Churche's Deliverance and safety ensuing thereupon, <hi>Our soul is escaped as a bird, and we are delivered.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Then, The Church was in Danger; and that's no news, the Church is in a conflicting condition, militant here on earth, a lily among thornes, in the midst of her enemies; among the pikes, and many a push made at her, many a snare laid for her. And thus <hi>Israel,</hi> the Church and people of God in King <hi>David</hi>'s time, was in great danger it seems, and that by reason of a <hi>snare;</hi> and that <hi>snare</hi> the <hi>snare</hi> of the <hi>fowlers,</hi> whether <hi>Philistins,</hi> or <hi>Ammonites,</hi> or others. And was not our <hi>Israel,</hi> the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the Church and people of God with us, in as great danger too, as upon this day 64 years ago? and that by reason of a <hi>snare</hi> too, <hi>the snare of the fowlers,</hi> those Popish Philistins; such a <hi>snare</hi> as the like was never laid by any <hi>fowlers</hi> that ever were, such a Plot as the like was never contriv'd by all the wit and malice of Devils and Men; the Gun-powder Treason: which having once nam'd, I have nam'd the very quintessence and elixir of all villany and barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, mischief, and cruelty; a Plot that none but the Devil or a Jesuit, or a Jesuited Papist could ever invent; and a <hi>snare</hi> it was to purpose. Wicked and ungodly men, especially Tyrants and Persecutors, the enemies of God, and his Church, are often in Scripture compared to Hunters and Fowlers; and their mischeivous machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, malicious plots, and contrivances, to traps, ginns,


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98012:30"/>
and snares; as in the book of Psalms, and elswhere. And very fitly so compar'd, and that in these three respects especially:
<list>
                  <item>1. Because they are <hi>Mala dolosa &amp; occulta,</hi> cunning and close mischiefs.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Repentina &amp; improvisa,</hi> sudden and unexpected.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Perniciosa &amp; mortifera,</hi> dangerous and deadly. And was not this days treason a <hi>snare</hi> in all these respects?</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. In regard of the closeness and cunningness of it. A ginn or a <hi>snare</hi> is laid very closely and cunningly, that the bird shall not see nor perceiv it; for <hi>in vain the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prov. 1. 17.</note> 
               <hi>net is spread in the sight of any bird,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon.</hi> And such was the mischievous design of this day; the <hi>snare</hi> was laid very closely, and cunningly, hid in a dark vault, in a deep mine; These Popish Pioneers and Powder. Traytors dig'd so deep to hide and conceal, and cover their Plot and Powder, as if they would have dig'd as deep as Hell; <hi>Flectere si nequeo superos,</hi> as if when God and men fail'd them, they would have mov'd and call'd in the Devils to help them; indeed such a black and horrid treason could not be hatcht and hammer'd but in the Devil's forge, in the deepest and darkest cell, and caverns of hell; A dark vault or coal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hous they hir'd to this purpose under the Parliament hous, where in they hid their Wood and Powder: and truly such a dark vault was a fit place for such a work of darkness; and a coal-hous a fit shop for such <hi>Romish</hi> Incendiaries with their <hi>fides Carbonaria,</hi> their Collier's faith: Now besides this close and secret conveyance, the better to cover and conceal their cursed conspiracy, they bound themselvs by an Oath of Secrecy; yea, under the Seal of the holy Sacrament, not to discover nor reveal it to any without common consent. Thus


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98012:31"/>
closely and cunningly was the mischief contriv'd, and the <hi>snare</hi> laid; for a company of cunning <hi>Fowlers</hi> they were. The cunning <hi>Fowler</hi> when he cannot get his quarrie, nor kill the birds with his gun and shooting, then he spreads his net, then he falls to his <hi>snare,</hi> then he lays his ginns and <hi>snares</hi> privily for them. These Romish <hi>Fowlers</hi> or Hunters (if you will) yea, and Fishers too (for sure the Fisherman of Rome <hi>sub Annulo Piscatoris,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s pretended successor, had a main hand in the business) I say, these Popish <hi>Fowlers</hi> had often shot at us before; and fought against us as in 88, and at other times, <hi>Many a time had they fought against us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Psal.</hi> 129. <hi>but they did not prevail against us.</hi> Yea <hi>Catesby</hi> and <hi>Faux</hi> with some other of their complices, had been very lately tampering with the <hi>Spanish</hi> Guns, dealing with the King of <hi>Spain</hi> about an Invasion: but when that fail'd, and those Guns wu'd not go off, nor take fire, then they fall to the <hi>snare;</hi> (yet there was gun-powder good store in the <hi>snare</hi> too), when they could not prevail against us by open force and violence, then they make use of their craft and subtilty, then they seek to entrap and entangle us with their ginns and <hi>snares,</hi> their close secret Plots and Conspiracies; for they had learn't <hi>Lysander</hi>'s <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, when the lion's skin would not reach, they peic't and eek't it out with the foxe's; when neither the wild beasts of the field, nor the roaring Bulls of <hi>Rome,</hi> of themselves could do us any harm, then those crafty subtil foxes the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits seek to circumvent and supplant us, to undermine and blow us up: for 'twas the <hi>Jesuites powder</hi> that was able to cure an ague, and all other diseases; 'twas Father <hi>Garnet</hi> and <hi>Greenwell,</hi> and others of that cunning crew, the spawn of <hi>Ignatius</hi> (with <hi>ignis,</hi> fire, in his


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98012:31"/>
name), 'twas they that animated and encouraged <hi>Catesby</hi> and <hi>Peircy</hi> and the rest of the Conspirators, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine both Church and State, to work in the mine, and blow up King and Parliament, Lords and Commons, and all at a blast, all of a sudden; which leads me to the second Consideration, the second Circumstance, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect whereof this horrible Plot and Conspiracy is fitly term'd a <hi>snare,</hi> and that is,</p>
            <p n="2">2. In regard of the suddenness and unexpectedness of it: The bird is taken in the <hi>snare</hi> of a sudden, <hi>ex im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proviso,</hi> and surpriz'd at unawares, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9. 12, <hi>As the birds that are caught in the snare, so are the sons of men snar'd in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them;</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 35, <hi>As a snare shall it come,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>viz.</hi> the last day, that is to say, suddenly, unexpectedly, and unawares. Such was the mischief of this day, <hi>Malum repentinum &amp; impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visum,</hi> sudden and unexpected, in a time of general peace and tranquillity, in the days of Great <hi>Brittain</hi>'s <hi>Solomon,</hi> wise and peaceable King <hi>James</hi> of happy Memory; no forrain foes from abroad, no domestic enemies suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted at home (he having oblig'd his Roman Catholic Subjects, as he thought, by many signal favours); when all things were thus calm and serene, no clouds gathering at all in appearance, then this storm was to break out of a sudden, and fall upon King and Kingdom; and like a Hurricane, sweep all away in a moment; Sudden it was in regard of the time and season, when 'twas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd, <hi>viz.</hi> when all was quiet, and no such desperate or fatal blow was in the least fear'd, or suspected (as the bird is surpriz'd, and caught in a <hi>snare</hi> when she little suspects it): thus it was <hi>Malum improvisum.</hi> And sudden it was too, in regard of the quick dispatch and havock it would have made, had it succeeded and taken (as the bird is caught in the <hi>snare</hi> of a sudden, in a trice, in a


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98012:32"/>
moment). And thus it was <hi>Malum repentinum:</hi> and both these, both the unexpectedness of the danger, and the sudden dispatch, mystically and covertly imply'd in the Letter to the L. <hi>Mountegle,</hi> by which the business was discover'd; the former in these words, <hi>Though there be no appearance of any stir, yet they shall receiv a terrible blow, this Parliament, yet they shall not see who hurt them:</hi> The latter in these, <hi>The Danger is past so soon as you have burnt the Letter.</hi> That is as that sagacious <hi>Oedipus,</hi> wise and learned King <hi>James</hi> rightly expounded the Riddle) The blow shall be suddenly given by a blast of Powder, which is as soon over as the blaze of a Letter burnt in the fire. And so you see, this mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Plot laid this day for this Church, the Church and People of God here in <hi>England,</hi> may very well be compar'd to a <hi>snare</hi> in regard of the <hi>suddenness</hi> and <hi>unexpectedness</hi> of it, both in respect of its sudden coming, and likewise of the sudden dispatch it shu'd have made when it came.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And lastly, As it was sudden, and unexpected, so 'twas dangerous and deadly. The <hi>snare</hi> of the <hi>Fowler</hi> is a fatal engine, an instrument of death; the bird that's caught in a <hi>snare,</hi> seldom escapes with her life; such was the mischief design'd and intended this day, a fatal and deadly blow it had been indeed, if it had taken; <hi>The snares of death encompass dus</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> speaks), and so <note place="margin">Psal. 18. 5.</note> our Church expresses her self in her Collect, <hi>O Lord who didst this day discover the snares of death that were laid for us.</hi> Indeed a deadly <hi>snare</hi> it had been, if it had not been broken; King and Parliament, Prince and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Peers and Prelates, Lords and Commons, all blown up at a blast: a whole Kingdom, Church and State, swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd up and destroy'd by a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. A dangerous, dreadful and deadly design it was, to cut off, or rather


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98012:32"/>
blow up, the King and the whole Representative Body of the Kingdom, head and tail, branch and rush, in one day, nay, in a moment, at one blast; and yet thus they had done if the <hi>snare</hi> had held; this they intended, and had it <hi>in voto,</hi> nay <hi>in parato: Caligula</hi>'s wish, O! that the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> nay, O! that the people of <hi>England,</hi> becaus they were not the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> O! that the Church of <hi>England</hi> had but <hi>unam cervicem,</hi> one neck, that they might cut it off; and why, think ye? even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus it had not that <hi>unum caput,</hi> that one Head which they would have set on. <hi>Cursed be their anger, for it</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 49. v. 7. v. 5. v. 6.</note> 
               <hi>was fierce, and their wrath, for it was cruel: Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of cruelty were in their habitation, and in their self-will they digged through a wall.</hi> They heaped up wood and faggots to burn up us Heretics: Indeed these <hi>Romish</hi> Beautefeu's and Incendiaries had been at their fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works before; they had been trading and tampering long with fire and faggot by retail, in the <hi>Marian</hi> times; and now they thought to do it by wholesale, by making a Bonfire of the Parliament-house, burning and blowing up the whole Body of the Realm, Head and Members, the King with all the three Estates of the Kingdom as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled and met together. But <hi>blessed be the Lord who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth. Our soul is escaped,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The snare is broken,</hi> the danger prevented, the design blasted, the Plot defeated: that is the second particular we observ'd in the words, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Prevention of the Danger,</hi> or Disappointment of the design.</p>
            <p>The mischievous machinations and devices of wicked and ungodly men against the Church and people of God, though never so closely and cunningly contriv'd and carry'd, are often frustrate and broken, defeated and disappointed. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Such wicked works do not always succeed and prosper, they often prove abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98012:33"/>
and come not to the birth; The reason is, there is a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an all-piercing eye that sees and discovers them, a <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, a God above that blasts and disappoints them and brings them to nought. And so it was this day, the <hi>snare</hi> was <hi>broken;</hi> and how was it <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken?</hi> just as it is here in the Psalm, by a <hi>Dominus nobis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> in the first verse, <hi>The Lord was on our side;</hi> and by an <hi>Adjutorium nostrum in nomine Domini,</hi> in the last; <hi>Our help was in the name of the Lord.</hi> How was this Treason discovered, and the danger prevented? just as God says to <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> Zech, 4. 6, <hi>Not by might, nor by power</hi> (I may add, not by wisdom, nor by policy) <hi>but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts. The snare is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and we are escaped as a bird, tanquam Avicula:</hi> 'tis not by her own strength or cunning that the poor <hi>bird</hi> makes her <hi>escape:</hi> Alas she is weak and simple, only there comes some strong hand and breaks the <hi>snare, Nodos &amp;</hi>

               <note place="margin">Psal. 118. 23.</note> 
               <hi>in our eyes,</hi> 'twas <hi>by the spirit of the Lord,</hi> and 'twas the Lord's doing that the Treason was discovered, and the <hi>snare broken:</hi> Yet our <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> our pious and prudent Prince King <hi>James</hi> under God had a hand in it too, in the breaking and disappointing of it, for sure he was guided by the Spirit of the Lord, and more than ordinarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired and directed in opening the secret, and unfolding the mystery and Riddle of the Letter; and according to that of the wisest of Kings, <hi>There was a Divine Sentence</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prov. 16. 10.</note> 
               <hi>in the lips of the King</hi> (Great Brittain's <hi>Solomon)</hi> so that <hi>his mouth transgressed not in judgment,</hi> when up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his reading of that dark aenigmatical writing, he past his <hi>sentence,</hi> whereby the whole business was happily discovered and brought to light, and so the <hi>snare</hi> was


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98012:33"/>
               <hi>broken,</hi> and <hi>we were delivered;</hi> that's the third and last Particular, the <hi>Churches safety and deliverance</hi> following upon the <hi>snare</hi> being <hi>broken; we are delivered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this indeed is a necessary consequent of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, for when the <hi>snare</hi> is once <hi>broken,</hi> the <hi>bird</hi> will soon fly away and <hi>escape. We are delivered,</hi> so we were this day indeed, <hi>delivered</hi> from death and destruction, <hi>delivered</hi> from fire and faggot, <hi>delivered</hi> from the <hi>mouth</hi> of the <hi>lyon,</hi> and from the <hi>paw</hi> of the <hi>bear,</hi> and from the <hi>horns</hi> of the <hi>bull,</hi> the Pope's <hi>Bull,</hi> I mean, and from the <hi>tayl</hi> of the <hi>Dragon; delivered</hi> from the savage cruelty of <hi>Catesby</hi> and <hi>Faux, Et ab ipsis faucibus Orci;</hi> from the very jaws of Hell: <hi>delivered</hi> from passing through the fire to the <hi>Moloch</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> from being made a holocaust, a whole burnt-offering to that Idol, by those Priests of <hi>Baal,</hi> Father <hi>Garnet,</hi> and the rest of those Gun-powder-Saints and Martyrs. Thus we were and are <hi>delivered;</hi> I, and which is more, <hi>our soul is escaped:</hi> I know, by <hi>soul</hi> here (according to the usual Idiom of the Hebrew tongue), is meant nothing els but life or person, as much as to say, our persons are <hi>escaped,</hi> or we are <hi>escaped</hi> with our lives; her life, that's all the <hi>bird</hi> looks after. Yet I hope I may without forcing the Text, take occasion from hence, by way of accommodation, to put some greater stress or emphasis upon the word <hi>soul,</hi> and to observe from hence, that the <hi>Deliverance</hi> wrought tnis <hi>day</hi> was a <hi>Soul-Deliverance,</hi> not only a <hi>Corporal</hi> but a <hi>Spiritual Deliverance;</hi> not only a <hi>Deliverance</hi> of the body, but of the <hi>soul</hi> too, we escaped not only with our lives, but with our Religion; <hi>Our soul is escaped, escap'd</hi> out of the <hi>snares</hi> of Popish Idolatry and Superstition, laid in our way by those Romish <hi>Fowlers; snares,</hi> I say, laid in our way; for what is their <gap reason="foreign">

And that herein I do her no wrong, I shall make it appear; For though our Romanists may wipe their mouths, and disclaim the business, by laying the blame upon a few rash hot-headed discontented Catholic Gentlemen; yet if we examine it well (and it has been examin'd pretty well already) we shall find it to have been the genuine issue and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of their Popish Principles, the natural result and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of some doctrines and opinions commonly and openly held and maintained in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> I shall instance in one especially, which is <hi>instar omnium,</hi> and the <gap reason="foreign">

Monarchy, his Lordship Paramount, his absolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty and Dominion, his unlimited Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, over Kings and Kingdoms, his power to depose Kings and to dispose of their Kingdoms. That the Pope hath power to depose Kings (if they be Tyrants or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics (and so they must be, if he once say the word, and pleas to call them so) is <hi>Communis Doctorum,</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon received opinion of their chief Doctors and Casuists; especially the Jesuits and their Adherents, who bear the great sway in the Church and Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> This I could shew at large by producing the concurrent testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of <hi>Becanus</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine, Suarez</hi> and <hi>Lessius, Mariana</hi> and <hi>Santarell, Bonarscius</hi> or <hi>Scribanius</hi> (which ye will), and <hi>Emanuel Sa,</hi> and divers others.

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98012:36"/>
Doctrines are but the private Tenets and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of some particular Doctors, and were never own'd and receiv'd as the public Doctrines of the Romish Church, nor ever decreed nor confirm'd by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in a Council.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the newest shift and refuge they have found out for themselvs. But let me ask 'um, 1. Is not the voice of their Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8th, claiming a right to the Temporal Sword by vertue of <hi>Ecce duo gladii,</hi> and <hi>Repone gladium in Vaginam,</hi> and the like; and when he told King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>France, Scire te volumus, We wu'd have you to know, that you are Subject to us both in Spirituals and Temporals:</hi> I say, is not this <hi>Vox Ecclesiae,</hi> the public voice of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Let me ask 'um, 2. Has not that of their Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7th, <hi>aliàs Hildebrand, Nos, nos Imperia, Regna, Principatus, &amp; quicquid habere mortales possunt, auferre &amp; dare posse,</hi> as <hi>Platina</hi> has it in his life; <hi>'Tis in our power to give and take away Empires and Kingdoms at our pleasure;</hi> I say, has not this fine <hi>Hildebrandine</hi> Doctrine been the public acknowledged Doctrine of their Popes, and of their Church, at least of the Court, of <hi>Rome,</hi> ever since? 3. Was the 4th <hi>Lateran</hi> Council under <hi>Innocent</hi> the 3d, a General Council, or no? If not, as sure it was not, (nothing being fully and openly determin'd in it, saith <hi>Platina, Nec decerni quicquam apertè potuit)</hi> how then comes their Transubstantiation to be made an Article of Faith by vertue of a Decree of that Council? If it was a lawful Oecumenical Council, as they will needs have it, then that the Pope has power to absolv Subjects from their Oath of Allegiance and fealty to their Princes, is a receiv'd authentic Doctrine of their Church; for that, they confess, was decreed in a Canon of that <hi>Lateran</hi> Council under Pope <hi>Innocent.</hi> 4. Suppose these King-killing


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98012:37"/>
Doctrines are not publicly own'd and declar'd to be the Doctrines of their Church, nor decreed in their Councils, either of <hi>Lateran, Florence,</hi> or <hi>Trent,</hi> are they a whit the less dangerous and pernicious for that, seeing they are the current Opinions of their most learned Casuists, Doctors, and Confessors, commonly receiv'd and embrac'd, I and openly publish'd and printed, by their greatest Clarks among 'um, and that without any check or controul, yea with great Approbation, Licence, and liking? But now, 5 and lastly, If in good earnest the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> disallows and renounces these dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Doctrines and Opinions so destructive to Kings and Kingdoms, then, I pray, let his Holiness seat himself in his Chair, and condemn these Doctrines, as he did, (or wu'd have seem'd to do) those of the <hi>Jansenists</hi> late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; let him limit his <hi>Ordo ad Spiritualia,</hi> and disclaim and quit his Temporal Monarchy; let him disown all power, so much as indirect, over Princes Temporals; let him confine himself within his own Precincts and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, and renounce his Catholic Supremacy, and his Universal Jurisdiction over all the Kingdoms and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Christendom: Let the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> publicly declare to the world in Print, that she disowns and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims these treasonable, disloyal, <hi>Loiolitical</hi> Principles, these pestilent pernicious Antimonarchical Tenets of the Canonists and Jesuits; and then we may hope that our Romanists may be good Subjects. But till this be done, and while the Doctrine of Deposing Kings, allow'd by so many Decrees, I and Practices too, of Popes, and maintain'd by so many of their chief Authors, stands yet uncondemn'd; they must still give as leav (becaus they will give us caus) to doubt of their loyalty. I do not, I will not, say, All our Romanists are enclin'd to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion: I doubt not but there are many faithful and


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98012:37"/>
loyal Subjects among 'um: but this I must say, As long as they own a forrain Jurisdiction, either Spiritual, or Temporal, which they must do, if they are thorow-pac't; and as long as the Pope usurps the power to <hi>depose</hi> and <hi>dispose,</hi> to <hi>depose</hi> Kings, and <hi>dispose</hi> of their Kingdoms, and to absolv Subjects from their Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance; so long the Romish Religion must needs have a natural tendency to disloyalty: And therefore if Papists be good Subjects, no thanks to their Popery; and I fear, 'twill be hard for 'um to be good Catholics at <hi>Rome,</hi> and good Subjects at home: for if they be so, it must be only <hi>durante bene-placito,</hi> as long as the Pope is well-pleas'd: but if once he be angry with Kings and call 'um Heretics, then have at 'um <hi>Fowlers,</hi> let 'um look to themselvs. And indeed how our Jesuited Papists, if they be true to their Principles, can be true to their Princes, and take the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance, without mental Reservation, or Jesuitical Equivocation, or Papal Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, first to take it, and then to break it upon occasion, which is to play fast and loos, to play with Oaths, as boys do with Cherry-stones; I say, how they can otherwise do it, for my part I confess, it passes my understanding. And therefore the Case was well stated and determin'd long ago by our Reverend and Learned Bishop <hi>Davenant, Jesuitici Pontificii non possunt esse</hi>

               <hi>boni subditi.</hi> Ye have hitherto seen what the Jesuits Doctrine is; now see what an influence it had upon this day's Treason; For I shall not say any thing of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sassines of the two <hi>Henrys</hi> of <hi>France, Clement</hi> and <hi>Ravailliac,</hi> one of which was a Novice in the Jesuits College at <hi>Clermont,</hi> but both acted by a Jesuitical spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and animated and spur'd on to the perpetration of those horrid Villanies by reading such Books as <hi>Maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s, and others. Nor shall I recount those many attempts


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98012:38"/>
made upon the life of our Renowned Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of blessed Memory; those many <hi>snares</hi> laid for her by those <hi>fowlers</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> especially after that famous or rather infamous Bull of <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> was published against her, declaring her Excommunicate as a Heretic, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of her Crown and Dignity, and absolving her Subjects from their duty and allegiance. What sad effects that Bull produc'd, what treasons and conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, rais'd against her by her own Subjects by the advice and instigation of <hi>Holt</hi> and <hi>Walpole</hi> and other Jesuits, commending it as a meritorious act to kill an Heretic Excommunicated and depriv'd by the Pope, is a thing notoriously known to the Christian world. In the head or title of that Bull, I find these words, <hi>Deinceps obedientes anathemate illaqueantur:</hi> where I take notice of the word, <hi>illaqueantur;</hi> all that would presume to be her obedient Subjects hereafter, were intangled in the same <hi>snare</hi> of the Pope's Anathema. However (God be thanked) those <hi>snares were broken,</hi> and <hi>she was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</hi> But we need not look so far back: This days treason will speak enough for all, <hi>Crimine ab uno Disce omnes,</hi> we need fetch in no more, <hi>Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.</hi> And first, 'tis as clear as the Sun at noon-day, that the Jesuits, <hi>Garnet, Hall, Greenwell, Gerard,</hi> and others, were deeply engaged in the Plot, and had a main hand in it, as being the Principal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors if not Actors, in this horrid Tragedy. 2. That the rest of the Conspirators were influenc'd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the traiterous Doctrines and Principles of the Jesuits, their Ghostly Fathers, and Confessors; and also animated, abetted, and encouraged, by their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels and instigations, this likewise is plain and evident by the Authentic Records of the Proceedings against them.


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98012:38"/>
3. And lastly, 'tis no less evident, that it was the Pope's Bull that engendred this hideous Monster, that gave the first rise and growth to this unparallel'd Powder-Treason; the Pope's Bulls being <hi>Tauri ignivomi,</hi> like those in the Poet, <hi>Vulcanum naribus efflant,</hi> they breath gunpowder, fire, and brimstone. About the latter end of Queen <hi>Elizabeth, Clement</hi> the 8th (by the procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment no doubt of some here at home) sent two Bulls or Breves into <hi>England</hi> by the aforesaid <hi>Garnet,</hi> the Jesuit, and Superiour of that Order here, wherein he straitly charged all Roman Catholics not to receiv or admit any to be King (how near soever in blood) that was not well affected to the Catholic Religion: thereby prejudging and precluding (what in him lay) King <hi>James</hi>'s Right here to the Crown; But these were but <hi>Bruta fulmina;</hi> they could not stop nor hinder the King, his way and Title were both so clear and open. And now his good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Subjects are at a loss; and what shu'd they do? they could not keep him out, and therefore <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, they will blow him out, or rather, blow him up; and for that they had sufficient warrant and encouragement from the fore-named <hi>Clementines:</hi> for proof whereof when Father <hi>Garnet</hi> told <hi>Catesby,</hi> 'Twere not amiss, if the Pope were sent to, and made acquainted with the business, to know his mind, and how well he approv'd it; <hi>Catesby</hi> reply'd, That needed not, for he knew the Pope's mind well enough, he having already declar'd himself for the King's non-admittance; and who knows not, (saith he) that <hi>Qui admitti nolit, expelli velit?</hi> So you see upon what Grounds he went, and what it was that prompted and mov'd him, and his Complices, to this cursed Conspiracy; yea, I dare boldly affirm, that those two Bulls, the one of <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth against Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the other of <hi>Clement</hi> the eighth against King

For do you think our Roman Catholics, at least the Jesuits, were idle spectators all the while, and had not a hand in the 30th of <hi>January,</hi> as well as in the 5th of <hi>November?</hi> Is it not well known that the train to entangle us in that horrible <hi>snare,</hi> and intrigue of the late confusions, was laid by a great Cardinal Minister of State, and perhaps the whole Conclave? are we not yet convinc'd, that the design was hammerd at the Romish forge, and fire fetcht from thence to kindle our combustions? Is it not yet apparent, that the Popish Emissaries and Incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were sent hither on purpose under the name of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists, Seekers, and Quakers, and I know not what, to blow the coals, and foment the flames of our late dissentions? And are we not yet sensible, how some fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious and seditious Separatists have been, and still are, acted and carried on by Jesuitical principles in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious practices; and so brought to be the Pope's drudges; and to do his work for him, though the leaders of them are so blinded with partiality and prejudice, and others so led with blind obedience to their Teachers (a point of Popery too) that they will not see nor perceiv it?

that he who was your King, is not now your King any more: No King any longer, if the Pope saith the word; and then take him <hi>Fowlers,</hi> and do what ye pleas with him; he lyes open either to your gun, or your <hi>snare.</hi> And now tell me, were not some among us of late very prompt Scholars of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> think ye, they had so perfectly learnt this distinction? they did not oppose nor resist the King, but you know whom; no gun had they to hit him, no <hi>snare</hi> to take him in his Political ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, but only in his Personal.

            <p>But I shall no longer <hi>hanc Camerinam movere,</hi> nor harp any more upon this unpleasant string; this is not the day nor the time for it: Only let not the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor such as <hi>Philanax Anglicus,</hi> or the Author of <hi>Jerusalem and Babel,</hi> think to choak us with our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels and Regicides, the Authors of the late horrid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, as a blot scandal and reproach to our Religion: For we own them not, nor do we look upon them as ours, I mean Protestants, and true Sons of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> seeing they were wholly acted and sway'd by Jesuitical and Popish principles: Our Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion teaches us another lesson; yea, and this I must be bold to say further, As for those that have any seeds of this Rebellion still lurking and remaining in them (if there be any such, as I hope there are none here) that look asquint at the Government, Civil or Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and are disaffected to the present settlement of Church and State, as it stands now by Law establisht, I cannot see how such men can cordially join with us in keeping this Fifth of <hi>November.</hi> The horrible plot of this day was intended (saith our Church in her Collect) <hi>for the subversion of the Government and Religion estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisht among us:</hi> Now how can they be truly thankful to God for this days deliverance, that will not own nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Subject-matter of it, <hi>viz. the Government and Religion establisht among us?</hi> This is a day of Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to God for the preservation and continuance of our Government, Civil and Ecclesiastical, the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both of the Church and State; the Church, I say, both in her Doctrine and Discipline; her Doctrine in


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:98012:41"/>
the true ancient Catholic and Apostolic Faith; her Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, in her true, ancient, Catholic and Apostolic, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal Government. The Church of <hi>England</hi> had both these then establisht by the Laws of the Land, and so both these struck at this day; and are any still hewing and hacking at 'um? Both these should have been blown up this day; and are any still lifting and heaving at 'um? If so, who are they? or what can we count them, but the sons of father <hi>Garnet,</hi> or the spawn of <hi>Catesby</hi> and <hi>Faux?</hi> And certainly our factious, fanatic, turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and schismatical spirits, are but the Jesuits Journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, though they are so blind they cannot, nor will not perceiv it. And I would heartily beseech and entreat our dissenting Brethren, who make such a fearful pudder, rupture, and rent in this poor Church, I say, (if there were any here) I would earnestly beseech and entreat them in the bowels of our Lord Jesus Christ, seriously to consider what a scandal they bring upon the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion, and what hopes and advantages they give to the adversary. They have been hammering (say they) a Reformation all this while, and yet now they cannot tell what they would have, or where they would be. O! how <hi>Rome</hi> triumphs in our Divisions! how the Pope warms himself at the fire of our feuds and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosities, schisms and dissentions! the best fire I believe that ever he had next to that of Purgatory. They that wu'd break down the fence of our Ecclesiastical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by undermining and weakning the power and autority of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in her Laws and Canons, and Constitutions, what a gap wu'd they open to the <hi>Foxes</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>little Foxes,</hi> to enter in and <hi>spoil our vines?</hi> They that would unhinge the frame, discompose and ruffle the Government of so well-order'd and setled a Church, by shaking and loosning the pinns

Do we not think our Romish <hi>Fowlers</hi> are at work still among us, very busie in laying their <hi>snares</hi> for us? and shall we be quarrelling among our selvs, till God <hi>give us up for a prey to their teeth?</hi> Quarrelling about I know not what; (I dare say the quarrelsome part know not what they wu'd have.) Give me leav to repeat a saying which I heard many years ago, as long ago almost as I can remember; <hi>Si unquam Papismus remeaverit in Angliam, Puritanis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus erit in causa;</hi> if ever Popery return into <hi>England,</hi> and we be brought into that <hi>snare</hi> again, and fall into the hands of those <hi>Fowlers</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> (which God forbid) we may thank our Schismatics and Sectaries for it. God be thank'd, hitherto this <hi>snare</hi> hath been <hi>broken;</hi> and this day it was <hi>broken,</hi> and I may say it was <hi>broken</hi> too not many years since by a miracle of mercy, this <hi>snare,</hi> or a wors; well, <hi>the snare is broken and we are delivered;</hi> and we still enjoy our Laws and Liberties, Lives and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, under a most Gracious Prince (who may far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be call'd <hi>Pius</hi> and <hi>Clemens,</hi> then either of the two men of <hi>Rome</hi> we spoke of before) I say under a most

Gracious King, whom God long preserv; in a Church most pure, and Orthodox, and Apostolical, and best re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of any Church this day in the Christian world. <hi>O fortunatos nimium!</hi> if we would but know it. <hi>Happy is that people that is in such a case,</hi> under such a King, and <note place="margin">Psal. 144. 15.</note> in such a Church; a happiness which nothing can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of, but our monstrous and wretched unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness for such a great mercy. As ever then we hope or desire to have this happiness prolong'd and continu'd to us and our posteritie, and still to <hi>escape</hi> these <hi>snares, snares</hi> of superstition, and <hi>snares</hi> of confusion; <hi>snares</hi> of the head, and <hi>snares</hi> of the hand; <hi>snares</hi> of corrupt and pernicious principles, and <hi>snares</hi> of cursed and cruel practices; in a word, as ever we look to enjoy the fruit and benefit of this days deliverance, let us be really and truly thankful to God for it; let us <hi>escape as a bird;</hi> the <hi>bird</hi> when she is <hi>escaped out of the snare,</hi> flys aloft to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, as it were in token of thankfulness, <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans in nubila fugit,</hi> with her in <hi>Virgil:</hi> so let us; let us be really thankful, let us express our thankfulness by flying aloft towards Heaven, I mean, by our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly-mindedness, by the purity and holiness of our lives, by an humble and chearful submission and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Laws of God and the King; in a word, by our lowly and loyal, peaceable and godly Conversation. And now let me ask but this one Question, <hi>Is our soul escaped?</hi> I say not, since this days Deliverance, 'tis so long past, but of late since the <hi>snare</hi> was last <hi>broken,</hi> eight or nine years ago? Is our <hi>soul</hi> the better for it? it may be our <hi>body</hi> is, our bodily and temporal estate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps is better, but are we grown better as to our <hi>Souls</hi> and spiritual estate? are we more reformed in our lives since that late wonderful Revolution? are we since that grown more holy and religious, more sober and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,

more meek and peaceable, more humble and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable? If so, then <hi>our soul is escaped.</hi> But if on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary we are nothing amended by it, nor more reformed in our Lives; if we are not the better, nor walk any whit the closer with God after such an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary signal deliverance from such a dangerous <hi>snare</hi> as this, our body is <hi>escaped</hi> it may be, but <hi>our soul</hi> is in the <hi>snare</hi> still, though not in the <hi>snare</hi> of Popish superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet in as bad or a wors <hi>snare,</hi> the <hi>snare</hi> of Atheism and prophaness; and so <hi>our soul</hi> is not <hi>escaped.</hi> Yea, and as to our outward and bodily estate, however it be with us at present, yet for the future we are never the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, but in as bad a case, in as much danger as ever, yea and in more, for <hi>if we sin more and more, a wors thing will come unto us;</hi> God will bring us into the same or a <note place="margin">Joh. 5. 14.</note> worse <hi>snare;</hi> for assure we our selves this, if we still go on to provoke the Lord by our sins, notwithstanding these his miraculous mercies towards us, <hi>a wors thing will come unto us,</hi> a worse <hi>snare</hi> will befall us, and we know not how soon; it may be here in this world, but be sure hereafter in the world to come. <gap reason="foreign">
