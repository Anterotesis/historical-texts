            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>I Did heretofore acquaint your Lordship, with my intention to write my thoughts and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, both of the Causes and Cure of the</hi> Stone <hi>in Humane Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: And that I did design to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate that Book to your Lordship, as the most proper Altar at which to offer whatever I should produce on that subject; you having been not only the most Illustrious Patient I have had in that Disease, but</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59323:4"/>
               <hi>also the most Generous too: For when some years since I was so happy to serve your Lordship not insuccessfully, upon that occasion, in the recovery of your health, your Lordship was pleased to take the opportunity (in a most Glorious Assembly) to give so obliging a Character, both of my Skill, and Care in my Profession, that had I not many former inducements, yet this alone were sufficient to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge (as a due debt to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship) not only my Labours upon that subject, but the Services of my whole life.</hi>

               <hi>Some part of that Treatise of the</hi> Stone, <hi>I writ some years since, and have yet lying by me; having had no conveniency to compleat the same, by reason of the removal of</hi>

               <hi>my Habitation, and the constant Trouble the prosecution of my Right to a considerable Estate, hath ingaged me in: For I find that a work of the nature of that Treatise, will allow of fewer Avocations, and requires a more easie posture of affairs, than I at present enjoy. Therefore be pleased, till I can make you that Present, to accept of this Book of</hi> Medicinal Councels; <hi>which I shall not need to recommend to your Lordship, since the worth of their Author, Sir</hi> Theodor Mayerne, <hi>is sufficiently known to you.

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IF you have ever been <hi>Sick,</hi> and have felt the incommodities of a Tourturing or Languishing <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease,</hi> I am sure you will conclude with me, that Man cannot enjoy a more <hi>useful</hi> and <hi>precious</hi> Blessing, then that of <hi>Health:</hi> For this gives us the true relish and delights of <hi>Honour, Riches, Knowledge, &amp;c.</hi> All which without health, have more of bitter then sweet in them: And it were much more Eligable to die, then to lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish out many years under the dayly oppressing <hi>insults</hi> of some vehement and cruel Disease; which is in reality to die, and but supposedly to Live. How much reason have we then to praise God for giving the knowledge of that <hi>Divine Art of Physick</hi> to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal men; And to Honour <hi>Physicians</hi> (as we are commanded to do) whose
<pb facs="tcp:59323:6"/>
Office it is, to take care of preserving our <hi>Health;</hi> and when it is decay'd, to restore us to it with <hi>speed, safety,</hi> and <hi>Pleasure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Heathens</hi> were so sensible of these benefits, that they <hi>Idoliz'd,</hi> and gave Divine Honours to <hi>Physicians;</hi> which thing we that are Christians do both renounce and abhor: But yet we must acknowledge, that a Faithful and Learned <hi>Physician,</hi> can hardly either be rewarded, or praised to his merit: And those men are most <hi>Ingrateful,</hi> and deserve not to enjoy even their own <hi>Lives,</hi> who despise either the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Physick,</hi> or its <hi>Professors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Cultivators</hi> and <hi>Promoters</hi> of this <hi>Science,</hi> have employ'd their learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Labours several ways; some of them in writing <hi>Medicinal Institutions,</hi> others in <hi>Controversies,</hi> others in <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Notes,</hi> and <hi>Illustrations</hi> upon the <hi>works</hi> of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> others in composing <hi>Methods</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> of <hi>Physick.</hi> As also in describing <hi>Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical</hi>

               <hi>Operations;</hi> others in <hi>Anatomy,</hi> others in increasing the <hi>materia Medica,</hi> by writing <hi>Pharmacopaea's,</hi> both <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenical</hi> and <hi>Chymical.</hi> But none have merited so much, (because of the uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which redounds from that way of writing) as those <hi>Authors</hi> which have writ <hi>Consultations</hi> and <hi>Councels:</hi> For by this singular <hi>Artifice,</hi> (or way of writing) we are taught to effect that which is the most difficult thing in the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Physick,</hi> viz. The Application of general <hi>precepts,</hi> to particular <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and Persons:</hi> For the <hi>Art of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick is long by precepts, but is rendred short and efficacious by Examples.</hi> And by this means we have the <hi>Knowledge, Learning,</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> of industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous able <hi>Physicians,</hi> (which they have labour'd all their life time to acquire) convey'd to us in <hi>Epitomy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of these sort of Writers is our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, Sir THEODOR MAYERNE: (Chief <hi>Physician</hi> to his late <hi>Majesty,</hi> and his <hi>Royal</hi> Consort;) For whose

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Give you thanks for your Charitable and Pious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice sent to me, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the last Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Ecclesiasticus.</hi> It is very fit for me, who am now growing into old Age, the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies of which, are already incumbent upon me. The Inhabitants of this Kingdom being disturbed with Tumults, and I at a distance from my Lordship of <hi>Aubonne:</hi> In that place it would not have been difficult to have found a <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> where I might have took a fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well of the World, and there quietly have

resign'd my Soul into the hands of my <hi>Saviour.</hi> But perhaps it is otherways decreed by Gods over-ruling power, to resist which, were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and wicked. I know not if there yet remain such a happiness for me, (which the troublesomeness and incommodity of the journey, proceeding from the distance of the place, and length of the way, forbids me to hope) that I may yet enjoy your Company: But if God do grant it, it will be much to my satisfaction and content; if otherways, accept favourably of the friendly and kind propensity of my mind; and my desires to be near and present with you: I am ready by all sort of services to deserve your favour. But being separated from you by a fatal necessity, since I cannot assist you nearer hand, (for the honour you confer upon me, in desiring my advice) in the recovery of your health (which I wish to God you may injoy better) though this present intemperate Weather doth not savour it; but rather puts a stop to the use and efficacy of Medicines; yet for all that, as improper as the Weather is, accept of, and follow the Councel I here send you, the which I offer to you with an affectionate mind.</p>
            <p>I do not doubt but that <hi>Mr. de Gras</hi> hath exactly and throughly examined your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution in general, and the unequal distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of all your parts, both <hi>Natural, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:59323:10"/>
and <hi>Animal;</hi> and I do firmly allow of the conjectures, constituted by so Learned a Man, and one knowing in the <hi>Art:</hi> but since I have been acquainted with you from your Cradle, nay, with your Ancestors before you, the last fate of whom, was throughly examin'd and look'd into by me. I suppose this affair ought to be deeper inspected.</p>
            <p>Your Illustrious Father, of happy memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, had the thread of his Life broken off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its due time, by a continual <hi>Cough,</hi> and an incessant <hi>defluction</hi> upon his <hi>Lungs:</hi> But as to what concerns your self, (if I remember rightly) you are like him in every thing, both in your <hi>Mind,</hi> and in your <hi>Body,</hi> you had always <hi>weak Lungs,</hi> you wax <hi>Lean,</hi> (of which I have been an eye witness) and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times also you did use to <hi>spit blood,</hi> though in small quantities: This I suppose, That as those parts which are weak by Nature, are subject to suffer by all sort of injuries, so the <hi>Lungs</hi> are so above the rest, both upon the account of their proper <hi>Texture,</hi> which is rare and spangious, as also by reason of their <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation,</hi> by which they easily receive the <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biffick Causes,</hi> as well from the superiour parts which lay over them, as also those which to their great prejudice are transmitted to them from the inferiour parts.</p>
            <p>I do not deny but that the <hi>Stomack</hi> perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

of its Office ill, the <hi>Mesentery</hi> filled with Obstructions, and the <hi>Liver</hi> generating <hi>acrid</hi> and <hi>thin blood,</hi> may (from the depraved condition of the aliment they afford) evilly affect the <hi>Brain</hi> and <hi>Lungs;</hi> whose Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whether they are transmitted thither (from other parts) or Congested there, are yet very Liquid, as long as they remain in their state of <hi>Fluidity,</hi> which is common for all dissolv'd <hi>Tartars;</hi> but having gain'd a <hi>place,</hi> and being lodged in the <hi>Pipes</hi> of the <hi>Lungs,</hi> they Coagulate into a glutinous and <hi>muci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laginous</hi> substance, producing that <hi>Asthmatick</hi> and <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>That you may receive relief, there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity by a good <hi>Diet,</hi> to amend the <hi>Vices</hi> of the <hi>antecedent Causes,</hi> in their <hi>Fountains</hi> or <hi>Spring-heads,</hi> reducing by degrees to a better state, the deprav'd <hi>Faculties</hi> of the parts, in which the <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Second Concoctions</hi> are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd. <hi>Secondly,</hi> to hinder the <hi>Flood</hi> and defluction from the <hi>Brain,</hi> and that by streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening, drying, and diverting to other

And if in the course of doing this, in the mean time the Anacatharsis, or upward Evacuation happen to be difficult, or stopt, care must also be taken of that: And at last there must be <hi>Analeptick</hi> means made use of to <hi>refresh</hi> and <hi>restore</hi> the parts which are ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to a <hi>decay</hi> and <hi>Consumption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That you may attain this end, follow exactly the advice given you by your <hi>Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> concerning <hi>Diet;</hi> which if I should par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly describe, this <hi>Councell</hi> would swell into a <hi>Volume.</hi>

            <p>I have long been afraid lest this Disease, which hath threatned you a great while, should at last break out into act.

Their infirmities are descended to you by way of Inheritance, together with their great <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments</hi> and <hi>Virtues.</hi> If you have done any thing which hath hasten'd this misfortune to fall upon you, it is unknown to me, and it were necessary that you acquainted me with it; for accurate instruction is necessary, that you may receive the full advantage and fruit of my advice.

And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst our rules, this is the Chief: <hi>If all things be done rationally, and success do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently</hi>

I have seen (that I may discover the Efficacy of the <hi>Air</hi> in Diseases of the <hi>Lungs)</hi> a Gentleman, who having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a deep wound in his <hi>Breast,</hi> he was twice Cured thereof by making an <hi>Aperture</hi> in the opposite side, which necessity compell'd to be made betwixt his <hi>Ribs:</hi> which <hi>Aperture</hi> became a <hi>Fistula;</hi> He travel'd into <hi>Spain,</hi> where after five years stay, the <hi>Fistula</hi> healed up; returning to his own Country, which was a cold and moist Climate, it open'd again of its own accord: and he was healed again by going into <hi>Spain</hi> for the same number of years as formerly. From hence it will plainly appear to you, that the <hi>Air</hi> pervading all the <hi>Bronchia,</hi> or Pipes of the <hi>Lungs,</hi> and passing directly to the <hi>Heart,</hi> is more efficacious in exerting the force of its native, or acquir'd qualities and virtues, than any other sort of remedy whatsoever.</p>

Functions of the Soul do act erroniously at sometimes: And from this humour, and from nothing else, is the Original of your fore-pass'd Melancholly afflictions, returning upon you by fits; the settling of humours in the parts near the <hi>Fundament,</hi> (the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy of which humours consists in a <hi>Septick,</hi> and Corrosive <hi>Salt)</hi> hath begotten that great <hi>Ulcer,</hi> which is now turn'd to a <hi>Fistula.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That troublesome heat of the <hi>Palm</hi> of your <hi>left hand,</hi> and the <hi>sole</hi> of your <hi>Foot,</hi> doth plainly shew the power of the <hi>Spleen,</hi> affecting the upper as well as the nether parts; also the intense dryness of your <hi>Mouth;</hi> all which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by <hi>Sulphurious, Nitrous,</hi> and <hi>Vitriolate</hi> exhalations sent up from the Bowels: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the <hi>Stupor</hi> and Numbness of your <hi>Arms</hi> &amp; <hi>Legs,</hi> which affects you only by <hi>Periods</hi> and Fits, not constantly: to all which may be added the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or <hi>stuttering</hi> of your <hi>Tongue,</hi> returning by intervals; from these without doubt I say, is the <hi>Idea</hi> of your Melancholly afflictions: all which may be constituted to proceed from the Reciprocal flowing of that juice from the <hi>Spleen</hi> to the <hi>Brain,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ways flowing back again; which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times introduceth grievous <hi>Symptoms,</hi> as the <hi>Epilepsia,</hi> and others, insomuch that it is not absurd to make a presage from these signs, of the near approach of a <hi>Palsie,</hi> though I think
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59323:21"/>
the danger may be prevented, if you be but strong enough: let us omit the Cure of the <hi>Fistula,</hi> since it is almost healed: But lest we Triumph before the Victory be gain'd, we must allow the space of five or six Months, to expect whether perhaps any new budding of the Disease, do not cause us quite to lay aside our conceived hopes of a perfect Cure; for the Melancholly humour is not unlike the dispositions of the most sort of <hi>Poysons,</hi> which by the force and efficacy of <hi>Antidotes,</hi> are somewhat weakened, and the Tempest which they brought with them allay'd, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced <hi>Symptoms</hi> ended, so that Nature being restor'd to her former state, doth easily overcome what remains: Let us direct our aim then at this point, since in my judgement, any other method of Cure, though it may appear never so useful, will prove ineffectual for the future.</p>
            <p>I do not touch upon your <hi>Diet,</hi> being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that those to whose care you have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted your health, will not pretermit any occasion of either doing what is fit, or omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what is inconvenient; let us proceed to remedies; of these I think it will be vain for the future to continue in the use of slight ones, which are usually prescrib'd, more for the comfort of the <hi>Physician,</hi> then the Sick; which are really <hi>adiaphora,</hi> or indifferent,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59323:21"/>
they are innocent truly, but by being so, they afford no help: This Evil is to be pluck'd up by the Roots, otherwise it will be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally hatching, and producing a new Brood. Let Vomits lead on the first and main Battle, as well for their efficacious removing the filth of the first regions of the body, as also to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move by their <hi>specifick</hi> efficacy (from which only the Triumph and Victory over Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly is to be expected) future impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Of these, I know none more preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, nor of less danger, than the infusion of <hi>Crocus Metallorum,</hi> made in <hi>Canary Wine,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing an <hi>Ounce</hi> of this to a <hi>Pint</hi> of the <hi>Wine;</hi> of which if you are easie to Vomit, you may take the first time one Ounce, adding of simple <hi>Oxymel</hi> half an Ounce, and one Ounce of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus Beneditus Water:</hi> if you are hard to work upon, then you may take from the quantity of ten Drams, to an <hi>Ounce</hi> and half of it, though I think it safest to begin with a small <hi>Dose,</hi> except the vehemence of the Disease perswade otherwise. <hi>Vomit</hi> three or four times, nay more, making use of no other Medicine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween: but if your endeavours to Vomit prove fruitless, the <hi>Stomack</hi> may be easily moved to it by drinking of <hi>Barley Water,</hi> or thin <hi>Chicking Breath,</hi> nay only with warm Water; procure this sort of Evacuation at least <hi>three times,</hi> allowing the space of two or
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59323:22"/>
three days between, after which, apply your self, to Purgation, beginning with <hi>Elleborat,</hi> and <hi>Hypochondriack Apozems.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If by rubbing and pressing hard with your hands, the whole <hi>Abdomen</hi> and the <hi>Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dries,</hi> there be found pertinacious obstructions there, it will be necessary then to exhibit some preparing Medicine for 7 or 8 days together, which being perform'd, the Purgation of the humour is to be administer'd again: If there be any occasion to open a Vein (from which nevertheless I expect little benefit) let the <hi>Physician</hi> that is present take care of that: I note this one thing to you, that I prefer the opening of an inferiour Vein in the <hi>Malleoli,</hi> or Ancles, rather then a superiour in the <hi>Arms,</hi> unless there be somewhat else that hinders it.</p>
            <p>The Body being thus conveniently Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated, the whole business of the Cure is to be directed to the use of <hi>Steel,</hi> in this Cure the chief Medicine: There are three Weeks at least to be imploy'd about the foresaid ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral praescripts, and in the mean time, care must be had of that intense dryness of your <hi>Tongue,</hi> which is so troublesome to you, which I hope in a small time will be dissipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, from which no great danger is threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd; so that care be took, that the Body be cleansed from those hot, dry, and vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick juices, (of the nature of Canker of Brass)
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59323:22"/>
which doth enduce this intense and unsatisfy'd thirst; in which case there is great relief found in the opening the Veins, situate under the <hi>Tongue,</hi> by which the heat of the <hi>Lungs</hi> and <hi>Heart</hi> is allay'd, and the <hi>Brain</hi> effectually discharg'd; if you find the <hi>Brain</hi> to be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd (with this matter) and if you find the continual <hi>Numbness</hi> of the <hi>Members</hi> to remain, together with an imbecility to move, apply a great visicatory to the <hi>Nuck</hi> of the <hi>Neck,</hi> and make two <hi>Issues</hi> in the topes of the Shoulders; The Head being shaved, put upon it <hi>Ferne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> his Cataplasme, or some other <hi>Epispatick:</hi> Anointing the whole Back-bone every day with <hi>Balsom</hi> of <hi>Earth-worms,</hi> or <hi>Batts, &amp;c.</hi> And when the Weather is convenient for it, go to the <hi>Baths</hi> of <hi>Borbon,</hi> or <hi>Aquense,</hi> which are not far from your House, and use to wash your Body with them, and let the whole Spine of your Back be dropt upon by these Waters.</p>
            <p>I do firmly believe your Panick fears will vanish, if you devote your self to the use of <hi>Steel,</hi> by the virtue of which, I have seen many <hi>Melancholly</hi> persons deliver'd, the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of whose Limbs did declare, that they were already <hi>Paralitick:</hi> And among these, a certain Maid of Honour, committed to my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>But concerning your <hi>Fistula,</hi> I think it is not far from being healed, if your <hi>Chyrurgion</hi> may be credited, who is a most expert man, to whom, (which you before desired me to do) since I have lately writ, there is no need that I take up my pen again, that he may be further satisfy'd of my kindness.</p>
            <p>Outward Remedies are needless for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but lest I should seem to be wanting in my Care and Friendship, if there is any thing needful to dry and confirm the <hi>Cicatrice,</hi> use the <hi>Balsom</hi> of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> of which you have heard me spake often, which will supply the place of all other Medicines which are fit for the part affected: you may apply <hi>Emplastrum Diasulphuris</hi> to the part; which since it needs some detersion and cleansing, upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it is convenient to use the solution of <hi>Crollius</hi> his <hi>Lapis Mirabilis,</hi> or another accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my judgement, of equal efficacy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59323:23"/>
of pure <hi>Bole-Armenick, White Vitriol,</hi> and <hi>Camphor,</hi> prepar'd according to Art: or you may well use the <hi>Mercurial Water</hi> descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by <hi>Hartman;</hi> made of <hi>Mercury sublimate,</hi> freed from its corrosive <hi>Spirits</hi> by <hi>Tynne,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Art.</p>
            <p>When the fear of a <hi>Palsie</hi> shall be dissipated, and the humour bred in the <hi>Hypochondries</hi> overcome, and cut off; also when it shall only remain to imploy our endeavours, that the Cure of the <hi>Fistula</hi> be made firm and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted; And that the birth of the same germinating kind of Ulcers, (in those lower parts subject to corruption) may be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then the use of <hi>Mercurial Medicines</hi> taken inwardly, will be seasonable, which in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time and place shall be prescribed to you with necessary cautions; as also certain other exsicating Medicines, taken from the Classes of <hi>Minerals,</hi> and these such as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a <hi>Diaphoresin,</hi> (or transpiration) at the pores, whose power and faculty is to discuss malignant vapours, and to hinder de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluctions; These produce different actions, according to the divers distemperatures of the receiving parts; which Distempers they master and overcome, by their particular ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious impressions: But enough for this time, and I will only subjoin an orderly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of certain Medicines promised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove:

            <p>As to your <hi>Fistula's,</hi> heretosore so afflictive to you, they are shortly to be closed up with a <hi>Cicatrice,</hi> for they are now almost healed, by the acurate care and diligence of your <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion;</hi> for which, both from my self, and all experienc'd <hi>Artists,</hi> he worthily deserves praise, which I will publickly make known, whensoever you require it, although I am equally averse to admit, or impart adulatory expressions.</p>
            <p>Before your <hi>Sores</hi> can attain a perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solidation, the greatest part of the <hi>Winter</hi> will be past over, and the subsequent <hi>Spring</hi> will be near at hand; at which time you will much better pass through that tedious course of Diet and Medicines which are to be made use of, then you can do in the height of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Wherefore since it is necessary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, and repair your life, that something be couragiously taken in hand, and yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing urgeth to begin it now: my opinion is, that you Elect a proper time, in which, without interruption, you may prosecute the course of your Cure, and use your Medicines successively, in due orde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, and with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; which if they be otherwise administred by fits, or broken intervals, and not with one steady course, although they be artificially
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59323:30"/>
and properly prescrib'd, yet they cannot have the least success: I advise (to compleat the Cure) that as soon as Dr. <hi>Guenalt,</hi> &amp;c. shall think fit, your Body be emptyed by Purging, according to the method I have prescribed; from thenceforth you may safely be quiet, only studying how to repair your strength, as well by aliments of good juice, as by gentle Cordials, such as the <hi>Majestery</hi> of <hi>Pearls, red Corals,</hi> and <hi>Crabs Eyes,</hi> sometimes given in <hi>Broaths,</hi> sometimes with the Confection of <hi>Kermes,</hi> and <hi>Syrup</hi> of <hi>Queen-Apples,</hi> procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring gentle Purgations betwixt whiles, with <hi>Laxative Ptisan,</hi> compos'd only with <hi>Senna,</hi> or sometimes adding <hi>Cassia, Tamarinds,</hi> and <hi>Manna,</hi> Clarifying all of them well, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times putting to the same quantity of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, a double Dose of the Purgers, upon the account of cleansing. From the going through this course, to the time that remains to the <hi>Vernal Aquinox,</hi> I advise you to rest; but when that time is come, then apply your self to the other course, nourishing your body afresh, insisting in the method I sent you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; according to which, having used the general remedies, the Prascripts of which you have by you, you are to make use of the <hi>Essence</hi> of <hi>Steel,</hi> which I send to you mix'd, and prepar'd with my own hands: And in my Opinion this sort of remedy is so powerful,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59323:30"/>
and so fitting for you, that if it agree with your nature, which I suppose it will not be repugnant too, I think the use of it is to be continu'd for <hi>threescore days</hi> together, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rules I have prescrib'd: This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perform'd, I hope your <hi>Bowels</hi> being strengthen'd, the <hi>humours</hi> will be amended, and the Collection of all the Causes of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>In the using of the <hi>Steel,</hi> let necessary Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations be interposed, having a care from henceforth of such as have <hi>Aloes</hi> in them, they irritate, and offend the <hi>Fundament,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less their bitterness be altogether taken away, which though it may be perform'd by Art, yet in my judgement it signifies little to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt that thing, which hath less utility then Ostentation in it.</p>
            <p>Having taken your Essence of <hi>Steel</hi> (which ought not to procure any loathing to you) warm <hi>Bathes</hi> are to be thought off, and the

            <p>MY last Letters gave you a large account how to make use of the <hi>Steel,</hi> which as I suppose is the chief, and apt remedy to recover your health, it only remains that I send it to you ready prepar'd, which I now do: you are to receive <hi>seventeen Ounces</hi> weight of the <hi>Syrup,</hi> which that it may be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd, and fitted to be used, according to the rule laid down in my former Letters, take order to have this following <hi>Syrup</hi> carefully made.</p>
            <p>Take sweet smelling Apples, commonly call'd <hi>Queen Apples,</hi> (with short Stalkes) as many as you please, cut away their rind, afterwards draw a water from them in a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Vessel, in a boiling <hi>Balneo Maria,</hi> till you

have got a sufficient quantity, pour the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said <hi>water</hi> upon the <hi>rinds,</hi> which have been first laid upon a <hi>Table</hi> until they are almost dry, add to them new <hi>Lemon peels</hi> cut small, distil this Water again by a <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Belvee Earth,</hi> or <hi>Tin;</hi> or so that the Distiller may carefully avoid the breaking of the Vessel in a large glass <hi>Alimbeck,</hi> and <hi>head</hi> of the same Metal; put into the inward part of the spout of the <hi>Alimbeck,</hi> a <hi>Nodule</hi> or little Bag, made with fine Linen, and fill'd with <hi>half a Dram</hi> of <hi>Ambargreece,</hi> and <hi>six grains</hi> of <hi>Mosck:</hi> put the Vessel into a Kettle of Water, filled with <hi>Hay,</hi> or <hi>Saw-dust.</hi> Make the joining of the <hi>Body, Head,</hi> and <hi>Reciver,</hi> fast with <hi>Lute,</hi> or Paste, made of <hi>Meal, Quick-lime,</hi> and the White of an Egg; draw a Water from this by distillation; in which, with a gentle heat, dissolve as much <hi>white Sugarcandy,</hi> ground to a fine powder, as it can possibly contain, to make it of the consistance of a <hi>Syrup,</hi> of which take exactly twenty three <hi>Ounces dilute,</hi> and mix it with that quantity (of the prepar'd Steel) which I send to you, which is sufficient for you to use threescore days, which is the time prefix'd by me. This Syrup is included in an <hi>Earthern Bottle,</hi> well stopt, and sealed with my own Seal, which Note, least it be chang'd.</p>
            <p>I would willingly have sent you the whole
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59323:32"/>
prepar'd, but that the price of the carriage would have been insufferable: keep this as a Treasure for the recovery of your health, (which perhaps you will not attain too in the place you now dwell in) take it all, leaving no remainder of it; I wish I were nearer you, for my presence would conduce much for the right use of so great a Remedy, although you cannot want expert directers when you shall be in that vast City of <hi>Paris:</hi> Give me an account of the success, chiefly if the desire of recovering your perfect health, shall call you home, and hinder you from expecting the <hi>Spring,</hi> which assists the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy and operation of Medicines.</p>
            <p>As to the swelling behind your Ear (it is a thing of difficulty, and for the most part eludeth the force of Medicines) I hardly think you are in that condition now, that upon the account of that you need my advice, since I imagine this grief of yours is already past the declination; but if there do remain any stubborn hardness, let that be overcome by some Mercurial Remedies, which will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the power of other Medicines, and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caciously overcome the hardness. I do often make use of them; and I do find, if all hope of suppuration be gone, yet these do so rarifie the humours, that nature is able to dissolve that humour that was congeal'd, into the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59323:33"/>
form of perfect Matter: This (besides other Experiments) happen'd in two <hi>Pestilential Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</hi> of which one was under the <hi>Arm-pit,</hi> they retain'd their hardness for <hi>six weeks,</hi> though the Malignity was extinct; yet by the help of <hi>Mercurial Remedies,</hi> they were brought to a happy suppuration.</p>

               <p>But I cut off as much as I could of the <hi>dead flesh</hi> with Scissers and Knives, as often as I open'd the <hi>Ulcer:</hi> I wiped away the Matter with <hi>Pencils</hi> made of <hi>Sponge,</hi> dipt in the decoction of <hi>Scordium, Rue, Wormwood,</hi> and <hi>Lupines,</hi> adding a little <hi>Salt:</hi> by which means the putrefaction went off by degrees, and that in three days time, and spread no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Wherefore I omitted the further using of the Aegyptiack Ointment, and apply'd to the <hi>Ulcer</hi> a <hi>Linement</hi> composed with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>round Aristolock roots,</hi> the <hi>roots</hi> of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine Oris, Angelica, Aloes</hi> and <hi>Myrrh,</hi> with the <hi>Extract</hi> of <hi>Scordium,</hi> mixt with a little <hi>Yolke</hi> of an <hi>Egg;</hi> I did use the before pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd <hi>Cataplasme</hi> for more then three weeks: for not only the Skin and Flesh of the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum</hi> were wasted and eat away by the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction; but also much of the <hi>membrains</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:59323:39"/>
were rotted, as without doubt were the <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles,</hi> or Coats of the <hi>Urinary passage,</hi> which we were fain to cut off, and take away; wherefore almost all the <hi>Urine</hi> did issue out at the <hi>Ulcer</hi> for a long time.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of <hi>Iune,</hi> that <hi>Pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> or small Tumour in the middle of the <hi>Yard</hi> upon the right side thereof, which was hard almost from the beginning of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease, became an <hi>Aposthume;</hi> and a little while after it also broke, but it did not penetrate to the passage of Urine; wherefore applying of <hi>Emollients,</hi> Digestives, and Mundificatives, it was with difficulty healed.</p>
               <p>Three days after the breaking of the small Tumour in the <hi>Yard</hi> the humour which was before spread through the whole <hi>Scrotum,</hi> fell down to the lower part of it, toward the Ulcer in the <hi>Perinaeum,</hi> and there made a hard extuberance, but by applying of <hi>Emollient Bags, Ointment</hi> of <hi>Marsh-mallows,</hi> and <hi>Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lote Plaister,</hi> the matter which was collected there, was by degrees evacuated by the <hi>Ulcer</hi> of the <hi>Perinaeum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Ulcer</hi> being sufficiently cleansed from <hi>putrid flesh,</hi> and <hi>mortify'd Membrains,</hi> we made use of a <hi>Traumatick</hi> decoction, (or wound think) composed of <hi>Winter green, Ladies mantil, Sanicle,</hi> or <hi>Butter-wort, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59323:39"/>
in adstringent <hi>red Wine;</hi> after this manner, The Patient drank a draught of this three hours before <hi>Dinner,</hi> and another as many hours before <hi>Supper;</hi> we also injected it into the <hi>Ulcer</hi> twice a day warm; we also put in two <hi>Tents</hi> moistened in the same decoction, into the <hi>Ulcer,</hi> thrusting one of them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the other backwards towards the <hi>Prostatas,</hi> at last we apply'd a doubled Linen Cloath, dipp'd in the same warm: We did not only pour in the decoction with a <hi>Syringe</hi> into the Ulcer, but also into the Urinary pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, both above and beneath; which that it might be done the more conveniently, we caused a crooked Pipe to be made to the <hi>Syringe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis to be admir'd, that in this great and high putrefaction, the <hi>Sphincter</hi> of the <hi>Bladder</hi> did always remain safe and untouch'd, which appear'd from hence, that the <hi>Patient,</hi> even in the height of his Disease, could always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his <hi>Urine,</hi> nor did he ever let it go from him against his will. Nevertheless the <hi>Ulcer</hi> which went downward towards the <hi>Bladder,</hi> was deep, and touched the <hi>Prostatas,</hi> which I suppose were evilly affected heretofore; as often as he made water, it flowed partly at the <hi>Yard,</hi> partly at the <hi>Ulcer,</hi> but without any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty or pain: He used the foresaid <hi>Trauma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Decoction</hi> for three Months, so that by
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59323:40"/>
degrees the Ulcer was fully consolidated, nor did there remain any <hi>Fistula.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides <hi>Topical</hi> means, general Medicines were made use of, and the strength being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited by degrees, I gave him every other day, and sometimes seldomer, a little of the best <hi>Turpentine,</hi> by the benefit of which his belly was loosened, and the Urinary passages also cleansed: the <hi>Reins</hi> were anointed with <hi>Ointment</hi> of <hi>Roses,</hi> with <hi>Camphor,</hi> and there was apply'd a <hi>plate</hi> of <hi>Lead</hi> big enough to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Loins,</hi> and the <hi>Os Sacrum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now God be prais'd, this Gentleman en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys a perfect health, nor doth perceive any inconveniency of these great Griefs; he makes water freely, there being only left this impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment, that he is sensible of a certain pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful itching in the place where the Ulcer was formerly; moreover, many times there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth a Branny substance in his <hi>Urine,</hi> and as often as he makes water, there appeareth one drop of a white, viscous, glutinous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at the top of the Urinary passage, before the making of his water.</p>
               <p>This Gentleman desires to know of you what kind of matter this is, and from whence it cometh? I suppose this matter to proceed from the weaken'd, and not sufficiently streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then'd <hi>Prostatas,</hi> and that it is as it were an Excrement of the <hi>Seed,</hi> by the benefit of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59323:40"/>
Nature thrust out to the extremity of the Yard.</p>
               <p>He also inquires, why that painful itching when he makes water, should only happen after Supper, when he is about to go to bed, and is not perceived in the morning, or day time? I judge Nature doth in the night time, (which is the time she performs her chief Operations in) furnish that part which wants its Membrain, with a certain viscous, gluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous matter, to the intent to defend it from the acrimony of the Urine, that it be not hurt by it; but in the day time, by reason of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Urine often, that matter is washt away, and the part being yet weak, is vellicated and gnawn; if this be not probable, it seems so to me.</p>

               <p>In those Bodies whose <hi>Urethra,</hi> or Urinary passage of the <hi>Yard,</hi> hath been long afflicted, and tortur'd by a cursed <hi>Caruncle,</hi> even after the flesh thereof is consumed, and the <hi>Ulcer</hi> healed and cicatric'd, the part remains weak a long time, and is very apt to receive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluctions, and that chiefly in <hi>Plethorick, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine,</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:59323:41"/>
and <hi>Bilius</hi> Constitutions, and such as have movable humours, and use hard exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, indulge their Appetite, and are little carefull in their Diet. The Kings Doctor, and you, did stoutly endeavour to prevent the Phlegmon, which perhaps might have been hindred, if the part had not been so extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fill'd, and heaped up with humours, that it eluded the force of Remedies, and did upon that account manifoldly exceed, and surpass the power of <hi>digestion,</hi> and <hi>dissipation:</hi> The lower parts are moist, and near to the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whose putridness and stench useth to be very great, which was the reason that they were the sooner seized with the <hi>Gangreen;</hi> with that horrid stench which the <hi>Patient</hi> was afflicted with: If the feeble and languishing heat deserts the parts, there doth immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow a sudden deadness, (or cadaverous corruption) and dissolution of the subject. But by the Divine goodness these mischiefs have been already removed by you, the curing of which I certainly attribute to your <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Decoction,</hi> with which I am well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, and have approved it by manifold experiments.</p>
               <p>There now remains three things, of which you require my opinion. 1. The itching in that place where the <hi>Ulcer</hi> was, and that chiefly after Supper, it being not perceptible
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59323:42"/>
all the day time. 2ly. The <hi>Urine</hi>'s being fill'd with a substance like <hi>Bran,</hi> which it doth not pour out so constantly, but by fits. 3ly. The <hi>Purilent matter</hi> excreated which appeareth at the top of the <hi>Glans,</hi> at the upper end of the urinary passage, and cometh before the <hi>Urine,</hi> and is expell'd by it.</p>
               <p>For the first, I do with you attribute it to the yet tenderness, and rawness of the part; which is scarce yet covered with a <hi>Cicatrix;</hi> and is of that tender and exquisite sense, that (being by the reiterated excretion of <hi>Urine</hi> in the day time, cleansed and washed from that <hi>Mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

To avoid this inconveniency, let the <hi>Cicatrix</hi> be confirmed by drying Medicines: make <hi>

               <p>'Tis questionable whether the Branny sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance proceed from the <hi>Kidneys,</hi> or, which

found he was bound in his Body, about the xxij day, a little before Dinner, without the advice of a Physician, he took a little <hi>Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> by the help of which he had <hi>two Stools:</hi> But what follow'd? about the beginning of the Night, his <hi>Urine</hi> was plainly and fully stopt; upon which, he was afflicted with sharp pains; Nauciousness, Gripes, and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting. When I visited him upon the <hi>23d.</hi> day of the said Month, I found him as it were dead with extreme pain: his <hi>Belly</hi> was extreme hard, and his <hi>Bladder,</hi> by reason of the plenty of <hi>Urine,</hi> was extended after a wonderful manner: I perswaded him to loosen his Belly with a <hi>Glyster,</hi> and that he would admit of a <hi>Catheter</hi> to be put into his <hi>Bladder.</hi> But this Noble Patient was infinitely averse to this Operation, by reason of the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his <hi>Urinary passage,</hi> (which he said was natural) he desired I would try all other Remedies before I put in the <hi>Catheter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I caus'd him to take several <hi>Glysters,</hi> and prescrib'd him a <hi>Bath,</hi> with Emollient Roots, Herbs, Flowers and Seeds and such things as relax'd and eas'd pain; I apply'd also <hi>Bags,</hi> compos'd with the same simples, to his <hi>Belly;</hi> and also anointed the <hi>Perinaeum</hi> with <hi>Oil</hi> of <hi>white Lillies,</hi> and <hi>Oil</hi> of <hi>sweet Almonds;</hi> But when I had used all my diligence, and yet his <hi>Urine</hi> did not pass, the pains and other

                  <hi>Symptoms</hi> were increas'd more and more, the xxvi day, about nine at Night, I exhibited to him a small <hi>Potion</hi> of three grains of <hi>Lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, Confectio Alkermes,</hi> ℈ j. dissolved in the <hi>Pectoral decoction,</hi> and a little <hi>Cinnamon water:</hi> by the benefit of this Medicine he slept quietly that Night, and his Water came plentifully from him in his sleep.

               <p>That which remains is, that he keeps an exact <hi>Diet:</hi> by intervals purging the first and common passages, with a Medicinal <hi>Wine</hi> made with <hi>Agarick; Senna, Rhubarb, Creme</hi> of <hi>Tartar,</hi> and certain appropriated Herbs, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd in the time of <hi>Vintage,</hi> after which, <hi>to wit,</hi> the following, or the third day after, he

               <p>The generating of the <hi>Stone</hi> is powerfully impeded, by procuring a <hi>revulsion</hi> of the <hi>vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid,</hi> slimy matter to the upper parts, and excluding them by <hi>Vomit,</hi> after liberal eating, and large drinking: Let this be done once in a month, or every other month, after <hi>Supper,</hi> that by <hi>sleep</hi> presently following after it, the <hi>Body</hi> may be refresh'd again, and the <hi>Spirits</hi> recreated.</p>

               <p>Not long after my going away, when the Disease began to renew it self again, there was another Physician call'd in to advise: He again purged his Body with <hi>Cholagogs;</hi> and with <hi>Syrup</hi> of <hi>Violets,</hi> and <hi>Marsh-mallows:</hi> he exhibited also with great success, <hi>Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> made with the <hi>greater cold Seeds,</hi> and <hi>sweet Almonds;</hi> when I was call'd again, (the pain still continuing; the sick person then discover'd to us, that it was a Disease of long standing) it was agreed upon then by us, that I should search with a <hi>Probe,</hi> and a <hi>Catheter,</hi> what was at the bottom of this grief, or what was its cause: Wherefore the Body being re-purged with <hi>Cholagogs,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of the <hi>compound Syrup</hi> of <hi>Roses solutive,</hi> together with the <hi>Electuary</hi> of the <hi>juice</hi> of <hi>Roses;</hi> and the <hi>Catheter</hi> being put in, I found <hi>Caruncles</hi> in divers places, chiefly towards the left side of the Urinary passage; which <hi>Caruncles</hi> do even now so stop up the passage, and are so

               <p>So it happen'd to our <hi>Noble Patient,</hi> who by the mercy of Almighty God, is now as free from this <hi>Chronick Disease,</hi> (which was almost converted into a habit, or nature) as ever he was in his life, as appears by the free passage of his <hi>Seed</hi> and <hi>Urine,</hi> also he <hi>Pisseth</hi> with a <hi>full, continued,</hi> and <hi>strait stream,</hi> who lately expell'd his <hi>Urine</hi> by <hi>drops,</hi> and with much difficulty.</p>
               <p>The superfluous flesh, (or <hi>Caruncles)</hi> being removed, there remain'd a longish <hi>Ulcer,</hi> which in respect of the part is great; and the cause being malignant, we have again and again cleansed the Ulcer, and have hitherto with incessant labour, endeavour'd to dry up, and bring it to a <hi>Cicatrice:</hi> But there is one thing yet remains after the healing of it, that is, to procure a solidity and hardness of the <hi>Cicatrix,</hi> which cannot be done either by <unclear>slight</unclear>, or few Medicines, or in a few days, in a <hi>Part,</hi> which is washed every day by the torrent and floud of the <hi>Urine:</hi> If publick business would permit this Patient to remain
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59323:54"/>
longer with us, we would add a conclusion to the Cure; but at the time of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he shall bring along with him both ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and necessary Remedies, which shall sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the want of our presence.</p>
               <p>Therefore by way of Confirmation, and that whatsoever remains in the <hi>Glandules,</hi> may be radically taken away, and that there may succeed no new infirmity, I advise, that the Body being artificially purg'd again, the next <hi>Spring</hi> he enter upon a <hi>Sudorifick Diet,</hi> than which I suppose no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more advantagious, both as to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the general cause, as also by streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening and greatly drying the parts, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store them perfectly.</p>
               <p>I have written what is further necessary more <hi>minutely,</hi> and particularly in my <hi>advice</hi> (which he brings with him) and at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent time of acting, the present face of things will direct you what is to be done first, and what last: <hi>The Soul of Cures are the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of times,</hi> which to follow, and lay hold of the moments, is a thing denied to the absent.</p>
               <p>You will learn from the mouth of this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Person, what arts I have made use of in fighting against this pertinacious Enemy; with what prudence I have eluded the cruelty of the most dangerous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Symptoms,</hi> with what
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59323:55"/>
care and diligence I have mittigated their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent fierceness.</p>
               <p>This Epistle would swell into a <hi>Volume,</hi> should I relate all. But lest I seem to envy the publick good, I will commit to the <hi>Press</hi> my small <hi>Commentaries</hi> upon <hi>Caruncles,</hi> and my experience in this part of the <hi>Art,</hi> as soon as my affairs at <hi>Court</hi> will give me a breathing time, which imperfect <hi>faetus</hi> I willingly leave to be licked by more polished ingenueties, and such as are more experienc'd in <hi>Art:</hi> For I am not in love with my own labours, nor can I believe that I can produce greater, or better things than other men.</p>
               <p>That you may experiment our <hi>Exaeretick</hi> Medicine, I have sent you a little of it, which nevertheless is sufficient to take away four great <hi>Caruncles.</hi>

            <p>I Participate in the evils which happen to my Friends, and suffer by consent, or sympathy with them, chiefly if they be such to whose service I have devoted my self, my <hi>Genius</hi> compelling to do so: I hear that a troublesome <hi>Catarrh</hi> afflicts you, which by <hi>Day</hi> gives you some respits, but by <hi>Night</hi> is exasperated and very troublesome: The dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of these sort of disaffections is, that they grow worse when the Night approaches, at which time <hi>Phlegm</hi> predominates over the rest of the <hi>humours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now since your <hi>Body</hi> in general is sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purged already, it remains particularly to cleanse your <hi>Brain;</hi> and afterward, by means of drying Medicines to strengthen it.</p>

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59323:71"/>

            <p>But to the <hi>Cure</hi> of this Disease, the now prescribed Remedies are to be insisted on, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards proceeding in the use of the following.</p>

            <head type="sub">Written in <hi>French,</hi> by a Physician whose Name is not known.</head>
            <p>ALthough the Disease of this Noble Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, is called the <hi>Epilepse,</hi> and is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be fixedly rooted and confirm'd, as having eluded and baffled many Medicines, yet I hope God (the chief Physician of Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical diseases) giving his blessing, in progress of time she will be freed from it; and by changing her <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Temperament,</hi> (which happens in <hi>Climacterick</hi> years, to wit, on the <hi>seventh year,</hi> by the help of the natural heat, grown more and more <hi>viget</hi> and lively) she will overcome that pernicious <hi>Diath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>sis,</hi> or indisposition: chiefly when Nature, at her appointed time, shall have cleansed the body of this Maid of its impurities, by the coming on of that <hi>Flux</hi> which is <hi>familiar</hi> to the <hi>Sex.</hi> And this is the rather to be hoped, for that those which have been by, and present when the Fits invade her, and have noted the signs going before, do deny it to be <hi>idiopathical</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:59323:73"/>
but rather assert it to be produced by <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy,</hi> and consent of parts: That is, its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal is not to be derived from the evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the <hi>Brain;</hi> but wholly from the inferiour parts, chiefly from the <hi>Bowels,</hi> (with whom the Brain consents by affinity) from which gross <hi>vapours</hi> ascend upwards, chiefly in the time of <hi>sleep,</hi> which is stirr'd up from their proper <hi>Mine</hi> by the heat then go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the inward parts: And this is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest from the <hi>pain</hi> which is perceived in the upper part of the <hi>Belly,</hi> before the assault of the <hi>Paroxysme,</hi> or Fit; and the turbulency, and want of sleep going before it, indicating the <hi>Bowels</hi> are filled or stuffed with <hi>vitious humours,</hi> (to which perhaps may be joyned <hi>Werminous,</hi> or Wormey matter, a thing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to that <hi>Age)</hi> which first pour sorth <hi>vapours,</hi> which procure those terrifying wants of sleep, and afterwards produce the <hi>Epilep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Insults,</hi> by obstructing the passage of the <hi>Animal spirits,</hi> and hence for a time inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting their <hi>action,</hi> untill those <hi>vapours</hi> be dissipated, or are transmitted to the inferiour parts.</p>
            <p>Now since according to my judgment, the <hi>antecedent,</hi> and first <hi>cause</hi> of this rebellious and troublesome disease, is constituted and made by those <hi>depraved humours,</hi> and that <hi>vitious Minera,</hi> we may well hope they will
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59323:73"/>
be <hi>taken away,</hi> and their <hi>effects</hi> removed <hi>in time,</hi> by the <hi>Divine assistance</hi> and blessing: And that the rather, because perhaps all things have not been prescribed with a fit and due <hi>Method,</hi> nor <hi>Chymical</hi> Medicines made use of, by the help of which most perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious diseases are overcome; which sort of Medicines are to be rightly used, slighter ones having been first made use of.</p>
            <p>Let the first <hi>scope,</hi> or intention of <hi>Cure</hi> be to purge the <hi>Sink</hi> of the Body, by the help of the <hi>Emetick,</hi> and <hi>Purging Medicine,</hi> noted <hi>A.</hi> taking of it presently, in a double proportion of <hi>Breath;</hi> walking after it the space of an hour, to make it act the better; also taking several spoonfuls after it of <hi>Broath,</hi> (some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more then warm) till it begins to nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceate; by which the Vomiting will be the casier: If perchance the <hi>Epileptical Paroxysme</hi> shall happen whilst it works, that ought to be no cause of fear, since it is an effect of the commotion of the humours stirr'd up by it, which ceasing the Fit also will <hi>cease.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let the <hi>second intention</hi> be, to prepare the <hi>Morbifick</hi> or offending <hi>humours</hi> with the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction</hi> prescribed for that purpose, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>B.</hi> of which a draught is to be taken <hi>six</hi> days successively in the <hi>morning, two hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Dinner.</hi>
