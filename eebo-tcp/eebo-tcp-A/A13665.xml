            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It was not for nothing that the elders in times paſt did ſo muche celebrate the inſtituters of thoſe things: as <hi>Herodotus</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that the Egiptians before all other men firſt fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d out the yere by the courſe of the Planets, and deuided it into .xij. mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes. <hi>Diodorus</hi> aſsigned it to the <hi>Thebanes,</hi> the which ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth well with the opinion of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> bicauſe the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes</hi> be a nation of Egipt. As <hi>Numa</hi> added to the yere Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary and February, <hi>Romulus</hi> ordred Marche, Aprill, and May, <hi>Auguſtus</hi> an other part, and ſo <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> made vp

the perfect yere, as <hi>Polidorus Vergilius</hi> witneſſeth in his boke <hi>De inuentoribus rerum.</hi> But how much praiſe is to be giuen to ſuch as haue inuented good lawes &amp; ſtatutes for the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Barbarous and wicked, and for the maintayning and defending of the iuſt? As we reade that <hi>Iſis</hi> ariuing in <hi>Egipt,</hi> brideled that Countrey, and ordained good common wealths. How did the <hi>Scicilians</hi> honor <hi>Ceres,</hi> for that ſhe was the firſt inuenter of wheat ſowing, with other innumerable? Among all other, none in my iudgement is more worthier to be praiſed, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the firſt finders out how to make ſhips and veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels nauigable for the ſea. <hi>Strabo</hi> writeth that <hi>Minos</hi> king of <hi>Crete,</hi> had the firſt rule of the ſea. But <hi>Diodorus</hi> ſayth, that <hi>Neptunus</hi> had the Empire of it afore him, for he inuented the feat in rowing of boates, and made a nauie, and was made Admirall of it by his father <hi>Saturnus,</hi> and <hi>Plinie</hi> reporteth that King <hi>Erichthas</hi> deuiſed boates firſt, and rowed in them on the Red ſea. Some ſay they were ordained by the Troyans in the narow ſeas called <hi>Helleſpontus:</hi> ſome thinke they were inuented in the Engliſh ſea. <hi>Danus</hi> as ſome write, was the firſt that vſed any ſhip when he ſailed out of Egipt into Grece. But for more aſsurance, what ſo euer their opinions be, as touching the beginning hereof, (as we rede in the holy ſcripture) <hi>Noe</hi> was the firſt inuenter or maker thereof, before the floud. The ingenious induſtry of man hath brought many things to a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and good perfection, as well in Coſmography and Naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, as in any other arte or ſcience: for no doubt, (as it ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by this trauaile or worke of Coſmography &amp; ſuch like,) the olde ancient writers, as <hi>Ptholomeus</hi> and others, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, in that they iudged this Newe found Worlde, or the Weſt part to be vnhabitable. How muche are they to be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that for their Countrey ſake refuſe no imminent perill, leauing the Pleaſaunt bedde of Delicacie, and the ſeate or cradle of Senſualitie, their landes and goodes, their Wiues

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y good Lorde,</hi> being ſufficiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, (how greatly) after the moſte com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable and no leſſe great and paynfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, to the which it pleaſed the King to employe and beſtowe your prudencie (&amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſting witt) you take pleaſure not onely to reade, but alſo to ſee and taaſte, ſome fayre Hiſtorie, the which among ſo many cares, might recreat your ſpirite and giue it a delectable libertie of his moſte graue and carefull buſineſſe. I haue boldened my ſelfe to preſent vnto you this my diſcourſe of a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger farre voyage made into <hi>India America,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe by vs named <hi>Fraunce Antartike,</hi> being partly peopled and partly diſcouered by our Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotes, a land which at this day may be called <hi>the fourth parte of the vvorlde,</hi> not onely by the withdrawings of our orizons, as by the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of nature of beſts, and temperatneſſe of the ayre of the countrey. Alſo for that none hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath ſought it out, ſuppoſing al Coſmogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
<pb facs="tcp:11759:6"/>
(yea perſuading with themſelues) that the world was lymitted in that which the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to vs had ſhewed. And although that this worke ſemeth to me of it ſelfe to be very litle to be offered before the eyes of your Lordſhip, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, the greatneſſe of your name will extol the baſeneſſe of my worke: ſeing alſo that I am aſſured wel of your wonted cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and deſire to heare wonderfull things, that eaſily you will iudge howe that my intention doeth tende to no other ende but onely to make you vnderſtand, that I haue no other delyght than to offer vnto you that thing, of the which you may draw and receiue ſome contentation, and wherein ſometimes, you ſhalbe eaſed of the great and troubleſome affayres which are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in thys degree and office, that you holde. For there is no mind or ſpirit be it neuer ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, but that ſometymes is troubled with the quicke diſpatch, graue and weighty affaires of a common weale. Therefore it is needefull ſometimes to ordayne as the learned Phiſition doth to a pacient or ſicke body, ſome chaunge of meates to recreate the appetite of them which by their infirmitie and ſickneſſe, cannot broke nor taſte one kind of meate continually, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo pleaſant.</p>
            <p>This therefore is the cauſe why the ancient Philoſophers and others did oftentimes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe themſelues from being wrapped in or charged with the publike affayres. As alſo the
<pb facs="tcp:11759:6"/>
great Orator <hi>Cicero</hi> witneſſeth to haue abſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him ſelfe many tymes from the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> (to the great diſpleaſure of the cytizens) for to remayne in his countreyhouſe to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in the pleſant and Harmonicall melodie of the birdes. Seing then that among oures, as he among the <hi>Romaynes,</hi> for your ſingular erudition, prudencie, and eloquence, you are as chiefe and principall miniſter of the triumphant common weale of <hi>Fraunce:</hi> and ſuch a one as deſcribeth <hi>Plato</hi> in his common weale, that is to know, great Lorde, and a louer of vertue and ſcience, therefore it is not without reaſon to imitate and folow him in this point. Euen ſo (my good Lorde) as returning all weake and wery of ſo long a voyage, I was by you firſt of your grace receiued and welcomed home, which gaue me to vnderſtand and know, that you are the ſingular patron of vertue and of all thoſe, that folowe it alſo to my iudgement, I thinke I could not direct this my little labour to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than to you, the which if it pleaſe you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ſo beningly as with a good &amp; affectioned will I do preſent and direct it, and alſo to reade and peruſe it, you ſhal find in my opinion wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to recreate your ſpirites, and to holde me yours for euer. Although that already for many cauſes I feele my ſelfe greatly bound and holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to do moſt humble and obedient ſeruice to your lordſhip: to whom I beſech the creator to giue all good lucke and proſperitie.</p>

And we ſayled ſo long that at the laſte we came to <hi>India America,</hi> aboute the <hi>Capricorne,</hi> a mayn land of good temperatneſſe and inhabited, as we will particularly &amp; more at large hereafter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, the which I haue taken in hande at the
<pb facs="tcp:11759:7"/>
inſtant requeſt of many great perſonages, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the geſtes more than Heroical &amp; high enterpriſes celebrated by the Hiſtories, cauſe them to lyue for euer in perpetual honor and immortall glory. What hath prouoked the great Poet <hi>Homer</hi> ſo vertuouſly to celebrate in his writings <hi>Vlyſſes,</hi> but onely his long peregrination and far trauell that he made in diuerſe places, with the experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of many things aſwel by ſea as by land after the ſpoyle of <hi>Troye?</hi> What moued <hi>Virgill</hi> to write ſo worthily of the <hi>Troyan Aeneas</hi> although that he according to the writing of ſome Hiſtoriogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers had moſt trayterouſly betrayed his natiue countrey in to the hands of his enimies, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for that he had vertuouſly reſiſted the furie of the raging waues, and other inconueniences of the ſea, he had ſene &amp; endured many ſharpe ſhou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and finally he came into <hi>Italie?</hi> Euen ſo as the ſoueraigne creator hath made man of twoo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces the one differing or exceding the other, the one elementary &amp; corruptible, the other celeſtiall; diuine and immortall. Alſo he hath put al things in his ſubiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is contained vnder the ſcope or circuite of the Firmament, to the ende that he might know aſmuch as to him was neceſſary for to attaine to the ſoueraigne gift, leauing him ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe ſome difficultie &amp; varietie of exerciſe. Man then although that he be a creature marue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly accompliſhed, yet he is neuertheleſſe an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of vertuous actes, of the which God is the original, ſo that he may electe ſuch an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as pleaſeth him for to execute his pleſure, be
<pb facs="tcp:11759:8"/>
it by ſea or by land. But it may ſo chaunce as it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly ſene come to paſſe, that ſome vnder this pretexitie make it a cuſtome to abuſe the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter by an auarice and an vnſatiable appetite of ſome particular and temporall appetite, ieo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parding themſelues vndiſcretely &amp; as wickedly, (as <hi>Horace</hi> in his epiſtles doeth manyfeſtly ſhew) that he is worthy of prayſe, that for the beautifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eluminating of his ſpirite, &amp; in the fauor of the common wealth doth willingly offer and put forth him ſelfe. This rule or meane <hi>Socrates</hi> the wiſe Philoſopher knew how to practiſe, and after him <hi>Plato</hi> his diſciple, (bothe the which) not onely contented to haue traueled and made voyages into ſtrange countreys for to attaine to the full perfection &amp; knowledge of Philoſophie, but alſo to declare it openly without hope of any reward or recompenſe. Did not <hi>Cicero</hi> ſend his ſonne <hi>Marke</hi> to <hi>Athens?</hi> partely for to heare <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tippus,</hi> and of him to lerne Philoſophie, and partly alſo for to lerne the maners and lyuing of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſens of <hi>Athens. Lyſander</hi> being elected for his magnanimitie &amp; worthineſſe gouernor ouer the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> hath ſo worthily atcheued ſo many faire enterpriſes againſt <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> a man prewe and valiant, and <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Lieutenant on the ſea, that what loſſe or detrime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſo euer did cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, his heart and manly courage did neuer faile him, but purſued his enimie by ſea &amp; by lande, ſo that in the ende he brought <hi>Athens</hi> to his obedience. <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> not leſſe experte in the feate of warre tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Philoſophie, for to ſhew what a ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb facs="tcp:11759:8"/>
he had to ieoparde his lyfe for the libertie of his countrey, perſuaded the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that the ſiluer that was gathered in the mynes the which they were wonte to diſtribute to the people, was turned and beſtowed to furniſhe and make ſhips and galleys againſt <hi>Xerxes,</hi> who for that he had partly diſtreſſed him, and almoſt put to flight, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to appointment after this happie victorie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the order of an enimie, made him preſent with three of the beſte Cities of his Empire. What hath cauſed <hi>Seleucus Nicanor,</hi> the Emperour <hi>Auguſtus Ceſar,</hi> and many Princes and noble men to beare in their pendens and ſtandarts the Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin and the anker, but onely to giue inſtruction to al their poſteritie, that Nauigation is the firſt and of al others the moſt vertuous. Here therfore without any long diſcourſe is an example of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: as al things the more excellent they are, the more difficile or harde is the way to attaine to them, as after the experience <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, ſpeaking of vertue. And that the nauiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is alwaies folowed with peril, as a body is with his ſhadowe, the which in times paſt was ſhewed by <hi>Anacharſis</hi> the Philoſopher, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of what quantitie or thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe were the pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cks or ſide of a ſhip: it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, not aboue four fingers: ſo much (ſaid he) is the lyfe of him from death that ſayleth with ſhips on the water. Now gentle Reader in that I haue alleged ſo many excellent perſonages, it is not to compare, much leſſe to thinke my ſelfe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to them, but I am perſuaded that the great
<pb facs="tcp:11759:9"/>
power of <hi>Alexander</hi> hath not letted his ſucceſſors to attempte yea the very extremitie of fortune. Alſo the deepe knowledge of <hi>Plato</hi> did nothing at all feare or abaſhe <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> but that at his owne pleaſure he hath treated of Philoſophy. For this intent therefore not to be found ydle and ſlacke among others, no more than <hi>Diogenes</hi> was amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the <hi>Athenians,</hi> I haue thought good to ſet out in writing many notable things that I haue dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently obſerued in my Nauigation betwene the South and the Weaſt, that is to wit, the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſpoſition of places, in what clymat, zone or paralegie it be, aſwel of the ſea coſtes, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landes, and mayne land, the temperatneſſe of the ayre, the forme and maner of liuing of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, the forme and propertie of beaſts of the earth and of the ſea, alſo of trees and roots with their frutes, mines and precious ſtones, ſhewing it liuely and truely as neare as is poſſible. As touching the reſte I wold thinke my ſelfe happie if that it would pleaſe you to accepte and receiue this my little labor with as willing a heart as I doe preſent it: as for the reſt I am aſſured that it wil be agreable if the Reader thinke well and way in his minde the long and dangerous pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grination that I haue taken in hand, for to ſee with the eye &amp; to bring to light thoſe things moſt memoriall that I cold note and gather together, as hereafter ſhalbe ſene.</p>

whether it meriteth the firſt degrée, at the leaſt I am aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it meriteth the ſeconde in excellencie and perfection.

The <hi>Spaniards</hi> haue affirmed that they wer not brought from <hi>Leuant</hi> nor from <hi>Candia,</hi> and yet the Wine is as good and better.

Now the fourth day of September we arriued into this Countrey of <hi>Ginney,</hi> on the Weſt bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.

And theſe people are ſo blinded and ignorant, that the firſt thing that they méete in the morning, be it birde, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, or other wilde or tame beaſt, they take it with them bearing it about them all the day, about what buſineſſe ſo euer they haue, as a God or protector of their worke, if they go a fiſhing in any of their litle boates of bark, they will put it in one of the endes of the boate well wrapped with ſome leaues, hauing an opinion and beleuing that

The which erroure differeth nothing from the error of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in times paſt, that worſhipped diuers Gods, vnder the coloure of Images and ſimilitudes. But yet this is a thing worthy to be noted, though it be ſuperſtitious and abhominable: that theſe pore, ignorant, and brutiſhe men, had rather worſhip corruptible things, than to be reputed without a God. <hi>Diodorus</hi> the <hi>Sicillian</hi> writeth, that the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> had the firſt knowledge of the fained gods, to whom they began to vow, and to ſacrifice. Alſo <hi>Homer</hi> ſignifieth that <hi>Iupiter</hi> with other Gods went into <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> as well for that they were there honored and ſacrificed vnto, as for the wholeſomneſſe of the Countrey. The like you haue of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Caſtor and Pol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lux, called the bright ſtarres, and lanternes of the ſea.</note> the which going on the ſea at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the <hi>Greekes</hi> againſt <hi>Troy,</hi> were vaniſhed in the aire, and were neuer after ſéene againe, the which giueth opinion to ſome to thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were rauiſhed &amp; placed among the ſtarres of the Sea: alſo many name them the cleare ſtarres of the ſea, attributing their names <hi>Caſter</hi> &amp; <hi>Polux,</hi> to two fair &amp; bright ſtarres. The ſayd people haue neither temples nor churches, nor other places appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for ſacrifice and prayer. Beſides this, they are without compariſon much more wicked than thoſe of <hi>Barbarie</hi> or <hi>Affrica,</hi> in ſuch ſort that the ſtraungers dare not aborde them, nor ſet foote on land, but by pledges:<note place="margin">The maners and order of liuing of thoſe of Ginney.</note> otherwiſe they would take them, and handle them like ſlaues.

They make not ſo great trade with beaſtes, as in <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:</hi> there is very fewe fruits, bicauſe of the drineſſe &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme heat, for this region is vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſigne <hi>Taurus</hi>: they liue a good many yeares, and yet ſéeme not olde, ſo that a man of a .C. yeares olde, would be iudged with vs not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue .xl.

with the which the <hi>Portingalles</hi> make a great trade. This fruit commeth vp in the fields like an Onion. The other that commeth from <hi>Molucquer</hi> and <hi>Calicut,</hi> is not ſo wel eſtéemed by a great deale. This people of <hi>Ginney</hi> trade with certaine <hi>Barbariens</hi> adiacent, golde and ſalt after a ſtraunge faſhion. There are certaine places ordained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, where as eche one of his parte bringeth his Marchandiſe, thoſe of <hi>Ginney,</hi> ſalte, and the others gold molten in lumpes, and without any other talke togither, bicauſe of the ſmall truſt and confidence one of another, as the <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> and ſome of <hi>America</hi> with their neighbors, they leaue in the place before ſpoken, the golde and the ſalte of eache part. This being done, theſe <hi>Ethiopians</hi> of <hi>Ginney</hi> if they finde there golde inough for their ſalt, they take it away, otherwiſe they leaue it, and let it lie.

For euen as the colde is an enimie, ſo in like caſe the heate is friendly to our bodies, knowing that our life is nothing but heat and moyſture, to the contrary death is colde and drineſſe. By this ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye may knewe that all the earth is peopled, and is neuer without dwellers neither for colde, nor heate, but for barenneſſe, and whereas it is vnfruitfull it may be inhabited, as I haue ſene in <hi>Arabia,</hi> and in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys.

            <p>THE twentie ſixth day of October, being eight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées beyonde our lyne <hi>Equinoctiall,</hi> we founde an Ilande not inhabited, the which at the firſte we thought to name the Ile of Birdes, bicauſe of the greate multitude of Birdes that are in the ſayde Ilande,<note place="margin">The Ile of the Aſcention, an why it was ſ. named.</note> but looking in our carde <hi>Marin,</hi> we found that before tyme it was founde out by the <hi>Portingals,</hi> and named the Ile of the <hi>Aſcention,</hi> bicauſe that on that day, they ariued thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. We therefore ſeing thoſe Birdes flying on the ſea,
<pb facs="tcp:11759:43"/>
made vs to thinke that there was ſome Ilande néere hande, and the néerer we came, we ſawe ſuch a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of birdes of diuers ſortes with coloured feathers, that the lyke was neuer ſéene in our tyme,<note place="margin">Diuers kinds of ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge birds and in great number.</note> the which came flying to our ſhips, and woulde reſte vpon vs, ſo that we might take them with our handes, and with greate payne coulde we be ridde of them. For if one had ſtretched out his Arme they woulde haue reſted vpon it, euen lyke tame birdes, and not one of them lyke to the birdes of our countrey, the which to ſome ſemeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible. Being caſte of from our handes they flyed not away, but let them ſelues be taken agayne as before.</p>
            <p>Furthermore in this Ilande there is a certayne kinde of greate birdes that I haue heard called Aponars,<note place="margin">Aponars birdes.</note> they haue little wings, and therefore they cannot flye. They are great and hye, lyke hearnſhawes, the belly white and and the backe blake as cole, the byll lyke to a cormo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, when they are killed they crye lyke hogs.</p>
            <p>I thought good to ſpeake of this birde among others, for that there are founde a greate number of them in an Ilande lying towarde the <hi>Caape,</hi> of good Spéede, on the coſte or borders of newe founde lande,<note place="margin">Caape of good haſt Ile of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponards and why it is ſo na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med.</note> the which was named the Ile of <hi>Aponards:</hi> Alſo there are ſuch a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that on a tyme thrée greate ſhips of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> going to <hi>Canada,</hi> did lade eche of them two tymes their cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boates with theſe birdes on the brinke of the ſayde Ilande, and it is no maiſtrie to goe into the Iland and to driue them before them to their boates lyke ſhéepe.

And therefore there is no Nation be they neuer ſo brutish, but that by their owne naturall reaſon haue ſome religion, and ſome cogitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God: they all therefore confeſſe, that there is ſome power and ſoueraygntie: but what a one it is, fewe there are that knowe it, and that hath cauſed the diuiſion of Religion.<note place="margin">The Religion of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans.</note> Some haue acknowledged the Sunne for ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne, others the Moone, ſome others the Starres, &amp; others otherwiſe, as Hiſtories do recite. Nowe to our purpoſe, theſe wilde men of <hi>America,</hi> make mention and tel of a greate Lorde, whom they name in their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage <hi>Toupan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Toupan.</note> the which they ſay is aboue, and maketh it rayne and thunder, but they haue not the meane to praye nor to honor him at one tyme or other, neither yet no place appointed. If one ſhew them of God, as I haue many times done, they will giue an attentiue eare there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto with an admiration, and they will aſke if it be not that Prophete that hath taught them to plante their great rootes,<note place="margin">Hetich rootes.</note> that they name <hi>Hetich.</hi> And they haue heard ſay of their fathers, that before they had the knowledge of the rootes, they lyued but with herbes and wild rootes, like brute beaſts: there was they ſay in their countrey a great <hi>Charaiba,</hi>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:11759:53"/>
vs. Of this roote I find two kindes of one greatneſſe: the firſt when it is ſodden or boiled becommeth yellow, &amp; the other white, and theſe two kindes haue the leafe like to a mallow, it neuer beareth ſéede, and therefore theſe wild men do plant againe this roote, being cut in péeces, ſo that they being replanted multiplie excedingly. When that this countrey was firſte diſcouered and founde on,<note place="margin">America firſt diſcouered in the yere. 1497</note> as before we haue ſhewed, which was in the yeare. 1497. by the commaundement of the King of <hi>Caſtilia,</hi> theſe wilde men being amaſed to ſée the Chriſtians in the order as they had neuer before ſene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like: likewiſe their maner, geſture and doings, they eſtemed them as Prophets and honored them as Goddes, vntil they perceiued that they became ſicke to dye, and to be ſubiect to the like paſſions that they were, then they began to diſpraiſe them, and to intreate them worſe than they were accuſtomed as they that afterwardes went thither <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portingals:</hi> ſo that if they be angred, they force no more to kil a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and to eat him, than if it were one of theyr enimies: but this is in certayned places, and ſpecially among the <hi>Canibals,</hi> that lyue with none other thing,<note place="margin">The Canibals are a people that liue with humaine fleſh.</note> as we doe here with biefe and mutton.

            <p>WE haue here before ſhewed ſpeaking of <hi>Africa,</hi> the which we coſted in our Nauigation, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Barbarians</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> and others in <hi>India</hi> went cuſtomably naked excepting their priuie partes, the which they couer with certayne vailes or aprons of cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, or beaſtes ſkins, the which without compariſon is more tolerable than in our <hi>Americans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">HoWe theſe America<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s liue.</note> that liue all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked euen as they come out of their mothers wombe, as well men as women without any ſhame. If you woulde know whether they do it of indigencie, or for the extreme heate, I anſwere that they may make themſelues clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of cotton as well as to make them beds thereof to reſt in, either they might cloth them with beaſtes ſkins, as well as thoſe of <hi>Canada,</hi> for they haue greate plenty of wild and tame, eaſy to be taken. They haue this opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that being naked and without apparell, they are more nimbler and better diſpoſed to all kynde of exerciſes.</p>
            <p>Moreouer if any tyme they be clad with any thyn and light ſhirte, the which they haue peraduenture gotten by greate payne: when they mete with their enimies they put it of before they ſet hande to their weapon (whoſe weapons) are a bowe and Arowes, for they thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this garment or ſhyrte would take away their dexteritie in their fight, alſo that they could not eaſily flye nor remoue their iointes before their enimies: yea they ſay that they ſhoulde be taken of their enimies by ſuch garments. And therefore they had rather be naked, ſo ignorant are they and yll aduiſed. Neuertheleſſe they are very deſirous of gownes, ſhirts, hats, and other clothing, and they eſteme them ſo precious and coſtly, that they will rather let them
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:11759:54"/>
marre &amp; take harme, than once to weare them, leaſt that by that meanes they ſhuld hurt them. In déede ſomtimes they will put them on when that they remaine at home, drinking and making good chéere after the death of their parents and friends, or in ſome ſolemnity after that they haue obtained victorie of their enimies. Moreouer if that they haue on any garment, they will put it of when that they ſit downe on the ground, and caſte it on their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for feare of ſoyling of it. There are olde men &amp; wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men among them, that hide their priuie partes with leaues. Some haue ſaid that in <hi>Europe</hi> when it was firſt inhabited, the men and women went al naked, only their ſecrete parts couered, as we read of our firſt parents. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe in that time the men liued longer than they do in our age, being not ſubiect to ſo many diſeaſes as we are, ſo that they haue affirmed that all men ought to goe naked as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> our firſt parents did, when they were in Paradiſe. As touching this nakedneſſe, we finde it not by Gods commaundement, I know that there are certaine heretikes called <hi>Adamians,</hi> that mainteine this nakedneſſe, the which ſect liued all naked, as theſe <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans</hi> of which we ſpeake.<note place="margin">Adamians a kinde of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> And they aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled in their ſina<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gogs for to pray, al naked, and by this ye may know their opinion to be falſe, for before the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; <hi>Eue,</hi> as it is ſhewed in the ſcripture, they were all naked, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward God gaue them garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of lether to couer their nakedneſſe, as the <hi>Canadians</hi> vſe at this day.<note place="margin">The opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Turlupins, and the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niques, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> The which error others haue maintained, as the <hi>Turlupins</hi> and the Phyloſophers named <hi>Ciniques,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which alleage for their reaſons, &amp; do teach it publikely, that a man ought not to hide that, which nature hath giuen him.

So muche thought I good to ſpeake, treating of the wilde men of <hi>America.</hi> Moreouer I haue ſéene thoſe of <hi>Perou</hi> vſe to weare litle garments made of Cotten after their maner.

The elders among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will kepe their promiſſe, and are more faithfull than the yong men, &amp; yet they are all ſubiect to theft, not that they ſteale one from another, but if they finde a chriſtian or a ſtraunger, they will rifle him (of their golde &amp; ſiluer they will take none) for they haue not the knowledge nor vſe therof, but their garments. They vſe great threatnings, ſpecially when y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are angred, not only to ſmite but to kil. Though they be vnciuil, yet are they prompt &amp; ready to do one ſeruice, yea for a little reward, euen to guide a ſtraunger .l. or .lx. leagues into the Countrey for feare of

In déede they are of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſuperſtitious, they will eat no beaſt nor fiſh, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is heauy or ſlow in going, but of all other light meats in running &amp; flying, as Veniſon and ſuch like, for bicauſe that they haue this opinion, that heauie meates wil hurte and anoy them when they ſhould be aſſailed of their enimies. Alſo they wil eate no ſalte meates, nor yet permit their children to eate any. And when they ſée the Chriſtian eate ſalt meats,<note place="margin">The Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes deteſt and abhorre ſalte meates.</note> they reproue them therfore as a thing impertinent, ſaying that ſuch meats will ſhorten their liues: their ordinary meates are roaſted after their manner, as Rats of diuers kinde, and great ones, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine kinde of Toades greater than oures, Cocodrils and others that they roaſt all whole, with the ſkin and the bowels, and this they vſe without any difficultie,

yea theſe Cocodrils and great Lezards as great as a pig of a month old,<note place="margin">The Lezard of America.</note> the which is a fine meat (as they ſay that haue eate thereof.) Theſe Lezards of <hi>America</hi> are ſo pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, that they will come neare vnto you, and take their repaſt, if that you wil take it without feare or difficultie. Their fleſh is like a Chickens fleſh, &amp; they kil them with ſhooting at them with their arrowes. The meates that they boile, are Oyſters and other ſhell fiſhe of the ſea. In taking of their foode, they obſerue no houre, but all times and houres that they féele them ſelues to haue a ſtomake or appetite, be it in the night after their firſt ſléepe, they will riſe to eate, and then lay them downe to ſléepe. In their repaſt they kepe a maruellous ſilence,<note place="margin">How theſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans kepe ſilence at their meat.</note> the which is more to be commended, than amongſt vs that bable and talke at our tables, they doe ſéethe and roaſt very well their meate, and eate it meaſurably and not raſhly, moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vs that deuoure in ſteade of eating: they will not drinke when they eate, nor eate when they drink, ſo that they will forbeare drinke a whole day. When they make their great bankets and ſolemnities, as when they haue obtained ſome great victorie on their enimies, then they wil ſit drinking a whole day without eating. They make drinkes of great <hi>Mill</hi> white and blacke, the which they call in their language <hi>Auaty.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Auaty a drink.</note> Neuertheleſſe after that they haue ſate drinking, being once departed the one from the other, they will eate ſuch as they can finde. The pooreſt ſorte liue more with ſea fiſhe, &amp; other like meates than with fleſhe, they that are farre from the ſea, do fiſhe in riuers. Alſo they haue diuers kindes of fruites, as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bringeth them forthe, &amp; yet they liue long in health and well diſpoſed.

               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:11759:56"/>
the vſe of fleſh. Therefore it is no ſtrange thing for to liue with fiſh. Firſte in our <hi>Europe,</hi> and before that the grounde was tilled, men lyued more hardly without fleſh or fiſh, hauing not the meane to vſe them, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they were ſtronger, and lyued the longer,<note place="margin">The more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate a man is nouriſhed the leſſe ſtrength he hath.</note> being nothing ſo feminate as now in our age.

Within theſe few yeares they haue found the meane to make litle pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, with the which they pull of their haire, for ſince that they haue bene frequented of Chriſtians, they haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the way how to forge Iron.

The women do more oftner coloure them ſelues therewith than men. Furthermore ye ſhall note in this place, that if the men are minded to go ten or twelue leagues off to drink or make good chéere with their friendes, they will pille ſome kinde of Trée, where within ſhall be red, yelowe, or ſome other coloure and they will ſtampe it very ſmall, and then they wil take gumme out of another trée, the which they name <hi>

It groweth on the trée by cluſters, xxx. or .xl. togither, and cloſe to another vpon litle branches neare to the trunck.

            <p>IT is not greatly to be maruelled at, if that theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple walking in darkneſſe, and ignorant of the truthe, prepareth not only vengeaunce, but putteth it in vre: Conſidering that the Chriſtian, although it be ſtraightly forbidden him by expreſſe commaundement,<note place="margin">Vengeance is defended to Chriſtians.</note> cannot kepe himſelfe from it, folowing the error of one named <hi>Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> who helde opinion, that we ought not to pardon our enimies, the which error hath of a long time polluted the Countrey of <hi>Egipt.</hi> Therfore to prepare vengeance, is to hate our neighbor, the which is wholly repugnant to the lawe. But in theſe people it is not ſtraunge, the whiche as we haue before ſhewed, liueth without faithe &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out law. For all their warre procéedeth only of a fooliſhe opinion of vengeaunce without cauſe or reaſon. And thinke not but that this fooliſh opinion hathe helde them from the beginning, and ſhall doe vntil the ende, if that God for his mercies ſake illuminat not their harts. This pore people are ſo ill taught, that onely for the flying of a flie, they will prepare miſchiefe. If that a thorne pricke them, or a ſtone hurt them, they will ſtampe it in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande pieces, as if the thing were ſenſible or had vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the which commeth not but for fault of good iudgement. Furthermore this is of a truthe, the which I am aſhamed almoſt to ſpeake, that for to reuenge them ſelues of Fleas and Lice, they kill them with their téeth, a thing more brutiſhe than reaſonable. And when they féele them ſelues offended or gréeued, be it neuer ſo little an offenſe, they will neuer be reconciled without
<pb facs="tcp:11759:73"/>
vengeaunce. Such opinions are taught, and be obſerued from age to age. Ye ſhall ſée them inſtructe and teache their children being a thrée or foure yeares of age, to handle a Bowe and an Arrowe to learne to ſhoote: alſo they exhorte them to manlineſſe, to take vengeaunce of their enimies, and not to pardon any, whome ſo euer it be. Moreouer, when they are priſoners one to another, thinke not that they require to be redeemed by any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition what ſo euer it be, for they hope no other thing than very death, eſtéeming it an honoure and glory vnto them. And therefore they can very well mocke vs, that deliuer our enimies that we haue in our power, for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or ſuche like things, the which they ſay, is vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to a man of warre. As for us ſay they, we vſe no ſuch things. Vpon a time it chaunced that a <hi>Portingall</hi> being priſoner to theſe wilde men, thought by faire words to haue ſaued his life, ſo he began to preache to them by faire woordes as gentle and as lowly as might be. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe his flattering woords could not preuaile,<note place="margin">A hiſtory of a Portingall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing priſoner to the wildemen.</note> but he to whome he was priſoner, ſhotte him to death with his arrowes: Goe thy wayes ſaide he, thou haſte not merited to die honourably as others, neither yet among companie.</p>
            <p>On a time there was brought a yonge male childe of theſe wilde men of <hi>America,</hi> of the Countrey and lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of thoſe whome they name <hi>Tabiares,</hi> which are mortall enimies to thoſe wilde men, with whome the Frenche men are in concorde and peace by certain Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntes of <hi>Normandie,</hi> the which was afterwarde baptiſed, noriſhed and maried at <hi>Roan,</hi> liuing like a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian man. But he was minded to returne into his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey with vs, being of the age of two and twenty yeares.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:11759:73"/>
It came to paſſe that being there, he was diſcouered of his auncient enimies, by the meanes of certaine Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who incontinently as madde Dogs furious and woodde, ran to our ſhippes which were at that time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of men, where as by caſuall chaunce they found him, ſo they fell vpon him, and rent him in pieces, not touching any other of the company there preſent, who by the prouidence of God, enduring this pitifull death, exhorted them in the Chriſtian faith, ſo this poore man died among their handes a good Chriſtian man, whome they did not eate, as they did other of their enimies. What opinion of vengeaunce is more contrary to our lawe? Notwithſtanding, there is found among vs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſo obſtinate that they will reuenge as well as the wilde men. Furthermore, this is among them, if one ſmite an other, let him be aſſured to receiue as muche a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and rather more, for they will not leaue it vnpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: it is a faire ſight to ſée them quarrell and ſight together.

Wée fynde in ſome hiſtories of certaine people, lyuing in maner as theſe wilde men do in their mariages. <hi>Seneca</hi> in one of his Epiſtles, and <hi>Strabo</hi> in hys Coſmographie writeth,<note place="margin">The auncient cuſtome of the Lydians Arme<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nians, and the inhabitants of Cypris.</note> that the <hi>Lydians</hi> and <hi>Armenians</hi> hadde a cuſtome to ſende their virgins and maidens to the ſea borders, there in offering them ſelues to all commers to get them huſbandes, or elſe their dowries. As muche ſayeth <hi>Iuſtinus,</hi> dyd the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins of <hi>Cypris,</hi> for to get their dowries and mariages, which when they were quit and well iuſtified, offered to the Goddeſſe <hi>Venus,</hi> a preſent or offeryng. We may fynde at this day amongſt vs, that making great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of vertue and religion would doe the lyke, and rather more, without offering preſente or candle, the which I knowe of a truthe. As touching the conſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie in Mariage, Saincte <hi>Hierome</hi> writeth, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> were woonte to marrie the brethren wyth the ſyſters, and not the Auntes wyth the nephewes, the whych is contrary to the order of the <hi>Americanes.</hi> Lykewiſe in oure countrey a woman of late hadde li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to marrie hir ſelfe to fiue huſbandes, and not contraried. Beſide this we ſée the <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> tooke many wiues: I ſpeake it not for that it is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and allowable, but for that we chriſtians ſhould auoyde ſuch things. To conclude, our wylde men vſe the maner and order that wée haue ſhewed, ſo that a mayden is ſeldome maried, hauing hir virginitie, but beyng once maryed, they dare doe no faulte: for their
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:11759:75"/>
huſbandes doe looke ſtraightly to them, hauing a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of Iealouſie: ſhée may leaue hir huſbande if that ſhe be euill intreated, the whiche oftentimes commeth to paſſe, as we reade of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> that dydde the lyke before they had any lawes. In this pluralitie of women that they vſe, as wée haue ſayde,<note place="margin">The wyld me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue many wiues.</note> there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes one aboue the others, moſte fauoured, whiche is not ſubiect to ſo much trauell as the others. All the children that procéede by the mariage of theſe wiues, are reputed legittimate, ſaying, that the firſt Author of generation, is the father and not the mother, which is the cauſe that many tymes they kill the male chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of their enimies being priſoners, bicauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſuch children in time to come might be their enimies.</p>

In other things they are very curious to knowe the trées and fruites, they will not taſt of any fruite that is periſht, vnleſſe it be thorough ripe: The fruite of which they commonly eate in their ſickneſſes is named <hi>Naua,</hi>

            <p>GOing on a day vnto a village diſtant from the place whereas was our remayning a ten leagues, being in my company fiue wilde men, and a Chriſtian to interpret, I was myndefull to beholde on all ſides the ttées, of the which there were diuers ſortes, among the which I ſtayed to beholde that of the which I minde to ſpeake,<note place="margin">The deſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a tree na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Vhebeha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> the which to ſée to, woulde be iudged to be an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall woorke, and not of nature.

In this Region betwene the Riuer of <hi>Platte,</hi> and this ſtraight, the inhabitaunts are very mightie, named in their language <hi>Pategones,</hi> Giants, bicauſe of their high ſtature, &amp; forme of bodies.

This Region is of lyke tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratneſſe as <hi>Canada</hi> and other countries néere to our <hi>Pole,</hi> and therefore the inhabitants are clothed with the ſkynne of a certaine beaſt named in their ſpeach <hi>Su,</hi> which is as much to ſay, as Water, for bicauſe (to my iudgement) that this beaſt for the moſt part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in the waters and flouds.

other meanes to winne the fauor of the wild men, for to get ſome vittails, and ſpace to reſte their weary bones. So that ſome of the wild men being in their little boates made of the barcke of trées, being allured with theſe fayr ſhewes, did ieopard themſelues to approch, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome doubt, hauing neuer ſene Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> come ſo néere to their limites.

There reſteth nowe ſomewhat to ſpeake in our returne, of that which before we left out, paſſing therefore about the firſte day of Aprill with a fauourable winde kéeping our right courſe with ſayle ſpread right to the North,<note place="margin">How the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor departed from Thequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall.</note> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe we were moleſted with one ill commoditie, the which was, that daye and night it ceaſed not to raine, the which notwithſtanding came well to paſſe for vs to drinke, conſidering our neceſſitie, for the ſpace of two monethes and a halfe, enduring thyrſt for that we colde get no freſh water.</p>

coſt vs our liues. Furthermore this water falling on a clothe woulde ſtayne it and leaue a ſpot that ſcant would be gotten out. Nowe therefore after we had paſſed the lyne, it was néedfull for our conduct, to beginne to counte our degrees, from thence vnto our <hi>Europe:</hi> as much muſte be done of them that goe thither, after that they are come vnder the ſayde-line. The Ancient Coſmographers, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured the earth the which we may alſo doe, by ſtades, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and féete, and not by degrées as we doe, as affirmeth <hi>Plinie, Strabo</hi> and others, but <hi>Ptolome</hi> did ſince inuente degrées, for to meaſure bothe the Sea and the land, which before was not a lyke meaſured, and this is much more eaſy. It is then <hi>Ptolome</hi> that hath compaſſed the whole worlde by Degrées, as wel in length as in bredth, finding 360. Leagues, and in euery degrée .17. Leagues &amp; a half, as I vnderſtande of our Pilots, that are expert in Naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. So that the whole world hauing the Firmament and the Elementes in his conference, contayneth .360. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées equally by twelue ſignes, whereof euery one hath 30.<note place="margin">The diuiſion of a degree.</note> degrées, for .12. tymes .30. make iuſt .360.

For the proportions of the firmament, may be parted in ſo many partes, as we haue ſayde. Then by the degrées we find the longitude, latitude and diſtance of places, the latitude from the line to our <hi>Pole,</hi> whereas there is .90. degrées, and ſo much beyonde,<note place="margin">How ye may know the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude longitude and diſtance of places.</note> the longitude is taken from the fortunate Ilands to the Eaſte. Wherefore I ſaye to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the Pilot that woulde ſayle, ought to conſider thre things, the firſte in what hight of degrées, he findeth himſelfe, and in what hight the place is that he will goe to, ſecondly the place where he findeth himſelfe, and the place whether he hopeth to goe, that is to know, what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance

and length there is from one coaſte to another. Thirdly to knowe what winde or windes wil ſerue for Nauigation, all the whiche he may knowe and ſée by his compaſſe and other Inſtrumentes of the Sea.

It is therefore to be noted, that vnder the lyne ten degrées on this ſide, and beyonde there is founde aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of flying fiſh, that flyeth hye in the ayre, being folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed of another fiſh that woulde deuoure him. So that by the quantitie of him that flyeth, ye may eaſily conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture the quantitie of the other lyuing by praye. Among the which the <hi>Dorade</hi> (of whom we haue before ſhewed) doeth folowe hym aboue all others, for that his fleſh is very delicate and tender: of the which alſo there are two kinds, the one is lyke a herring, the which is, that which is ſo chaſed of others, this fiſh hath foure wings, two great ones, lyke vnto the wings of a bat, and two other little ones néere to the tayle: the other is made lyke a Lampron, of the which kindes there are fewe found, but onely .15. degrées on this ſide, and beyonde the lyne, the which to my iudgement is the cauſe that thoſe that haue ſet out bookes of fiſhes,<note place="margin">Pirauena.</note> haue left them out beſide many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The <hi>Americans</hi> name this fiſh <hi>Pirauena</hi> he flieth lyke a Partrige, and the little one flyeth much better and higher than the other, and ſometymes they are ſo néere

chaſed and folowed, ſpecially by night, that many tymes they ſtrike againſte the ſhip ſayles by heapes, and there remayne. There is another fiſh, which is called by them <hi>Albacore,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Albacore a fiſh</note> much more greater than the Porpas, the which is alſo a deuourer of the flying fiſh as wel as the <hi>Dorade,</hi> and he is very good and excellent to eate aboue all other fiſhes in the ſea, as well of the Weaſt as of the Eaſte. He is vneaſy to be gotten, and therefore they make a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfet fiſh of white linnen, the which they make to ſpring aboue water, as doeth the flying fiſh, and by this meanes he is moſt commonly taken.</p>

The inhabitans at this daye, which before were cruel and vnhumaine, by ſucceſſion of time haue ſo well changed their maners and conditions, that in ſtead of barbarous and cruell, they are ciuill and gratious, in ſuch ſort that they haue left all theyr former naughtie and wicked doings, the which they were wont to vſe: as in killing one another, eating humayne fleſhe, to haue company with the firſt woman y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they met, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hauing regarde either to kindred or degrée, with other lyke vices and imperfections.

And to get them out they firſt take the oiſters out of the veſſell, and then they lette the water oute by a hole, vnder the which they lay a linnen cloth, leaſt that with the water the ſtones or pearles that mighte be, ſhould runne out. As touching the figure of theſe Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, they differ much from ours, as well in colour as in ſhell, hauing eche of them certain litle holes, which would be thought to haue ben made artificially, in the which holes are theſe pearles.

Some iudge it to be a narow Sea, like that of <hi>Magellan,</hi> by the which ye may enter from the Weſt ſea, to the South ſea. <hi>Gemafrigius,</hi> although he was expert in Mathematike, hath herein failed &amp; erred, for he maketh vs beleue, that this Riuer of which we ſpeake is a ſtraight, the which is named <hi>Septentrionall,</hi> and ſo hath he ſette it out in his <hi>Mappa Mundi.</hi> If that which he hath written be true, in vaine then haue the <hi>Portingals</hi> bene, and <hi>Spanyards</hi> to ſéeke a new ſtraight di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from this, aboue .3000. leagues, for to enter into the South ſea, to goe to the Ilands of <hi>Moluques,</hi> where as the ſpices are. This Countrey of New found land is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited with barbarous men, being clothed in wilde bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes ſkinnes, as are thoſe of <hi>Canada:</hi> this people is very frowarde and vntractable, as our men can well teſtifie that goe thither euery yeare a fiſhing. They that dwel by the Sea, liue with little kinde of other meate than fiſhe, which they take in the ſea, wherof they take a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,<note place="margin">Oyle of the fat of fiſhe.</note> &amp; chiefly ſea Wolues, of which they eate the fleſh, which is very good. With the fat of this fiſh, they make a certaine Oyle, that after it is come to his perfection, hath a redde colour, which they drink at their tables as we do wine or béere. Of the ſkin of this fiſh which is ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g and thick, as if it were of ſome wild beaſts, they make clokes &amp; garments according to their maner, which is a meruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thing, that in a element ſo moiſt as that is, which is moiſt of it ſelf, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be noriſhed a beaſt or fiſh, that hath the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:11759:143"/>
ſkin hard and dry, as beaſts of the earth haue. Likewiſe they haue other fiſhes that haue hard ſkins, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas &amp; the Dog fiſh and others with ſtrong ſhels, as Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terels, Oyſters, Muſcles, &amp; ſuche like. Beſides this, they haue great plenty of other good fiſh bothe ſmal and great, of which they liue daily. I maruell that the <hi>Iewes, Turkes,</hi>

In thoſe parts there is alſo found Whales, (I meane in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hie ſea, for ſuch fiſh neuer cometh toward the ſhore) to liue with ſuch little fiſh. Notwithſtanding,<note place="margin">With what fiſh the Whale li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth.</note> the fiſh that the Whale doth moſt commonly eate, is no greater than a Carpe, a thing almoſt vncredible conſidering hir greatneſſe, the reaſon therof as ſome ſay, is for bicauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the whale hath but a litle throte in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greatneſſe of his body, &amp; therfore he cannot deuour a greater fiſh. The which is a wonderfull ſecrete, &amp; vnknowne as well to our elders as to vs, although that they haue treated of fiſhes, the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male hath but one yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g one at a time, which ſhe bringeth forth as a beaſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth without egge, &amp; that which is more wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful, ſhe giueth ſuck to hir yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g one after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe hath brought it forth.

In the ſame place wheras the Whale frequenteth,<note place="margin">A fiſhe that is perpetuall eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to the Whale.</note> there is found moſte commonly a fiſhe that is his mortall eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, ſo that if ſhe méete the Whale, ſhe will pricke the whale vnder the belly, which is the ſofteſt and tendereſt place, with hir tong that cutteth like a Barbars raſer, ſo that he being thus hurt, cannot ſaue himſelf, but that he dieth as the inhabitants of New found land do ſhew, and the common fiſher men.

As touching theſe Beares, although that we haue treated thereof at large in our <hi>Coſmographie</hi> of <hi>Leuant,</hi> yet notwithſtanding we will ſpeake ſomewhat thereof by the way, howe the inhabitants of the Countrey take

them, being afflicted with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> importunitie that they make them. Therfore they make certaine pittes in the ground very déepe, néere to trees and rockes, and then they couer them finely with leaues and braunches, and this they vſe where as are hiues or multitude of Hony Bées, which theſe Beares ſéeke and follow with all diligence, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are very deſirous, not only ſo much for to fil them therewith, but for to heale their eyes, the whiche they haue naturally blemiſhed and all their braine: alſo that being ſtinged with theſe Hony Bées, there falleth from them a bloud, ſpecially from the head, wherby their paine is eaſed, ſo that they are comforted thereby. There is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſéene a kinde of great beaſtes like to Buffles, hauing hornes very great, their ſkin is grayiſhe, of which they make garments, and of many other beaſts, whoſe ſkins are very riche.

As for birds, there are not found ſuche quantitie as in <hi>America,</hi> or at <hi>Perou,</hi> nor yet ſo faire.

Alſo in this Countrey there is many faire riuers, and a multitude of good fiſhe. This people prepareth for nothing, but that which is néedefull to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine nature, ſo that they are not curious in meates, for they goe not to ſéeke any thing in farre Countreys, and yet their nouriſhment is healthſome, and therefore they know not what ſickneſſe meanes, but they liue in peace and in continuall health, ſo that they haue no occaſion

to conceiue enuie one againſt an other, bicauſe of their goods and patrimonie: for they are in a maner all equall in goodes and riches, being in one mutuall contentation and equalneſſe in pouerty.

The people that dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the ſea as I haue ſhewed liue with fiſh, and others that are farre from the ſea, are content with fruits of the earth that commeth forth, the moſt part without labour of mannes hands: and after this ſorte liued the people in the firſt age as <hi>Plinie</hi> witneſſeth:<note place="margin">
