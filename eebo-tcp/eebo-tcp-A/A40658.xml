            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E may observe, that <hi>David</hi> is
much pleased with the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor
in frequent comparing
himselfe to a Bird, and that
of severall sorts: first, to an
<hi>Eagle, Psal. 103. 5. Thy youth is renewed
like the Eagles:</hi> Sometimes to an <hi>Owle,</hi>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:55742:6"/>
Psal. 102. 6. <hi>I am like an Owle in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart:</hi>
Sometimes to a <hi>Pelican,</hi> in the same
Verse, <hi>Like a Pelican in the Wildernesse:</hi>
Sometimes to a <hi>Sparrow, Psal. 102. 7. I
watch, and am as a Sparrow:</hi> Sometimes
to a <hi>Partridge, as when one doth hunt a
Partridge.</hi> I cannot say, that he doth
compare himselfe to a <hi>Dove,</hi> but he would
compare himselfe, <hi>Psal. 55. 6. Oh that I
had the wings of a Dove, for then I would
flee away, and be at rest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some will say, How is it possible, that
Birds of so <hi>different a feather</hi> should all so
flye together, as to meet in the Character
of <hi>David?</hi> To whom we answer, That
no two men can more differ one from
another, then the same servant of God at
severall times differeth from himselfe.
<hi>David</hi> in Prosperitie, when commanding,
was like an <hi>Eagle;</hi> in Adversitie, when

when retired, like a <hi>Pelican;</hi> in Solitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

too much companie [of <hi>Saul]</hi> like a
<hi>Partridge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This generall Metaphor of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Bird,</hi> which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55742:6"/>
                     <hi>David</hi> so often used on himselfe, his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
in the first Verse of this Psalme used
on him, though not particularizing the
kinde thereof: <hi>Flee as a Bird to your
Mountaine;</hi> that is, <hi>Speedily betake thy
selfe to thy God, in whom thou hopest for suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
and securitie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> Seeing this counsell was both
<hi>good in it selfe,</hi> and <hi>good at this time,</hi> why
doth <hi>David</hi> seem so angry and displeased
thereat? Those his words, <hi>Why say you
to my soule, Flee as a Bird to your Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi>
import some passion, at leastwise a
disgust of the advice.</p>
                  <p>It is answered, <hi>David</hi> was not offended
with the counsell, but with the manner
of the propounding thereof. His enemies
did it <hi>Ironically,</hi> in a gibing jeering way,
as if his flying thither were to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and he unlikely to finde there the
safetie he sought for. How-ever, <hi>David</hi>
was not hereby put out of conceit with
the counsell, beginning this Psalme with
this his firme resolution, <hi>In the Lord put I
my trust, how say ye then to my soule, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Learne we from hence, when men give
us good counsell in a jeering way, let us
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55742:7"/>
take the counsell, and practise it, and
leave them the jeere, to be punished
for it.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, Corporall Cordials may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venomed,
by being wrapt up in poysoned
Papers; not so good Spirituall Advice,
where the good matter receives no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
from the ill manner of the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie
thereof. Thus when the chiefe
Priests mocked our Saviour, <hi>Math. 27. 43.
He trusted in God, let him deliver him now
if he will have him.</hi> Christ trusted in God
never a whit the lesse for the fleere and
flout which their prophanenesse was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to bestow upon him, Otherwise, if
mens mocks should make us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value
good counsell, we might in this Age
be mocked out of <hi>our God,</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> and
<hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Heaven;</hi> the Apostle <hi>Iude,

times there should be mockers, walking after
their owne lusts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next Verse presents an unequall
Combat betwixt <hi>armed Power, advantaged

That the Righteous are wanting to
themselves, and by their owne <hi>easinesse</hi>
and <hi>unactivitie,</hi> (not daring and doing so
much as they might and ought) betray
themselves to that bad condition. In
whose defence <hi>David</hi> shewes, that if God
in his wise will and pleasure seeth it fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
for Reasons best known to himselfe,
to suffer Religion to be reduced to termes
of extremitie, it is not placed in the power
of the best man alive to remedie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
the same. <hi>If the Foundations be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,

                  <p>First, A sad Case supposed, <hi>If the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, A sad Question propounded,
<hi>What can the Righteous doe?</hi>

the point of re-establishing the destroyed
Foundation.</p>
                  <p>Note by the way, that in Scripture,
when a Question is propounded, and let
fall againe, without any Answer returned
thereunto, that it generally amounts to a
Negative. Thus saith <hi>Thamar, 2 Sam. 13.
13. And I, whither shall I cause my shame
to goe?</hi> that is, <hi>Nowhither:</hi> neither Citie,
Court, or Countrey, will afford me any

                  <p>Before we goe any further, it will be
worth our paines to enquire into the time
and occasion of this Psalme. But here we
are left at a losse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and cannot of our selves
recover any certaintie, nor meet with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to direct us. The Title of the Psalme
is speechlesse, as to the date and occasion
thereof: Nor maketh it, with <hi>Zachariah,</hi>
any signes when, or why composed; onely
we may be confident, <hi>David</hi> made it when
the <hi>Church</hi> was in some great affliction,
and reduced to a dolefull condition.</p>
                  <p>For (under favour) I conceive, that the
destroyed Foundations mentioned in the
Text, relate not so properly to the <hi>Civill
State</hi> as to the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>Israel.</hi> Had this
destruction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> been principally of <hi>Temporall
concernment, David</hi> would have said,
What can the <hi>valiant Champion,</hi> or what

it probably intimates, that the deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
complained of, concerned chiefely
the Cause of the <hi>Church, Religion,</hi> and
<hi>Religious persons</hi> therein.</p>
                  <p>If one may offer to make a modest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,
it is not improbable this Psalme
might be composed on the <hi>sad murther</hi> of

<hi>Doeg</hi> the <hi>Edomite</hi> by command
from <hi>Saul, slew in one day fourescore and
five persons which wore a Linnen Ephod.</hi>
I am not so <hi>carnall,</hi> as to build the <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Church</hi> of the <hi>Iewes</hi> on the materiall
walls of the Priests Citie at <hi>Nob,</hi> (which
then by <hi>Doeg</hi> was <hi>smitten with the edge of
the sword)</hi> but this is most true, that <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
must preserve the people,</hi> and <hi>Mal. 2. 7.
The Priests lips shall preserve knowledge:</hi>
and then it is easie to conclude, what an
Earth-quake this Massacre might make in
the <hi>Foundations</hi> of <hi>Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is some difference in the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations,
even as much as is betwixt the

                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:55742:9"/>We embrace the latter, as confident
that those Worthy Translators were led
thereunto by sufficient Reasons from the
Originall, seeing <hi>Sextinus Amama,</hi> a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                     <p>It is the onely word of Comfort in the

And yet this Comfort, which is but a

                     <p>First, Impossible Suppositions produce
impossible Consequences. <hi>As is the Mother
so is the Daughter.</hi> Therefore surely Gods

but what either had, did, or might come
to passe.</p>

                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:55742:10"/>Secondly, the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word is not the

Well, it is good to know the worst of

imaginations:</hi> They may not onely vainly
boast, but also verily beleeve, that they
have <hi>destroyed</hi> the <hi>Foundations.</hi> Apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to this purpose, is that high <hi>Rant</hi> of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, <hi>Luke 2. 1. And it
came to passe in those dayes, that there went

not a Figure, but the ordinarie language
of Pride: because indeed <hi>Augustus</hi> had
very much, he proclaimeth himselfe to

                     <p>Thus no doubt <hi>Herod, Math.</hi> 2. was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
he had killed all the Infants in and

the <hi>Iewish King</hi> amongst the rest,
when he safely had escaped his furie.</p>
                     <p>Thus the persecuting Emperours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
themselves to have destroyed all
the <hi>Bibles</hi> in the world, whereof so many
were surrendred up unto them by the
hands of the <hi>Traditores</hi> (in plaine <hi>English

                        </gap>ssed be God, a <hi>Remnant</hi> was left, from
which the Christians at this day have
plentifully recruited themselves. Thus
Tyrants please themselves, in reporting
that they have <hi>destroyed all the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of <hi>Religion,</hi> when haply unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
they have partly ruinated some of
them.</p>
                     <p>In such a case, no wonder if <hi>Fame</hi> (the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55742:15"/>
                        <hi>Parasite-Generall</hi> of Gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

dimensions. <hi>Absalom</hi> is said to have
killed all the Kings sonnes, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 30.
when indeed onely <hi>Amnon</hi> was slaine.
Thus <hi>Flatterie</hi> will make the most of <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
atchievements,</hi> and by a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> of
the whole for a part, all the <hi>Foundations</hi>
shall be reported to be <hi>destroyed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Foundations</hi> may be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed</hi>
as to all outward <hi>visible illustrious
apparition.</hi> The Church in Persecution is
like unto a Ship in a Tempest; downe
goe all their Masts, yea, sometimes for the
more speed, they are forced to cut them
downe: not a piece of Canvas to play
with the Windes, no <hi>Sayles</hi> to be seene;
they lye <hi>close notted</hi> to the very <hi>Keele,</hi>
that the <hi>Tempest</hi> may have the lesse power
upon them: though when the <hi>Storme</hi> is
over, they can <hi>hoise</hi> up their <hi>Sayles</hi> as high,
and spread their Canvas as broad as ever
before. So the Church in time of Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<hi>feared,</hi> but especially <hi>felt,</hi> loseth all
<hi>gaynesse</hi> and <hi>gallantrie</hi> which may attract
and allure the eyes of beholders, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenteth
it selfe with its owne secrecie. In

and certaine hope that God will give her
a <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>happie Day,</hi> when with joy she
shall weare her best Garments.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, they may be <hi>destroyed</hi> in the
<hi>jealous apprehensions</hi> of the best Saints
and servants of God, especially in their
Melancholy Fits: I will instance in no
Punie, but in a Starre of the first magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and greatest eminencie, even <hi>Elijah</hi>
himselfe complaining, 1 <hi>Kings 19. 10. And
I, even I onely am left, and they seeke my
life, to take it away.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Where had <hi>Elijah</hi> lived? Did his <hi>intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence</hi>
or <hi>intellectuals</hi> deceive him, to be
thus mistaken? His <hi>intelligence!</hi> So con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
with Gods servants, as to know
none of them, but meerely to conceive,
that the whole <hi>species</hi> of Gods people was
conserved onely in his <hi>individuall</hi> selfe?
Surely, the fault was rather in his <hi>intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuals,</hi>
and that onely for the present his
<hi>passion</hi> at this time <hi>imposed</hi> on his <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and betrayed him to mistake. The
clearest apprehension may lose its way, in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55742:16"/>
the midst of excessive Joy, Love, Griefe,
Feare, both the last meeting in <hi>Elijah.</hi> Stil
God had seven thousand hearts belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him, whose knees never bowed
unto <hi>Baal:</hi> probably some of them might
be knowne to <hi>Elijah,</hi> but for the present
forgotten by him.</p>
                     <p>Whence we observe, first, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hat no <hi>under-Officer</hi>
(such as <hi>Elijah</hi> was) in the <hi>Armie</hi> of

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, as <hi>concealed Lands</hi> belonged
anciently to the King, so many a close, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
and unsuspected Christian (especially
in times of Persecution) belongs onely to
the God of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>But some will say, Why doth God
suffer the <hi>Foundations</hi> to come so neere
to be <hi>destroyed?</hi> Is it not at the best some

knowne and communicated to men;
three whereof in humilitie and modestie

                           </gap>Graces;</hi> I count some
<hi>Summer-Graces</hi> in their hearts, namely
such, the principall use whereof is in the

as <hi>Patience, Contentmen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>, &amp;c.</hi> I confesse,
that <hi>Thankefulnesse</hi> is seasonable Summer
and Winter, <hi>Ephes. 5. 20 Giving of thanks
alwayes for all things:</hi> like <hi>Holly</hi> and <hi>Ivie,</hi>
greene all the yeare long, it is constantly
in the prime thereof. How-ever, that the

<hi>Patience may have her perfect worke,</hi> James
1. 4. no whit <hi>abortive</hi> in the <hi>time,</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective</hi>
in the <hi>members</hi> thereof, God in his
wisdome will permit that the <hi>Foundations</hi>
may be <hi>gradually destroyed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, God permitteth the enemies
of Religion to atchieve such a <hi>destruction,</hi>
that plumped up with their own successe,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55742:17"/>
they may at the last be the <hi>fuller</hi> Sacrifice
to his Justice. For as he feedeth himselfe
dayly on the punishment of leane and
common Offenders, so his Justice some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>taketh state</hi> to feast it selfe as King
<hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 Kings 4. 23. <hi>on faited Fowle,</hi> on
men <hi>larded</hi> with <hi>thriving</hi> and <hi>batling</hi> in
their owne villanies, <hi>Psal. 119. 70. Their
heart is as fat as grease. Abel</hi> offered to
God, <hi>Gen. 4. 4. of the fat of his Flock.</hi> God
in like manner sometimes is delighted to
offer to himselfe the <hi>fattest</hi> Malefactors,
fed in the Stall of succeeding wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, God permitteth the <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
to be <hi>destroyed,</hi> because he knowes
he can <hi>un-destroy</hi> them; I meane re-build
them in what minute and moment he
pleaseth himself. It is no Policie for men
to suffer growing evils to encrease, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
suddenly they may start past helpe
and hope. Thus it is not good to dally
with danger, and delay with Diseases;
<hi>Venienti occurrite morbo;</hi> it is no wisdome
for men to suffer a House to run long to
ruine, lest it prove past repaire. But <hi>nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
tempus occurrit Deo,</hi> all times are
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55742:18"/>
equally easie for God to recover his
Right, and sometimes are more for his
Honour, namely, when he interposeth
his Power to his greater Honour and
Glory, in that seasonable minute and
moment, when men say it is <hi>past hope,</hi>
and give up all for <hi>desperate,</hi> yea, for <hi>lost</hi>
and <hi>destroyed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Come we now to that Point which we
conceive both pertinent to the Text, and
profitable for our Times, namely, to give

if God should for their sinnes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
them to live in a Time and Place
wherein the <hi>Foundations</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> (so

wondring to see him make no Warlike
Provision against the time appointed,
presumed at last to enquire of him the
reason of so great neglect.</p>
                     <p>The Bishop returned this Answer, That
he never intended any Martiall resistance,
counting it madnesse to fight against him,
where's no human probability to conquer;
Mustering of men in this case, was but
casting away so many into the Gaghs of
Death. This he was resolved on, to Pray,
to Preach, to visit the Churches in his
Dioces, leaving the event of all to God,
to defend the innocencie in his Cause.</p>
                     <p>Politicians, I know, will censure his
Designe as silly and weake, which others
will behold under a better notion of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and pious: sure I am, it is most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyable
to our purpose. When the godly
sadly behold the <hi>Foundations</hi> of <hi>Religion
destroyed,</hi> (so farre forth as they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyable)
they make no provision of
themselves to set them up againe, as suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
assured it is past their <hi>power,</hi> above
their <hi>strength,</hi> it <hi>will cost more, so that they
must let it alone for ever.</hi> Onely this they
doe, they will faithfully, and fervently,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55742:26"/>
and constantly pray to God, (whose Glory
is concerned in the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>First, the <hi>Booke of Life,</hi> whereof fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent

Whose Names are in the Booke of Life.</hi> This

persons, in whose salvation God from all

glorified, and for whom Christ merited
<hi>Faith, Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Perseverance,</hi> that
they should <hi>repent, beleeve,</hi> and be finally
<hi>saved.</hi>
                  </p>

Hence that frequent expression in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Psalme 51. 9. And blot out all mine

He that beleeveth, and is baptized, shall be

when <hi>the Bookes are opened.</hi> For, grant
that in some particular actions they may
be said morally to supererogate, even
over-doing in goodnesse what was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
at their hands, yet in other things
they were defe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tive, and fell short of the
just measure of Gods Commands, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the <hi>Morall Light</hi> manifested unto
them. That servant doth not his Masters

the doores in the house, doth latch, bolt,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55742:35"/>
lock, barre, and barricado up one or two
of them, leaving the rest standing open.
So, though some of these <hi>Heathens</hi> may
seeme in some particular acts to surpasse
themselves, and to be better then the
Law enjoyneth them, yet in other things
they were deficient, and justly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
for the same, seeing Gods finall
Sentence shall be passed, not according to
some eminent performance of persons,
but according to the constant drift, scope,
purpose, and tenour of their conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Besides, some grand Vices (though not
so visible to humane eyes) infected the
transcendiaries of their highest atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rres</hi> by which they
steered all their actions. Had <hi>Pride</hi> been
the Weapon whereat a <hi>Duel</hi> had been
fought betwixt <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Diogenes,</hi>
probably the Conqueror of the World
had been worsted by a poore Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> set a <hi>Tincture</hi> and
<hi>Dye</hi> on all their Actions. Who hath more
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55742:35"/>
                     <hi>golden Sentences</hi> then <hi>Seneca</hi> against the

none more <hi>Rich,</hi> none more <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous</hi>
then he; as if out of Designe he had
perswaded others to cast away their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
that he himselfe might come and

                  <p>Thus these <hi>Heathens,</hi> for ought we can

which will plainely appeare on the

                  <p>Secondly, that even the worst of men
living under the <hi>Light</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> have
at one time or another their heads filled
with good notions, and their hearts with
good motions; Grace illuminating, woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and courting them, as I may say, to
lay hold on God in his Promises: on the
truth whereof, their owne Consciences
will be deposed; and so this will appeare
<hi>when the Bookes are opened.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that God standeth readie, on

<hi>illuminating Grace,</hi> (though not for
the merit of mans performances, but for
his owne meere mercie and promise sake)
to Crowne their Endeavours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the

whereas he before-hand had taken order

                        </gap>ous Error,</hi> lurking in the brests of
most men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We are generally jealous, that
God at the <hi>Last Day</hi> will not come off

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55742:39"/>
desire: We suspect, that his <hi>Name</hi> will

appeare so cleare as we both desire and
expect, if he should <hi>condemne</hi> such and
such persons whom we in our narrow ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
conceive <hi>uncondemnable,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the proportion of Justice, as
we doe measure it. But know, that
this suspition hath a double mischiefe
therein.</p>
                  <p>First, The owners thereof are <hi>jealous
over God with an ungodly jealousie,</hi> fearing
where no feare is; and it proceedeth from
a Principle of <hi>Atheisme,</hi> seeing it springeth
from the same Root, to denie a God, and
doubt, that God will appeare just in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesting
his owne Proceedings.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This takes off mens thoughts,
to take care for themselves, what they
shall plead in their owne behalfe, and how
they shall manage their owne Defence at
the <hi>Last Day,</hi> and maketh them employed
where they ought not, troubling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
about that wherein they are not
concerned. If it be a hainous offence, and
punishable by the Lawes of man, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.

                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:55742:40"/>
how great is the offence, to be busie
in the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of the God of Heaven?
Let us leave it to him to act his own part;

well at the <hi>Barre,</hi> as God doth at the

                           <p>From whence the Observation is this;
<hi>We ought to be Hospitall and courteous to

severall places of Scripture enjoyneth it,
<hi>Exod. 23. 9. Levit.</hi> 19. 33. 2ly. Because
God apprehendeth all courtesie done to
a stranger as bestowed on himselfe; <hi>He
that receiveth you, receiveth me, &amp;c. I was
a stranger and ye harboured me,</hi> Mat. 25.
And then if we entertain strangers, it may
be said of us not onely as it is of <hi>Lot</hi> and
<hi>Abraham,</hi> Heb. 13. 2. <hi>That we entertained

be we that now relieve strangers, hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
our selves being strangers may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved

                           <p>That all offices of kindnesses and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesies
ought to be betwixt the mother in
law and the daughter in law, I meane her

world, and ye shall commonly finde enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
betwixt them, as saith <hi>Terence in Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sera;

                                 </gap>s animo
socrus oderunt nurus:</hi> And their fallings
out chiefely proceed from these two
causes:</p>
                           <p>First, they contend which should have
the greatest right &amp; interest in the Man,
who is Sonne to the one, Husband to the
other. <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> contested (2 <hi>Sam.</hi>
19. 43.) which should have most part in
King <hi>David;</hi> the former claiming it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was bone of their bone; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
pleaded they had eleven parts in him,
to <hi>Iudahs</hi> single share. Thus mother in
lawes and daughter in lawes use to fall
out; the mother, because her sonne is flesh
of her flesh, and bone of her bone, pleades
it is right, that he should side and second
with her; the daughter in law, because he
is her Husband, and therefore one flesh
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55742:70"/>
challengeth that he should rather take her
part: so betwixt them they fill the Family
with all discord.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, they fall out about the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
of the matters in the Household,
after whose mind they should be ordered:
but as S. <hi>Iames</hi> said in another case, <hi>Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
these things ought not to be so;</hi> both
these brawles may be easily ended. The
first may be taken up by the wisdome and
discretion of the sonne in law, who ought
so indifferently to poyse his affections be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them both, with such dutifulnesse
and respect to the one, such love and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to the other, that neither may have
just cause to complaine. And the second
controversie may thus be decided: If the
mother hath the state still in her hands,
good reason it is she should rule the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
and that the daughter in law should
wait till her mother in lawes naturall
death hath paved the succession to the
governing of the Family: but if the old
woman hath resigned her estate, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
her selfe to an yearely pension, then
ought she not to intermeddle with those
matters, from which she had willingly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questred
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55742:71"/>
her selfe. Were this observed,
there would not so many daughters in
law rejoyce, when the day of mourning
for their mother in law is come; some
whereof say as the wicked said of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
O, when will she die, and her name
perish?</hi>

                           <p>Why <hi>Naomi,</hi> Why didst thou quench
the zeale of thy daughters, which proffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

your God have pleasure in you: true it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ye have a Mother in <hi>Moab,</hi> but what of

for your Maker: care not for her that

spiritually, let them bury such as die na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally,

the part, done the duty of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;

them on the way, thou hadst travelled
with them till God had been formed in

whereas now thou art in a manner acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary

                           <head>Defence.</head>
                           <p>To this accusation <hi>Naomi</hi> might justly
answer; It is my hearts desire and prayer
go God, that I may be an instrument of my
Daughters in laws conversion; but the
wisdome of the Serpent, as well as the
innocency of the Dove is to be used in
all our actions, least we draw needlesse
danger upon our selves. True it is, my
Daughters in law proffer to go with me,
but here is the question; whether this is
done out of courtesie and complement,
or out of singlenesse and sinceritye. Now
should they through my perswasions, go
into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and there live
in want and penury, they will be ready
to raile on me another day. We may
thank <hi>Naomi</hi> for all this, we had plentifull
provisions in our own Country, but she
must have us hither; she by her restlesse
importunitie must wring a constrained
consent from us to come into <hi>Canaan;</hi> all
these miseries are befallen upon us
through her default. Yea, I am affraid,
that finding want, that they again will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into their own Country to my shame,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55742:72"/>
the scandall of our Religion, and the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
punishment of their own souls. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
without their minds would I do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
that their going might not be as it
were of necessity, but willingly. To
which end I will put them to the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,
to see whether their forwardnesse
be faithfull or faigned, sound or seeming,
cordiall or counterfeit; I will weigh them
both in the ballance, hoping that neither
shall be found too light.</p>
                           <p>Upon these Grounds learned men have
acquitted <hi>Naomi</hi> from any fault in mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
this matter, she doing it onely with
an intent to trie them.</p>
                           <p>Whence we may observe, That <hi>Pagans</hi>
that proffer themselves to become Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,
are not without proof presently to
be received into the Church.</p>
                           <p>And here we may take occasion to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
a little, to shew how Christians
ought to behave themselves in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
of Infidels.</p>
                           <p>First, They must strive in their mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
conversing with them, to season them
with a good opinion of their honesty and
upright dealing, otherwise their Doctrine

                           <p>Secondly, Having possessed them with

                              </gap>s good esteem, they ought as occasion

of Christian Religion; and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with such as are plain and evident by
the light of nature, and so in due time to
proceed to matters of greater difficulty.</p>
                           <p>Lastly, They are to pray to God to
give his increase to their planting and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering:
for, as <hi>Athanasius</hi> saith, <hi>

                           <p>But as for the using of tortures and of
torments thereby to force them, we have
no such custome, nor as yet the Churches
of God: for though none come to Christ
but such as his Father draws by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence

not men to drive or drag any to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Scripture makes no mention of any such
middle place, wherein the soules of the
godly should be detained before they goe
into Heaven; and in matters of Faith,
every Christian may safely say, Except I
see in the Bible the print thereof, or can
feel it deduced out of it by undenyable
consequence, I will not believe it.</p>
                           <p>It is strange to see what impertinent
places are produced by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> to
prove praying for the dead; as <hi>Iames 5.
16. Confesse your faults one to another, and
pray one for another, that ye may be healed;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55742:77"/>
the effectuall fervent prayer of a righteous
man availeth much.</hi> Then he endevoureth
to prove, that the dead pray for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
from the Parable of <hi>Dives, Luke 16.
27. I pray thee therefore Father &amp;c.</hi> where
<hi>Dives</hi> was charitably sollicitous for the
good of his surviving <hi>Brethren:</hi> But let
the first place in S. <hi>Iames</hi> be perused by
impartiall Judgements, and it obligeth
mutually the dead Saints to confes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>e to
us, as well as we to them; which being
impossible, directeth us to confine the
words onely to reciprocall confessing and
praying to and for the living.</p>
                           <p>Some will say, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> having suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
proved <hi>Purgatorie</hi> before, (which
necessarily inferreth prayers for the dead)
he might be the briefer in that subject. It
is confessed, many arguments are alledged
by him to that intent, though to small
purpose; as <hi>Psalme 66. 22. We went through
fire and through water, but thou broughtest
us out into a wealthie place.</hi> We answer;
first, the living there speake <hi>de praeterito,</hi>
we went; not <hi>de futuro,</hi> we shall goe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
it was literally meant of the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
of <hi>Israel;</hi> they went through the fire,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55742:77"/>
when envassalled to worke in the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Brick-kills;</hi> and <hi>through water,</hi> when
miraculously they passed through the <hi>Red
Sea.</hi> Again, they went through <hi>fire,</hi> when
preserved from the stinging of the <hi>fierie,</hi>
they beheld the <hi>Brazen Serpent.</hi> Thirdly,
if from <hi>fire</hi> in this Text any can kindle a
<hi>Purgatorie,</hi> others will quench it from the
word <hi>water,</hi> seeing no <hi>Papists</hi> ever fancied
a <hi>watered Purgatorie.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>They urge the place, <hi>Matth. 5. 26. Thou
shalt by no meanes come out from thence till
thou hast payd the uttermost farthing;</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting,
say they, a possibilitie on satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to be freed thence, that is, from
<hi>hell fire.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Answer: <hi>Vntil</hi> there, is not taken <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatively,</hi>
but <hi>extensively;</hi> equivalent to
<hi>never,</hi> or <hi>not at all;</hi> paralleled to that
place, <hi>Psalme 57. 1. In the shadow of thy
wings will I make my refuge, untill these
calamities be over-past.</hi> What, would <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
depart from God, after his delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance?
Would he use him as Travellers
a Bush? come under it in a storme, and
leave it in fair weather? No surely, <hi>David</hi>
would trust in God untill that time, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55742:78"/>
at that time, and in that time, and after
that time, and at all times. Parallel also
to that place of <hi>Matthew 1. 25. And knew
her not till she had brought forth her first-borne
Sonne:</hi> it being the constant Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Antiquitie, according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of Faith, and embraced by the
<hi>Papists</hi> themselves, that Christs Mother
lived and died a spotlesse Virgin.</p>
                           <p>Much stresse he layeth on that passage
of the Apostle, 2 <hi>Corinth. 3. 15. He himselfe
shall be saved, yet so as by fire.</hi> This place,
saith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> is <hi>locus utilissimus &amp; dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficillimus,</hi>
most profitable and most hard.</p>
                           <p>We answer, first, in general; seeing by
the <hi>Iesuit's</hi> confession it is so hard a place,
it is utterly improbable, that <hi>Purgatorie</hi>
(being of so high concernment to every
soule as <hi>Papists</hi> would perswade us) can
be therein intended: For all matters ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
for men to know and beleeve,
wherein the safetie of every single soule
is interessed, (such as <hi>Purgatorie</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be) is by the confession of all
Divines expressed in plaine and pregnant
Texts of Scripture; for want whereof,
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> is faine to shrowd and shelter
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55742:78"/>
himselfe under the most obscure places,
alledging a Text most dark and difficult,
by his owne confession.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, that <hi>fire</hi> there meant by Saint
<hi>Paul,</hi> is affliction in this life. As for such
Fathers who expounded it <hi>de igne confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grationis,</hi>
of that <hi>fire</hi> which should burn
up all things at the end of the world; it
makes nothing for the patronizing of
<hi>Purgatorie,</hi> in the <hi>Popish</hi> notion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                           <p>Come we now to finde an <hi>Office,</hi> and
make an enquirie, how many things a
<hi>dying godly man</hi> leaves behind him in this
world: His <hi>Soule</hi> is sent before him; and
<hi>Revel. 14. 13. From henceforth blessed are
the dead that die in the Lord.</hi> He leaveth
behind him,</p>
                           <p>First, his <hi>Body;</hi> to which we must be

to whom we must be kinde, by <hi>Love</hi>
and <hi>Affection.</hi>

                           <p>I say, first, his <hi>Body;</hi> to which there is

that according to the qualitie and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
wherein he lived. We reade of King
<hi>Hezekiah, 2 Chron. 32. 33. They buried him
in the chiefest</hi> (in the <hi>Hebrew, in the highest)
Sepulchers of the sonnes of David.</hi> It must

                           <p>And <hi>Lamentation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                              </hi> Surely, of all the
<hi>godly</hi> that ever departed this Life, Gods
servants had the least cause to bewayl the
death of S. <hi>Steven:</hi> For first, whereas
there is a three-fold degree of certaintie
of salvation; first, that of <hi>Hope,</hi> which as
the least and lowest, scarce deserveth to
be styled Certaintie; secondly, that of
<hi>Evidence,</hi> whereby the person clearely in
his soule apprehendeth Gods favour;
thirdly, that of <hi>Vision,</hi> peculiar to this
<hi>Steven</hi> alone, antedating his happinesse
with his bodily eyes, being in Heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was in Heaven: so that as many
gates in his wounded body stood open to
let out his soule, he beheld alive the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
opened to receive it.</p>
                           <p>And yet we reade, <hi>Acts. 8. 2. And devout
men carryed Steven to his Buriall, and made
great Iamentation over him.</hi> Observe; it
was not said, <hi>they made great Iamentation
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55742:80"/>
for him,</hi> but <hi>over him;</hi> they knew him in a
happy condition: It was themselves they
bemoaned in his death, the sight of his
Corps sharpening their sorrow, that the
<hi>Infant-Church</hi> had lost one of her best

                           <p>Secondly, his <hi>Estate;</hi> to which we must
be kinde, by carefull and faithfull <hi>Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration.
Heb. 9. 17. For a Testament is of
force after men are dead. Gal. 3. 15. Though
it be but a mans Covenant,</hi> or Testament,
<hi>yet if it be confirmed, no man disanulleth or
addeth thereto.</hi> NO MAN? He must
either be lesse then man in knowledge, a
<hi>meere Beast;</hi> or more then man in malice,
a <hi>meere Devill.</hi> By <hi>Testament</hi> I understand
not onely the very words thereof, but also
what appeareth to be the <hi>Testator</hi> his
Will to the Conscience of the Executor.
How many in this kinde are cruell to the
dead? So that some of the Legacies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed
by them, have had a <hi>Thumbe</hi> or
a <hi>Toe,</hi> yea, some an <hi>Arme</hi> or <hi>a Legge</hi> cut
off from them. Many Legacies which
came <hi>sound</hi> forth from the <hi>Testator,</hi>
before they could get through the <hi>Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>
have beene more <hi>lame,</hi> and <hi>maimed,</hi>
                              <pb n="63" facs="tcp:55742:80"/>
then the Criples in the Hospitall, to whom
they have beene bequeathed.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, his <hi>Children,</hi> or (because <hi>Mah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
and <hi>Chilion</hi> had none of them) his
<hi>Kindred</hi> or <hi>Friends;</hi> to whom the living
must be kinde, with <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Affection.</hi>
Remember the Character of the good
Wife, <hi>Proverbs 31. 12. She will doe her
Husband good, and not evill, all the dayes of
her life.</hi> We have many <hi>Wives</hi> onely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively
<hi>good,</hi> pleasing and praysing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in this, that they doe their <hi>Husbands</hi>
no hurt. This will not doe the deed, they
must be positively profitable. Nor is it
said, <hi>all the dayes of his life,</hi> but <hi>all the
dayes of her life.</hi> What if he dieth, her
obligation to him is not <hi>cassated</hi> or <hi>nulled,</hi>
(as many <hi>Wives</hi> generally conceive) but
still continueth <hi>all the dayes of her life.</hi>
True it is, she is set free so farre, as she may
marry againe in a competent time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the least shadow of sinne; yet so, as
still obliged to doe good all her life time
to the <hi>Friends,</hi> to the <hi>Children</hi> (if any)
of her dead <hi>Husband;</hi> and he, if survi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
her, reciprocally engaged to doe the
like.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="64" facs="tcp:55742:81"/>Fourthly, the best men leave <hi>Faults</hi> and
<hi>Failings</hi> behind them; to these the living
must be kinde, by <hi>Silence</hi> and <hi>Suppression.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>First, of those of whom thou canst say
no good, say nothing.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, of those of whom thou canst
say some good, say no bad.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>David</hi> is a most excellent instance here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 24. Who could more, or
more justly have inveighed against <hi>Saul</hi>
then <hi>David? O ye Daughters of Israel, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
for the death of so great a Tyrant, who
killed Ahimelech the High Priest, and foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
more of Gods Priests, whose soules were
as cleare from Treason as the white Linnen
Ephod they wore were from spots: Twice I
had him at my mercy, once in the Cave, once
when asleepe; yet he (notwithstanding all
his faire promises to the contrarie) was the
more cruell to me for my kindnesse to him.</hi>
No such matter; <hi>David</hi> conceales what
was bad, remembreth what was good in
<hi>
                                 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                                 </gap>,</hi> at leastwise what would make his
memorie acceptable with the weaker
Sex; namely, his making of Gallantrie
fashionable amongst them: <hi>Ye Daughters
of Israel weepe over Saul, who clothed you
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55742:81"/>
in Scarlet, with other delights, who put

                           </p>
                           <p>Fifthly, <hi>Memorie</hi> of his <hi>Vertues:</hi> To
which three things are due, to make thee
kinde thereunto.</p>
                           <p>First, <hi>Congratulation.</hi> I will touch this
string but tenderly; not so much because
fearing mine owne fingers, (as if the Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
should be false I play thereon) but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
other mens eares as ill-disposed
with prejudice. It is no <hi>Poperie,</hi> nor Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
to prayse God for the happie
condition of his servants departed; the
ancient <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> the inspired <hi>Prophets,</hi>
the holy <hi>Apostles,</hi> the patient <hi>Martyrs,</hi> the
Religious <hi>Confessors.</hi> When the Tribe of
<hi>Ruben, Gad,</hi> and halfe <hi>Manasses,</hi> erected
the Altar ED at the pas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>age over <hi>Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi>
it startled all the rest of the Tribes,
as if under it they had hatched some su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
designe; whereas indeed, the
Altar was not intended for <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> but
was meerely an Altar of <hi>Memorial,</hi> to
evidence to posteritie, that these two
Tribes and an halfe (though divided from
the rest by the River of <hi>Iordan)</hi> were
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55742:82"/>
conjoyned with them in the worship of
the same God. In like manner, when
some Ministers thank God for the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of his servants, some people are so
weake, and some so wilfull, to condemne
such for passages of <hi>Poperie,</hi> as if supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
prayers were made for their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
whereas, indeed, such <hi>Congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
on the contrarie, speakes our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
on their present blisse and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and continueth the <hi>Church Militant</hi>

                           <p>Secondly, <hi>Commemoration</hi> is due to the
<hi>Memories</hi> of the deceased. Hence the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

custome of <hi>Funerall Orations</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in our moderne practice, both to
the honour of the dead, and profit of the
living.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, <hi>Imitation</hi> of their <hi>Vertues.</hi>
It hath been a great Question amongst
such who desire to expresse themselves
thankfull to their dead <hi>Ancestors,</hi> of what
<hi>Metall,</hi> or <hi>Matter</hi> to make their <hi>Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
so as they may be most lasting and
permanent. Wise men have generally
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55742:82"/>
decryed <hi>Silver</hi> and <hi>Brasse;</hi> not so much,
because too costly, (such may be the
worth and wealth of the <hi>Executors</hi> and
partie deceased) but too tempting to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge</hi>
to demolish them. <hi>Brasse</hi> is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
subject to the same mischiefe, and
<hi>Marble Touch</hi> and <hi>Alablaster,</hi> are generally
used for that purpose; but the <hi>Monument</hi>
lesse subject to Casualtie, is, to <hi>imitate</hi> the

                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>ues</hi> of our dead <hi>Friends:</hi> in other
<hi>Tombes</hi> the dead are preserved; in these,
they may be said to remaine alive.</p>
                           <p>When we see a Child very like to the
Father and Mother thereof, we use to say,
<hi>Thy Father will never be dead as long as

Yet by the way, I would advise such who

of Gods Children, that they sorrow more

in a common calamitie, then for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Example in <hi>Elias, 1 King.</hi> 17. 20.
Put then it goeth nearest to their heart,
when others are not onely afflicted with
them, but also for them, when they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are the principall Malefactors for

such, who being in Trouble, care not
though they pawne their dearest friends
in their stead, so be it they themselves may
escape. And it may also serve to comfort
those that are in distresse, when God onely
layeth his punishments on them alone,
and doth not involve others together
with them. Art thou afflicted with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie?

Comfort thy selfe, that though
thou beest poore, yet thou hast undone
none by Suretiship for thee. Art thou in

infectious, and that thou hast not derived
the contagion to others. Doth God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
thee for thy sinne with a personall

the weight of thine owne offence, and
that thou art not the <hi>Ionah,</hi> for whose pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

                           <p>Let not the <hi>smoaking Flax</hi> be dismay'd,
which in time may be a <hi>blazing flame;</hi> nor
the <hi>bruised Reed</hi> be discouraged, which
may prove a <hi>Brazen Pillar</hi> in the Temple
of God: That therefore thou mayest
finally persevere, observe these foure
Rules.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div type="part">
                           <head>1 Rule.</head>
                           <p>First, utterly renounce all sufficiencie
in thy selfe. Who but a mad man will

of his owne strength, that knowes that
<hi>Adams</hi> compleat Armour of Original
Integritie, was shot thorow in <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise.</hi>

                           <p>Secondly, place all thy confidence on
the undeserved mercie of God: Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
commeth neither from the East,
nor from the West, nor as yet from the
South; but God suffereth one to fall, and
holdeth up another. The Temple of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
had two Pillars; one called <hi>Iachin,</hi>
sounding in Hebrew, <hi>The Lord will stablish;</hi>
the other <hi>Booz,</hi> signified, <hi>In him is strength:</hi>
                              <pb n="85" facs="tcp:55742:92"/>
So every Christian (<hi>the Temple of the Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Ghost)</hi>
is principally holden up by these
two Pillars, Gods Power, and Will, to
support him. Wherefore in every di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse
let us crie out to God, as the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
did to our Saviour, in the midst
of a Tempest, <hi>Helpe Master, or else we

                           <p>Thirdly, use all those means which God
hath chalked out for the encrease of grace
in thee; as Prayer, Meditation, reverent

                           <p>Fourthly, alwayes preserve in thy selfe
an awfull feare, lest thou shouldst fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from God: Feare to fall, and Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to stand, are two Sisters; and though
<hi>Cain</hi> said, he was not his <hi>Brothers keeper,</hi>
sure I am, that this Feare doth watch and
guard her Sister Assurance: <hi>Tantus est gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus

They that have much of this Feare, have
much certaintie; they that have little,
little certaintie; they that have none,

have none at all. It is said in Building, that

When <hi>Rachel</hi> bare her first sonne, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.

For the Heathen supposing that the whole

                           <p>Yea but one may say, What if I finde in
the Scripture an action recorded, whose
doer is knowne to have beene a godly
and gracious man; may I not, without
any further doubt, or scruple, follow
the same?</p>
                        </div>

                           <p>For the better satisfying hereof, I will
ranke the actions of godly men, registred
in the Scriptures, into nine severall
rankes, and will shew how farre forth we
may safely proceed in the imitation of
them.</p>
                           <p>1. We fide some actions set downe
which are extraordinary, the doers where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
had peculiar strength and dispensation
from God to doe them. Thus <hi>Samson</hi>
                              <pb n="94" facs="tcp:55742:97"/>
slew himselfe and the <hi>Philistims</hi> in the
Temple of <hi>Dagon; Elias</hi> caused <hi>fire</hi> to
descend on the two Captaines, and their
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ifties; <hi>Elisha</hi> cursed the Children of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                                 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>hel.</hi>
Now these are recorded rather for
our instruction, then imitation: For when
the sonnes of <hi>Thunder</hi> would have been
the sonnes of <hi>Lightning,</hi> and have had <hi>sire
from Heaven</hi> to burne the <hi>Samaritans,</hi>
which refused to receive our Saviour, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the example of <hi>Elias</hi> Christ checked
their ill-tempered Zeale, and told them,
<hi>You know not of what spirit you are of.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>2. Some examples are set down which
are founded in the Ceremonial Law, as
the eating of the <hi>Paschall Lamb,</hi> the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcising
of their Children</hi> the eight daie:
Now the date of these did expire at the
death of Christ; the substance being come,
the shadows are fled, and therefore they
may in no wise still be observed.</p>
                           <p>3. Such examples as are founded in the
Judicial Law, which was onely calculated
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>or the elevation of the Jewish Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
as to put Men to death for Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie.
Now these examples tie us no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to imitate them, then they agree with
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55742:97"/>
the Moral Law, or with those Statutes by
which every particular Countrie is Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned.</p>
                           <p>4. Some there be founded in no Law
at all, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ut onely in an ancient custome by
God tolerated and connived at, as Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamie
in the <hi>Patriarks,</hi> Divorces in the

                              </gap>light occasion; from
these also we must in these daies abstaine,
as which were never liked or allowed
by God, though permitted in some
Persons, and Ages, for some speciall
reasons.</p>
                           <p>5. Doubtful examples which may so
be termed, because it is difficult to decide
whether the Actors of them therein did
offend or no; so that should a Jurie of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Writers be empannelled to passe their
verdict upon them, they would be puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
whether to condemn or acquit them,
and at length be forced to find it an <hi>Ig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramus,</hi>
as whether <hi>David</hi> did well to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
himselfe frantick, thereby to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
the crueltie of <hi>Achish</hi> King of <hi>Gath.</hi>
Now our most advised way herein, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
to abstain from the imitation of
them, because there is a deal of difficultie
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55742:98"/>
and danger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and our judgements may
easilie be deceived.</p>
                           <p>6. Mixt examples, which containe in
them a double action, the one good, the
other bad, both so closely couched toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that it is a very hard thing to sever
them: thus in the unjust Steward, there
was his wisdome to provide for himselfe,
and his wick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>dnesse to purloyne from his
Master: the first God did commend, we
may imitate; the latter he could not but
loath, we may not but shun. In the <hi>Israeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
Midwives,</hi> Exod. 1. there was <hi>fides
mentis &amp; fallacia mentientis:</hi> the faith of
their love, and the falsenesse of their ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
the first God rewarded, and we may
follow; the latter he could not but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
and we must detest. Behold here is
wisdome, and let the Man that hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
discreetly divide betwixt the
Drosse and the Gold, the Chaffe and the
Wheat in these mixt examples, that so
they may practice the one, eschew and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the other.</p>
                           <p>7. Those which be absolutely bad, that
no charitable Comment can be fastened
upon them, as the drunkenness of <hi>Noah,</hi>
                              <pb n="97" facs="tcp:55742:98"/>
the incest of <hi>Lot,</hi> the lying of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
the swearing of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> the adulterie of
<hi>David,</hi> the denial of <hi>Peter:</hi> Now God
forbid we should imitate these; farre be it
from us with King <hi>Ahaz,</hi> to take a pattern
from the Idolatrous Altar of <hi>Damascus:</hi>
the Holy Spirit hath not set these sinnes
down with an intent they should be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed;
but first to shew the frailtie of his
dearest Saints, when he leaves them to
themselves; as also to comfort us when
we fall into grievous sinnes, when we
see that as haynous offences of Gods
servants stand upon record in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                           <p>8. Actions which are only good as they
are qualified with such a circumstance, as
<hi>Davids</hi> eating of the <hi>Shew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>

necessitie. These we may follow, but then
we must have a speciall eye and care that
the same qualifying circumstance be in us,
for otherwise the deed will be impious
and damnable.</p>
                           <p>9. Examples absolutely good, as the

our power, God blessing us, to performe
that which we promise.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, that the occasion whereupon
we use it, be of moment and consequence,
not trifling and trivial.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, that we sweare by God alone,
and not by any Creature. Sweare then

neither by the Heaven, nor by the Earth,
nor by <hi>Ierusal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he onely is able to punish thee, if that thou
avouchest be false. Yet this doth no wayes

who make Oathes their language. Our

I sent my Sonne to die for thee, by

                           <p>Here also we may see, that it was a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of great Antiquitie in the World,
that Men and Women should have seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
names whereby they were called, and
that for these three Reasons.</p>
                           <p>1. That they might be differenced and
distinguished from others.</p>
                           <p>2. That they might be stirred up to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
the meanings and significations of
their names: wherefore let every <hi>Obadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>
strive to be a servant of God, each <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel</hi>
to be a gift of God, <hi>Onesimus</hi> to be
profitable, every <hi>Roger</hi> quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<hi>Robert</hi> famous for counsell, and <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
a help and defence to many; not like
<hi>Absalon,</hi> who was not a Father of Peace,
as his name doth import, but a sonne of
Sedition; and <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> not nursed by
God, as his name sounds, but puffed up
by the Devill, as it is 3 <hi>Iohn</hi> 9.</p>
                           <p>3. That they might be incited to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the vertues of those worthy persons,
who formerly have been bearers and ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of their names. Let all <hi>Abrahams</hi> be
faithfull, <hi>Isaac's</hi> quiet, <hi>Iacobs</hi> painfull, <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephs</hi>
                              <pb n="120" facs="tcp:55742:110"/>
chaste, every <hi>Lewis</hi> pious, <hi>Edward</hi>
confessor of the true faith, <hi>William</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror
over his own corruptions. Let them
also carefully avoid those sinnes for which
the bearers of the Names stand branded
to posteritie. Let every <hi>Ionah</hi> beware of
frowardnesse, <hi>Thomas</hi> of distrustfulnesse,
<hi>Martha</hi> of worldliness, <hi>Mary</hi> of wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
If there be two of our names, one
exceedingly good, the other notoriously
evill, let us decline the vices of the one,
and practise the vertues of the other.
Let every <hi>Iudas</hi> not follow <hi>Iudas Iscariot,</hi>
who betrayed our Saviour, but <hi>Iudas</hi> the
brother of <hi>Iames,</hi> the writer of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Epistle; each <hi>Demetrius,</hi> not follow
him in the acts who made silver shrines
for <hi>Diana,</hi> but <hi>Demetrius 3 Iohn,</hi> who
had a good report of all men. Every <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi>
not imitate <hi>Ignatius Loiola</hi> the lame
Father of blind obedience, but <hi>Ignatius</hi>
the worty Martyr in the <hi>Primitve Church.</hi>
And if it should chance through the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scretion
of Parents and God-fathers, that
a bad name should be imposed on any; oh
let not folly be with them, because <hi>Nabal</hi>
is their name; but in such a case, let them
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:55742:110"/>
strive to falsifie, disprove, and confute
their names; otherwise if they be good,
they must answer them.</p>
                           <p>In the dayes of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> there was
a Royall Ship called the <hi>Revenge,</hi> which
having maintained a long fight against a

Cleane contrarie is the practice of poore
people now-adayes, which oft times take
away things not onely without the
knowledge, but even against the will of
the owners. The Boy of the Priest,
I <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 16. when the Sacrifice was in
offering, used to come with a <hi>flesh-hooke
of three teeth,</hi> and used to cast it into the
fat of the Sacrifice, making that his Fee,
which so he fetcht out; if any gain-say'd
him, he answered, <hi>Thou shalt give it me
now; or if thou wilt not, I will take it by
force.</hi> Thus poore people now-adayes,
they cast their hooke, their violent hands
(gleaning the leane will not content
them) into the fat, the best and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
of rich mens Estates, and breaking all
Lawes of God and the King, they by
maine force draw it unto themselves.
Not so <hi>Ruth;</hi> she would not gleane with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                           <p>One forcible Motive to perswade the
Rich to suffer the Poore to gleane, may
be this: Even the greatest, in respect of
God, is but a gleaner. God, he is the
Master of the Harvest; all Gifts and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
they are his, in an infinite measure;
and every godly man, more or lesse,
gleanes from him. <hi>Abraha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

out of his Harvest, let us not grudge and
repine, that poore people gleane a little
gaine from our plentie. To conclude,
when God hath multiplyed our <hi>five

hath given us a great deale of increase, let
poore people, like <hi>Ruth</hi> in the Text, be the

Let this encourage men in their vertuous

way for men to consecrate their Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

Deeds; which shall ever remaine,
even when the most lasting Monuments

vertuous Memories from shining in the
World, yet this may be their comfort,
that <hi>God that sees in secret, will reward
them openly.</hi> Moreover, it is the dutie of
such who have received Courtesies from

as occasion shall serve; that so their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors

a thing truly meritorious of a Reward, it
is required, first, that the thing meriting
be our owne, and not anothers; now our

we be not bound of dutie to doe it; now
we are bound to doe all the good deeds

be a proportion betweene the thing me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting,
and the Reward merited; now
there is no proportion betweene our stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and imperfect workes, (for such are
our best) and that infinite weight of glory
where with God will reward us. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
therefore, that no Reward is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

                           <p>A Metaphor; it is borrowed from an
Hen, which with her clocking summons
together her stragling Chickens, and then
out-stretcheth the fanne of her wings to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:55742:146"/>
cover them. Familiarly it is used in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and amongst other places, by our
Saviour, <hi>Math. 23. How oft would I have
gathered thee together, as an Hen gathereth
her Chickens under her wings, and ye would
not?</hi> And just it was with God, because
the foolish Chickens of the <hi>Iewes</hi> would
not come to Christ, the Hen, calling them,
to suffer them to be devoured by the
Eagle, the Imperiall Armie of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>

                           <p>Gods love and care over his Children,
is as great as an Hen's over her Chickens.
Now the Hen's wings doe the Chickens a
double good.</p>
                           <p>First, they keepe them from the Kite;
so Gods providence protecteth his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
from that Kite, the Devill: For as
the Kite useth to fetch many Circuits, and
Circles, and long hovers and flutters
round about, and at length spying her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
pops downe on the poore Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for a prey; so the Devill, who as it is
<hi>Iob 1. 7. compasseth the Earth to and fro,
and walketh through it,</hi> and at length spy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:55742:147"/>
an opportunitie, pitcheth and setleth
himselfe upon some poore Soule, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure
it, if the wings of Gods providence
(as the Citie of Refuge) doe not rescue
him from his clutches.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, the Hen with her Chickens
broodes her Chickens, and makes them
thereby to thrive and grow. In Summer
her wings are a Canopie, to keepe her
Chickens from the heat of the scorching
Sunne; and in Winter they are a Mantle,
to defend them from the injurie of the
pinching cold: So Gods providence and
protection makes his Children to sprout,
thrive, and prosper under it: in Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
Gods providence keepeth them
from the heat of Pride; in Adversitie, it
preserveth them from being benummed
with frozen Despaire.</p>

                           <p>Let us all then strive to runne, to hide
our selves under the wings of the God of
Heaven. Hearke how the Hen clocks in
the <hi>Psalmes, Call upon me in the time of
trouble, and I will heare thee, and thou
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:55742:147"/>
shalt prayse me:</hi> How she clocks in the

returne, that we may behold thee:</hi> How she
clocketh, <hi>Math. 7. 7. Aske and ye shall have,
seeke and ye shall finde, knock and it shall be
opened unto you:</hi> How she clocks, <hi>Math.</hi> 11.
<hi>Come unto me all ye that are wearie and
heavie laden, and I will ease you.</hi> Let not
us now be like fullen Chickens, which sit
moaping under a rotten Hedge, or proat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under an old Wood-pile, when the
Hen calleth them. Let not us trust to the
broken Wall of our owne Strength, or
think to lurke under the tottering Hedge
of our owne Wealth, or winde-shaken

to God, that he may stretch his wings over

And as alwayes in Day-time, so
especially at Night, when we goe to Bed,
(for Chickens when going to Roost, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes

our selves with prayer to his Providence,
that he would be pleased to preserve us
from the dangers of the Night ensuing;

A Scholler being maintained in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitie
by his Uncle, who gave a Basilisk
for his Armes, and expected that he should
make him his Heire, wrote these Verses
over his Chimney;

                                 <l>Nam vitae nostrae spem Basiliscus alit.</l>

                           </p>
                           <p>Soone after it happened that his Uncle
dyed, and gave him nothing at all; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Scholler wrote these Verses
under the former.
<q>
                                 <l>Certè aluit, sed spe vanâ; spes vana venenum;</l>

                           <p>So soone may mens expectations be
frustrated, who depend on rich Kindred:
Yea, I have seene the twine-thred of a

                           <p>Let those therefore be thankfull to

                           <p>Commendable is the constancie and the
continuance of <hi>Ruth</hi> in labour. Many
there are who at the first have a <hi>ravenous
appetite</hi> to worke, but quickly they <hi>surfet</hi>
thereof. <hi>Ruth</hi> gleanes one day, so as she
may gleane another; it is the constant pace
that goeth farthest, and freest from being
tyred: <hi>Math. 24. 13. But he that shall endure
unto the end, the same shall be saved.</hi>

<hi>Math. 10. 11. to abide in the place
wherein they did enter,</hi> and not to goe
from house to house. Such the setlednesse
of <hi>Ruth;</hi> where she first fastned, there she
fixed: <hi>She dwelt with her Mother. Naomi</hi>
affords <hi>Ruth</hi> House-roome, <hi>Ruth</hi> gaines
<hi>Naomi</hi> Food; <hi>Naomi</hi> provides a Mansion,
<hi>Ruth</hi> purveyes for Meat; and so mutually

were not the hinderances, how
might one <hi>Christian</hi> reciprocally be a
helpe unto another? All have something,
none have all things; yet all might have
all things in a comfortable and competent
proportion, if seriously suting themselves
as <hi>Ruth</hi> and <hi>Naomi</hi> did, that what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
in one, might be supplyed in the
