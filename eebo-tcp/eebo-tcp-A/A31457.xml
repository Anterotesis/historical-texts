            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THAT this Cauſe hath been carried on by the
united Councels and Intereſts of many of <hi>Doctors
Commons,</hi> needs no proof; the whole manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it declares it, and the Doctor, who is promoter
of that Office, owns it; who hath been true to his Truſt,
and left nothing unattempted that might advantage his
Proſecution, and depreſs his Adverſary; and this for
Six Years together, by all the Tricks and Quirks, and
Hardſhips that ever were put upon any Man, ſince the
Firſt erection of <hi>Doctors Commons,</hi> to this Day. And
all to make a meer Miſtake a great Crime, and by Art
and Chicanry to advance it, both in its Nature and
Puniſhment, ten fold higher than any Law of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
ever yet accounted it.</p>
            <p>To effect this, there were frequent Cabals, and
ſtanding Counſel for the Promoter to have recourſe to,
when his own Skill was deficient, as it hath often been
in this Cauſe. Almoſt all the great Miniſters, both in
Church and State, have been courted, and gained, to
countenance the Proceedings; thoſe eſpecially of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Intereſt or Perſwaſion, who have advanced and
cheriſhed the Proſecution in ſeveral Inſtances; As by
procuring Patents from the King, and Biſhop of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln,</hi>
to the Promoter and his Aſſigns, by denying Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions,
often prayed in the Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi>
upon ſuggeſtion that the Cauſe was cenſured by virtue
of Papal Canons, never deviſed, uſed, nor received in
<pb facs="tcp:98108:3"/>
this Nation; by hindering a review, and by contriving
to exclude the Conſtitutions in <hi>Lyndwood,</hi> which are the
Eccleſiaſtical Laws of this Nation, from being admitted
to rule in this Caſe, (although there are Three poſitive
and expreſs about this very Matter) becauſe the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
they inflict were not ſharp enough to anſwer
the ends of the Promoter, and his Aſſociates. Which
was done, by ſome, to make a fair way for the Popiſh
Religion, by admitting Firſt all their Canons; and by
others, to introduce an Arbitrary Power over the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
and Reputations of all the Clergy. Some perhaps
were led thereinto by meer miſtake in the Canons,
cited and alledged by the Promoter and his Counſel,
which are ſuch that they make all the Clergymen in the
World in one Inſtance or other Simonical,<note place="margin">In Actor 8. 21.</note> as <hi>Marle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>
obſerves, <hi>Secundum hanc rationem, vix in toto
Papatu, reperietur ſacerdos, qui non ſit Simoniacus.</hi>
And he ſaith, <hi>Papiſtae crimen Simoniae ad otioſos
ſuos proventus trahunt;</hi> according to the Papal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
account of Simony, not one in all the Popes Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
can be guiltleſs,—and they make it ſerve to
bring in a revenue to their Sloth.</p>
            <p>At the Informations in this Cauſe, any Word that
could be found in the whole Body of the Canon Law
was urged, and improved againſt me, and allowed for
as good Law as if it had been at <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf; all the
Riff-raff and Trumpery of that Pedlar's-pack was expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
as if Popery had been then fully Eſtabliſhed and
Triumphant; and every clauſe of the Romiſh Laws had
been as much our Own, as is <hi>Magna Charta.</hi> And
when I urged to be cenſured by Canons deviſed and
made in <hi>England,</hi> the motion was rejected as imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
although it is well known ſuch practice incurs a
Premunire; and it is an unaccountable thing, That any
<pb facs="tcp:98108:3"/>
ſhould receive a Canon made at <hi>Lateran</hi> and <hi>Tours,</hi>
and reject our own Provincial Conſtitutions enacted in
the Kingdom, and by all the Clergy of it. A thing, I
dare ſay, never before attempted in this Realm; at
leaſt in ſo high a degree as in this Caſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe Canons then that are ſaid to have cenſured
this Fact for Simony are all Foreign,<note place="margin">Duck de uſu &amp; aut. jur. Jus Belgarum, &amp;c. Edictum Phil. 2. Gerſon. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtolae Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticae.</note> and a part of

The Canon Law that Sink of Forgeries, Impiety and

more forged Writings, (under good Names ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times)
for bad Purpoſes, or more impious Doctrines

Such burdens on Mens Conſciences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which they can
never reckon, never tell over, never know, never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.—And
it repreſents the Happineſs of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom
that they are not obliged to ſuch Laws,—whereof
the Cardinal of <hi>Cuſa</hi> ſaith, Infinite Numbers
<pb facs="tcp:98108:4"/>

the worſt Popes, Perſons Bloody and Ambitious, Traytors
to their Princes, and Butchers of Chriſtendom.</p>
            <p>And yet even the ſevereſt of theſe Canons do not De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
this Fact to be Simony, nor place it under that
Title, nor puniſh as Simony, or with more than Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the firſt time, or at moſt Suſpenſion. So <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
the Third commanded the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
no otherwiſe to cenſure the Archdeacons of <hi>Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
for ſome ſorts of Simony,<note place="margin">Extra de pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis c. licet.</note> being not againſt Divine
but Humane Law only, but by admoniſhing them to
deſiſt.</p>
            <p>If therefore any ſhall wonder how this Fact came to
be called Simony in the <hi>Arches,</hi> and then the Sentence
to be confirmed by the Delegates, I ſhall give a ſhort
Anſwer. That it was never argued on my part in the
<hi>Arches,</hi> becauſe the nullities in the Proceedings were ſo
groſs on the Promoters part, that my Counſel adviſed
me to rely on them in an Appeal, which I brought;
which nullities I muſt have waved if I had joyned iſſue;
ſo the Promoter had a Sentence <hi>Secundum Petita,</hi> as he
deſired, and that was, That it was Simony <hi>in hâc Parte.</hi>
And for the Delegates when it is known, that half of
them were of the <hi>Commons,</hi> and ſo my Proſecutors, and
the very Perſons who put the Promoter upon the project;
and that either the Promoter or his Agents had privily,
and very ſubtilly, inſinuated to the Delegates, a most
wicked, and most falſe and ſcandalous Report, that I
bought my Archdeaconry; telling many particulars and
circumſtances of it, (every Tittle and Word whereof was
a moſt horrible untruth, and without any ſhadow or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
but maliciouſly and deſignedly ſuggeſted, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed

was done ſo clandeſtinely, that I never heard of it till
<pb facs="tcp:98108:4"/>
Two Days before the Hearing. I leave all Men to judge
what Impreſſions theſe things might make, even on good
Men, and what effect they might have to make them mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
or byaſs them in their judgment; which whether
pronounced according to the Eccleſiaſtical Laws or not,
I now leave all that will to judge, after I have obſerved
that they differ'd in their Opinions about it; and one ſo
diſſatisfied that he went away, and ſet down the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <head type="sub">An Archdeacon granted to the Chancellor of the

            <head type="sub">Qu. <hi>Whether it be Simony.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IN the <hi>Roman</hi> Church almoſt every thing is made Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal,
not becauſe they intend to puniſh it, but to
gain by it: And the Spiritual Fiſher draws all into his
Nets; not to ſeparate the Bad from the Good, but
equally to make Merchandiſe of both.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, That that Church abounds ſo much in Canons
Decrees, in Decretals and Extravagants, Bulls and other
Conſtitutions; as if ſhe would even prevent Vice by ſo many
Sanctions, that lye, as it were, in ambuſh to intercept it.</p>
            <p>However, her Cunning is greater than her Care; and the
frequent and continued Violations of thoſe Canons is ſo
generally Connived at, that it makes good what hath been
long obſerved; Where there are moſt Laws, is the leaſt
Reformation.</p>
            <p>For in that place of Spiritual Traffick, no Man is Puniſh'd
but he who cannot Pay. And 'tis good Law, <hi>Qui non
habeat in crumenâ, luet in corpore:</hi> And <hi>Soto</hi> confeſſes it was

Diſpenſation is ſeldom denied, if you will come up to the

are become eaſie.</p>
            <p>Upon which bottom it is accountable, why the Canons
of that See make above an Hundred things Simony, that
were never taken ſo to be, or ſo Decreed in the Church of
<hi>England;</hi> nor is there Precept or Practice to bring them
under that odious Denomination with us; our Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too ſincere to lay Snares for her Sons, deſigning by all
ſhe Enacts to reform, not rob Delinquents.</p>
            <p>So many are the Branches of that Corrupt Tree of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony

admitted to be ſo by us, I may ſafely affirm, That there is
no Clergy Man of what Rank or Degree ſoever, let him

               <hi>Soto</hi> contends that his Church hath ſuch a Power,<note place="margin">De Jur. lib. 9. Tit. Simonia. pag. 759.</note> and he
knew her pretenſions as well as any, being of the Tridentine
Conventicle; <hi>Eccleſia poteſt quempiam actum in vitio Simoniae

durſt ſpeak what they knew in this Matter, though it would
prove a great eaſe to many Mens Conſciences who have
thought themſelves Guilty of that Crime, and ſo became
uneaſie, perhaps all their lives, (though they were Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
both in Fact and Intention) deeming that Simony
which was not ſo, and that they had infringed a Divine or
Natural Law, when the Crime was only againſt a Papal
Humane invention, made only to enſnare Mens Conſciences,
and ſo get Money to releaſe them; calling that Simony
which was not ſo in its own Nature, but made ſo to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance

            <p>Accordingly the Church of <hi>England</hi> eſteems it, who is ſo

Crimes, yet ſhe is too merciful and juſt to extend them, and
is very far her ſelf, whatever ſome of her miſtaken Sons
have done, from giving a Name to any Crime that is more
Execrable than its Nature. This were to make a Man an
Offender by a Word only, which is as bad as for one, if not
much worſe, and is ſo contrary to the Rules and Equity of
the Chriſtian Religion, that it tranſgreſſeth the Common
Rules and the Laws of Pagans and Infidels. It is indeed the
true practice of the Primitive Barbarity againſt Chriſtians,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98108:7"/>
to cloath them with the Skins of Beaſts, and then furiouſly
ſet on them, a ſort of Men as greedy and voracious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

under that diſguiſe, expoſed to amongſt them: Only with
this difference, that one ſort raged againſt Mens Lives,
and theſe prey upon their Goods. Thus in <hi>Rome</hi> any thing
is made Hereſie, that their Eſtates may be Confiſcate to

Juriſdiction exterior then is an humane Inſtitution, and
the letting it out a breach only of a pontificial, or other
Eccleſiaſtical Canon, not any Divine Law; And ſo the
crime is become Ten fold, nay an Hundred fold leſs than elſe
it had been. For 'tis now indeed only a Sin of diſobedience,
and not Simony, as <hi>Durandus</hi> hath reſolved. And upon this
account it is, That the Popes have given leave by their
Bulls to the Biſhops to let out their Juriſdictions for a year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Rent, it being in its own nature but a Tranſgreſſion of
their own Laws, which they may diſpenſe with at pleaſure,
which they neither could nor durſt have done,<note place="margin">De Jur. Tit. de Sim. l. 9.</note> ſaith <hi>Soto,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>It is not then real Simony, nor is called ſo, or ſo reputed
by the Canon Law, as the Caſe is now Stated, being to a Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
When the Decretals of <hi>Alex.</hi> III. before cited, forbid
Letting and make it penal, They reſtrain it to Spiritual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
Clerks in Orders, Deans or Archprieſts; Neither was
it feaſible then to let the Exerciſe of Juriſdictions Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
to any other.</p>
            <p>To let to a Layman, is like Ploughing with an Ox and
Aſs together, nay they reckon it Sacriledg in them, and it
is wholly impracticable, unleſs they had particular, and

            <p>If then this Office be ſuch as hath been uſed to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed

to Let it, according to the Laws and conſtitutions of this

'tis moſt rational that if one be, yet the other ſhould not be

            <p>Several other Gloſſes alſo afford us the ſame reſtrictions
of Simony, to convince that this is the true notion of it,

how great Authority the Gloſſes are: 'Tis <hi>conſuetudo generalis</hi>

buying Offices to this point; If the Office can't be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

Offices; And of Clerks only all that large and ſtrict
Canon againſt ſelling and buying them is to be underſtood.
By which we have clearly gain'd this point without any
poſſibility of reply or contradiction, That the Canon Law
eſteems it then only Simony to buy Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

<hi>Alio autem tempore, emere non eſt peccatum,</hi> ſaith the Gloſs. So
that theſe authorities make it evident, That the eſſence of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
conſiſts in this, that ſomething is purchas'd by the

            <p>By all theſe Authorities and Reaſons it is evident, That if
the Juriſdiction that is let out under a Yearly Payment, hath
not concomitant to it a Power of Order or the Keys, which
renders none capable of them but Clergymen, it is not
Simony. To all I ſhall add the Judgment of Two or Three
of the Neotericks, that it may appear that as this hath

again mind the Reader, an Archdeacon is one there named)
thus ſpeaks; Though the ſaid Offices are purely Temporal,
and their Acts and Objects Temporal, therefore neither
Divine nor Natural Law makes it Simony to ſell them;
becauſe they have a kind of remote habitude and reference
to a Spiritual and Supernatural end, and are inſtituted by
virtue of a Power given by Chriſt to his Church; therefore
to keep a decorum in the Church, and to avoid Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies
that would enſue if ſuch Offices were ſold, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
have forbid it <hi>tanquam Simonia,</hi> as <hi>Caietan, Victoria,

<hi>Quamvis aliqui negant ejuſmodi Officia, ſi ſpiritualem functionem

            <p>Here is then the Caſe, A Juriſdiction granted to all Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who could not exerciſe the Spiritual part of it, if
any ſuch had been becauſe not in Orders, and ſo there
could be no Simony in the Leſſor or Leſſee, becauſe the
Juriſdiction was wholly Temporal, the Object Temporal,
the Subject Temporal alſo.</p>
            <p>Wherein that I be more clear and inſtructive I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
what kind of Power this is that is inveſted in a Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
by ſuch a Patent.</p>
            <p>According to <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> Eccleſiaſtical Power is either of
Order or Juriſdiction, That of Order is to perſwade or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
the willing, by the word and Sacraments, inſtructions
and perſwaſions and is Sacerdotal, the ſame which all Prieſts
have.</p>
            <p>The other is a Power of Juriſdiction, which though <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
and others divide into Internal and External, I ſee no
ground for the Dichotomy, and can find nothing Internal
but what belongs to Order only, which is <hi>jure divino;</hi> only
ſome part of this Power of Juriſdiction is reſerved to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98108:11"/>
only, and the reſt communicable others, by them
or the Law.</p>
            <p>If any will be more critical, and find out ſome Acts of
Internal Power beſides that of Order, yet that uſed in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Courts and conſiſtories, wherein Men are compelled
to their Duties by Proceſs and cenſures,<note place="margin">Andrews, Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Burhill, Tompſon, Carlton, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> muſt be meerly
External, and is ſo acknowledged to be by moſt Writers,
and fully evinced by our own Writers about the Kings
Supremacy againſt <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Becanus &amp;c.</hi> Of this ſort is
the Power delegated by an Archdeacon to a Layman, as
Dr. <hi>Coſens</hi> recounts it.<note place="margin">Tab. 2.</note> The Archdeacons Office is to take
care the Churches and their utenſils be repaired, and to
reform exceſſes in the Clergy, to acquaint the ordinary with
what is amiſs, and induct Clerks to Benefices; and for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
it is according to uſage. To keep Courts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
and Office, and grant Wills and Adminiſtrations. So he.</p>
            <p>In all which there is no Spiritual Act included; And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be done that requires the uſe of the Keys, or flows
from the Power of Order. But all theſe mentioned, the
Church Wardens, or the promoters, or the Court Leet, or
a Layman may exerciſe as well as the Clergy, if they are
legally deputed to it, nay, a Woman as <hi>Gerſon</hi> ſpeaks, and
the Abbeſſes and Prioreſſes do at this Day.</p>
            <p>As for Viſitations, The Surrogate only ſends to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
to meet at ſuch a place where preſentments are taken,
and exceſſes enquired after, which are meerly Temporal
Acts, though the Perſons enquired of be ſome of them Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.
Therefore when <hi>Redoanus</hi> and any other Canoniſts
make Viſitations (in their large ſenſe and acceptation or
abuſe rather of the word) Spiritual, it is becauſe the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon
is bound to Preach and give Spiritual Inſtructions
to his Clergy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and others, as the pontificial forms for Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
of which there are very many extant, do enjoyn,
from which part a Layman is excluded.</p>
            <p>As for Excommunication and Abſolution, it is well known
that Laymen do not uſe them but leave them to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
and though they are decreed by one, they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
and made valid by the other. And how great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
there have been in this Nation of the contrary u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
is well known, and that the Canons of 40, which
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98108:11"/>
ſhew the ſenſe of the Church though they were not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
utterly debar Laymen from any ſuch Power. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can I hear that at this preſent any Layman throughout
<hi>England</hi> taketh upon him to Excommunicate without one in
Orders to aſſiſt him; And I am ſure if he cannot bind, he
cannot looſe. <hi>For ejus eſt ſolvere cujus eſt ligare.</hi>

ſhall never make him irregular, as <hi>Navar</hi> and <hi>Cova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racias</hi>
and <hi>Infinite</hi> beſides of the Canoniſts Obſerve. Which
demonſtrates that their Opinion is, that Juriſdiction is not

            <p>For this is the <hi>Palladium</hi> of the Romiſh Church, to make

began to be a common pleading place, having execution
done by the Miniſtry of the Magiſtrate, and to gain the
Name of Epiſcopal Juriſdiction, Epiſcopal Audience, and
ſuch like. The Emperor <hi>Valens</hi> did inlarge it, who 365.
gave the Biſhops the care over all the Prizes of vendible
things.—St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> complained how troubleſom it was

to him.—<hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius</hi> reſtrained their Juriſdiction

of Religion, Eccleſiaſtical faults of the Clergy, and divers
voluntary Juriſdictions alſo over the Laity.—The Biſhops
became Counſellors to the Princes in the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire; and,
by the mixture of Spiritual and Temporal Charges, cauſed
their Juriſdictions to increaſe exceedingly. He ſhews large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
how they increas'd their Power over the Clergy and Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
pretending the Cauſe was Eccleſiaſtical or mixt, and ſo
leaving nothing to the Secular, appropriated all to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
—making all devolve to themſelves, if the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
will not, or neglect to do juſtice. This might be
tolerable—but not ſtaying here, they added, that neither
the Magiſtrate, nor the Prince himſelf, can meddle in any
of theſe Cauſes, which the Clergy had appropriated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Spiritual; and of Spiritual things the Laicks are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable

other Spiritual things are there beſides theſe?—'Tis falſe
that cauſes appropriated to the Epiſcopal Judicature, are
Spiritual. For all are either delicts or contracts, which
conſidering the qualities, given by the Holy Scripture to
Spiritual things, are as far from being ſuch, an Earth is

            <p>If we have gain'd this point, That the exterior Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

Sacerdotii &amp; Imperii,</hi> and makes that the ground of the
Eleventh Canon of the Councel of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> His words are
theſe, <hi>Cum in illâ aetate ordinatio ſive</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

electionem perſonae, atque illius conſecrationem per impoſitionem

he deduces, is a neceſſary connexion, and the Spiritual can't
be ſeparated from the Temporal; <hi>quare omnia comprehende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantur
damnatione illâ quae gratiam commercio exponebat.</hi> The
Benefice and Orders went together, and he who paid for
one was a Purchaſer of the other alſo. Of ſuch things the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſts
ſay, they are <hi>annexa concomitanter,</hi> He who buys one
cannot leave the other unbought, and it is real Simony.
But when things are annex'd to a Spiritual, only Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
or Conſequently, ſo as they may be ſeparate and
one bought without the other, many times it is not Simony
to give Money for them: Otherwiſe neither Tythes could
be Let, nor Glebe, nor Lands, nor Houſes, nor the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
of a Juriſdiction, nor could broken Conſecrated
Veſſels be ſold, nor Advouſons, nor Burying places. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
alſo <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaith, Things may be annex'd to Spirituals
Two ways, either as depending on Spirituals, as a Benefice
which none can have but a Clerk, and ſuch cannot be
ſold.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As they are appointed, and ſet a part to Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Uſes, and ſuch may be ſold: Which ſtrengthens, as
well as gives light, to this whole Tract; If a Juriſdiction
were ſo annex'd to any Spiritual Office, that it could not be
ſeparated from it, but that Supernatural, Spiritual Power,
is requiſite to the exerciſe of it, then it would be Simony,
becauſe it muſt be ſuppoſed the Power is bought alſo,
(which is true Simony) but is nothing of, or to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Caſe; where the Juriſdiction that is let is Temporal,
uſed by a Temporal Perſon, and about Temporal Objects.
And accordingly the Canons of <hi>Lateran</hi> and <hi>Tours,</hi> prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting
the letting out Juriſdictions of Biſhops, or Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons
ſpeak of letting to Spiritual Perſons, Deans and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presbyters,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98108:14"/>
but of letting to Laymen there is not any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
in the Canon Law. And thoſe Canons being Penal,
the more Penal they are,<note place="margin">Lynd. de vita &amp; hon. cler. c. exterior v. pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulis.</note> the more they are to be reſtrain'd,
and no extenſion ſhall be allowed to them for Puniſhment,
but for Favor only, as all know that know any thing either
of the Canon, or the Civil Law. <hi>Lyndwood</hi> is expreſs, that

Rules of the Laws. And once more I ſhall cite <hi>Lyndwood</hi>
for this, and ſo have done, <hi>Regulare eſt quod Statutum maximè
paenale loquens de perſonâ verâ, non extenditur ad perſonam repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatam.</hi>
The Perſons ſpoken of in the Canons, being Deans
and Archpresbyters; If a Juriſdiction be not let to one of
them, by all theſe Authorities the Leſſor can't be within the
Purview of it; but infinitely ſtronger is it, that theſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
being all Clerks in Orders, Laymen out of Orders
ſhall not be included, but they who let to them ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved.</p>
            <p>For, though it be Felony to ſteal a Horſe, yet the ſame
Statute cannot extend to ſtealing a Mule, much leſs an Aſs,
though all are Beaſts of Burden, and the firſt a part of him;
though the Immorality and Crime in ſtealing either of them
be not at all different.</p>
            <p>To all which I ſhall add one thing more, That this Crime,
whatever it is, yet is not under the title of Simony in the
Canon Law, but under the title immediately following,
which ſhews what Notion the Compilers of the Canon Law
had of it, and that they took it not to be Simony, though
it had been exerciſed by a Clerk, at leaſt not ſuch a Simony
as the former title treated of, in the rigorous and ſtrict ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of the Word, but in a large extenſive, abuſive
ſignification only, as they may call any Crime they pleaſe
by that Name, as <hi>Soto</hi> before cited to that purpoſe, hath
obſerved; though indeed the Canons never call this ſo, in
any ſenſe whateſoever, but clearly intend it for another ſort
of Crime, by placing it under another ſort of Head, which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98108:14"/>
I may very rationally infer, conſidering the accuracy and
exactneſs, uſed by the Compilers, in ranging every thing
under its proper Head, by that ſhewing to us the true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and formal difference of every thing there treated of.
And this is ſo true and material, that Pope <hi>Greg.</hi> XIII. in his
Breve before the Body of the Canon Law, ſaith <hi>Quae per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peram
poſita erant, ſuis locis reſtituta,</hi> &amp;c. every thing is now
reſtored to its proper place, to which place this Crime is
not reſtored, if it be Simony, which muſt argue either
Neglect, or Unskilfulneſs in the Compilers, Crimes not to
be objected where Popes, and the beſt Canoniſt in the
World are ſo far concerned. And, indeed, who can believe
that in Forty ſix Chapters, which make up the Title Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in the Decretals, this ſhould not have been inſerted, if
it had belonged to that Claſſis, rather than have crept in
under the next Title of <hi>Nè prael. vices,</hi> where there are in
all but Four Chapters; and that which is treated of in the
laſt, no Man ever called Simony; <hi>viz.</hi> Letting the Tythes
to Farm for Seven Years, which yet muſt be Simony, if the
Gloſs ſaith true, which would make it a kind, or a ſort of
Simony, ſomething like it, though not it. <hi>Altera ſpecies Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniae,</hi>
That is ſomething the Canoniſts call ſo, though it
be not ſo. For as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Uſurps a Power to
make every thing Lawful, if ſhe pleaſe, by her Diſpenſing
Power, which began at <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Matth. Paris</hi> ſaith, though
never ſo flagitious; ſo doth ſhe, on the contrary, pretend the
ſame Power to brand every Action with an infamous Name,
though it be in it ſelf never ſo Innocent and Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
            <p>In this Caſe, It is Lawful ſay her Canoniſts for a Biſhops,
or an Archdeacons Chancellor or Official to put in a Surro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,
it may be a Curate, or a Vicar-choral, never Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Law, and give him 10 lb a Year, or but a Groat
for an Oath, and no other Salary, as many have done who
have theſe Juriſdictions, and the Chancellors and Officials
take all the reſt; allowing not a full Scandalous Tenth of
the Profits to the Surrogate. But it ſhall not be Lawful for
an Archdeacon to make the Chancellor of the Dioceſs, or
any other well Qualified Learned Man, his Surrogate, the
Archdeacon reſerving to himſelf, perhaps, not neer half of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98108:15"/>
the Profits, and ſo allowing the Surrogate a plentiful, and
honorable Sallary. Now let any Man Judge which of theſe
two will be tempted to Oppreſſion and Extortion, he that
executes the Office for 10 lb a Year, or he who hath 80 or
an 100 lb. But ſtill there is a Quirk and Nicety in the
Law, which improved by the Chicanry of the Practiſers,
and countenanced, and even promoted by a whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
of the profeſſion, can make Black White, and
White Black, and find error where there is no fault, and
make that Criminal which moſt furthered the adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Juſtice; whereas their own ſcandalous, and ſcanty,
both Salaries and Surrogates, ſhall never be called into
queſtion. This is the true Caſe I now treat of; and it is,
and hath been confeſſed at the hearing of this Cauſe, by
the moſt violent in it, That there is really, and indeed no
difference at all between the Archdeacons giving a Sallary
to a Surrogate, or his reſerving part to himſelf, only in
one caſe the Archdeacon receives the Profits and divides
them; and in the other caſe the Surrogate doth it. The
thing is all one, and comes to all one, and either way the
Archdeacon may have what he will himſelf, and let his Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
have what part he aſſigns him. The Surrogate in
either caſe may be tempted to Extortion of Fees, becauſe
he hath not the whole, yet that is the only reaſon in the
Canons why this we write of is forbid, and muſt be a very
weak one, ſince they permit what is as pernitious, or more
than what they prohibit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Second head is, That it is not Simony by the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Conſtitutions, Injunctions, or Canons of the
Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A great part of which were Compiled, and Gloſſed on
by <hi>Lyndwood,</hi> who follows the Order of the Pontifical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretals,
making in all Five Books; in the the laſt whereof is
a Title of the ſame Name, and in the ſame place as in the
Decretals, called <hi>Nè praelati vices,</hi> wherein this Crime is
treated of. So that the Title of Simony, which juſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceds
this, hath no more to do with it than any other Title
hath; but in <hi>Lyndwood,</hi> as before in the Decretals, it
is under another Title, diſtinct from that of Simony, which
ſtrongly argues it to be a diſtinct Crime.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:98108:15"/>
Long before <hi>Lyndwood,</hi>

Councel was held under Archbiſhop <hi>Anſelm,</hi> whoſe Second
Canon is againſt Simony, and the Third is againſt letting
Juriſdictions to Farm, but that Canon calls it by no ſuch
Name as Simony, no more than ranks it under that
head.</p>
            <p>In the Abortive Canons of <hi>Edw.</hi> the Sixth, there is not a
Word about it, though very much about Chancellors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and their Juriſdictions.</p>
            <p>The Canons of King <hi>James</hi> 1603,<note place="margin">Can. 40.</note> injoyns an Oath againſt
Simony at Inſtitution to Benefices, and the Canon is under
the general head, Intituled, Miniſters their Ordination,
Function and Charge. The whole Canon concerns Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices

is the very Definition of a Benefice in the <hi>Regulae juris,</hi>

Oath againſt Simony, recittd in that 40 Canon, Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
by any, who underſtands his Duty, to Officials or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries,
or any who act by Deputation. But there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
injoyned, in Can. 127, 128, for theſe Officers, and
indeed for all Judges Eccleſiaſtical and their Surrogates;
and conſiſts of but Two Canons. 1. The Quality and
Oath of Judges. 2. The Quality of Surrogates. In the
Firſt, whereof they are injoyned to take the Oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
and ſubſcribe the 39 Articles, and of dealing
Juſtly and Uprightly in their Offices; all which the Surro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
are equally obliged to by Can. 128. And this is all
they are required to take: So that if any other Oath be
Adminiſtred to them, they may refuſe it, and if they do
take any, it is voluntary, and they do more than is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
and the impoſer incurs a Premunire, excerciſing Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
without Lawful Authority.</p>
            <p>In the Repertorium, which <hi>Badius Aſcenſus</hi> made to <hi>Lynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi>
many ſorts of Simony are recounted, and even all
that <hi>Badius</hi> could collect out of the Conſtitutions, but this
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98108:16"/>
is not there counted for one, nor in his <hi>Tabul a Rubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What the Church of <hi>England</hi> thought of it, we may
judge by the Canons 1640, which declare her ſenſe,
though the Canons are not genuine and binding, 'Tis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
in Can. 11. That no reward ſhall be taken for any
Chancellors, Commiſſaries, or Officials place, under the
heavieſt cenſures of the Church: And that is Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but if it be true and real Simony, againſt Divine or
Natural Law, it were Deprivation. Now although the
Offence mentioned in that Canon be of a higher Nature,
and far more odious than letting out a Juriſdiction to Farm,
or reſerving part of the Profit to the Leſſor, yet it is not De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation,
for Deprivation is no cenſure at all, and ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

<hi>In Ordine ſive gradu, &amp; Beneficio,</hi> in Orders and Benefice;

taken notice of, had they eſteemed it any ſpecies of it in the
account of this Church.</p>
            <p>It is alſo evident by the Puniſhments inflicted on it by the
Conſtitutions of our Church to be found in <hi>Lyndwood</hi>'s Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections,
that it is not judged Simony.<note place="margin">Lynd. Nè prael. vices lib. 5.</note> For in the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Conſtitution of Archbiſhop <hi>Langton,</hi> the Puniſhment is
Suſpenſion only, <hi>ab Officio,</hi> for a Year.</p>
            <p>In the Legantine Conſtitution of <hi>Otho</hi> there is no Penalty
annext,<note place="margin">Cap. Eccleſias.</note> and ſo the Puniſhment can be but Admonition for
the firſt time.</p>
            <p>In the Conſtitution of Cardinal <hi>Othobone,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. Indign.</note> the puniſhment
is to pay a third part of what the Leſſor ſhall have received,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98108:16"/>
to the Fabrick of the Metropolitical Church of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
Whereas if it were Simony, it is notorious that the whole
ought to be refunded, by all the Canons of Chriſtendom:
Which I ſhall not trouble my ſelf to prove, ſince no Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt
denies it, for he who purchaſes Simonically buys no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
he hath no Title to the profits, and therefore is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to be diſpenſed with, till he hath reſtored the whole.
Theſe Arguments I do but propound, becauſe I would be
brief, but if any Man of Judgment will conſider them, he
will find them ſolid, and the weakeſt of them of great
weight to determine this Caſe. For if all the Clergy of
<hi>England, Scotland, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> and the Cardinal Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,
who preſided in the laſt Synod, and who was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
alſo afterwards Pope, underſtood as much as the leaſt
Canoniſt in <hi>Doctors Commons</hi> pretends to, they muſt have
impoſed another ſort of puniſhment upon this crime, if it
had been Simony, and not have let it eſcaped with ſo ſlight
a cenſure, as only paying to the Cathedrial of <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
a third part of what was received. I ſhall only add, That
the Provincial Conſtitution ſaith, it was a frequent thing in
thoſe Days to let Juriſdictions to Farm, and ſo frequent
that the Cardinal and Synod were afraid to make Canons
againſt it, leaſt they ſhould inſnare Mens Conſciences, yet
in all the Realm is not to be found any ſentence ever cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it Simony, or puniſhing it as ſuch. And if they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
it Simony, there needed no new Decrees about it
to puniſh it, for the Canon Laws might have done that,
without the help of theſe new Conſtitutions, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we may conclude counted it another crime, becauſe
they give it another puniſhment. It is therefore not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
what an intereſted partial promoter, or his abetters
would make of it, ſince it is ſo clearly reſolved in that, and
other Conſtitutions, in moſt Auguſt and venerable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
of all the Prelates of three Kingdoms, and by Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
Authority, not to be Simony, as appears by the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of their Canons.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is not Simony by the Statutes of this Realm.
There is only one Statute that takes any notice of letting to
Farm Juriſdictions; And one more that gives account what
the Temporal Laws of this Land think to be Simony; The
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98108:17"/>
firſt Statute is, that of 5, 6 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. 16. Entituled, The penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for buying and ſelling ſome ſort of Offices. And this is
made for the avoiding corruption, as the firſt Clauſe ſpeaks.
That letting out a Juriſdiction is comprehended in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
is agreed by the Judges, but the Statute calleth the
fact Corruption, not Simony.</p>
            <p>The other is 31 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 6. Againſt taking reward for Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Schollars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for preſentation of Benefices. By
which Title I may Collect, this is not included that I Treat
about; And indeed no Man ever ſaid it was, therefore I
ſhall not ſpend time about it. For the Statute concerns on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
buying Orders and Benefices, and corrupt reſignations.</p>
            <p>And indeed ſo far are the Temporal Laws of the Realm,
from making this fact to be Simony, that whatever Name
had been given it by the Pontificial Canons, or by thoſe of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> yet the Laws of the Land have
Abſolved it, and acquitted it from being that ſort of crime.</p>
            <p>I ſhall at preſent avoid the Queſtion, whether any thing
can be Simony by the Laws of this Land, that is not De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
ſo in that Statute of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> which is made for
the avoiding Simony and corruption, as the fourth Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph
Declares; Although I know, 'tis the Opinion of moſt
of the Learned Lawyers, who are poſitive in it, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it by very ſtrong Arguments, Reaſons, and Authority.
But it is a matter too long to be diſcuſt here, and out of
my Province; and more than is neceſſary to my Subject in
Hand.</p>
            <p>It ſhall be ſufficient to ſhew, that whatſoever the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
about this matter had been before the Statutes of <hi>H.</hi> 8.
and Reformation of Religion that ſoon followed, and the
Statutes thereupon, the nature of the crime, and the whole
current of the Laws about it are altered: So that had this
Office been given to a Clerk, and not to a Layman, yet,
as the Laws of <hi>England</hi> now are, it could not have been
Simony, although the Leſſee had exerciſed by virtue of his
Deputation, all thoſe Functions, and that Juriſdiction which
the Ancient Canons called Spiritual.</p>
            <p>For by many Statues made in the Reigns of <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6.
and the Queen, thoſe Powers and Juriſdictions are made
Temporal, and ſo no longer of that nature, which could
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98108:17"/>
render the Contract about them liable to the imputation of
Simony; which cannot be committed but when that which
is ſold is Spiritual.</p>
            <p>The 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 1. Gives the Kings of this Realm full Power
and Authority, to Viſit, Redreſs, Repreſs, Reform, Order,
Correct, Reſtrain, and amend all ſuch Errors, Hereſies,
Abuſes, Offences, Contempts, and Enormities whatſoever
they be, which by any manner of Spiritual Authority, or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction,
ought, or may, lawfully be Reformed, Repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
Ordered, Redreſſed, Corrected, Reſtrained, or Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
—any Uſage, Cuſtom, Foreign Laws, Foreign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
Preſcription,—to the contrary notwithſtanding.</p>
            <p>Alſo the 37 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 17. Declares the ſame Power to be in
the King, and to exerciſe all manner of Juriſdictions, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called, Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction,—And that the
Power the Pope claimeth, is directly repugnant to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
of Supream Head of the Church, and Prerogative
Royal, your Grace being a Layman,—and that the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops,
Biſhops, Archdeacons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have no manner of
Juriſdiction Eccleſiaſtical, but by under, and from your Royal
Majeſty,—Some evil diſpoſed Perſons little regard the
Proceedings and cenſures Eccleſiaſtical, made by your
Highneſs and Vicegerent, Officials, Commiſſaries, Judges,
and Viſitors, being alſo Lay and Married Men, and think
them of little or none effect. Foraſmuch as your Majeſty
—hath all Power by Scripture to hear and determine all
manner of Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, and correct Vice and Sin
whatſoever; and to all ſuch Perſons as your Majeſty ſhall
appoint thereunto,—Be it Enacted, That Doctors of
Law may lawfully execute and exerciſe all manner of
Juriſdiction Eccleſiaſtical, and all cenſures and coertions,
—Albeit they be Lay or Married Men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. 2. Affirms all Authority of Juriſdiction Spiritual
and Temporal, is derived and deducted from the King's Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
—And all Courts Eccleſiaſtical are kept by no other
Power or Authority, either Foreign or within the Realm, but
by the Authority of his moſt Excellent Majeſty.</p>
            <p>All which Statutes,<note place="margin">1, 2 Phil. &amp; Mariae. 8. Revived by Queen Eliz.</note> among many more, were repealed by
Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> being contrary to the Doctrine and Intereſt of
the Romiſh Church, who holds for the moſt part all theſe Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictions
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98108:18"/>
to be of Divine Right, and their cenſures to be
Sacerdotal, and the Power Eccleſiaſtical to be, <hi>Ex ſacrorum
Canonum diſpoſitione,</hi> as the Popiſh Clergy ſpeak in their
ſubmiſſion to Cardinal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">Epiſcopacy not prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, &amp;c. Pag. 32.</note> 
               <hi>Pool.</hi> But the Reformed Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
ſpeak quite otherwiſe, as Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> doth, who
ſaith of the Exterior Juriſdiction, it is not from God but
from the King, wholly and entirely from him, as the ſole
Fountain of all exterior Juriſdiction, Spiritual or Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and conſequently not of Divine Right. So ſaith that
Biſhop; for indeed if theſe Juriſdictions were of Divine
Right, they could not be deputed to others, but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
muſt be limited to the Perſons alone in whom ſuch
a right is inherent.<note place="margin">25 H. 8 21.</note> One Statute therefore ſaith well; They
are called Spiritual, not that they are ſo; it is Popery to
Affirm it, and a virtual denying the Kings Supremacy,
and renouncing the Oath of it, and a Lopping from the
Crown one of the principal Branches of its Prerogative;
preheminence in all Cauſes; Which the King can never
have, if exterior Juriſdiction be Spiritual, from God and
the Pope, not from the Crown. The Book (of an <hi>Anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi>
Author) called, Epiſcopal Inheritance, ſaith 'tis a
Popiſh Yenet to Affirm the Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction to be
diſtinct from the Civil, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> aſſerts to ſet the
Pope above Kings, and to exempt the Clergy from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Powers.</p>
            <p>In Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign,<note place="margin">1 Eliz. 1.</note> this Power is Affirmed to be
in the Crown, and 'tis Enacted, That all Spiritual or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Power or Authority, for the Viſitation of the
Eccleſiaſtical State, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Be united and annexed for ever to
the Imperial Crown of this Realm.</p>
            <p>But the Canons Affirm it to be in the Pope as a Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Head, and have therefore called it a Spiritual Power,
which being now by theſe Statutes, reduced to its true
Original, muſt be no longer Spiritual but Temporal, for
the King hath it as a Layman, ſaith the 37 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 17. And
may inveſt Laymen with it, who are no ways capable to
give or receive it if it were Spiritual. So that whatever it
was heretofore, when it came from <hi>Rome,</hi> it is now Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
and a part of the Kings Temporal Juriſdiction, as
Impropriate Parſonages and Vicarages become Temporal
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98108:18"/>
Things and Lay-fees, now they are appropriate to Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
which before were Eccleſiaſtical and Spiritual: And
ſo the nature of ſuch Juriſdictions, as of the Benefices, is
altered with the alteration of the Tenure. So it would have
been Simony to have ſold the Six and the Sixty Clerks
places in Chancery, when they were all Clergy Men, or the
Advocates and Proctors of the Commons, when they were
all bound to be Clerks (which made <hi>Altiſſiodorenſis</hi> and <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
ſay, it was Simony for the Advocate to take Fees for
pleading) but now they are all Laymen, there is no colour
for ſuch a cenſure.</p>
            <p>There is yet remaining one, and a very ſtrong Argument,
that letting a Juriſdiction cannot be Simony by the Laws
of <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Nè prael. vices.</note> and it is this. Neither that Canon of <hi>Yours,</hi>
nor that of <hi>Lateran,</hi> in the body of the Canon Law, nor
any Gloſs nor Commentator upon them is Law with us in
<hi>England.</hi> 'Tis true that thoſe Canons do not call it Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
nor puniſh it as Simony, but if they did, I Affirm,
they are nothing to the Caſe, being not Law in our Church,
and ſo concerns us no more than the Laws of <hi>Coufutius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dr. Heylin, &amp;c.</note> or
<hi>Japan.</hi> 'Tis almoſt unaccountable what Intereſt thoſe Men
would ſerve, who have contended earneſtly that all the
Popes Laws are in force with us. I know none but that
of <hi>Doctors Commons,</hi> who, if they had ſo large a Field to
expatiate in, would have all Mens Eſtates and Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in their own Power; But it is moſt certain, that no
part of the Canon Law is in force in <hi>England,</hi> but what hath
been received and uſed here, not as the Popes Law, but as
made part of the Kings Eccleſiaſtical Laws by cuſtom, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
and conſent; Upon which conditions the Laws of all
<hi>France</hi> might have been ours, as well as thoſe only of <hi>Ole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
This is plain by our Statutes,<note place="margin">25 H. 8. 21. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Eliz. 1.</note> and it is a Premunire
to defend and maintain thoſe Canons; or; that ſhall dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly
or indirectly put in ure, or execute any thing for the
Extolling, Advancing, ſetting forth, maintenance or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence

               </gap>eminence, or Authority, or any part thereof. The
Second Offence is Preminure by the Statute of that Queen.
Now there cannot be an higher Offence againſt both the
Statutes cited in the Margen, than introducing Foreign Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98108:19"/>
and judging the Cauſes of the King's Subjects by
them; utterly refuſing to proceed by Canons made and
uſed within the Realm, as hath been done in this Cauſe.</p>

               <note place="margin">Page 32.</note> in his Speech concerning the Premunire,

And for this he forfeited all his Goods and Chattels to the

            </p>
            <p>Thoſe Laws of the Pope we have no more to do with
than his Religion, which yet by a Corrupt Intereſt have
been partly maintained, by thoſe perhaps, who hope his
Power may ſometime return where his Canons ſo much
prevail.</p>
            <p>It is indeed an unaccountable Boldneſs for any Judge to
give ſentence in a Cauſe upon Popiſh Canons, never uſed
or put in practiſe in <hi>England,</hi> as hath been done in this
Caſe; but it muſt be remembred it was done when Popery
began to rule us, and he was moſt countenanced who
could moſt cunningly introduce it one, and that a very ſubtle
Method, being to bring in force again all the Pontificial Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
which the Reformation had Abdicated. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
all the Popiſh Judges, and thoſe that were eminently
Popiſhly affected, would never conſent to a Prohibition
upon this ſuggeſtion,<note place="margin">Though they granted a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition upon another ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion.</note> though it was thrice attempted, That
it was no Simony by any Law or Canon that ever was uſed,
or in force in <hi>England,</hi> though the ſuggeſtion be moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
true and relevant. That it is true, I affirm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there never was any ſuch Cauſe before heard in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
nor any Sentence in it, no nor is there any deciſion
of this Cauſe to be found in any of the numerous Rotaes of
all Chriſtendom. There is no inſtance before, neither in
<hi>England,</hi> nor in the whole World of any hearing wherein
it hath been judicially pronounced Simony. Therefore the
ſuggeſtion muſt be relevant, as may be ſeen by the Statutes
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98108:19"/>
before cited; for thoſe Canons on which the Sentence is
grounded, are no Laws in <hi>England.</hi> Suppoſe a Man was
Libelled in the Court Chriſtian for Hereſy, they will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
becauſe it is an Eccleſiaſtical Crime and give ſentence;
It is true that by the 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> if it be not ſuch as hath been
declared Hereſy by the Four Firſt General Councels they
ought not, but the Court will not hear it; Whether muſt
the Client go, but to the Temporal Judges, who are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
and vindicate that Statute, and enquire whether it be
Hereſy within that Statute or no, and whether the Canons
about Hereſy, by which the Court proceeds, do not abate
by virtue of that Statute? In this Caſe the Reverend Judges
may, and let me ſpeak with humble ſubmiſſion, ought to
enquire whether the Court do not intrench upon the
25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>H.</hi> 8. 21, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That Enacts no Canons ſhall be uſed but
what have been received, and if the Court Chriſtian put in
ure ſuch Canons, they are to be reſtrain'd, elſe theſe ſeveral
Temporal Laws were made in vain, that have aboliſhed
ſuch Foreign Canons. It ſeems to me the ſtrongeſt plea in
the World, to alledge, That this Cauſe is pronounced to be
Simony by Canons that were never in force in <hi>England,</hi> or
if they were, they are abrogate and obſolete; and, of this
I am ſure, none but the Temporal Courts are the proper
Judges. For if the Court Chriſtian be allowed to make
uſe of what Pontificial Laws they pleaſe, there is no Biſhop
or Clergyman whom they cannot deprive for this very
Crime, in Inſtances never yet heard of by Engliſhmen.
<hi>Godolphin</hi> takes notice how much Simony in <hi>England</hi> differs
from that of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſaith,</p>
            <p>The Canon Law,<note place="margin">Repert Canon cap. of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</note> in this point of Simony, is of far wider

are not of any moment to us, who are out of the Pope's

Office Eccleſiaſtical. Beſides theſe, we find many Nice en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries
in the Canoniſts about Simony; As whether one can
be a Simoniſt by making a Contract with God, or the Pope?
Or by buying a Slave his Liberty, that he may enter into
Orders? Whether one can be Simonical without an intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to commit it? Whether it be Simony to give Money if the
Incumbent ſhould have had the Benefice, though he had given
nothing? Whether to give one Spiritual Thing for another?
Whether <hi>Gehazi</hi> was a Simoniſt, who made no compact, or
took any thing of the Profit till after his Maſter was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored?
Whether to give Money to an Infidel on condition
he be Baptiſed? Whether Clerks may take Money for Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Offices in Places where they are not bound to offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate?</p>
            <p>For what is Simony and what is not, is one of the moſt
perplexed Queſtions in the Canon Law. So <hi>Pius</hi> the
Fourth thought it, when he revoked many Decrees of his
immediate Predeceſſor about it, though formed by 150
Cardinals, Biſhops, and Canoniſts, and approved by moſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98108:21"/>
Univerſities in Chriſtendom, becauſe he adjudged them
too rigorous.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Felinus</hi> cites the Archdeacon of <hi>Florence,</hi> who ſaith
as much of <hi>Eugenius</hi> and <hi>Martin</hi> the Fourth, and of one of
the <hi>Urbans.</hi> For Eccleſiaſtical Simony being but <hi>malum quia
prohibitum,</hi> and only a Pontificial notion, The Popes might
correct their Breves as they ſaw occaſion, and make that
but Diſobedience in one Pontificat, which was Simony in
another. Which had the Promoters of this Cauſe well
weighed, perhaps they would not have contended ſo fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to create a new Crime, and Sect of Simoniſts unknown
to all the Canoniſts of Chriſtendom, from <hi>Innocent</hi> the IV.
to <hi>Fagnanus;</hi> and which is not to be found in any of the
Rotaes Counſils and Deciſions extant, if the caſe be ſtated
true according to the Fact, which is, That the Juriſdiction
was not ſold, but let; and not to a Clerk but a Layman.</p>
