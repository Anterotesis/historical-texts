            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE NARRATIVE OF Colonel Blood, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>AT, or about the third of <hi>January</hi> laſt, 1679. One <hi>Jane Bradley,</hi> a Widow, now and then living at the Sign of the St. <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Head, alias,</hi> the <hi>Heaven-Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern</hi> in the <hi>Old-Palace-Yard, Weſtminſter</hi> (mentioned in the Narrative that was lately pretended to be Mr. <hi>Blood</hi>'s (acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally ſeeing Mr. <hi>Blood</hi>'s Servant going by, beckon'd to him, and told him that ſhe thought ſhe had heard ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing related, by nameleſs Perſons, proper for Mr <hi>Blood</hi>'s knowledge, and therefore bad him tell him ſo, and that ſhe would ſpeak with him about it, when he came that way; which ſhe deſired might be that or the next day following; thereupon the Servant haſten'd home to his Maſters Houſe, and told him what Mrs. <hi>Bradley</hi> had ſaid.</p>
            <p>Within few dayes after Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> calling, deſired the ſaid Woman to let him know the meaning of her late meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, brought him by his Man <hi>John:</hi> She replyed, and told him, that ſhe had ſome reaſon to believe there were ſome damn'd Deſigns and Plots under Agitation, tending to the diſturbance and interuption of the preſent eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Government, and that ſhe feared the ſame was as great and dreadful, if not exceeding any that has been yet diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> asked her, with no ſmall ſurpriſe and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, why ſhe thought ſo, and by what Ccircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. <q>why, ſaid ſhe, here were two ſhabby fellows here the other Night, that told me, they had ſomething of great conſequence, in reference to the welfare of the publick, to reveal, but that they did not know how to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93444:3"/>
do it for want of ſome diſcreet Perſon whom they could confide in, and that would manage it and them warily by carrying them before the King and Council.</q> Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> hearing her ſay ſo, ſuſpected that there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the matter more than ordinary; and weighing her Apprehenſions of the Fellows in reference to the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs wherewith ſhe told him they expreſt their deſire of being rid of this Plot (for ſo they called it) replyed, that if ſhe truly thought they were fit to be taken notice of, or knew any ſecret that might be to the prejudice of the publick good, he would take care ſo to manage their pretences, as that he would engage to hand them to a ſuitable Power in order to it's receiving what they had to offer of any kind relating to the diſcovery of a Plot.</p>
            <p>Hereupon, the ſaid <hi>Jane Bradley</hi> prevailed with Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> to promiſe to call of her again that Evening at ſix of the Clock.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> inſiſted to her upon letting him know, why ſhe deſired his calling at that time, becauſe, replyed ſhe, <q>I and they have appointed a meeting about that time in order to their diſcourſing with him about the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (ſhe not naming him to them.)</q> Accordingly, Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> came much about the hour, and went into a Room below ſtairs, and asked whether the two Perſons ſhe talkt of came yet or no; ſhe replyed, and told him, Yes, they were in the Balcony Room above ſtairs.</p>
            <p>Within a quarter of an hour after the Woman came into the Room where Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> was, and told him that the ſaid two ſtrange fellows looked ſo like Rogues, that ſhe was of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion they came upon the Katch as Trapans; for their behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, whiſperings, and ill aſpects, made them ſeem to look no leſs. <q>Why, <hi>ſaid Mr.</hi> Blood, a man may be an honeſt man, though by his looks he may be thought otherwiſe, for it's oft-times obvious, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> that though the Face be the Emblem of the Heart, and that thereby mens meaſures are uſually taken yet a man may be miſtaken ſomtimes.</q> Nay, replyed the Woman, I have ſome other reaſon to think them to be ſuch. <hi>Curtis</hi> being drinking with them, and telling them that Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> was the man that they were to diſcourſe with, about being brought to the King and Council: <q>What,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93444:3"/>
                  <hi>ſaid one of them,</hi> what <hi>Blood?</hi> is that the <hi>Blood</hi> that ſtole the Crown? God damn him, we will have nothing to do with him, for he is a great Friend of the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s.</q> And a while after underſtanding that Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> was in the Houſe, and that he was the man that was to treat with them (ſhame take their Craft) they began ſuddenly to be under a reſolution different from that of ſpeaking with him, as they ſeem'd before to do if it had been another man; for calling up Mrs. <hi>Bradley,</hi> they asked her whether Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> was come: Yes, reply'd ſhe: Why, ſaid they, we have appointed a meeting with other perſons this night, that we did not think of when we came hither, which we muſt neceſſarily attend, and deſired to be excuſed for that time. <q>Pray (ſaid Mrs. <hi>Bradley)</hi> do not diſappoint him for he came of purpoſe, but could not prevail with them.</q> Where it is to be rationally ſuppoſed that this ſudden change of their purpoſe of ſpeaking with Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> (who Mrs. <hi>Bradley</hi> intended to have them to, though they knew it not) either ſprang from faint-heartedneſs and fear of diſcourſing one againſt whom they intended to lay ſnares, and ambuſhes, leſt ſomething might drop in by their behaviour that might betray their deſignes, or their being there, to be a ſufficient Circumſtance to prove that Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> was tampering with them; as in he concluſion of this Narrative they ſeem to charge him with the doing of. For it is obvious to ſee that where a Guilty Conſcience appears, to that power againſt which it has offended, there is ſcarce need of any Teſtimony to prove the Guilt: for as the ſaying is, a guilty Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence needs no accuſer, which may be properly alluded to this circumſtance of theſe two perſons altering their meeting, as above. But upon parting, Mrs. <hi>Bradley,</hi> with much ado, perſwaded one of them to ſhew himſelf to Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> that thereby it might appear they were there, and that ſhe did not tell a lye, in mentioning that ſuch an appointment was to be and not to appear ſo; who when he was paſſing by where Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> was, ſtept in and told him, ſaid he, <q>we have a buſineſs of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to diſcover, but are diſappointed and pinched as to our preſent Leiſure of diſcourſing with you about it, by reaſon (continued he) of another appointment that we
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93444:4"/>
made about this hour with others; but upon <hi>Munday</hi> morning next we will take an occaſion of waiting upon you again, and communicating to you what we are privy to: </q>and ſo withdrew immediately, accompanied with ſome others, ſuppoſed of his Confederates, who were alſo very ſhye to appear to Mr. <hi>Blood.</hi> This was the firſt time that Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> ſpoke to theſe men, though they ſeem to make out, in what you ſhall hereafter ſee, that he has been in their company, and feaſted them, and gave them money ſeveral times before.</p>
            <p>Upon this paſſage, Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> not knowing what to think of the matter, or what theſe fellows might mean by a Plot, or their coming there to diſcover it, went home immediately; whither within about an hour after <hi>Mrs. Bradley</hi> came, and repeating over her former thoughts, and opinion of the two men, in reference to their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Geſture, talking both openly, and whiſperingly, declared her ſelf ſatisfied, by what ſhe already ſaw, they were Rogues and Trapans, and that ſhe did fear, they had ſome miſchievous deſigns upon him, and therefore bad him to have a care of himſelf, by laying with all poſſible diſpatch a prevention and ſtop againſt any ſuch thing (for this was her Opinion) <q>How do you think I I can do it (replyed Mr. <hi>Blood)</hi> for I know nothing of them, neither do I know where they live? Why, ſaid ſhe, I know, and ſo told him the Directions left her, by <hi>Mr. Curtis,</hi> where their lodgings were. Why what will you have me do, replyed <hi>Blood</hi> again, to Strangers that I never ſaw before? Do, ſaid ſhe, ſeize, carry, and get them examined before one of his Majeſties Juſtices of the Peace, where they muſt upon a report of this meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and what they told me touching a Plot, give a ſatisfactory account of what they are, and what they mean, or are privy to, relating to a Plot.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> weighing the Conſequence of her Advice, and conſidering how much the ſame in it's Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances affected his ſafety and defence againſt any emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Deſign that might be probably threaten'd him, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Trouble, and expence which the finding out of theſe fellows could expoſe him to, eſpecially in theſe dangerous times, when all men Mouths ſeem to be as open
<pb n="1" facs="tcp:93444:4"/>
as their Eares, reſolved immediately to go in queſt of them; and in order thereto, went to Colonel <hi>Walcup,</hi> one of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Juſtices of the Peace, who happen'd to be then out of Town. Upon that he went in queſt of another, and met with Doctor <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> likewiſe a Juſtice of Peace, to whom he communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the whole paſſage at large; and told him that the behaviour of the aforeſaid two Fellowes towards him appeared ſo wry-necked (for thoſe were his very words) that he believed they had a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of doing him ſome miſchief, and that he thought the way to prevent them in it, and the defending himſelf againſt harm, was to get them ſeized and examin'd in order to the forcing them to declare what they pretended to be privy to relating to a Plot or any thing elce concerning him, and therefore deſired his Warrant ſo to do, and that he would pleaſe to do him the favour to go with him, in regard ſaid he, that it did meerly concern his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar part to be out of the fear of it, as well as the health of the Government ſaid to be aimed at, by what theſe fellows reported they knew.</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Chamberlain</hi> condeſcended to the giving a Warrant for the apprehending of them under the Names of <hi>Philemom Codan,</hi> and <hi>Samuel Ryther,</hi> and was as well out of friendſhip to Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> as love to the publick good, pleaſed to go in perſon himſelf to find them out taking a long with him, a Conſtable or two, and a competent number of Watchmen, and being informed that they lodged, <hi>viz.</hi> the former at one <hi>Richard Monk</hi> a Dyers Houſe, bearing the Sign of the <hi>Rainbow</hi> at the lower end of <hi>Long Aker,</hi> and the other, <hi>viz. Samuel Ryther,</hi> about the <hi>Soho,</hi> thither he went, and having taken care to ſpeak with them at either place as they came in, after ſome attendance, ſeized both at the latter of the ſaid Places, that is at <hi>Rythers</hi> Quarters, about eleven of the Clock at night. After being ſeized, Doctor <hi>Chamberlain</hi> began to examine them ſeverally, touching the Plot they pretended to be priuy to, and which they wanted a Magiſtrate to reveal to, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at they behaved themſelves with much ſtrangeneſs and ſurprize, and very pragmatically and inſolently preſſed the Juſtice to let them know what he meant, what the ground of his Apprehenſion was, or what he had to lay to their Charge? He told them that he heard they were privy to a great and dangerous Plot againſt the Tranquility of the Government; and that to diſcover the ſame, he underſtood that they did appoint a meeting that Evening about ſix In order to their revealing the ſame, to ſuch a perſon as Mrs. <hi>Bradley</hi> did bring them to, but that when they came to the place, appointed, being at the St. <hi>Johns-Head-Tavern, alias</hi> called <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:93444:5"/>
in the Old <hi>Pallace-Yard Weſtminſter,</hi> they ran away without giving any Account of what they pretended to reveal when they came either to Mrs. <hi>Bradly</hi> or her Friend, and that he underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it was about a Plot, he came purpoſely to know and receive what they had to diſcover of that kind.</p>
            <p>Whereat <hi>Samuel Ryther</hi> ſtarted up and proteſted he knew of no Plot, nor ought like it. The other, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Codan</hi> forſooth, being ask'd what the meaning of their meeting at <hi>Heaven</hi> was, if they had no Plot to diſcover? To which he replied, that it was about the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who he ſaid owed them both ſeveral hundreds of pounds upon Account of Wages, and that they wanted ſome body that was able to cope with him. How! how! replied one <hi>Thomas Curtis,</hi> that happened to ſtand by, why do you ſay ſo? Did not I hear you ſay at ſuch a place, naming it, that you knew of a greater Plot yet undiſcovered, than either Doctor <hi>Oats</hi> or Captain <hi>Bedlow</hi> ever hither to confeſſed; to which they gave no ſatisfactory Anſwer.</p>
            <p>Then Doctor <hi>Chamberlain</hi> urged again, that it was not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that any ſhould be ſo overſeen as to interpoſe between Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Servants about Wages, eſpecially ſo great a Perſon as the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was, that that could not be the reaſon of their meeting as was appointed at <hi>Heaven,</hi> and therefore told them that he could not believe, but that that was an Excuſe</p>
            <p>Upon which one of theſe men (ſeeing themſelves ſo ſtrictly ſet, and no other pretence to eſcape owning that they ſaid they knew of a Plot) ſtarts up, and fell violently upon Damming and ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, in the preſence of the Juſtice, that he would be reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and that he would ſwear and do any thing that could tend to the doing him a prejudice, and that he himſelf would ſwear <hi>Sodomy</hi> againſt him.</p>
            <p>With that Doctor <hi>Chamberlain</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> perceiving and weighing deliberately that the reſult of their Cavelling in cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Replies and Defence, was fictitious, and ſprang from their own invention; concludes, that it was ſcarce worthy their further notice, and therefore the Juſtice told him of the two that laſt ſpake, that he neither did, nor would hear any thing of the matter of <hi>Sodomy</hi> they talkt of relating to the Duke; and that he was a little unſatisfied with their evaſions and quibling ſtories, aſſerting that there was a ſufficient Witneſs by (naming <hi>Curtis)</hi> who vvas able to juſtifie that he heard them ſay they had ſomething to relate touching an Interruption deſigned to the Government, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preſſed them both to be ingenious, yet to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Then Doctor <hi>Chamberlain</hi> reſolving to leave no ſtone unturn'd,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93444:5"/>
nor any Circumſtance unrepeated, that could contribute to the having out the Truth of the matter from them, asked them jointly why, and what was the reaſon of their running away at the ſight of Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> when they appointed to meet at Mrs. <hi>Bradlies</hi> at <hi>Heaven,</hi> without giving an Account of what they came about? Becauſe, replied they, we were diffident and miſtruſtful of him, why ſo ſaid the Juſtice? Why ſaid they, we did not judg him to be a fitting perſon for our turn, in reference to what we have to offer againſt the Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> Why ſo ſaid he? becauſe replied they, we apprehended by what we heard, that he was the Dukes friend, and if we did truſt him he might probably betray us.</p>
            <p>Thereupon Doctor <hi>Chamberlain</hi> taking them for idle Fellows, had them be gone, but preſently upon ſecond Thoughts, directed them to conſider of what they had already ſaid, and to attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him at his Houſe in Eſsex-Building on the Munday morning following, where he would receive what, if any thing, they ſhould then have to offer concerning the diſcovery of a Plot.</p>
            <p>Accordingly they came accompanied with Mr. <hi>Whittaker,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jenks,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> likewiſe attended, and Doctor <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain</hi> asking them over again the meaning of thoſe ſhuffling Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries they treated him the foregoing Saturday at night with, they replied, they had a further Deſign to diſcover and carry on, relate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the welfare and Good of the publick, but would come to no particulars. Whereupon without more ado, Doctor <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain</hi> diſmiſſed them, and heard not of them for ſome time after.</p>
            <p>About the 20th of <hi>January,</hi> Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> being returned out of the Country where he then was about this time, took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſending his Man to Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> with directions that he would be pleaſed to come to him to the <hi>Buffillo-head-Tavern</hi> near the <hi>Gatehouſe</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> to drink as he thought, a Glaſs of Wine with him; who preſently came, where finding, to his ſurprize, Mr. <hi>Ryther</hi> and Mr. <hi>Codan,</hi> together with Mr <hi>Whittaker</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jenks</hi> in Sir <hi>Williams</hi> Company, ſtarted not ſo much at their being there (I mean Mr. <hi>Ryther</hi> and <hi>Codan)</hi> but at the ſudden change of the dreſs of the ſaid two, who from the degree of Porter-like fellows (for ſuch like, or worſe they appeared to be when they were exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined before Doctor <hi>Chamberlain)</hi> got into fine Rigging, ſuch as near Clothes, good Perrivvigs, new Hats, clean Linnen, Swords and all other Accoutrements anſwerable, ſo that Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> did ſcarce know them, and ſo ſaid nothing for a little time.</p>
            <p>After the drinking a Glaſs or two of Wine, Sir <hi>William</hi> began to open the Matter, and told Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> why he ſent for him, and withal, that he was very much troubled at the misfortune he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93444:6"/>
lately brought himſelf under, and that not only upon the Account of his being a Neighbour, and a long Acquaintance, but for ſome other Reaſons, which he did not think fit then to mention.</p>
            <p>What misfortune do you mean, replied Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> I do not underſtand you? Why, ſaid Sir <hi>William,</hi> theſe two Gentlemen (pointing at Mr. <hi>Ryther</hi> and <hi>Codan,</hi> that ſate by) are come hither before me, to depoſe upon Oath, that you as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate have attempted at ſeveral times to corrupt them by money, and the proſpect of other conſiderable Rewards, to ſwear and falſly to accuſe and charge his Grace the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> with <hi>Sodomy.</hi> How! What do you mean, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>replied Mr. <hi>Blood?</hi> what is the matter, I do not know what you ſay?</p>
            <p>Whereat <hi>Philemon Coddan</hi> ſtarted up, almoſt diſguis'd (for Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> could ſcarce remember where he ſaw him, becauſe he got ſo finely Rigged of a ſuddain) and ſaid, Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> you would ſuborn us to ſwear Buggery againſt the Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> O ſhame on you replied <hi>Blood,</hi> can you be ſo Impudent, as to invent ſuch a thing of Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> that is a Stranger to you, and who never ſaw you in his Life, but before Doctor <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> and one time at <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At which <hi>Mr. Jenks</hi> and Mr. <hi>Whittaker</hi> ſitting by, jointly interpoſing, ſtood up and took the opportunity of backing him that laſt ſpake, and ſaid, come Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> come, as God gave you Reaſon, Wiſdome and Underſtanding; be honeſt, and juſt, and Confeſs.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> being ſomething concerned thereat, replied, ſaying, you that have been theſe two years laſt paſt imployed to aſperſe <hi>Mr, Blood,</hi> do you appear in ſuch a Game as this, is your Invention no better?</p>
            <p>Then directing his Diſcourſe to Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> askt him what the matter was, or what made thoſe two men run away from <hi>Heaven</hi> without ſaying of any thing of this kind, and why did they Damme and ſink themſelves, when they came afterwards before Doctor <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> that they would ruine the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> by Oath or any other Act that could inable them to reach him. Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> replied, that they ſaid ſo on Purpoſe, and in Order to the carrying on a greater Deſign; further aſſerting that theſe Gentlemen (for ſo they were pleaſed to call them, were honeſt men, whereupon Mr. <hi>Jenks</hi> and Mr. <hi>Whittaker</hi> jointly preſt, that they meaning <hi>Codan</hi> and <hi>Ryther,</hi> were very honeſt men, and therefore deſired that Sir <hi>William</hi> would be pleaſed to exerciſe Juſtice on Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> in their behalf.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> thereat deſired Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> with Civility, that he would bring in two perſons for his Bail, inſtancing at the ſame time Mr. <hi>Jarrat</hi> and another Gentleman, that were friends of Mr. <hi>Bloods,</hi> Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> replied, that he would take time to conſider of the validity of his Advice, and wait upon them with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of what he would reſolve upon another time, for ſuch things were not to be done raſhly.</p>
            <p>Accordingly Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> quitted the Company friendly and went about his buſineſs</p>
            <p>Next morning he went to Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> to his houſe, where he found Mr. <hi>Whittaker</hi> and being askt by Sir <hi>William,</hi> have you brought your friends Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> as I deſired you, no replied Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> nor will till I know for what, and then deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Copy of the mittimus that he was to be Committed by, for by that ſaid he I ſhal be able to know how I ſhall proportion my Bail.</p>
            <p>Upon which Sir <hi>William</hi> begg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d that he would not proceed according to that method or Courſe, but follow his directions, and put in Bail. Which Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> perſiſted in his declining the doing of it, declaring that he would inſiſt upon being treated by him according to the form of Law, and therefore deſired to know what he ſtood charged with, by letting him have a Coppy of his mittimus, which Sir <hi>William</hi> did.</p>
            <p>The next day a Conſtable came to Mr. <hi>Bloods</hi> Houſe in the name of Sir <hi>William</hi> and deſired to ſpeak with him, notice whereof being carried to Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened then to be in bed; he ſent his man to Sir <hi>William</hi> to tell him that as ſoon as he waf up, and made an end of ſome Affairs that he was obliged to ſee diſpatcht that morning at Court, he would wait upon him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:93444:6"/>
Immediately Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> got up, and went to Court accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and upon his return thence, which was within ſome ſmall time after, he met a Conſtable at the upper end of <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> who deſiring him to ſtep aſide a little into an Alley that was hard by, told him he had a Warrant (miſtaking a Warrant for a <hi>Mittimus)</hi> againſt him from Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> and that if he pleaſed to ſtep into any Houſe hard by, he would follow him, without expoſing the paſſage to the view of any, that upon ſeeing a Conſtable in his company might be apt to gueſs of his being in trouble; Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> thereupon went to the Dog-Tavern, next door to the <hi>Gate-houſe,</hi> whither the ſaid Officer followed him, and ſhew'd him his Authority from Sir <hi>William,</hi> which was in the following words, <hi>(Viz.)</hi>

the thirtieth day of <hi>January,</hi> for the apprehending and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> to Goal, by the vertue of the ſame, and imagining that the Conſtable did his Duty that day accordingly in laying of him up, the Printer had ſome how notice thereof brought him, and ſo diſpers'd it. But Sir <hi>William</hi> ſoon heard of the miſtake, for ſending upon the ſaid <hi>Saturday,</hi> about three in the afternoon, one of the ſaid Witneſſes from the Cock-Ale-Houſe near <hi>Temple-Bar</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> to know of the Conſtable how he had diſpoſed of Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> he found the Conſtable was with Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> at the Dog-Tavern, who ſending for the Conſtable into another Room, asked him why Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> was not carried to Priſon before that time? Why, replyed the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, I do not know how Sir <hi>William</hi> can juſtifie me in what I have done; for, ſaid he, when Sir <hi>William</hi> gave this <hi>Mittimus,</hi> I told him, that I durſt not carry him to Goal before he was firſt carried by Virtue of a Warrant before a Juſtice of Peace, and thence, according as the Crime appear'd, or ſworn againſt him, Committed; and then he told me, that he would bear me out in it, but now I find to the contrary; and beſides that, I have opened the Buſineſs to two of my Acquaintance, whom I accidentally met with here, and that are now Conſtables of this Pariſh, who tell me, that it is in the Power of Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> to bring me under great trouble, for my inadvertency in the thing, which pray go and tell him, and that if Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> hath a mind to go, I neither dare nor will keep him one minute lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in my Cuſtody.</p>
            <p>In this interval of time, Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> taking notice of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and obſerving that the Conſtable abſented from his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany a good while, and taking notice alſo, that he was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly called for into another Room, to ſpeak with one, and deſirous to know who it was, or what the matter might be, ſent out one of his Friends to learn who it was, who upon his return brought word, that it was one of the Witneſſes againſt him, that came from Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> but what his Meſſage or Buſineſs was he knew not, but that they were together in the Houſe. Whereupon the ſaid Witneſs going back imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately again to Sir <hi>William</hi> to tell him what the Conſtable ſaid touching his incapacity of detaining Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> without a Warrant; the Conſtable came in to Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> but did not then tell him the Paſſages that happened between him and the two Conſtables about the danger he was in, nor the Meſſage that the ſaid Witneſs came upon, or that he went back to Sir <hi>William</hi> for a Warrant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:93444:7"/>
Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> took occaſion then of telling the Conſtable of his inadvertency, and that if he (meaning himſelf) were a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome Man, he could have trounc'd him; how? replyed the Conſtable, and for what? For detaining me here, replyed Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> unlawfully, for I know what a Juſtice of Peace ought to do in Caſes of this kind; but, ſays he, as you are a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and a civil Man, I ſcorn to take the advantage of you, though I might bring my Action at Law againſt you, and make you pay me ſo much an hour for falſe Impriſonment.</p>
            <p>This Diſcourſe was ſcarce at an end, but the Conſtable was ſent for a ſecond time out of Mr. <hi>Blood</hi>'s Company to ſpeak with this Witneſs, who was by this time hurried back from Sir <hi>William,</hi> who preſently, when he underſtood what the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſaid of his not daring to hold Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> without a Warrant, ſent him down with one, dated the one and thirtieth of <hi>January;</hi> upon the delivery whereof to the Conſtable the Witneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, and the conſtable came to Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> and told him the whole ſtory, and withal, that juſt then Sir <hi>William</hi> ſent him a Warrant, and what paſs'd between him and the Witneſs before, and that he did purpoſe to diſcharge Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> without any more ado, had not that Warrant been brought him, acknowledging, that he could not anſwer his detaining of him ſo long without it: A Copy of which Warrant, for the Readers further ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is as followeth, <hi>(Viz.)</hi>

            <p>Here it may be moſt naturally inferr'd from the Premiſſes, that there was nothing more aimed at in theſe Proceedings, than to hurry Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> to Goal, purpoſely to bring him at firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der publick ſcandal, and then to ſtrip him of the good eſteem of his Friends, by turning them all againſt him, and (to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat their work) to poſſeſs Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> ſtood guilty of capital offences, ſuch as Conſpiracy againſt the Kings Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore fit to be confined, for there lay the knack of the Intrigue; for the original meeting of the two Witneſſes at <hi>Heaven</hi> was intended only to ſerve as a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their having ſeen him there, and accordingly to be made uſe of by them, when ever they came to prove what they were then imployed upon: for when they underſtood by <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Curtis,</hi> when they firſt came to <hi>Heaven,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> was the Perſon that was to introduce them to the King and Council, in order to their detecting and divulging the Plot that they preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be privy to, exceeding in greatneſs, as they called it, any that has been yet diſcovered by Dr <hi>Oates</hi> or Captain <hi>Bedloe,</hi> they excepted againſt Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> (though they came thither upon no other ſcore than to furniſh themſelves with Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances) ſaying, Is not that the <hi>Blood</hi> that ſtole the Crown? God damn him, we will have nothing to do with him, for he is too great a Friend of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s. Then to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh in Print, that he was a Priſoner, to the end that the ſame might be diſpers'd over all the Nation, and the People poſſeſs'd, (eſpecially his Friends) that it was for high miſdemeanours, and conſequently not bailable; and then for haſt, becauſe his Reputation ſhould not eſcape, being gull'd to take him up by a <hi>Mittimus,</hi> on purpoſe to run him into Priſon; and finding that way not to take, then to take him by a Warrant.</p>
            <p>After the Warrant was thus brought, Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable continued together till it was about ſix of the Clock, (for till then no Juſtice of Peace could be found) when Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> gave in Bail to the value of forty Pounds before Sir <hi>William Poultney,</hi> to anſwer this monſtrous Accuſation, for ſuch they made Sir <hi>William VValler</hi> believe it to be.</p>

               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:93444:8"/>
Within few days after, Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> happening to meet with one Mr. <hi>Burrowes,</hi> a Cabinet-ſeller in the <hi>Strand,</hi> they both by conſent went to the <hi>Kings-head-Tavern</hi> in <hi>Chancery-Lane</hi> to drink a Glaſs of Wine, where being accompanied by one or two more Gentlemen, Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> among other Paſſages, began to mention Sir <hi>VVilliam VVallers</hi>'s unkind uſage of, and behaviour towards him; whereat Mr. <hi>Burrowes</hi> ask'd him wherein? Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> replyed, that when he was ſent for the other day by Sir <hi>VVilliam,</hi> to give in Bail to anſwer the Charge ſworn againſt him by the two Witneſſes, he ask'd Sir <hi>VVilliam,</hi> do you heed theſe Fellows? you ſhould rather ſecure, and lay them by the heels, for they did own before Doctor <hi>Chamberlaine,</hi> and ſeveral Witneſſes, that they did run away from <hi>Heaven</hi> without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him, becauſe they thought he was too great a Friend to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and that they then ſwore ſeveral times God damn them, they would deſtroy the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi> by Oath, or any thing elſe they could reach him with; and thereupon Sir <hi>VVilliam</hi> ask'd them both at that very inſtant of time, whether they knew or ſaid any ſuch thing touching the Duke? and that they thereupon acknowledged they ſaid ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Doctor <hi>Chamberlaine;</hi> yet Sir <hi>VVilliam</hi> did, notwithſtanding that, tell Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> (touching him on the Sleeve) that they were both honeſt Men for all this; at which Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> anſwered, Then the Devil is honeſt. Upon which Mr. <hi>Burrowes,</hi> ſeeming to be very unwilling to believe, that Sir <hi>VVilliam</hi> could be guilty of ſo great an error; Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> upon his own free accord, ſent his Man to ſee if he could find out Sir <hi>VVilliam,</hi> and if he did, to deſire him to come to him to the Tavern, to the end Mr. <hi>Burrowes</hi> ſhould ſee and hear Sir <hi>VVilliam</hi> himſelf own to his face what Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> ſaid, touching him in this Particular. Sir <hi>VVilliam</hi> being come accordingly, Mr. <hi>Burrowes</hi> opened the matter, and, by way of reproach, began to charge Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> with his having ſcandalized Sir <hi>VVilliam</hi> behind his back, in ſaying; that he did diſpence with the two Witneſſes, when he ſaid they were honeſt Men: I do not know, replyed Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> that he gave them a Diſpenſation, or that he did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe With them; but that I ſaid either the one or t'other, I confeſs; and then Sir <hi>VVilliam</hi> being ask'd if he ſaid ſo or no? Yes, replyed Sir <hi>VVilliam,</hi> I own I ſaid ſo; yet it has been ſince induſtriouſly reported, that Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> took occaſion of railing againſt Sir <hi>VVilliam VValler</hi> before ſome company; and ſome Perſon thereof concerned for Sir <hi>VVilliam,</hi> obſerving the ſame,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93444:9"/>
ſhould ſend for Sir <hi>William</hi> before the Company broke up, and that when Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> was charged therewith before Sir <hi>William</hi> by that Party who was ſaid to be ſo concern'd, he ſhould deny it, which Mr <hi>Blood</hi> is ready to prove if need be; and it is believed Sir <hi>William</hi> himſelf will own it if need be.</p>
            <p>Mrs. <hi>Bradley,</hi> the Woman at <hi>Heaven,</hi> was much about the ſame time brought upon the ſame Stage with Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> and it ſeems upon the like ſcore; for Sir <hi>William</hi> being jealous that Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> held correſpondence with <hi>Thomas Curtis,</hi> ſent for her to know how long Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> knew the ſaid <hi>Curtis;</hi> ſhe told him that ſhe thought he never ſaw him but once, which was before Doctor <hi>Chamberlaine;</hi> whereat Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> not willing to believe her Anſwer, told her that ſhe lyed, it was no ſuch thing, but that they correſponded; you may believe me, replyed the Woman, if you pleaſe, for I do not lie.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>William</hi> not ſatisfied herewith, on the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her with a Conſtable, and cauſed her to be brought before him. When ſhe came, he asked her where her Bail was, I have them here, quoth ſhe; who are they? ſaid he; ſo ſhe told him; but he not liking them, commanded the Conſtable to do his Duty, and carry her to Goal; the Conſtable hearing him ſo ſay, and knowing her to be a Neighbour, carried her to Mr. <hi>Church</hi> his Houſe, where ſhe continued till next day, when ſhe gave in Bail before Sir <hi>William Poultney</hi> to the value of two Hundred Pounds.</p>
            <p>The meaning of this Paſſage being mention'd here is this. When the two Witneſſes came firſt to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and went up ſtairs to drink, it happened that one of Mrs. <hi>Bradley</hi>'s Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, being a Woman-kind, was in the next Room to them, who ſuſpecting them to be Bailiffs, or ſuch like Fellows, (for their outward condition made them look no better) ſhe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally liſtened to know what they might ſay, or came about. By and by one of them ſaid, How ſhall we do this? God damn me, ſaid t'other, we will do this Rogue <hi>Blood</hi>'s buſineſs for him, and get Oaths enough to ſwear againſt him by that time Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> comes to Town.</p>
            <p>Upon this Mrs. <hi>Bradley</hi>'s Friend for the preſent ſaid nothing of the matter to her, but told it the next day to another Friend, who took no notice of it neither at that time. But ſeeing Mrs. <hi>Bradley</hi> brought under trouble about a fortnight after, as you heard before, both came and told her what the two Witneſſes ſaid of Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> when they were above in the Balcony Room,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93444:9"/>
and how they ſwore they would do Mr. <hi>Blood</hi>'s buſineſs, and would find Oaths enough againſt him by that time Sir <hi>William</hi> came to Town. Hereupon Mrs. <hi>Bradley</hi> had both before a Juſtice, to have them ſwear the Matter of Fact, which they accordingly did; which Depoſitions are to be ſeen in due time. From whence it may be pertinently inferr'd, that the ſaid Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes were then brewing what they have ſince broached in the following manner.</p>
            <p>Firſt they frame and contrive, that <hi>Maurice Hickey,</hi> aliàs <hi>Hig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, Robert Smith,</hi> aliàs <hi>Jones, John Haley, Thomas Curtis, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Blood, Edward Chriſtian, Arthur O-Bryan, Phillyp la Mere,</hi> and <hi>Jane Bradley,</hi> did by unlawful means and ways, between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, conſpire to rob the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> not only of his Honour and Reputation, as a Peer of <hi>England,</hi> but likewiſe of his Life, upon a preſumption of his committing Sodomy with one <hi>Sarah Harwood;</hi> and in order to the convicting and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the ſaid Duke of the ſame, they did invent, that they the ſaid Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> and Company afore-mention'd, did agree with two of the ſaid Dukes Servants, namely <hi>Philemon Coddan,</hi> and <hi>Samuel Ryther,</hi> to pay them ſeveral hundreds of Pounds, upon condition that they would ſuffer themſelves to be prevailed with to come as Evidences, and ſwear, when the matter of Fact was brought to a Tryal, that they did hear <hi>Sarah Harwood</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare ſuch and ſuch things againſt the ſaid Duke; (meaning Sodomy with her, and ſeveral others) and that, beſides theſe ſeveral Sums of Money thus invented to be agreed upon to be in hand paid, they ſhould engage to ſecure them the ſaid <hi>Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> and <hi>Ryther</hi> of conſiderable Annuities for Life, and the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the beſt Noble-men in <hi>England,</hi> to vindicate them in whatever they did.</p>
            <p>That previous to all this, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> and the reſt of them, ſhould be invented to have expended ſundry great Sums of Money upon theſe two Fellows in Junkets, Treats, and ſo forth, before they could be brought to ſwear to this ſubornati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the Duke. In manner following, <hi>viz.</hi> That the ſaid <hi>Philemon Coddan,</hi> and <hi>Samuel Ryther,</hi> ſhould Sign a Paper ready drawn, wherein they were to certifie, that they did hear the ſaid <hi>Sarah Harwood</hi> confeſs and declare before them, that his Grace the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> did forcibly enter both her Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities, as far as he could go, ſtop'd her Breath, and then ſent her away; by which conveyance the King loſt his Evidence. That they were further (as they contrived it themſelves) to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93444:10"/>
teſtifie, that the ſaid Duke ordered the ſaid <hi>Sarah Harwood</hi> to be murthered, or conveyed to, and ſold beyond the Seas, and that he had committed the like on ſeveral others, which they were to be ready to prove when called thereto: And that this Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be ſent (by direction of Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> and the reſt above-mentioned) by <hi>Maurice Hicky</hi> to a certain place in <hi>Bloomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry,</hi> where he was to meet with the ſaid <hi>Ryther</hi> and <hi>Coddan,</hi> and being met there, to offer both or either of them that came 300 Pieces of Gold, provided they Signed the foregoing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, and if they did not, to ſtab them; but if they did Sign, to give them the Gold. That <hi>Ryther</hi> being come alone, and offered the Gold and Inſtrument by Mr <hi>Hickey,</hi> he ſhould deſire to have a little leiſure of peruſing and pauſing upon it in the next room, and when that, to eſcape and run away to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Sollicitour, and tell him that he was ſet upon in ſuch a place by <hi>Maurice Hickey</hi> in the name of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> and others to ſign that Paper (which he was to bring with him) and take ſo much Gold for his pains, or elſe to be killed. And that upon this eſcape, <hi>Hickey,</hi> thus out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witted, was to ſay, when he underſtood by the Woman of the Houſe that he was gone, that he and Partners were undone, and ſo fled. And the next day after, the better to carry on the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, without ſuſpition, to bid <hi>100 l.</hi> in the Intelligence to any that could give tydings of this <hi>Hickey,</hi> in the following manner, <hi>viz.</hi> That whereas one <hi>Maurice Hickey</hi> had tempted one <hi>Samuel Ryther,</hi> a Servant of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham's,</hi> to Sign to a certain Paper, (meaning the foregoing Inſtrument) containing mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters tending to the taking away the Life of his Grace the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and that he offered him 300 Pieces of Gold for his condeſcention thereto; and whereas the ſaid <hi>Samuel Ryther</hi> did not only deny the ſame, but ran away; and that the ſaid <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice Hickey</hi> did thereupon fly, and could not be heard of, then to bid 100 <hi>l.</hi> in the Intelligence to any that could bring tidings of him to Mr. <hi>Whitaker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this any Man may plainly ſee, that theſe Fellows were not idle in carrying on what they damn'd themſelves they would, againſt Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> when they were over-heard at <hi>Heaven,</hi> where they ſaid we will find Oaths enough to ſwear againſt him by that time Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> comes to Town; for when Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> came home, it's worth the Readers notice to remember, how he ſent for Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> preſently to the <hi>Buffillo-Tavern,</hi> where theſe Fellows were; how Sir <hi>William</hi> was prevailed with
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93444:10"/>
to preſs Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> to give in Bail to anſwer what they ſwore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; what haſt was made in running him to Priſon, by laying hold of him firſt by a <hi>Mittimus,</hi> and then by a Warrant, as by the foregoing appears; and then to have it declared and cryed about the ſtreets, that he was in Priſon, when he was not; and how Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> was diſappointed by thoſe Hands who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to have them forthwith coming before that Juſtice of Peace in <hi>Westminſter</hi> that took examination on his behalf, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer what he had to accuſe them of, but did not: for Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> having examin'd Witneſſes before a Juſtice in the Liberty of <hi>Westminſter,</hi> before whom a Conſpiracy was proved to be on foot againſt Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> and finding that theſe Fellows were, by the report of the Neighbourhood, fled from their Habitations, he ſent a Gentleman of his Acquaintance to Sir <hi>William VValler,</hi> to deſire and require of him, that in regard, and for as much as he had promiſed to take good Security for the forth-coming of the ſaid Perſons, and their appearing before that Authority that took examinations on his behalf, when required, he would pleaſe to produce them, to the end they might be bound over to anſwer what ever Charge Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> had to offer againſt them, and he thereby obtain equal Juſtice. Sir <hi>William</hi> was pleaſed to ſay, that he was not obliged to take any Security for their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, nor would he bring them forth, adding, that Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> was unkind for abuſing him for his civility, (meaning the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage touching Mr. <hi>Burrowes.)</hi> Upon this the Gentleman urged, that it was Mr. <hi>Blood</hi>'s opinion that he was not over kind to him, who had been ſo long his Neighbour and Acquaintance, and one by whom he never knew any ill.</p>
            <p>To which Sir <hi>William</hi> anſwered, That he had done his Duty as to the Method wherein he took their Oaths; and as to thoſe Circumſtances which he charged him with the neglect of, they muſt make them out as they can, when the Matter comes to be decided by a Tryal.</p>
            <p>Upon this Mr. <hi>Blood</hi>'s Friend came back, and gave him an account what paſſed between him and Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> and how he denyed the bringing forth of the two Perſons. It's plainly to be ſeen from the foregoing Circumſtances, that there was no labour ſpared towards the ſetting of Sir <hi>William</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> by the ears.</p>
            <p>Whereupon Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> not well knowing how to help him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or what remedy to retort to, at laſt he went to, and directed Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> to put them into his Intelligence, in the Words following, <hi>viz. Whereas</hi> Philemon Codan <hi>and</hi> Samuel Ryther,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93444:11"/>
               <hi>pretended Servants to his Grace the Duke of</hi> Buckingham, <hi>did falſly aſperſe</hi> Thomas Blood <hi>
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> that he would have ſuborned them to ſwear ſome notorious Crimes againſt the ſaid Duke, (who now abſcond themſelves.) If any can give notice of the ſaid</hi> Philemon Coddan <hi>and</hi> Samuel Ryther, <hi>unto the ſaid</hi> Thomas Blood <hi>
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> at his Houſe over the Bowling-Alley in</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>or to</hi> Dorman New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>at the</hi> Kings-Arms <hi>in the</hi> Poultry, <hi>they ſhall be well rewarded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When this was cryed about the ſtreets, and a Reward profer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any that could tell where theſe Fellows were, one Mrs. <hi>Stringer,</hi> that keeps a Cup of Ale to ſell at the lower end of <hi>Long-Acre,</hi> happened to buy the Intelligence, and knowing theſe Perſons, when mentioned, and where they lay, came to Mr <hi>Blood</hi>'s Houſe to let him know where they lay, under hopes, it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, of receiving the promiſed Revvard; but miſſing of Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> at home, left vvord at his Houſe, that ſhe lived at ſuch a Place, that her Name vvas <hi>Stringer,</hi> and that ſhe came to give ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of <hi>Coddan</hi> and <hi>Ryther,</hi> vvhom ſhe heard cry'd in the Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and that if he came to her, ſhe vvould tell him more of them.</p>
            <p>When Mr <hi>Blood</hi> heard this, he ſent preſently to the Woman to let him knovv vvhat account ſhe had to give of them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſhe told them he ſent, that ſhe knevv <hi>Philemon Coddan</hi> and <hi>Samuel Ryther,</hi> mentioned in Mr. <hi>Thompſons</hi> Intelligence, very vvell, that <hi>Coddan</hi> lodged in the next Houſe, <hi>viz.</hi> at Mr. <hi>Monkes</hi> a Dyer, for ſome time, that he vvas indebted to her for Drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereupon Mr. <hi>Bloods</hi> Friends deſired her to let them knovv, if ſhe could tell vvhere the ſaid Perſons lay novv? ſhe told them in the City at a Shoomakers in <hi>Walbrook;</hi> notice vvhere of being brought back to Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> he vvas adviſed to have her, by War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, carried before a Juſtice of Peace, as alſo Mr. <hi>Monk</hi> the Dyer, to be examined touching their knovvledge of theſe Perſons; vvhich he accordingly did, vvhere being both come, Mrs. <hi>Strin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> gave relation of them both to the follovving purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Juſtice ask'd her and Mr. <hi>Monk</hi> both, <hi>1ſt.</hi> Whether they knevv any thing relating to the Plot? they reply'd, No. Have you ever taken the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy or not? they replyed, Yes: Then you knovv that thoſe Oaths bind you to be true and faithful to the King; Yes, they knevv that, they ſaid: Then the Juſtice took Mrs. <hi>Stringer</hi> ſingly to task, asking her, vvhether ſhe knevv <hi>Coddan, Ryther,</hi> or <hi>Hickey?</hi> Yes, ſaid ſhe, I knovv them all three conſtant Companions together, and that they uſually reſorted to her Cellar, accompanied great many times by other <hi>Iriſh</hi> Men, vvho vvere of their Gang, and vvhoſe Names
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93444:11"/>
ſhe knew not, though they all together dyeted with her common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Have you taken any notice of any diſcourſe they had when they were together? replyed the Juſtice. Why, replyed the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, when they diſcourſed about any thing that they would not have me, or the Houſe privy to, they uſually ſpoke <hi>Iriſh.</hi> And being asked, whether ſhe knew any remarkable thing or paſſage relating to any of the three under preſent debate. Yes, ſaid ſhe: What is't? Why, ſaid ſhe, the day after <hi>Hickey</hi> was cryed in the Intelligence, and one hundred Pounds bid to any that could diſcover him, ſhe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpied him go by her door in very great haſt, and being indebted to her, ſhe ran after him, and with much ado overtook him in ſuch a Sweat, that every drop that came from him looked as big as a Pea; being overtook, ſhe asked him for the Money he owed her, for, ſaid ſhe, we are very Poor People, and new Beginners, and you would do very well to pay us. Whereto Mr. <hi>Hickey</hi> reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I am, ſaid he, going into the City to Mr. <hi>Coddan,</hi> and though I am diſappointed at preſent, yet it ſhall not be long before I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent you; and not only that, but I will ſpeak to Mr. <hi>Coddan</hi> to do the like for what he owes you.</p>
            <p>The next day, being the ſecond day after <hi>Hickey</hi> was cryed in the Intelligence <hi>Coddan</hi> himſelf came to Mr. <hi>Monkes,</hi> whom he owed Money to alſo for Lodging, where I happening to ſee him, quoth the Woman, I went and ſpoke to him before Mr. <hi>Monk,</hi> and told him, I ſaw and ſpoke with Mr. <hi>Hickey,</hi> ſaid ſhe, yeſterday about my Money, and he told me that he was going into the City to ſpeak with you: Yes, replyed <hi>Coddan,</hi> he was with me yeſterday, and told me what you ſaid to him. But, ſaid the Woman, Mr. <hi>Coddan,</hi> I hear that Mr. <hi>Hickey</hi> is in the Intelligence; no, ſaid <hi>Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> you are miſtaken, it's another. Whereupon he went away, and called within two days after at Mr. <hi>Monkes</hi> Shop, where I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be, ſaid the Woman, and I hear, (continued ſhe to Mr. <hi>Coddan)</hi> that <hi>Hickey</hi> is in the <hi>Gate-houſe,</hi> and did not I tell you before, that I was ſure it was the ſame <hi>Hickey</hi> that was cryed in the Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence the other day. <hi>Coddan</hi> replyed to Mr. <hi>Monk</hi> and ſhe, ſaying, I was not willing you ſhould take him, becauſe I had a mind to take him my ſelf. Whereupon the Woman told the Juſtice, that the ſaid <hi>Coddan</hi> owing her Money, ſhe went ſeveral times to demand it, but to little purpoſe; and being loſt for ſome time, ſhe heard at laſt that he lay in <hi>London,</hi> whither ſhe and her Husband went on a <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> morning to demand their Debt, not exceeding five Shillings. He reply'd, Damn him, he would pay her no Money, if it were to ſave her Life from the Gallowes, or her Soul from Hell, and ſo would not pay her one farthing, though he ſhewed a great quantity of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93444:12"/>
that he had about him. At which her Husband went with a Friend to the <hi>Gate-houſe,</hi> where he found the ſaid <hi>Hickey</hi> with the Campaigne Coat that <hi>Coddan</hi> had on his back, when <hi>Hickey</hi> was in the Intelligence.</p>

Here the Reader may, with little trouble, undo the Snare, as well as unriddle the whole Plot laid againſt the Innocence of Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> and others, if he will but pleaſe to conſider,</p>
            <p>Firſt, the manner of the two Witneſſes firſt coming to the Woman at <hi>Heaven,</hi> what they were over-heard to ſay againſt Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> ſaying (when they were told by Mr. <hi>Curtis,</hi> that he was the man, that was to treat with them touching what they came about,) <hi>Is that the</hi> Blood <hi>that ſtole the Crown? God Damn him, we'll have nothing to do with him, for he's the Dukes Friend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Their ſaying at <hi>Heaven, How ſhall we do?</hi> ſaid the ſame again, <hi>God Damn me! we will do</hi> Blood<hi>'s bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs for him, and find Oaths enough againſt him by that time Sir.</hi> W. W. <hi>comes to Town.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Their Confeſſion before Doctor <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> where they acknowledged they would have told the Plot to Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> when they met, but that they knew he was the Dukes Friend, and therefore durſt not truſt him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, How he has been treated by Sir <hi>W. W.</hi> through the inſtigation of others, and endeavoured to be hurryed into Priſon, firſt by a <hi>Mittimus,</hi> and then by a <hi>Warrant;</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that he was in Priſon, when he was not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, How they invented the Paper which was to be ſigned by <hi>Coddan</hi> and <hi>Ryther,</hi> certifying that <hi>Sarah Harwood</hi> ſaid before them that the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> did ſo and ſo with her, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, How <hi>Maurice Hickey</hi> ſhould appoint a meeting with this <hi>Coddan</hi> and <hi>Ryther</hi> at a certain place in <hi>Bloomsberry,</hi> where he was to pay them 300 pieces of Gold, in the name of himſelf, Mr. <hi>Blood, &amp;c.</hi> upon their ſigning the ſaid Paper.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, How when <hi>Hickey</hi> came (as the pretence would make it be believed) <hi>Ryther</hi> only appear'd; where it was ſo contrived, that when <hi>Hickey</hi> ſhould offer him the Paper to ſign, <hi>Ryther</hi> ſhould deſire the liberty of conſidering on it in the next Room, and then like a faithful Servant forſooth, to make his eſcape, and run to a place hard by, where it is credibly reported his Teachers attended his coming out of ſuch a danger (here is a delivery with a vengeance!) and pretend that one <hi>Maurice Hickey,</hi> and others did tempt him with ſo much monyes for ſigning ſuch a Paper, and that if
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93444:13"/>
he did not, they the ſaid <hi>Hickey,</hi> and Company, ſhould ſtab him; that the ſaid Paper tended to the ruin of his maſter the Duke, and that therefore it was wery Proper to lay the ſaid <hi>Hickey</hi> by the Heels.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, That when <hi>Hickey</hi> underſtood that <hi>Ryther</hi> went thus away, unknown to him as he pretetended, he ſhould thereupon tell the Woman of the Houſe, <hi>we are all undone;</hi> for the information, its ſuppoſed, of thoſe that waited hard by, who when they ſhould repair where <hi>Hickey</hi> was, upon this alarum carried them by <hi>Ryther,</hi> and that they knew <hi>Hickey</hi> was fled, were to come under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſeizing him.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, When <hi>Hickey</hi> was thus fled, Mr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> to bid 100 <hi>l.</hi> in the Intelligence to any man that could appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him, and give notice thereof to the ſaid Dukes At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney, living near S. <hi>Thomas Apoſtles.</hi> Where to their, <hi>viz. Coddan</hi> and <hi>Ryther's</hi> never to be forgotten reproach, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy and ſhame (if they had or have any) it plainly, and undeniably appears, by Mr. <hi>Stringer,</hi> and <hi>Monks</hi> Depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons aforeſaid, that every day, both while he the ſaid <hi>Hickey</hi> was ſo cryed after, and till he was taken, or ſurrender'd, (it matters not which, though the laſt is the propereſt and neareſt to the matter) that <hi>Hickey</hi> who thus was hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after, and a 100 <hi>l.</hi> bid to take him, was every day in the Company of <hi>Ryther,</hi> who pretends to refuſe the 300 pieces for ſigning the Paper, and might tell Mr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> where he vvas if he liſted, <hi>Coddan</hi> might do the ſame too. And being together, as <hi>Monk</hi> and <hi>Stringer</hi> make it out, <hi>Hickey</hi> might as well then, as at the meeting at <hi>Bloomsberry,</hi> kill <hi>Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> if he liſted, and <hi>Coddan</hi> too: And if <hi>Coddan</hi> and <hi>Ryther</hi> were ſuch honeſt men as <hi>Mr. Jenks</hi> and <hi>Mr. Whitaker</hi> ſaid and told <hi>Mr. Blood,</hi> before Sir <hi>W. W.</hi> they were, they would certainly have ſhewed themſelves ſuch, by diſcovering <hi>Hickey</hi> to Mr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> gratis, without ſuffering him to be at the charge of ſo much money as he publickly bid to any that ſhould take him: But their ill management of it makes it evidently plain, that when the whole matter vvas to be brought to an iſſue they did hope to make appear that Mr. <hi>Blood, &amp;c.</hi> were tampering with theſe two Witneſſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sir <hi>W. W.</hi> to charge a falſe thing upon the Duke; and to make it look the better, ſo to bring in this <hi>Hic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and</hi> others, who, upon being pardoned (which <hi>Hickey</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt, is ſaid to have attempted the doing of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93444:13"/>
ſince his confinement) were to become the Kings Evidence, and ſwear in Conjunction with the reſt, that Mr. <hi>Blood, &amp;c.</hi> did tempt them to the Fact, that they otherwiſe knew nothing of it; that in fine, the whole was a Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to bring an odium upon Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> and his Friends.</p>
            <p>Immediatly, upon Mr. <hi>Blood</hi>'s having them thus cryed after, in Mr. <hi>Thompſons</hi> Intelligence, in order to the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them to that Juſtice of Peace in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> (before vvhom it vvas proved that they really Conſpired againſt Mr. <hi>Blood, &amp;c.)</hi> to anſvver the ſame, the ſaid tvvo Perſons thought fit, about the 16 of <hi>February,</hi> not only to make knovvn vvhere they lay, but in a daring Vindictive man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to publiſh (the better to carry on their buſineſs) that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvithſtanding the many diſappointments the Conſpirators againſt the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> have hitherto met with, and the ill ſucceſs met vvith by Subornation, yet that the unvvearied endeavours of the Popiſh Conſpirators ſeemed to find out a nevv vvay for aſperſing the Kings Evidence, thereby to fend off the hand of Juſtice, repeating that on the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> vvith others of his Creatures, ſent for Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> the Publiſher of the pretended <hi>True Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Intelligence,</hi> and he in his Print offering revvard to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>any that could diſcover them, they thereupon ſent a meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to knovv the revvard, and if the revvard ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, to acquaint him that they vvere both ready at their Lodgings in <hi>Walbrook,</hi> and had never abſented themſelves, though Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> charged them therevvith contrary to his ovvn particular knovvledge, and that Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> (after divers meſſengers ſent him to take poſſeſſion of the tvvo Perſons) ſent vvord back that he vvould not trouble himſelf further in the buſineſs, nor pay any revvard. And that thereupon on the <hi>Saturday</hi> follovving they vvent to my Lord Mayor, vvhere they complained of the abuſe done; not only to them but the Kings Evidence, and prayed His Lordſhips Warrant to bring Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> before his Lordſhip, who being ill, and His Lordſhip being inform'd hovv theſe 2 Gentlemen (for ſo they call themſelves) came to be thus unfortunately hunted after, vvas pleaſed on the enſuing <hi>Munday,</hi> to Iſſue out his Warrant for the apprehending of Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> and ſome others of his Companions.</p>
            <p>How unwilling they were to come out of <hi>London-Liberty,</hi> or appear before him who had the keeping of thoſe Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> that were made of theſe two Fellows
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93444:14"/>
having conſpired againſt Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> is clear, for had they done ſo, they well knew that either they muſt clear that, give in bayl for their anſwering the ſame, or go to Coal; and beſides that, if Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> had done them any wrong, it was equally, or more in their Power to have him taken up by Warrant at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where he was every minute to be ſpoken with, at his Houſe: than in <hi>London</hi> where he ſeldom came; but to be taken out of <hi>London</hi> could not ſerve their ends; for the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> of it was, they wanted him in <hi>London</hi> to bring him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the laſh of a Fob Action or ſome ſuch like thing, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to expoſe him to the trouble of procuring bail, not to be by him there probably obtain'd; or to publiſh that he was in Priſon in good earneſt, to make amends for that falſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication thereof that was formerly made, when he was ſaid to be in the Gate-houſe.</p>
            <p>Immediately upon the Neck of this, they frame an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment againſt him, the ſaid <hi>Mr. Blood,</hi> and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (moſt of them for Company ſake) in the Crown Office, containing the whole Scene and Intrigue of this Plot; wherein <hi>Maurice Hickey</hi> the better to diſguiſe it, has the Honour of having the firſt Poſt aſſign'd him.

            <p>When Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> ſmelt of this Indictment, and that for proof of the Contents thereof, it was reported that it was given out by Mr. <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and others concerned, that among other Places of conſultation: The Crown in <hi>Ram Alley</hi> in <hi>Fleeſtreet,</hi> and the Bear in <hi>Holborn,</hi> both Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alling Houſes, were ſaid and nominated; and that Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Chriſtian</hi> have conſulted in thoſe two places, as well as treat the ſaid two Perſons with money, Treats, Junkets and other encouragements, and large plights and promiſes of preferment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Cuſtom-Houſe, in order with the more eaſe to prevail with them to be ſuborned as Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in this matter. He carried with him five ſubſtantial people and went to both places (for well he might without bluſh, innocent man!) and directed the ſaid five people to examine whether they knew of Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> or ever ſaw him with any body there? to which the people reply'd, (as well they might) No; Do you know him? no, ſaid they: did you over ſee this man here ſaid they, pointing at Mr. <hi>Blood?</hi> no, never in our Lives. All which he is ready to juſtify, when need is: Beſides it is very well known, that this Mr. <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> could never to this day lay up their Horſes together, as the old ſaying is, ſo that it is very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that he ſhould coact with one in an Intreague of this make, to whom he always grudged the civility of drinking either publickly or privately. Furthermore, if any Houſe in <hi>London</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> of any good repute, can ſay or give any Teſtimony that he has ever ſeen Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> and theſe Fellows together, in company of Mr. <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or all three together, Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> will contentedly acquieſce under the ſevereſt cenſure.</p>
            <p>To come to my L. Mayors Warrant, when his Lordſhip Iſſued it, for the apprehending Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> &amp; others of his Crew, purſuant to the complaint of <hi>Coddan</hi> and <hi>Ryther,</hi> it was reported (you may immagine by whom) that Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> nor the other Perſons of Mr. <hi>Blood</hi>'s company, ſaid to be mention'd therein, durſt come into his Lordſhips Liberty for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken up. When the ſame came to be underſtood by one of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, he preſently went into the City, and having waited ſome ſhort time about his Lordſhips houſe, he was introduced to his Lordſhip, and told his Lordſhip that hearing it ſpread abroad, that he Iſſued a Warrant againſt him, he was come to know of his Lordſhip what it was for. <hi>I do</hi> (Replyed my Lord) <hi>Iſſue a great many War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:93444:16"/>
that I do not remember who they are againſt. Why, replied <hi>Blood</hi>'s Friend, reading in the <hi>Intelligence</hi> that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip had a Warrant againſt Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> and Friends, I thought it might be my ſelf; whereupon my Lord ſent his Clerk to know whether by his Entries any Warrant appeared iſſued againſt one of that name; who went accordingly, and brought word that he did not find any, and when there is, ſaid the Clerk, I'le ſend word. I lodge, replied <hi>Blood</hi>'s Friend, at <hi>Grayes-Inne,</hi> and if there be, or when there is any thing of this kind againſt me, I'le wait upon your Lordſhip, if I am ſent for. I do not uſually concern my ſelf, replied my Lord, with any out of my Liberty; and ſo went away.</p>
            <p>A day after, Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> ſent one <hi>Comings</hi> an Atturney to my Lord, to know, if his Lordſhip had iſſued any Warrant lately againſt Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> and if he did, he came in Mr. <hi>Blood</hi>'s name to know what it was for. To whom it was replied, by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Lordſhips Clerks, there was one iſſued againſt Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> three dayes before, together with one <hi>John Burry,</hi> and one <hi>Fooks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Few dayes after, Mr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> took the liberty of ſpreading about the City that Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> and Friends, having heard of a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that was out againſt them from my Lord Mayor, durſt not come into <hi>London,</hi> as they uſually did, for fear of being impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, reporting at the ſame time that he had the ſame in his Pocket. This report being boaſted about in the <hi>Coffee-Houſes,</hi> and particularly in one Mr. <hi>Combe</hi>'s, where one of Mr. <hi>Blood</hi>'s particular good friends happened to be, the Friend replied, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting he did not believe it, and that if Mr. <hi>Blood</hi>'s Friend did decline coming into <hi>London</hi> upon that ſcore, he would never own him; and withal ſaid, I'le warrant his coming, and being there, notwithſtanding all this, to day or to morrow.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blood</hi>'s Friend hearing this, as alſo that Mr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Mr. <hi>Combes</hi> the Coffee-man, half a Crown in Money, to drink a Bottle of Sack with, conditionally that he would tell him where Mr. <hi>Blood</hi>'s Friend was, if he was then in the City, or ſend him word when he came there; whereupon Mr. <hi>Blood</hi>'s Friend hearing this, left word that he did not fear either Mr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> or his Warrant, and that if he had any thing to ſay to him, he was there to anſwer him: and, ſaid he, I am going to the <hi>Crown-Tavern,</hi> where I'le ſtay ſome time, which pray tell him if you ſee him this afternoon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:93444:17"/>
To make ſhort, by and by in came Mr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Man. Mr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> enquiring after Mr. <hi>Blood</hi>'s Friend, <hi>Combes</hi> told him, that he was hard by. Where? ſaid Mr. <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker;</hi> nay, ſaid <hi>Combes,</hi> let me have the Half-Crown firſt, which he accordingly did, but with ſeeming anger; then he told him where he was. Whereupon Mr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> ſent his Servant with my Lord Mayor's Warrant, who asked him, whether he would pleaſe to go before the Lord Mayor? No, ſaid he, I may go before any other Juſtice of the Peace; for, ſaid he, your War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant is not Special; then one that ſtood by adviſed him to go before Sir <hi>William Turner,</hi> and another to another: Well, ſaid Mr. <hi>Blood</hi>'s Friend, I do not care if I go before my Lord, I'de as live go before him as any other, eſpecially upon this, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he took theſe People's Examination, and therefore Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heart, ſaid he, go and bring a Conſtable: will you not go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one? replied the Servant. Well, ſaid the Servant, I'le go and tell my Maſter, and come again. Well, ſaid Mr. <hi>Blood</hi>'s Friend, now 'tis half an hour paſt Four, I'le ſtay till Five for your Maſter, and no longer, and if he comes within that time, I'le go with him before my Lord. Whereupon the Servant went to his Maſter, and at the time appointed came back again, and asked whether or no he would go before my Lord? No, ſaid Mr. <hi>Blood</hi>'s Friend, not without a Conſtable. Well, ſaid he, my Maſter then muſt take another time and opportunity.</p>
            <p>Thereupon Mr. <hi>Blood</hi>'s Friend ſtood up and ſaid, Your Maſter has here, ſaid he, given Mr. <hi>Combes</hi> Half a Crown for a Bottle of Sack, to let him ſpeak with me when I came to the City, and ſee I dare do it: But, ſaid he, tell your Maſter that in recompence I'le give you five Shillings to buy a pair of Gloves, and ſpend Fifteen Shillings upon him, provided he will bring <hi>Coddan</hi> and <hi>Rither</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> to anſwer Mr. <hi>Blood</hi>'s charge. And beſides, tell him farther, that if he be the Duke of <hi>bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Solicitor, I am Mr. <hi>Blood</hi>'s Solicitor. So that it is plainly ſeen they wanted only Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> in the City, to lay him in Pickle.</p>
            <p>To the foregoing Narrative it may be without digreſſion added, that at the burſting out of the late Divice, called the <hi>Presbyterian Plot,</hi> diſcovered by Mr. <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> and broached at the Lodgings of Collonel <hi>Rotherick Manſell,</hi> in <hi>Ax-yard, Weſtminſter,</hi> it was fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> did combine and conſpire with ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the World to enſnare and entangle the Profeſſors of the true <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, in a Plot laid againſt the Government,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93444:17"/>
and that then he was to be by his own conſent Seized upon, Tryed for his Life, and then upon getting his Pardon, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the King's Evidence by betraying ſeveral <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> which he was ſaid to be concerned within the ſaid Conſpiracy.</p>
            <p>And that conſequently he apprehends himſelf under ſome ill cenſures with ſome of his beſt Friends in <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. to whom the ſame is ſaid to be reported for a real truth. The matter of Fact was as follows, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVHen the late Parliament was diſſolved, and our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent one called to ſucceed it, it fell out, that one <hi>Thomas Curtis</hi> was then employed by ſome Power or Authority to carry down Writs into the Country to Sherifs, to chuſe new Parliament Members. This Mr. <hi>Curtis</hi> being returned from his Errand, and calling at <hi>Heaven,</hi> whether he uſually reſorted in <hi>Term</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> time, as being an old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of <hi>James Bradley</hi> in his life-time, Mrs. <hi>Bradley,</hi> the ſaid <hi>J. Bradley</hi>'s Widow, asked his Opinion, in reference to his thinking whether the approaching <hi>Parliament</hi> would ſit at the appointed time or no; for it highly concerns us, continued ſhe, that live hereabouts, to have it ſit, if it were for no other Good but the Cuſtom and Trade it brings, (for her lively-hood depended much upon it.) Truly, replied <hi>Curtis,</hi> I know nothing of its Sitting, neither whether or no it continues Sitting when it meets. I am ſorry in my Heart, ſaid ſhe, that you can give me no better hopes, for we ſhall be ruined for want of Trade.</p>
            <p>This after ſome further diſcourſe to that purpoſe, the ſaid <hi>Curtis</hi> whiſperingly told her, that he heard there were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions a giving out: how? quoth ſhe, how comes that? who has them a giving? ſaid he, Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> is one that has Commiſſions to give out. And with that they both parted, being <hi>Saturday</hi> Night.</p>
            <p>When he was gone, ſhe began ſeriouſly to conſider of what could be the matter or meaning of giving out Commiſſions, and could not purge her thoughts thereof all that Night; and obſerving Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> mentioned, as alſo that he was a Friend to the King, and ſinking deeper into the thing, wondred what it ſhould be, and therefore at laſt thought fit to ſend for Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> to acquaint him with it, (though ſhe never had the exchange of one word with him in her lifetime before.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:93444:18"/>
Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> after twice ſending, did happen to neglect coming to her, till the <hi>Tueſday</hi> following, as judging it was upon the ſcore of ſome frivolous errand that might tend to the begetting his Cuſtom to her Houſe, came at laſt, and deſiring her to tell him the buſineſs, ſhe rehearſed what paſſed betwixt her and <hi>Curtis,</hi> and that ſhe doubled that tho' ſhe knew <hi>Curtis</hi> as her Husband's acquaintance, yet ſhe did not know what his heart might be, and and that ſhe therefore ſent for him, to give him caution as became a Neighbour.</p>
            <p>Whereupon Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> pauſed a little, and began to think what to do in the caſe; but at laſt reſolved to go to ſome friends for their advice and directions, what to think of as a defence againſt the ill effect or iſſue of ſuch a report as that ſeemed to threaten. And finding that it was impoſſible for any judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Scrutiny to detect or explain the meaning of it without ſome time to conſider on't, adviſed him to paſs it by, which he accordingly did; but now underſtands it by the foregoing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative.</p>
            <p>It is credibly reported, that notwithſtanding the ſtrictneſs with which <hi>Maurice Hickly</hi> has been committed to the care and cuſtody of the Keeper of the Gate-Houſe from the King and Council, with prohibition, that none ſhould be ſuffered to ſpeak with him, but that he ſhould be kept cloſe Priſoner till due de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery. Yet one of his Majeſties Juſtices of the Peace is ſaid to have contrary thereto carried him thence to Taverns, and other publick Houſes at unſeaſonable hours of the Night, furniſhed him with Money, and return'd him back again ſome times at 1, 2, 3 and 4 the next Morning. And Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> being told that the ſame was in order to the ſueing out his pardon, and eſcaping the puniſhment juſtly due to his Treachery to Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> by becoming an evidence to put a Cavet thereto, in the proper Offices.</p>
