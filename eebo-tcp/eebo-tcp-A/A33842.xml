            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="6">VI. That they use their utmost Endeavour, both in their <hi>Sermons</hi> and by <hi>private Applications,</hi> to prevail with such of their Flock as are of competent Age, to receive frequently
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60825:4"/>
the <hi>Holy Communion:</hi> and to this end, that they administer it in the greater Towns once in every Month, and even in the lesser too, if <hi>Communicants</hi> may be procured, or how-ever as often as they may: and that they take all due Care, both by Preaching and otherwise, to prepare all for the worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of it.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. That in their <hi>Sermons</hi> they teach and inform their People (four times a Year at the least, as what the <hi>Canon</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire) that all <hi>Vsurp'd</hi> and <hi>Foreign</hi> Jurisdiction is for most Just Causes taken away and abolish'd in this <hi>Realm,</hi> and no manner of Obedience or Subjection due to the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>me, or to any that pretend to act by virtue of it: but that the King's Power being in his Dominions highest under God, they upon all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions perswade the People to <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> to his <hi>Majesty</hi> in all things <hi>Lawful,</hi> and to patient Submission in the rest; promoting (as far as in them lies) the publick Peace and Quiet of the World.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. That they maintain fair Correspondence (full of the kindest Respects of all sorts) with the <hi>Gentry</hi> and <hi>Persons</hi> of <hi>Quality</hi> in their Neighbourhood, as being deeply sensible what reasonable Assistance and Countenance this poor <hi>Church</hi> hath received from them in her Necessities.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. That they often exhort all those of our Communion, to continue stedfast to the end in their most Holy Faith, and constant to their Profession; and to that end, to take heed of all Seducers, and especially of <hi>Popish Emissaries,</hi> who are now in great numbers gone forth amongst them, and more busie and active than ever. And that they take all occasions to convince our own Flock, that 'tis not enough for them to be Members of an <hi>Excellent Church,</hi> rightly and duly Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, both in Faith and Worship, unless they do also reform and amend their own Lives, an so order their Conversation in all things as becomes the Gospel of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. And forasmuch as those <hi>Romish Emissaries,</hi> like the Old Serpent, <hi>Insidiantur Calcaneo,</hi> are wont to be most busie and troublesome to our People at the end of their Lives, labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to unsettle and perplex them in time of Sickness, and at the hour of Death; that therefore all who have the Cure of Souls, be more especially vigilant over them at that dangerous Season; that they stay not till they be sent for, but enquire out the Sick in their respective Parishes, and visit them frequently:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60825:5"/>
that they examine them particularly concerning the state of their Souls, and instruct them in their Duties, and settle them in their Doubts, and comfort them in their Sorrows and Sufferings, and pray often with them and for them; and by all the Methods which our Church prescribes, prepare them for the due and worthy receiving of the Holy <hi>Eucharist,</hi> the Pledg of their happy Resurrection: thus with their utmost Diligence, watching over every Sheep within their Fold (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in that critical Moment) lest those <hi>Evening Wolves</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. That they also walk in Wisdom towards those that are <hi>not</hi> of Our Communion: and if there be in their <hi>Parishes</hi> any such, that they neglect not frequently to confer with them in the Spirit of Meekness, seeking by all good Ways and Means to gain and win them over to our Communion: More especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that they have a very tender Regard to our <hi>Brethren</hi> the <hi>Protestant Dissenters</hi>; that upon occasion offered, they visit them at their Houses, and receive them kindly at their own, and treat them fairly where-ever they meet them, discoursing calmly and civilly with them; perswading them (if it may be) to a full Compliance with our <hi>Church,</hi> or at least, that whereto we have already attained, we may all walk by the same Rule, and mind the same thing. And in order hereunto that they take all Opportunities of assuring and convincing them, that the <hi>Bishops</hi> of this <hi>Church</hi> are really and sincerely irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable Enemies to the Errors, Superstitions, Idolatries and Tyrannies of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>; and that the very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind Jealousies which some have had of us to the contrary were altogether groundless.</p>
                  <p>And in the last place, that they warmly and most affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately exhort them, to joyn with us in daily fervent Prayer to the God of Peace, for an Universal Blessed <hi>Vnion</hi> of all <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches,</hi> both at <hi>Home</hi> and <hi>Abroad,</hi> against our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemies, and that all they who do confess the Holy Name of our dear Lord, and do agree in the Truth of his Holy Word, may also meet in one Holy Communion, and live in perfect Unity and Godly Love.</p>

                  <head>An Account of the late <hi>PROPOSALS</hi> of the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> with some other Bishops, to his Majesty: In a LETTER to <hi>M. B.</hi>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Am much surprized at the ill Constructions some People make of the Actions of those Bishops, who have lately wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the King; especially considering that most of them are the very Men, who not many Months ago ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared so publickly and so courageously, even to the hazard of all the Interests they had in this World, in Defence of our Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion, and the Laws of the Land.</p>
                  <p>In order to the removing all groundless Jealousies, and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Surmises, in an Affair of so great Consequence, which our Popish Enemies will, I am sure, be very ready to foment and keep up, I have here sent you the Heads of those Matters which were proposed by them to the King.</p>
                  <p>They waited upon Him, not as a Party separate either from the Nobility or Gentry, whom they could (I believe) have wished his Majesty would rather have called for at this Juncture; or from the rest of the Bishops or Clergy of <hi>England</hi>; but as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whom the King was pleased, upon Reasons known only to his Royal Breast, to command to attend upon Him.</p>
                  <p>The Heads which I send you, are not taken from any Copy of the Paper which my Lords the Bishops presented to the King. I understand that all their Lordships have been extreamly careful to prevent the publishing of any Copies, and that they still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to communicate any, tho they now lie under no Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the contrary. However, I do assure you with all faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that these Heads which I am now sending you, are true Contents, obtain'd by another Method, which in prudence you will imagine not fit for me to disclose.</p>
                  <p>You have already been told from me, that every one of these Bishops were sent for up out of their Diocesses by <hi>Expresses</hi> from
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60825:6"/>
his Majesty, whom they first waited on in a Body, on <hi>Friday</hi> the 28<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September.</hi> I cannot, upon the strictest inquiry, find that any thing passed betwixt the King and them, at that first atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon Him, besides general Expressions of Favour and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from his Majesty, and general returns of Duty and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty from the Bishops. This was matter of Admiration to us all here, who could not believe but that the King had other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of a nearer and more particular Concern, when he first resolved to send so far for some of these Bishops: but these Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations in Councils are Things not sit for you or I to meddle with.</p>
                  <p>However, my Lords the Bishops were not satisfied herewith, concluding (as I suppose) that his Majesty would not have sent for them so far, if he had not intended to have advised with them in this Juncture, and to give them the liberty of offering Him such Counsels as they thought necessary at this Time: And therefore when his Grace my Lord Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> waited on the King alone the first time, on <hi>Sunday</hi> morning, <hi>Sept.</hi> 30. being indisposed when the other Bishops attended on <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> their Lordships did, by my Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> intimate their Thoughts about that Affair, and their readiness to the King; who was pleased not only to permit them to give him the best and most particular Advices, but to encourage them to do it with all the freedom that was necessary for the present Occasion.</p>
                  <p>Upon this Royal Invitation their Lordships assembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the next day at my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s Palace, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, upon the most mature deliberation, such Matters as they judged necessary for hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Majesty's Knowledg and Consideration: And on the <hi>Wednesday</hi> after waited on the King in a Body, when his Grace in his own, and in the name of the rest of the Bishops then present, did, in a most excellent Speech, represent to his Majesty such things as were thought by them absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to the Settlement of the Nation, amidst the present Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions, and to the publick Interest of Church and State.</p>
                  <p>I am assured that his Grace delivered himself upon this Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Occasion, as with all dutifulness to his Majesty, so with all the readiness and the courage that did become such an Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Arch-Bishop as God hath blest our <hi>Church of England</hi> with at this Time.</p>
                  <p>You must not expect here his excellent Words, but an Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, according to my Talent, in a meaner Stile.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:60825:6"/>I. <hi>First, the Bishops thought fit to represent in general to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, That it was necessary for Him to restore all things to the state in which He found them when He came to the Crown, by committing all Offices and Places of Trust in the Government, to such of the Nobility and Gentry as were qualified for them according to the Laws of this Kingdom; and by Redressing and Removing such Grievances as were generally complain'd of.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. Particularly, <hi>That his Majesty would Dissolve the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Commission, and promise to His People never to Erect any such Court for the future.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>That He would not only put an effectual stop to the issuing forth of any Dispensations, but would Call in, and Cancel all those which had since his coming to the Crown been obtained from Him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">IV. <hi>That he would Restore the Vniversities to their Legal State, and to their Statutes and Customs, and would particularly Restore the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of</hi> Magdalen Colledge <hi>in</hi> Cambridge, <hi>to the Profits of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stership, which he had been so long Deprived of, by an Illegal Suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; and the Ejected President and Fellows of</hi> Magdalen Colledge <hi>in</hi> Oxford, <hi>to their Properties in that Colledge: And, that He would not permit any Persons to enjoy any of the Preferments in either Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, but such as are qualified by the Statutes of the Vniversities, the particular Statutes of their several Foundations, and the Laws of the Land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">V. <hi>That He would suppress the Iesuits Schools opened in this City, or elsewhere, and grant no more Licenses for such Schools as are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently against the Laws of this Nation, and His Majesty's True Interest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">VI. <hi>That He would send Inhibitions after those Four</hi> Romish Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, <hi>who under the Title of</hi> Apostolick Vicars, <hi>did presume to Exercise within this Kingdom such Iurisdictions as are by the Laws of the Land Invested in the Bishops of the</hi> Church of England, <hi>and ought not to be Violated or Attempted by them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">VII. <hi>That He would suffer no more</hi> Quo Warranto's <hi>to be issued out against any Corporations, but would restore to those Corporations which had been already disturbed, their ancient Charters, Priviledges, Grants, and Immunities, and Condemn all those late Illegal Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Corporations, by putting them into their late Flourishing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and Legal Establishment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. <hi>That He would fill up all the Vacant Bishopricks in</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>with Persons duly qualified according to the Laws: and would especially take into His Consideration the See of</hi> York, <hi>whose
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60825:7"/>
want of an Archbishop is very prejudicial to that whole Province.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">IX. <hi>That He would Act no more upon a Dispensing Power, nor insist upon it; but permit that Affair at the first Session of a Parliament to be fairly Stated and Debated, and Settled by Act of Parliament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">X. <hi>That upon the Restoration of Corporations to their Ancient Charters, and Burroughs to their Prescriptive Rights, He would Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Writs to be issued out for a fair and free Parliament, and suffer it to Sit to Redress all Grievances, to Settle Matters in Church and State upon just and solid Foundations, and to Establish a due Liberty of Conscience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">XI. Lastly, and above all, <hi>That His Majesty would permit some of His Bishops, to lay such Motives and Arguments before him, as might by the Blessing of GOD, bring back His Majesty unto the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Our Holy Church of</hi> England, <hi>into whose Catholick Faith He had been Baptized, in which He had been Educated, and to which it was their earnest and daily Prayer to Almighty GOD, that His Majesty might be Reunited.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All these Counsels were concluded with a Prayer to GOD, in whose Hands the Hearts of Kings are, for a good Effect upon them; especially the last, about bringing the King back to the Protestant Religion.</p>
                  <p>And now, Sir, I cannot but ask you, What grounds there are for any Mens Jealousies of the Bishops Proceedings? Pray shew this Letter to all your Friends, that some may lay down their Fears, and others may have this Antidote against taking any up. I do assure you, and I am certain I have the best grounds in the World for my assurance, That the Bishops will never stir one Jot from their PETITION; but that they will, whenever that happy Opportunity shall offer itself, let the Protestant Dissenters find that they will be better than their Word given in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous PETITION.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time let You and I, Commend the Prudence of these Excellent Bishops, Admire their Courage, and Celebrate their just Praises, and never forget to offer up most fervent Thanks to GOD, for his Adorning the Church of <hi>England,</hi> at this Juncture, with such Eminent Apostolical Bishops. I am with all Respect.</p>

                     </gap>fence is grounded upon three Fundamental Principles:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>I. <hi>The Right of Petitioning.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>II. <hi>The Necessity.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>III. <hi>The Duty.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">I. It is the undoubted Right of the Subjects to Petition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing founded upon an Act of Parliament, and the highest Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the World; for that is a very monstrous Government, where the People must not approach their King, and acquaint him with their Grievances. The People have the greatest Property in the Land, and therefore the most concern'd when a Foreign Enemy is upon it; their Welfare is the Supream Law, and yet they must not desire to meet in order to consult their own Preservation. The Jesuits (the sworn Enemies to the English Nation) will take care of us, and our Posterity; therefore why should we trouble our selves at this Juncture? They can levy Mony with a Proclamation, they can dispense with all Laws, and what should we do with a Parliament, when the whole Statute-Book serves for no other End but to wipe the Tails of these Reverend <hi>Satyrs,</hi> who fly into their Dens and Thickets, at the very sound of a <hi>House of Commons?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. The Necessity, and that an indispensible one: The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment turn'd <hi>Topsy-Turvy,</hi> no Law, no Rule, all in a state of War; all Treaties broken, all Obligations ceas'd; and yet the <hi>People</hi> must not come together to know why or wherefore they Fight, or how they may avoid destroying one another; they must hack and cut one another to pieces blindfold, and to no other End, but to save the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> and the <hi>Knaves,</hi> and to ruin themselves: But the most Reverend <hi>Bishops</hi> are told, that they shall have a <hi>Free Parliament</hi> as soon as ever the <hi>Prince of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60825:9"/>
Orange</hi> has quitted this Realm; that is, such a <hi>Free Parliament</hi> as they were like to have had before the <hi>Prince</hi> came hither, shuffl'd, cut, and pack'd, by Mr. <hi>Brent</hi> and his <hi>Missionaries</hi>; or perhaps ten times worse, or rather none at all: for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is grown such an infamous <hi>Bankrupt,</hi> that no Body will trust her further than they can command her: She may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to the <hi>Tyger,</hi> which fawns, sneaks, and lurks, as long as the Hunter is arm'd with his Spear and his Gun; but when once the Weapons are laid down, the <hi>Beast</hi> flies upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary Forester, tears and devours him.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The Duty: For what better Office could those pious <hi>Prelats</hi> and <hi>Patriots</hi> of their Country do for the Publick-Good, than to make all People Friends, to save the Lives of many Thousands, and to heal all our Wounds and Sores, which they of the <hi>Roman Faith</hi> have inflicted upon a <hi>People</hi> too kind and good natur'd for such ravenous <hi>Monsters,</hi> who go about seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom they may devour. <hi>France, Ireland, Hungary,</hi> and the <hi>Valleys of Piedmont</hi> are still reeking with the Blood of their poor innocent <hi>Preys,</hi> and ecchoing with the Lamentations of a <hi>People</hi> ruin'd, by trusting these <hi>Crocodiles</hi> too much; and if God in his infinite Mercy had not watch'd over these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and sent a <hi>Gabriel</hi> to guard them, they had certainly fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len a Victim to the intollerable Pride, the lawless Fury, and untractable Barbariety of a sort of <hi>Animals,</hi> call'd <hi>Catholicks,</hi> subtile and treacherous by Custom and Discipline, not to be chain'd by any Law, either of God or Man; and therefore every Body knows how <hi>far</hi> we may rely <hi>upon them,</hi> when the <hi>Arch-Angel</hi> leaves us.</p>

                  <head>Extract of the States General their Resolution. <hi>Thursday,</hi> 28th <hi>October,</hi> 1688.</head>
                  <p>UPon mature Deliberation, it is found sit, and resolved, that notice be given to all their Ministers abroad, of all the Reasons which induce their H. and M. to assist the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> going over to <hi>England</hi> in Person with Ships and Forces, with Orders to the said Ministers to make use thereof in the several Courts where they reside, as they shall think most convenient; and that it be also writ to the said Ministers, that it is known to all the World that the <hi>English</hi> Nation hath a good while very much mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured and complained, that the King (no doubt with the Evil Counsel, and Inducement of his Ministers) had gained upon their Fundamental Laws, and laboured through the violation thereof; and by the bringing in the <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion, to oppress their Liberty, and to ruine the Protestant Religion, and to bring all under an Arbitrary Government: That as this inverted and unjust Conduct was carried on more and more, and the Apprehensions thereupon were still greater, and that thereby such Diffidence and Aversion was stirred up against the King, that nothing was to be expected in that Kingdom but general Disorder and Confusion. His Highness the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> upon the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold Representations, and the reiterated and earnest De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire which was made to His Highness by several Lords, and other Persons of great Consideration in that Kingdom; as also upon the account that Her Royal Highness, and His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness Himself, are so highly concerned in the Welfare of that Kingdom, could not well endure that through Strife and Disunion they should run the danger, however it went, of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60825:10"/>
being excluded from the Crown, held himself obliged to watch over the Welfare of that Kingdom, and to take care thereof; and also had the thoughts of assisting the Nation, and giving them a helping-hand, upon so many just and good Grounds, against the Government that oppressed them in all manner of ways that lay in his Highness's Power, for that His Highness was perswaded that the Welfare of this State (the Care whereof is also entrusted to him) was in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est manner concerned, that the said Kingdom might continue in Tranquillity, and that all misunderstanding between the King and the Nation might be taken away. That His Highness well knowing, that to succeed in so Important and Laudable a Cause, and not to be hindred and prevented by those that were evil inclined towards it, it was necessary to pass over into that Kingdom accompanied with some Military Forces, hath thereupon made known his Intentions to their Highnesses, and desired Assistance from their Highnesses, that their High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses having maturely weighed all things, and considered that the King of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Great Britain</hi> stood in very good Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence and Friendship one with the other, which their Highnesses have been frequently very well assured of, and in a strict and particular Alliance; and that their Highnesses were informed and advertised, that their Majesties had laboured upon a Concert, to divide and separate this State from its Alliances; and that the King of <hi>France</hi> hath, upon several occasions, shew'd himself dissatisfied with this State, which gave cause to fear and apprehend that in case the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> should happen to compass his Aim within his Kingdom, and obtain an absolute Power over his People, that then both Kings, out of Interest of State, and Hatred and Zeal against the Protestant Religion, would endeavour to bring this State to Confusion, and if possible, quite to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it, have resolved to commend His Highness in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking of the above said Designs, and to grant to him for his Assistance, some Ships and Militia, as Auxiliaries; that in pursuance thereof, His Highness hath declared to their Highnesses, that he is resolved, with God's Grace and Favour, to go over into <hi>England,</hi> not with the least insight or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to invade or subdue that Kingdom, or to remove the King from his Throne, much less to make himself Master
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60825:10"/>
thereof, or to invert or prejudice the Lawful Succession, as also not to drive thence, or persecute the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, but only and solely to help that Nation in re-establishing the Laws and Priviledges that have been broken, as also in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their Religion and Liberty; and to that end, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and bring it about, that a free and lawful Parliament may be call'd in such manner, and of such Persons, as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated and qualified by the Laws and Form of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and that the said Parliament may deliberate upon, and establish all such Matters as shall be judged necessary to assure and secure the Lords, the Clergy, Gentry, and People, that their Rights, Laws and Priviledges, shall be no more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated or broken, that their High and Mightinesses hope and trust, that with God's Blessing, the Repose and Unity of that Kingdom shall be re-established, and the same be thereby brought into a Condition to be able, powerfully to concur to the common benefit of <hi>Christendom,</hi> and to the restoring and maintaining of Peace and Tranquillity in <hi>Europe.</hi> That Copies hereof be delivered to all their Foreign Ministers residing here, to be used by them as they shall see occasion.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THere is a Man of <hi>Lunenburg Wolfenbuttel,</hi> who being fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len in Debt in <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> upon his Father's Death, his Brother taking no Care of him, was put in Prison and brought extream low; yet he was brought out by the means of a Friend: And soon after a Man who pretended to know him, and to have seen him before, (though the <hi>German</hi> believes he never saw him) seem'd to take pitty on him, seeing him in a Coffee-House, and gave him a Ducatoon, and promised he should never want; so he entred into a great familiarity with him, but would never let him know where he lodged, only he gave him Appointments in Coffee-Houses, and Taverns, and fed him from time to time with Mony: At last, after some weeks, he drew him into a secret Walk in the Grounds that are not yet built, and ask'd him if he had a Heart to do a bold Thing? The <hi>German</hi> said he had, if it were not such a Thing as might bring him to a Scaffold. The other said, There was no Danger, only it would require a little hardiness. Then he ask'd an Oath of the <hi>German,</hi> That he would either do that which he was to propose to him, or presently go out of the Country. The <hi>German</hi> said, He could not go out of the Country, for he had no Mony: And then he gave him eight Ducats in Gold, and then he he swore the Oath: So the other proposed to him the poysoning the Prince of <hi>Orange:</hi> that startled him, but apprehending he should be killed if he refused it, he undertook it. The other told him, That in the last Age Men had tried Stabbing or Shooting, but these were dangerous Things, Poisoning was a safe and sure way: He added, That he should have 3000 Pistols in hand, and a Fortune besides. The <hi>German</hi> ask'd, From whom? The other, who called himself <hi>Corne,</hi> and spoke
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60825:12"/>
French like a Stranger, but the <hi>German</hi> cannot judg what Nation he was of; the other, I say, said to him, That if he had the Mony, he was not concern'd to know from whence it came. In short, he made a Proposition to the <hi>German,</hi> giving him a Quill with a Water in it, carefully stop'd, and told him, that he (the <hi>German)</hi> lodged in the House of an inconsiderable Man, of whom no regard would be had; and if he would cut the Quill, so that one drop of the Liquor fell into any thing that his Landlord was to drink, he would be certainly dead before to Morrow; and if he would begin with him, one should come to him to such a place to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, having a white Feather in his Hat, who should deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him 1500 Pistols, and instruct him how to manage the Poisoning the Prince, which he should find would be easy and safe; then upon his going on he should have the rest of the Mony. The <hi>German</hi> went Home, but was struck with Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and so resolved to keep that part of his Oath of going out of the Country; yet he shew'd another his Gold, and told him of his going Home: But from <hi>Osnaburgh</hi> he writ to one about the Prince; this happned in the beginning of <hi>March</hi> last. So he was desired to come back, which he did, and the Matter being brought into the Court of <hi>Holland,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Oath of Secresy, Mr. <hi>Halewyn</hi> Deputy of <hi>Dort,</hi> and another, were sent with him to <hi>Amsterdam</hi>; they found many collatoral Confirmations of part of his Story; but no such Man could be seen in all the Places where he had met with him formerly; the <hi>German</hi> came to the <hi>Hague,</hi> and being in the Fair, seeing one of the Shews, and a <hi>Dane</hi> with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as they came out in a huge Crowd, the <hi>German</hi> complain'd that one struck him on the Breast with a Battoon: But this was not minded till they were quite out, and he found one had struck at him, as it seems, with a <hi>Stilletto</hi> under the left Pap, his Cloak and Coat were cut, and the Wound proved but a slight Scratch: the Quill with the Poison in it sealed, is in the Court. It seems, a <hi>German</hi> was thought a fit Tool, being of a Nation that would not be easily suspected; and the putting it on a <hi>Lutheran</hi> would have been thought a Master-piece. I give you this Account, which I will Answer for, to satisfy some of your Friends, both Here and in <hi>England,</hi> who will perhaps desire to know the Certainty of this Matter.</p>

And in saying this, I will invite you to nothing but what I will do my self; and I will not desire any of you to go any further than I will move my self; neither will I put you upon any Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger where I will not take share in it. I propose this to you, not as you are my Tenants, but as my Friends, and as you are <hi>Englishmen.</hi> No Man can love fighting for its own sake, nor find any Pleasure in Danger. And you may imagine, I would be very glad to spend the rest of my Days in Peace, I having had so great a share in Troubles; but I see all lies at Stake, I am to chuse whether I will be a <hi>Slave</hi> and a <hi>Papist,</hi> or a <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> and a <hi>Freeman</hi>; and therefore the Case being thus, I shall think my self false to my Country, if I sit still at this time. I am of Opinion, that when the Nation is deliver'd, it must be by Force or by Miracle: It would be too great a presumption to expect the latter, and therefore our Deliverance must be by Force, and I hope this is the Time for it; a Price is now put into our Hands, and if it miscarry for want of Assistance, our Blood is upon our own Heads; and he that is passive at this
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60825:14"/>
Time, may very well expect that God will mock when the Fear of Affliction comes upon him, which he thought to avoid by being indifferent.</p>
                  <p>If the K. prevails, farewel Liberty of Conscience, which has hitherto been allowed, not for the sake of the Protestants, but in order to settle Popery. You may see what to expect if he get the better; and he hath lately given you, of this Town, a taste of the Method whereby he will maintain his Army. And you may see of what sort of People he intends his Army to consist; and if you have not a mind to serve such Masters, then stand not by and see your Country-men perish, when they are endeavouring to defend you.</p>
                  <p>I promise this on my Word and Honour, to every Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that goes along with me, That if he fall, I will make his Lease as good to his Family, as it was when he went from home. The thing then which I desire, and your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try does expect from you, is this, That every Man that hath a tollerable Horse, or can procure one, will meet me on <hi>Boden</hi>-Downs to morrow where I Randezvouz: But if any of you is rendred unable by reason of Age, or any other just Excuse, then that he would mount a fitter Person, and put five Pounds in his Pocket. Those that have not, nor cannot procure Horse, let them stay at home and assist with their Purses, and send it to me with a particular of every Man's Contribution. I impose on no Man, but let him lay his Hand on his Heart, and consider what he is willing to give to recover his Religion and Liberty; and to such I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and to all that go along with me, that if we prevail, I will be as industrious to have him recompenced for his Charge and Hazard, as I will be to seek it for my self. This Advice I give to all that stay behind, That when you hear the Papists have committed any Out-rage, or any Rising, that you will get together; for it is better to meet your Danger than expect it. I have no more to say, but that I am willing to lose my Life in the Cause, if God see it good, for I was never unwilling to die for my Religion and Country.</p>

                  <p>WIth a Heart full of Grief am I forced to write, that Prudence will not permit me to say to your Face. And may I e'er find Credit with your Majesty, and Protection from Heaven, as what I now do, is free from Passion, Vanity or Design, with which Actions of this Nature are too often accompanied. I am not ignorant of the frequent Mischiefs wrought in the World by factious Pretences of Religion; but were not Religion the most justifiable Cause, it would not be made the most specious Pretence. And your Majesty has always shewn too uninte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested a Sense of Religion, to doubt the just Effects of it in one whose Practices have, I hope, never given the World cause to censure his real Conviction of it, or his backwardness to perform what his Honour and Conscience prompt him to: How then can I longer disguise my just Concern for that Religion in which I have been so happily educated, which my Judgment throughly convinces me to be the best; and for the Support of which I am so highly interested in my Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country? and is not <hi>England</hi> now by the most endearing Tie become so?</p>

Could I secure your Person by the Hazard of my Life; I should think it could not be better emploied: And wou'd to God these your distracted Kingdoms might yet receive that satisfactory Compliance from your Majesty in all their justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Pretensions, as might upon the only sure Foundation, that of the Love and Interest of your Subjects, establish your Government, and as strongly unite the Hearts of all your Subjects to You, as is that of,</p>

The <hi>Militia</hi> put into the Hands of Persons not qualified by Law; and a Popish Mercenary Army maintained in the Kingdom in Time of Peace, absolutely

contrary to Law: The Execution of the Law against several high Crimes and Misdemenours superceded and prohibited; the Statutes against Correspondence with the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> Papal Jurisdiction, and Popish Priests, suspended; that in Courts of Justice those Judges are displaced who dare acquit them whom the K. would have condemned, as happened to Judg <hi>Powel</hi> and <hi>Holloway</hi> for acquitting the seven Bishop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>WE have in the course of our whole Life, and more particularly by the apparent Hazards both by Sea and Land, to which We have so lately exposed our Person, given to the whole World so high and undoubted Proofs of our fervent Zeal for the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> that we are fully confident no true English-man, and good Protestant, can entertain the least Suspicion of our firm Resolution, rather to spend our dearest Blood, and perish in the Attempt, than not carry on the blessed and glo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ious. Design, which by the Favour of Heaven we have so successfully begun, to rescue <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> from Slavery and Popery, and in a <hi>Free Parliament</hi> to establish the Religion, the Laws and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of those Kingdoms, upon such a sure and lasting Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, that it shall not be in the Power of any Prince for the future to introduce <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Tyranny.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Towards the more easy Composing this great Design, We have not been hitherto deceived in the just Expectation we had of the Concurrence of the Nobility, Gentry, and People of <hi>England</hi> with Us, for the Security of their Religion, the Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Laws, and Re-establishment of their Liberties and Properties: Great Numbers of all Ranks and Qualities having joined themselves to us; and others at great Distances from Us, have taken up Arms and declared for Us. And,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60825:18"/>
which we cannot but particular mention, in that Army which was raised to be the Instrument of <hi>Slavery</hi> and <hi>Popery,</hi> many (by the special Providence of God) both Officers and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers, have been touched with such a feeling Sense of Religion and Honour, and of true Affection for their Native Country, that they have already deserted the Illegal Service they were ingaged in, and have come over to Us; and have given Us full Assurance, from the rest of the Army, that they will certainly follow this Example, as soon as with our Army we shall approach near enough to receive them, without the Hazard of being prevented and betray'd. To which End, and that We may the sooner execute this just and necessary Design We are ingaged in for the Publick Safety and Deliverance of these Nations, We are resolved, with all possible Diligence, to advance forward, that a <hi>Free Parliament</hi> may be forthwith called, and such Preliminaries adjusted with the King, and all Things first settled upon such a Foot according to Law, as may give Us and the whole Nation just Reason to believe the King is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to make such necessary Condescentions on his part, as will give intire Satisfaction and Security to all, and make both King and People once more Happy.</p>
                  <p>And that we may effect all this, in the way most agreeable to our Desires, if it be possible, without the Effusion of any Blood, except of those execrable Crimin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>als who have justly forfeited their Lives for betraying the Religion, and Subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Laws of their Native Country, We do think fit to declare, that as we will offer no Violence to any but in our own Necessary Defence; so we will not suffer any Injury to be done to the Person even of a Papist, provided he be found in such Place, and in such Condition and Circumstances as the Laws require. So we are resolved and do declare that all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, who shall be found in open Arms, or with Arms in their Houses, or about their Persons, or in any Office or Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Civil or Military, upon any Pretence whatsoever, contrary to the known Laws of the Land, shall be treated by Us and our Forces not as Souldiers and Gentlemen, but as Robbers, Free-Booters and <hi>Banditti</hi>; they shall be incapable of Quarter, and intirely delivered up to the Discretion of our Souldiers. And We do further declare that all Persons who shall be found any ways aiding and assisting to them, or shall march under
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60825:18"/>
their Command, or shall joyn with or submit to them in the Discharge or Execution of their Illegal Commissions or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, shall be looked upon as Partakers of their Crimes, Enemies to the Laws, and to their Country.</p>
                  <p>And whereas we are certainly informed that great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Armed Papists have of late resorted to <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminister,</hi> and parts adjacent, where they remain, as we have reason to suspect, not so much for their own Security, as out of a wicked and barbarous Design to make some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate Attempt upon the said Cities, and their Inhabitants, by Fire, or a sudden Massacre, or both; or else to be the more ready to joyn themselves to a Body of French Troops, design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if it be possible, to land in <hi>England,</hi> procured of the French King, by the Interest and Power of the Jesuits in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance of the Engagements, which at the Instigation of that pestilent Society, his most Christian Majesty, with one of his Neighbouring Princes of the same Communion, has entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to for the utter Extirpation of the Protestant Religion out of Europe. Though we hope we have taken such effectual care to prevent the one, and secure the other, that by God's As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, we cannot doubt but we shall defeat all their wicked Enterprises and Designs.</p>
                  <p>We cannot however forbear, out of the great and tender Concern we have to preserve the People of <hi>England,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly those great and populous Cities, from the cruel Rage and bloody Revenge of the <hi>Papists,</hi> to require and expect from all the Lord-Lieutenants, Deputy-Lieutenants, and Justices of Peace, Lord-Mayors, Mayors, Sheriffs, and all other Magistrates, and Officers Civil and Military, of all Counties, Cities Towns of <hi>England,</hi> especially of the County of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> and Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> and Parts adjacent, that they do immediately Disarm and Secure, as by Law they may and ought, within their respective Counties, Cities, and Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, all <hi>Papists</hi> whatsoever, as Persons at all Times, but now especially most dangerous to the Peace and Safety of the Government, that so not only all Power of doing Mischief may be taken from them, but that the Laws, which are the greatest and best Security, may resume their Force, and be strictly Executed.</p>

                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:60825:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>And We do hereby likewise declare, that We will Protect and Defend all those who shall not be afraid to do their Duty in Obedience to these Laws. And that for those Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates and others, of what condition soever they be, who shall refuse to assist Us, and in Obedience to the Laws, to Execute vigorously what We have required of them, and suffer themselves at this Juncture to be cajoled or terrified out of their Duty, We will esteem them the most Criminal and Infamous of all Men, Betrayers of their Religion, the Laws, and their Native Country, and shall not fail to treat them accordingly; resolving to expect and require at their Hands the Life of every single <hi>Protestant</hi> that shall perish, and every House that shall be burnt or destroyed by their Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Cowardise.</p>

                  <head>AN ENQUIRY Into the Measures of SUBMISSION TO THE SUPREAM AUTHORITY: And of the <hi>Grounds</hi> upon which it may be <hi>lawful</hi> or necessary for <hi>Subjects</hi> to defend their <hi>Religion, Lives,</hi> and <hi>Liberties.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THis <hi>Enquiry</hi> cannot be regularly made, but by taking in the first place, a true and full view of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Civil Society,</hi> and more particularly of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Supream Power,</hi> whether it is lodged in one or more Persons?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is certain, That the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> has put no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence nor subordination among Men, except it be that of <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> to <hi>Parents,</hi> or of <hi>Wives</hi> to their <hi>Husbands</hi>; so that with Relation to the Law of Nature, all Men are born free: and this Liberty must still be supposed entire, unless so far as it is limited by Contracts, Provisions and Laws. For a Man can either bind himself to be a Servant, or sell himself to be a Slave, by which he becomes in the power of another, only so far as it was provided by the Contract: since all that Liberty which was not expresly given away, remains still entire: so that the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60825:21"/>
Plea for Liberty always proves it self, unless it appears that it is given up or limited by any special Agreement.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. It is no less certain, that as the Light of Nature has planted in all Men a Natural Ptinciple of the Love of Life, and of a desire to preserve it; so the common Principles of all Religion agree in this, that God having set us in this World, we are bound to preserve that Being, which he has given us, by all just and lawful ways. Now this Duty of Self-preservation is exerted in Instances of two sorts; the one are, in the resisting of violent Aggressors; the other are the taking of just Revenges of those, who have invaded us so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, that we could not prevent them, and so violently that we could not resist them: In which cases the Principle of self-Preservation warrants us, both to recover what is our own, with just Damages, and also to put such unjust Persons out of a Capacity of doing the like Injuries any more, either to our selves, or to any others. Now in these Instances of Self-Preservation, this difference is to be observed; that the first cannot be limited by any slow Forms, since a pressing Danger requires a vigorous Repulse, and cannot admit of Delays; whereas the second, of taking Revenges, or Reparations, is not of such haste, but that it may be brought under Rules and Forms.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The true and Original Notion of <hi>Civil Society</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> is, that it is a Compromise made by such a Body of Men, by which they resign up the Right of demanding Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, either in the way of Justice against one another, or in the way of War, against their Neighbours; to such a single Person, or to such a Body of Men as they think fit to trust with this. And in the management of this <hi>Civil Society,</hi> great distinctions is to be made, between the Power of making Laws for the regulating the Conduct of it, and the Power of executing those Laws: The <hi>Supream Authority</hi> must still be supposed to be lodged with those who have the <hi>Legislative Power</hi> reserved to them, but not with those who have only the <hi>Executive</hi>; which is plainly a <hi>Trust,</hi> when it is separated from the <hi>Legislative Power</hi>; and all <hi>Trusts,</hi> by their nature import, that those to whom they are given, are accountable, even though that it should: not be expresly specified in the words of the <hi>Trust</hi> it self.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:60825:21"/>IV. It cannot be supposed, by the Principles of Natural Religion, that God has authorised any one <hi>Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> any other way than as the general Rules of Order, and of Justice, oblige all Men not to subvert Constitutions, nor disturb the Peace of Mankind, or invade those Rights with which the Law may have vested some Persons: for it is certain, that as private Contracts lodg or translate private Rights; so the <hi>Publick Laws</hi> can likewise lodg such Rights, Prerogatives and Revenues in those under whose Protection they put themselves, and in such a manner, that they may come to have as good a Title to these, as any private Person can have to his Property: so that it becomes an Act of high Injustice and Violence to invade these: which is so far a greater Sin than any such Actions would be against a private Person, as the publick Peace and Order is preferrable to all private Considerations whatsoever. So that in Truth, the Principles of <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> give those that are in Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty no Power at all, but they do only secure them in the Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that which is theirs by Law. And as no Considerations of Religion can bind me to pay another more than I indeed owe him, but do only bind me more strictly to pay what I owe; so the Considerations of Religion do indeed bring <hi>Subjects</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der stricter Obligations to pay all due Allegiance and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to their <hi>Princes,</hi> but they do not at all extend that Allegiance further than the Law carries it. And though a Man has no Divine Right to his Property, but has acquired it by human means, such as Succession, or Industry, yet he has a Security for the Enjoyment of it, from a Divine Right; so tho <hi>Princes</hi> have no immediate Warrants from Heaven, either for their Original Titles, or for the extent of them, yet they are secured in the Possession of them by the Principles and Rules of <hi>Natural Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">V. It is to be considered, that as a private Person can bind himself to another Man's Service, by different degrees, either as an ordinary Servant for Wages, or as one appropriate for a longer time, as an Apprentice; or by a total giving himself up to another, as in the case of Slavery: in all which cases the general Name of <hi>Master</hi> may be equally used, yet the degrees of his Power, are to be judged by the nature of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract: so likewise Bodies of Men can give themselves up in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60825:22"/>
different degrees to the Conduct of others: and therefore though all those may carry the same Name of <hi>King,</hi> yet every ones Power is to be taken from the measures of that Authority which is lodged in him, and not from any general Speculations founded on some Equivocal Terms, such as <hi>King, Sovereign,</hi> or <hi>Supream.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">VI. It is certain, that God, as the Creator and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the World, may set up whom he will to rule over other Men: But this Declaration of his Will must be made evident by Prophets, or other extraordinary Men sent of him, who have some manifest proofs of the Dvine Authority that is committed to them on such occasions, and upon such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons declaring the Will of God in favour of any others, that Declaration is to be submitted to and obeyed. But this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a Divine Delegatation, can be carried no further than to those who are thus expresly marked out, and is unjustly claimed by those who can prove no such Declaration to have been ever made in favour of them or their Families. Nor does it appear reasonable to conclude from their being in Possession, that it is the Will of God that it should be so, this justifies all Usurpers when they are successful.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. The measures of <hi>Power,</hi> and by consequence of <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> must be taken from the express Laws of any State or Body of Men, from the Oaths that they swear, or from imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial Prescription, and a long Possession, which both give a Title, and in a long Tract of Time make a bad one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come good, since Prescription, when it passes the Memory of Man, and is not disputed by any other Pretender, gives by the common Sense of all Men a just and good Title: so upon the whole matter, the degrees of all Civil Authority are to be taken either from express Laws, immemorial Customs, or from particular Oaths, which the Subjects swear to their Princes: this being still to be laid down for a Principle, that in all the Disputes between <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Liberty, Power</hi> must allways be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>roved, but <hi>Liberty</hi> proves it self; the one being founded on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y upon a Positive Law, and the other upon the Law of Nature.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. If from the general Principles of Human Society, and Natural Religion, we carry this matter to be examined by the Scriptures, it is clear that all the Passages that are in the Old
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60825:22"/>
Testament, are not to be made use of in this matter of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side. For as the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was given to the <hi>Iews</hi> by an immediate Grant from Heaven; so God reser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> still this to himself, and to the Declarations that he shoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap>ke from time to time, either by his Prophets, or by the Answers that came from the Cloud of Glory that was between the Cherubims, to set up Judges or Kings over them, and to pull them down again as he thought fit. Here was an express De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation made by God, and therefore all that was done in that Dispensation, either for or against Princes, is not to be made use of in any other State that is founded on another Bottom and Constitution, and all the Expressions in the Old Testament relating to <hi>Kings,</hi> since they belong to Persons that were immediately designed by God, are without any sort of Reason applied to those who can pretend to no such Desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, neither for themselves nor for their Ancestors.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. As for the New Testament, it is plain, that there are no Rules given in it, neither for the <hi>Forms of Government</hi> in general, nor for the degrees of any one Form in particular, but the general Rules of Justice, Order and Peace, being esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in it upon higher Motives, and more binding Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, than ever they were in any other Religion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, we are most strictly bound by it to observe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution in which we are; and it is plain, that the Rules set us in the Gospel can be carried no further. It is indeed clear from the New Testament, that the Christian Religion as such, gives us no grounds to defend or propagate it by force. It is a Doctrine of the Cross, and of Faith, and Patience under it: And if by the order of Divine Providence, and of any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Government, under which we are born, we are brought under Sufferings for our professing of it, we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed retire and fly out of any such Country if we can; but if that is denied us, we must then, according to this Religion, submit to those Sufferings under which we may be brought, considering that God will be glorified by us in so doin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and that he will both support us under our Sufferings, and glo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously reward us for them.</p>
                  <p>This was the State of the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> during the three first <hi>Centuries,</hi> under Heathen <hi>Emperors,</hi> and a Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which <hi>Paganism</hi> was establish'd by Law. But if by the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60825:23"/>
Laws of any Government, the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> or any Form of it, is become a part of the Subjects <hi>Property,</hi> it then falls und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>other Consideration; not as it is a <hi>Religion,</hi> but as it is become one of the principal Rights of the Subjects to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and profess it: and then we must judg of the Invasions made on that, as we do of any other Invasion that is made on our other <hi>Rights.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">X. All the Passages in the <hi>New Testament</hi> that relate to <hi>Civil Government,</hi> are to be expounded as they were truly meant, in opposition to that false Notion of the <hi>Iews,</hi> who believed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be so immediately under the Divine Authority, that they could not become the Subjects of any other Power, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of one that was not of their Nation, or of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; therefore they thought they could not be under the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoke, nor bound to pay Tribute to <hi>Cesar,</hi> but judged that they were only subject out of <hi>Fear,</hi> by reason of the force that lay on them, but not <hi>for Conscience sake:</hi> And so in all their Dispersion, both at <hi>Rome</hi> and elsewhere, they thought they were <hi>God's Freemen,</hi> and made use of this pretended <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty as a Cloak of Maliciousness.</hi> In opposition to all which, since in a course of many Years, they had asked the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoke, and were come under their Authority, our Saviour ordered them to continue in that, by his saying, <hi>Render to</hi> Cesar <hi>that which is</hi> Cesar<hi>'s</hi>; and both St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> in his general <hi>Epistle,</hi> have very positively condemned that pernicious Maxim, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any formal Declarations made of the Rules or Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of <hi>Government.</hi> And since both the <hi>People</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> had acknowledged the Power that <hi>Augustus</hi> had indeed violently usurped, it became Legal when it was thus submitted to, and confirmed both by the <hi>Senate</hi> and <hi>People:</hi> and it was established in his Family by a long Prescription, when those <hi>Epistles</hi> were writ: So that upon the whole Matter, all that is in the <hi>New Testament</hi> upon this Subject, imports no more, but that <hi>all Christians</hi> are bound to acquiesce in the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and submit to it, according to the Constitution that is setled by <hi>Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">XI. We are then at last brought to the Constitution of our English Government: so that no general Considerations from Speculations about Sovereign Power, nor from any Passages,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60825:23"/>
either of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testament,</hi> ought to determine us in this Matter; which must be fixed from the Laws and Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations that have been made among us. It is then certain, that with Relation to the Executive part of the Government, the Law has lodged that singly in the King; so that the whole ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of it is in him; but the Legislative Power is lodged between the King and the two Houses of Parliament; so that the Power of making and repealing Laws, is not singly in the King, but only so far as the two Houses concur with him. It is also clear, that the King has such a determined extent of Prerogative, beyond which he has no Authority: As for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, If he levies Mony of his People, without a Law impowring him to it, he goes beyond the Limits of his Power, and asks that to which he has no Right: So that there lies no Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the Subject to grant it; and if any in his Name use Violence for the obtaining it, they are to be looked on as so many Robbers, that invade our Property; and they being vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Aggressors, the Principle of Self-Pres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rvation seems here to take place, and to warrant as violent a Resistance.</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. There is nothing more evident, than that <hi>England</hi> is a Free Nation, that has its Liberties and Properties reserved to it, by many positive and express Laws: If then we have a Right to our Property, we must likewise be supposed to have a Right to preserve it: for those Rights are by the Law secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red aginst the Invasions of the Prerogative, and by consequence we must have a Right to preserve them against those Invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It is also evidently declared by our Law, that all Orders and Warrants that are issued out in opposition to them, are null of themselves; and by consequence, any that pretend to have Commissions from the King for those Ends, are to be considered as if they had none at all; since those Commissions being void of themselves, are indeed no Commissions in the Construction of the Law; and therefore those who act in vertue of them, are still to be considered as private Persons who come to invade and disturb us. It is also to be observed, that there are some Points that are justly disputable and doubtful, and others that are so manifest, that it is plain that any Objections that can be made to them, are rather forced Pretences, than so much as plausible Colours. It is true, if the Case is doubtful, the Interest of the publick Peace and Order ought to carry it;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60825:24"/>
but the Case is quite different, when the Invasions that are made upon <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property,</hi> are plain and visible to all that consider them.</p>
                  <p n="13">XIII. The main and great Difficulty here, is, that though our Government does indeed assert the <hi>Liberty of the Subject,</hi> yet there are many express Laws made, that lodg the <hi>Militia</hi> singly in the King, that make it plainly unlawful, upon any Pretence whatsoever, to take Arms against the King, or any Commissioned by him: And these Laws have been put in the Form of an Oath, which all that have born any Employment, either in Church or State, have sworn; and therefore those Laws for the assuring our <hi>Liberties,</hi> do indeed bind the King's Conscience, and may affect his Ministers; yet since it is a Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime of our Law, that the <hi>King can do no wrong,</hi> these cannot be carried so far as to justify our taking Arms against him, be the Transgressions of Law ever so many and so manifest. And since this has been the constant <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> it will be a very heavy Imputation on us, if it appears, that though we held those Opinions, as long as the Court and Crown have favoured us, yet as soon as the Court turns against us, We change our Principles.</p>
                  <p n="14">XIV. Here is the true Difficulty of this whole Matter, and therefore it ought to be exactly considered: <hi>First,</hi> All general Words, how large soever, are still supposed to have a tacit Exception and reserve in them, if the Matter seems to require it. Children are commanded to obey their Parents in <hi>all things:</hi> Wives are declared by the Scripture, to be subject to their Husbands <hi>in all things, as the Church is unto Christ:</hi> And yet how comprehensive soever these words may seem to be, there is still a reserve to be understood in them; and though by our Form of Marriage, the Parties swear to one another <hi>till Death them do part,</hi> yet few doubt but that this Bond is dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Adultery, though it is not named; for odious things ought not to be suspected, and therefore not named upon such occasions: But when they fall out, they carry still their own force with them. 2. When there seems to be a Contradiction between two Articles in the Constitution, we ought to examin which of the two is the most Evident, and the most Important, and so we ought to fix upon it, and then we must give such an accommodating sense to that which seems to contradict it, that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60825:24"/>
so we may reconcile those together. Here then are two seeming Contradictions in our Constitution; The one is the <hi>Publick Liberty</hi> of the Nation; the other is the Renouncing of all <hi>Resistance,</hi> in case that were invaded. It is plain, that our <hi>Liberty</hi> is only a thing that we enjoy at the <hi>King</hi>'s Discretion, and during his Pleasure, if the other against all Resistance is to be understood according to the utmost extent of the Words. Therefore since the chief Design of our whole Law, and of all the several Rules of our Constitution, is to secure and mai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tain our <hi>Liberty,</hi> we ought to lay that down for a Conclusion, that it is both the most plain and the most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of the two. And therefore the other Article against <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance</hi> ought to be so softned as that it do not destroy us. 3. Since it is by a Law that <hi>Resistance</hi> is condemned, we ought to understand it in such a sense as that it does not destroy all other Laws: And therefore the intent of this <hi>Law,</hi> must only relate to the <hi>Executive Power,</hi> which is in the <hi>King,</hi> and not to the <hi>Legislative,</hi> in which we cannot suppose that our Legislators, who m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>de that Law, intended to give up that, which we plainly see they resolved still to preserve entire, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Ancient Constitution. So then, the not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting the <hi>King,</hi> can only be applied to the <hi>Executive Power,</hi> that so upon no pretence of ill Administrations in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Law, it should be lawful to resist him; but this cannot with any reason be extended to an Invasion of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative Power,</hi> or to a total <hi>Subversion of the Government.</hi> For it being plain, that the <hi>Law</hi> did not design to lodg that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the <hi>King,</hi> it is also plain, that it did not intend to secure him in it, in case he should set about it. 4. The Law men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the <hi>King,</hi> or those <hi>Commissioned</hi> by him, shews plainly, that it only designed to secure the <hi>King</hi> in the Executive Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: for the word <hi>Commission</hi> necessarily imports this, since if it is not according to <hi>Law,</hi> it is no <hi>Commission</hi>; and by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>quence, those who act in virtue of it, are not Commissiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>King</hi> in the Sense of the <hi>Law.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> likewise imports a Prince clo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hed by <hi>Law</hi> with the Regal Prerogative; but if he goes to <hi>subvert</hi> the whole Foundation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, he <hi>subverts</hi> that by which he himself has his Power, and by consequence he ann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ls his own Power; and then he
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60825:25"/>
ceases to be <hi>King,</hi> having endeavoured to destroy that upon which his own Authority is founded.</p>
                  <p n="15">XV. It is acknowledged by the greatest Assertors of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchial Power, that in some Cases a <hi>King</hi> may fall from his Power, and in other Cases that he may fall from the Exercise of it. His Deserting his People; his going about to enslave, or sell them to any other; or a furious going about to destroy them, are in the opinion of the most Monarchial Lawyers, such Abuses, that they naturally divest those that are guilty of them, of their whole Authority. <hi>Infancy</hi> or <hi>Phrenzy</hi> do also put them under the Guardianship of others. All the Crowned Heads of <hi>Europe</hi> have, at least secretly, approved of the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the late <hi>King of Portugal</hi> under a Guardianship, and the keeping him still a Prisoner for a few Acts of Rage, that had been fatal to a very few Persons: And even our Court gave the first countenance to it, though of all others the late King had the least reason to have done it, at least last of all, since it justified a younger Brother's supplanting the Elder; yet the Evidence of the Thing carried it even against Interest. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if a King goes about to subvert the Government, and to overturn the whole Constitution, he by this must be supposed, either to fall from his Power, or at least from the Exercise of it, so far as that he ought to be put under Guardians; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Case of <hi>Portugal,</hi> the next Heir falls naturally to be the Guardian.</p>
                  <p n="16">XVI. The next Thing to be considered, is to see in Fact whether the Foundations of this <hi>Government</hi> have been struck at, and whether those Errors that have been perhaps committed, are only such Maleversations as ought to be imputed only to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Frailty, and to the Ignorance, Inadvertencies, or Passions to which all Princes may be subject, as well as other Men. But this will best appear, if we consider what are the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Points of our Government, and the chief Securities that we may have for our Liberties.</p>
                  <p>The Authority of the Law is indeed all in one word, so that if the King pretends to a Power to dispense with Laws, there is nothing left upon which the Subject can depend; and yet as if the Dispensing Power were not enough, if Laws are wholly suspended for all Time coming, this is plainly a repealing of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60825:25"/>
them, when likewise the Men, in whose Hands the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Justice is put by Law, such as Judges and Sheriffs, are allowed to tread all Laws under-foot, even those that infer an Incapacity on themselves if they violate them; this is such a breaking of the whole Constitution, that we can no more have the Administration of Justice, so that it is really a Dissolution of the Government; since all Trials, Sentences, and the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of them, are become so many unlawful Acts, that are null and void of themselves.</p>
                  <p>The next Thing in our Constitution, which secures to us our <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> is a <hi>Free</hi> and <hi>Lawful Parliament.</hi> Now, not to mention the breach of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Triennial Parliaments,</hi> it being above three Years since we had a Session that enacted any Law; Methods have been taken, and are daily a taking, that render this impossible. <hi>Parliaments</hi> ought to be chosen with an entire Liberty, and without either Force or Preingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: whereas if all Men are required before-hand to enter into Engagements how they will vote if they are chosen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or how they will give their Voices in the Electing of others? This is plainly such a preparation to a <hi>Parliament,</hi> as would indeed make it no <hi>Parliament,</hi> but a <hi>Cabal,</hi> if one were chosen, after all that Corruption of Persons who had prein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged themselves, and after the Threating and Turning out of all Persons out of Imploiments who had refused to do it: And if there are such daily Regulations made in the Towns, that it is plain those who manage them, intend at last to put such a number of Men in the Corporations, as will certainly chuse the Persons who are recommended to them. But above all, if there are such a number of Sheriffs and Mayors made over <hi>England,</hi> by whom the Elections must be conducted and returned, who are now under an Incapacity by Law, and so are no legal Officers, and by cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>quence those Elections that pass under their Authority are null and void: If, I say, it is clear that things are brought to this, then the Government is dissolved, because it is impossible to have a <hi>Free and Legal Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> in this state of things. If then both the Authority of the <hi>Law,</hi> and the Constitution of the <hi>Parliament</hi> are struck at and dissolved, here is a plain Subversion of the whole Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But if we enter next into the particular Branches of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60825:26"/>
the Government, we will find the like Disorder among them all.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Church of England</hi> make a great Article of our Government, the latter being secured, not only of old by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> but by many special <hi>Laws</hi> made of late; and there are particu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>udging or Censuring them. If then in opposition to this, a Court so condemned is ercted, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to Judg and Censure the Clergy, and even to disseise them of their <hi>Free-holds,</hi> without so much as the form of a Trial, though this is the most indispensable <hi>Law</hi> of all those that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures the Property of <hi>England</hi>; and if the King pretends that he can require the Clergy to publish all his Arbitrary <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and in particular one that strikes at their whole Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and has ordered Process to be begun against all that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey'd this illegal Warrant, and has treated so great a number. of the Bishops as Criminals, only for representing to him the Reasons of their not obeying him; If likewise the King is not satisfied to profess his own Religion openly, though even that is contrary to <hi>Law,</hi> but has sent Ambassadors to <hi>Rome,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Nuncio's from thence, which is plainly Treason by <hi>Law</hi>; If likewise many <hi>Popish</hi> Churches and Chappels have been publickly opened; if several Colledges of <hi>Iesuits</hi> have been set up in divers parts of the Nation, and one of the Order has been made a Privy Counsellor, and a principal Minister of State: And if <hi>Papists,</hi> and even those who turn to that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, though declared Traitors by <hi>Law,</hi> are brought into all the chief Imploiments, both Military and Civil; then it is plain, That all the Rights of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and the whole Establishment of the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> are struck at, and design'd to be overturned; since all these Things, as they are notoriously illegal, so they evidently demonstrate, That the great Design of them all, is the rooting out of this Pestilent Heresy, in their stile, I mean, the <hi>Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
                  </p>

In what is doing in <hi>Scotland</hi> we may gather what is to be expected in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; where if the King has over and over again declared, that he is vested with an <hi>Absolute Power,</hi> to which all are bound to <hi>obey without reserve,</hi> and has upon that annulled almost all the Acts of Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Minority, though they were ratified by himself when he came to be of Age, and were confirmed by all the subsequent Kings, not excepting the present. We must then conclude from thence, what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved on here in <hi>England,</hi> and what will be put in Execution as soon as it is thought that the Times can bear it. When likewise the whole Settlement of <hi>Ireland</hi> is shaken, and the Army that was raised, and is maintained by Taxes that were given for an Army of <hi>English Protestants,</hi> to secure them from a new <hi>Massacre</hi> by the <hi>Irish Papists,</hi> is now all filled with <hi>Irish Papists,</hi> as well as almost all the other Imployments; it is plain, that not only all the <hi>British Protestants</hi> inhabiting that Island, are in daily danger of being butchered a second time, but that the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is in danger of losing that Island, it being now put wholly into the Hands and Power of the Native <hi>Irish</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who as they formerly offered themselves up some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> sometimes to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and once

to the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> so are they perhaps at this present treating with another <hi>Court</hi> for the Sale and Surrender of the Island, and for the Massacre of the <hi>English</hi> in it.</p>
                  <p>If thus all the several Branches of our Constitution are dissolved, it might be at least expected that one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But the whole Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the Birth, the sending away the Princess of <hi>Denmark,</hi> the sudden shortning of the <hi>Reckoning,</hi> the <hi>Queen</hi>'s sudden going to St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s, her no less sudden pretended Delivery; the hurrying the Child into another Room without shewing it to those present, and without their hearing it cry; and the mysterious Conduct of all since that time; no Satisfaction being given to the Princess of <hi>Denmark</hi> upon her Return from the <hi>Bath,</hi> nor to any other Protestant Ladies, of the <hi>Queen</hi>'s having been really brought to Bed. These are all such evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Indications of an Imposture in this Matter, that as the Nation has the justest Reason in the World to doubt of it, so they have all possible Reason to be at no quiet till they see a Legal and Free Parliament assembled, which may impartially, and without either Fear or Corruption, examine that whole Matter.</p>
                  <p>If all these Matters are true in Fact, then I suppose no Man will doubt, that the whole Foundations of this Government, and all the most sacred Parts of it, are overturned.

                     <hi>An ANSWER to a PAPER, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled,</hi> Reflections on the Prince of <hi>ORANGE</hi>'s Declaration.</head>
                  <p>IT seems a strange piece of Arrogance that any Man should reflect on a Declaration, because it does not begin as he would have it; that is, with a Manifestation of our Clandestine League with <hi>France,</hi> whereby an Army of <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> together with our <hi>Papists, Irish,</hi> and other Mercenaries, might establish Popery in <hi>England.</hi> The Reflector ought to have consider'd, that a Clandestine League, tho' it may be very notorious to its Existence and Effects, may likewise be very difficult to prove, according to the meaning of the word Clandestine. But that there is such a one, we have the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of the King of <hi>France,</hi> in a Memorial delivered to the States of <hi>Holland</hi>; and though it has been since disowned by our Court, and Mr. <hi>Skelton</hi> upon it committed to the Tower; his short Confinement, and sudden Advancement to a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, shews that his Disgrace was but a trick of State: It is also an inconsequential way of Arguing, that because the Prince does not begin his Declaration with it, therefore there is no such League, things of that high consequence being ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier and better carried on by secret Messages, than Writings under Hand and Seal.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In his second Reflection, he tells us the Prince had needed less Apology, if he had pretended only to have come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the King from Evil Counsellours, and to ingage him fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Interest of <hi>Europe</hi>; forgetting the Prince does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to us he comes for that end, tho' not singly, and brought over his Army to secure him from the Rage and Fury of those Evil Counsellours. His next Quarrel is, that the Prince uses the Stile, <hi>Of We and Vs within His Majesties Dominions</hi>; a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60825:28"/>
thing, I believe, ordinary enough in Great Princes, when they speak, or write to their Inferiours. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> is General of a great &amp; numerous Army, Admiral of a vast Fleet, State-holder to a High and Mighty Common-wealth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, too great to speak in the Stile of a Private Person; so that Rewarding, Punishing, Commanding, Advancing, may very naturally fall within his Power. Nor is it any Crime to endeavour the calling of a Free Parliament, and settling the Nation, tho by ways and methods unusual in our days, nothing being more frequent in our Histories, than for our Barons, with Arms in their Hands, to compel their Kings to call and hearken to their Parliaments: But now there being a standing Army of fourty thousand Mercenaries in the Land, it was grown a Crime to petition for a Parliament, and a Folly to expect a free one, new Charters and Corporations, and a general Nomination of incompetent Magistrates, having taken the Election of Members for Parliament out of those Hands, the Laws of the Land, and Memorial Custom, had intrusted with them. According to the new Scheme designed by those Upstart and Popish Counsellours, no Man was to Elect, or be Elected for Parliament, that would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, as far as in them lay, to take away the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> and <hi>Test</hi>; nay, those wicked Counsellors prevailed yet farther up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Majesty; and he that pardoned so many of his Enemies, was not suffered to forgive his best Friends, and most Loyal Subjects a Refusal or Excuse in that particular.</p>
                  <p>That the Prince will send back his Army, seems to some a strong presumption that he will not stay behind, since even our own lawful King thinks himself not safe without an Army of Mercenaries in his own Kingdom. From a strain'd Phrase or two, <hi>Of We and Vs, Require and Command,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times used in his Declaration, to infer, That the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> intends to make himself King of <hi>England,</hi> seems to all rational Men a very captious and unsatisfactory way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, and a very unjust Calumny cast upon so great a Prince, since more than once in express terms, he declares he has no design upon his Majesty's Crown or Person, so that all that Reproach falls to the Ground.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In his third Reflection, he tells us the Prince wants a clear Call, and that a Son against a Father, a Nephew against
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60825:28"/>
and Unkle, a Neighbour against a Neighbour, cannot be such: That he is a Son-in-Law, and a Nephew to his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Majesty, gives the Prince a fair and just pretence to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in our Affairs: had he been a Foreigner, as our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flector</hi> terms him, it might have look'd like an intended Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest; had he not been a Neighbour, it had been Impossible for him to have afforded us this seasonable Assistance. But some think, that where Attempts are made to introduce the Catholick Religion, by a Conspiracy against the Laws that secure and establish the Protestant Religion and the Test, that only can keep the Papists out of the Government: And to carry on this Conspiracy the better, the old Charters are taken away under pretence of Forfeiture and Surrender; new ones granted, such as might bring Elections within the Power of those Evil Counsellors; Papists upon the Bench, a Jesuit in the Council, and whole Troops of them in the Army: 'Twas high time for a Protestant Prince, that had so near relation to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> to look about him, and choose rather to be censured by our Reflector, and such as he, for entering upon the Stage a little before his time, than be justly reproach'd and curs'd to the End of the World, by all such as love the Protestant Religion, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Government of <hi>England,</hi> for appearing too late in their Defence. The Example of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of <hi>France,</hi> may teach us how hard it is for a Protestant Prince to obtain his Right, where the Catholick Religion is predominant; nor was the new Armour of Popery he put on at last, sufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the old Protestant against the Stab of a Jesuited <hi>Novitiate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. His fourth Reflection acquaints us, the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is at once expos'd and hazarded; for if the King pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, what can the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s sort of Protestants ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect at his Hands, which are indeed all sorts of Protestants that I know of, for the <hi>Presbyterians, Independants, Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Church-of</hi>-England-<hi>Men,</hi> are in his Army: 'Tis fair warning, and I hope God will give the Protestants Grace to make the right use of it: As for their changing Masters, 'tis a <hi>Chimera</hi> of his own, and utterly foreign to the Declaration he pretends to reflect upon. Lest we should forget, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> us with that admirable Demonstration of, <hi>I say, that the whole Protestant Religion is at stake</hi>; for which I heartily
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60825:29"/>
thank our worthy Reflector, for tho it be very true, we had not seen it in Print but for him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In his fifth Reflection, he tells us that some Laws are better broken than kept, which will not be easily granted; 'tis indeed true, that some Laws were better be repealed than continued: But then they must be null'd by the same Power they were constituted, and not by any part of it in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the whole.</p>
                  <p>His instance is, That Christianity could not have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd had the <hi>Pagan</hi> Laws been executed; by which Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel he would warrant Popery to be the true Christianity, and the Protestant the Heathen Persecutors; Laws for Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try cannot bind, therefore Laws against it cannot; a very strange Inference, and I allow that a Lawful Authority by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding their just Bounds, may act unlawfully, but the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative Power cannot, since all over the World the Supream Power ever was absolute, be it in one or more. He says, no Man is obliged to maintain a Religion that is not true, be it never so legally established: So that it is but saying the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion is not true, and His Majesty, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his repeated Ingagements, is no longer bound to protect it. For in the words of our Reflector 'tis an Absurdity and Impiety to do so.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The sixth thing considerable in our Reflector is, his Defence of the Dispensing Power, and the use His Majesty, seduc'd by his Evil Councellors, makes of it; which is no other than the setting aside of all our Laws made for the Security of the Protestant Religion; but sure such a Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative can never be legally vested in the Crown, which, if ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, were the destruction of all Law.</p>
                  <p>Had those Evil Counsellors only prevailed with his Majesty, to have dispensed with the Penalties inflicted on Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks and other Dissenters, for serving of God according to their particular Consciences, though perhaps contrary to Law, the matter had never been complained of: But to put them into Places of the highest Trust, to make one Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> another President of the Council, a third Lieutenenant General of the Tower, a fourth a Judg; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying numbers of them in the Army, Court, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is a Transgression of the Law, which is certainly very dangerous,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60825:29"/>
if not immediately, yet inevitable in its Consequences to the Protestant Religion and Government, and therefore a Mischief remote only (as an Egg is from a Chicken) from the worthy Reflector's <hi>Malum in se,</hi> which he acknowledges this Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Power extends not to. And the particular Catholicks breaking the Law in these Points, are without Excuse: For no Man is obliged in Conscience to be a Judg, a Priest, a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, a Privy-Councellor, a Courtier, or a Souldier in time of Peace, contrary to the Laws of the Land. Nor do those Laws deprive the King of the Service of any of his Subjects absolutely; since all Men, if they please, may capacitate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for Imployment. If the High-Commission-Court be at an end, <hi>Magdalen</hi>-Colledge and the Bishop of London re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored, we may in all appearance thank the Honesty and Caution of some of its worthy Members, and the Noise of what our Reflector calls the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Invasion; though some will say, a Descent upon <hi>England</hi> made by a Prince of the Blood, Married to the Eldest Daughter of the present King, upon the Invitation of many Lords both Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Temporal, and of the considerable Gentry, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty of all Counties, might have deserved a fairer Name. Nor ought any Man to complain if his honest Neighbour break violently into his House at a time when his Family cry out Fire or Murther; the common Obligation of Humanity, and a due care of their own Preservation, exact no less of them. But this Paper is not intended for a Vindication of the Prince, I will therefore return to my Reflector again, who undertakes for all good Protestants that they only refus'd to repeal the Test, by reason of the Security it affords to their Religion. As if they had cast off all care of their Civil Concerns, and were only intent upon Religious Affairs, so as to consent to give his Majesty a Majority of Papists in the House of Lords; by which he might have two Negative Voices upon all Laws to be offer'd: and an House of Pears ready to repeal the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beas Corpus</hi> Bill, and such Statutes as any ways seem to incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what Papists think his Majesties Prerogative, of which they maintain the Dispensing Power to be an Essential Part; and well they may, since it is the very Power, by which he maintains them in Places and Imployments: So that by leave of my worthy Reflector, the Considerations of Religion, tho

they are the principal, are not the only Reasons, that have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined all good Protestants to a Non-concurrence with his Majesty in the Repeal of the Test.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. In his eighth Reflection he tells us, That Chappels are places of Devotion; so are <hi>Turks</hi> Mosques, and the <hi>Iews</hi> Synagogues, yet no good Christian but would be offended to see them multiply'd and encouraged, either in his own, or his Neighbours Country.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. In his ninth he tells us, The King was content the Test should remain. I answer, These Evil Counsellors were not content the Test should remain, but sent their Regulators and other Agents, to threaten, promise, remove and change the Magistrates in all Corporations in order to the procuring Members of Parliament, such as were to enter the House under solemn Promises, and firm Resolutions, to take off the Penal Laws and Test, notwithstanding all the weighty, nay, convincing Arguments they might meet with there to the contrary: A desperate sort of Senators, and fitter for <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines</hi> Conspiracies than an <hi>English</hi> Parliament. Nor did these Evil Counsellors cease to sollicit even Knights of the Shire, till the general Indignation their Proposals met with, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Noise of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Preparations, frightned them from a further prosecution of their enormous Attempts. He ingenuously confesses the seizing of Charters to have been a fault, so there is no Contest between us on that Point; but he adds, That the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with it; now others think him highly concern'd in it; for if, according to Sir <hi>Thomas Moore, Rex Potest Iuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Parta mentem &amp; potest &amp; destrui</hi>; or according to the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of latter Times, a Parliament may make a Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion; a Prince that has so near a Relation to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> ought not to suffer any foul play in the calling together such an Assembly as may null his Title, or preclude him of his Right to the Crown in time to come. 'Tis true, the Counsel for seizing Charters was given in the last King's Reign, and most of them then seized, but no Man can deny but some have been condemned and seized in the Reign of his present Majesty, and restored not till the Apprehension of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Invasion; so that we are promised a Free Parliament, only because they cannot put one of their own framing upon us.</p>
                  <p n="10">
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:60825:30"/>10. His tenth Paragraph needs no answer.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. In his eleventh, he tells us there were but two Papist Judges, as if the Laws were not broken unless the Judges were all Papists; or that Judges sitting contrary to Law could give a Legal Sentence. Both these defects he supposes supplied by the <hi>Dispensing Power,</hi> a Power sufficiently baffled by those Gentlemen of the long Robe of Counsel for the Bishops, and not defended by either Judges or Counsel on the other side; for which two of the Judges, <hi>Iones</hi> and <hi>Holloway,</hi> lost their places on the Bench.</p>
                  <p n="12">12, 13. His twelfth and thirteenth concern <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and therefore I will leave them untouch'd, to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of those Nations, who best understand, and are most sensible of the Oppressions they are under.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. In his fourteenth, he pleads the Validity of the King's Declaration for Liberty of Conscience, tho' that pretended <hi>Prerogative</hi> has been discuss'd and baffled in <hi>Parliament,</hi> within these few years, and deserted as such by His late Majesty; he affirms, that the King, as Head of the Church, might oblige the Bishops to cause the Declaration to be read in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which if they had complied with, in the Opinion of many good <hi>Protestants,</hi> they had precluded themselves of their Votes in <hi>Parliament</hi> against it; for with what Forehead could they Vote against the Declaration, when they caused it to be read in their Churches? An Act amounting to no less than maintaining, or owning, the <hi>Dispensing Power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. In his fifteenth, he allows the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Princess</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> have, in terms full of respect, signified to the King their deep regret which all these things have given them, and their Thoughts abour Repealing the <hi>Test</hi> and <hi>Penal Laws</hi> as an Expedient of Peace; but blames him, it seems, for doing all this so respectfully and privately, and would rather had it done by a <hi>Manifesto,</hi> that some of the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Friends might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned for delivering it, as Captain <hi>Lenham</hi> is for bringing over the Declaration. He tells us next, the King has come up almost to <hi>Fagel</hi>'s Letter, which was the Declaration of their Minds, <hi>viz.</hi> The Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Test, and Laws of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy to remain; then urging the King's Concessions, which may be observ'd to bear date only from the report of the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Preparations for <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="16">
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:60825:31"/>16. He tells us in his sixteenth, That the <hi>Prince</hi> thinks a <hi>Free Parliament</hi> to be the last and great Remedy for these Evils<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but complains these Wicked Counsellors are against it, for fear of being called to Account, that they had preingaged Voices to take off the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> and the <hi>Test</hi>; and regulated Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Burroughs, that so they might assure themselves of the Members of <hi>Parliament.</hi> He allows the Charge, but says, What has all this to do with the King? No Man says it has, and the <hi>Prince</hi> only requires the removal and punishment of those Evil Counsellors in a <hi>Free Parliament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="17">17. Next our Reflector tells, That there never was a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> absolutely <hi>Free,</hi> but that Drink, Mony, and other Evil Arts, have had a great sway in Elections. This is true, but no reason that we should consent to a General or Fundamental Corruption of our Elections, because we cannot avoid some few and casual Ones. Then he would have had the <hi>Prince</hi> have desired the King to have laid aside those Evil Counsellors, as if it were not Notorious, that the <hi>Princes</hi> dislike of some Men has been their ready way to Preferment in our Court; and Embassadors for <hi>Holland</hi> have been, of late, chosen out of those he has most aversion for; as if these Wicked Counsellors feared nothing so much as a good Understanding between His Majesty and the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. In the nineteenth he tells, The Prince and Princess of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Question concerning the Birth of the <hi>Prince of Wales,</hi> saying, That <hi>during the Queen's pretended Bigness, and in the manner in which the Birth was managed, there have appear'd so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny just and visible grounds of Suspicion, that not only the Prince himself, but all good Subjects in</hi> England, <hi>do vehemently suspect that the pretended Prince of</hi> Wales <hi>was not born of the Queen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="20">20. Next our Reflector tells us, <hi>That the Prince ought to have writ to the King for a private satisfaction in this Matter, which the King would no doubt have given in the manner that all reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Men do when they are examined against themselves.</hi> All Men allow the imputation of such an Imposture, to be a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on their present Majesties. But some think they have in a great measure drawn it upon themselves, by omitting to have those Witnesses by, and those Methods observed, that our Laws require to prove the Birth of a Legitimate Prince of <hi>Wales:</hi> 'Tis not perhaps enough to say, that there were as
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60825:31"/>
many Witnesses, and as good Proof of it as the Law exacts; still the Question returns, Why not the same Persons? a Legal Proof admits of no Equivolent.</p>
                  <p>Our Reflector will not deny, but that there has been common Fame all over <hi>Europe,</hi> that this Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> was not Born of the Body of her Majesty, and common belief of it among Protestants; this of it self were enough to make the next Heir to the Crown look about, and move every Stone that the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might be examined by impartial Methods in a <hi>Free Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which is all that the Prince and Princess of <hi>Orange</hi> aims at; for their Proofs to the contrary, 'tis not to expected they should acquaint the World with them before the Trial.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. In his two and twentieth Reflection on the eighteenth Paragraph, where the Prince says, <hi>He was invited to this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition by many Lords, both Spiritual and Temporal, and many Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and Subjects of all Ranks:</hi> Our Reflector is pleased to tell him he is mistaken, as <hi>Monmouth</hi> was. Notwithstanding those eminent Peers, Gentry and Commonalty of all sorts that are already in his Camp, and such as are going daily, as well Souldiers as others; nor considering the great number of the Nobility that are in the Country and have not been examin'd, and that such as were examin'd here in Town, did no more than answer, Not Guilty to the Charge of High-Treason: So that there are more Nobility and Gentry with him than with his Majesty.</p>
                  <p>In his three and twentieth Reflection on the 19<hi>th</hi> and 20<hi>th</hi> Paragraph, where the Prince refers all to a free Parliament; our Reflector says it belongs not to him, to refer other Mens business; as if the <hi>Prince</hi> had no relation to the Crown: Then tells us we are already in possession of what the <hi>Prince</hi> promises us; as if the Catholicks were all out of imployment, the Dispensing power given up, no standing Army, no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> and a <hi>Free Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for redressing of Grievances of all kinds in being.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. In the twenty fourth Reflection on the three last Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs of the <hi>Princes</hi> Declaration, he tells us, <hi>The Prince has a manifest design upon the-Crown, because he summons the Nobility, Gentry and People of England to his Standard: And if so, who must stay with the King?</hi> To that may be answered, All such as believe the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> has brought this Army, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60825:32"/>
to make War upon <hi>England</hi> to subdue it to his meer will and pleasure, trample all Laws, both Divine and Humane, under his Fleet, dethrone his present Majesty, and make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self King; they will stay and fight for him, or at least to the best of their power, in some other manner assist and help him: On the contrary part, such as believe the <hi>Prince</hi> means nothing of all this, but brought over his Army only the better to assist the Nobility, Gentry, and People of <hi>England,</hi> upon their earnest desires, and frequent solliciations, and reiterated complaints, in the recovering of the old Legal way of choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Members for <hi>Parliament,</hi> which by Illegal new Charters, on pretended Forfeitures, was in a ready way to be for ever lost; in rescuing all the Laws of <hi>England</hi> from the devouring Jaws of a <hi>Dispensing Power</hi>; in reducing <hi>Popery</hi> within those bounds the Law has prescribed it, which, like an Inundation, had so over-flowed its Banks, that our Religion and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were in peril to be swallowed up by it; and finally, to redress these and all other grievances, if for these and no other ends or concerns Men think the <hi>Prince</hi> has landed here, such Men will take his part, espouse his quarrel, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to his success: and in these cases every Man will judg for himself, as they did in our late Civil Wars.</p>
                  <p>Again, he charges the <hi>Prince</hi> with a design of Conquest; which not only the <hi>Prince</hi> himself disclaims throughout his Declaration, and will hereafter disown in all his Manifesto's; but the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> who have so vigorously assisted, and engaged themselves with all their Power and Credit, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him in this Attempt, have assur'd us he left <hi>Holland</hi> under high and solemn Protestations to the contrary. All this is, I hope, sufficient to dash the strain'd inferences of an inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Reflector.</p>
                  <p>As for that impudent Calumny of <hi>Perjury</hi> he endeavours to fix upon the <hi>Prince,</hi> it needs no other refutation than a serious consideration of the Charge it self; his Words are, <hi>The Prince of</hi> Orange <hi>swore to the States of</hi> Holland <hi>never to be their State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, tho' it were offered him, and yet is now that very State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder he swore never to be on any terms.</hi> Now let any reasonable Man consider, whether it be possible a Wise State should by an Oath given him, disable the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> from being their State-holder, tho' Circumstances and times should so
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60825:32"/>
change, that their immediate preservation and very existence of their State should require him to accept, and execute that Office. For his personal Reflections towards the latter end, I think very Impertinent, and only fit to be buried in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
                  <p>Thus having followed my tedious Reflector through his twenty four Reflections, I take my leave of him, reserving the <hi>Princes</hi> farther Vindication to some time when I shall be more at leisure to write, and people willinger to read, than they can be under the present surprize, hourly expectation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual anxiety, for the event of this Heroick Enterprise.</p>

Of which, I beg you, as a Friend, to consider the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences, and to reflect on the Blot and Infamy it will bring on you, not only now, but in all After-Ages, That by Your means the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> was destroy'd, and your Country depriv'd of its Ancient Liberties: And if it pleases God to bless the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Endeavours with Success, as I don't doubt but he will, consider then what their Condition will be that

                  <p>WE the Nobility, Gentry, and Commonalty of these Northern Counties assembled together at <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> for the defence of the Laws, Religion, and Properties, according to those free-born Liberties and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, descended to us from our Ancestors, as the undoubted Birth-right of the Subjects of this Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> (not doubting but the Infringers and Invaders of our Rights will represent us to the rest of the Nation in the most malicious dress they can put upon us) do here unanimously think it our Duty to declare to the rest of our Protestant Fellow-Subjects the Grounds of our present Undertaking.</p>
                  <p>We are by innumerable Grievances made sensible, that the very Fundamentals of our Religion, Liberties, and Properties are about to be rooted out by our late Jesuitical Privy-Council, as hath been of late too apparent. 1. By the King's dispensing with all the Establish'd Laws at his pleasure. 2. By displacing all Officers out of all Offices of Trust and Advantage, and placing others in their room that are known Papists, deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly made inc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By discouraging all persons that are not Papists, preferring such as turn to Popery. 5. By displacing all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and conscientious Judges, unless they would, contrary to their Consciences, declare that to be Law which was meerly arbitrary. 6. By branding all Men with the name of Rebels that but offered to justify the Laws in a legal Course against the arbitrary proceedings of the King, or any of his corrupt Ministers. 7. By burthening the Nation with an Army, to

maintain the Violation of the Rights of the Subjects. 8. By discountenancing the Establish'd Reformed Religion. 9. By forbiding the Subjects the benefit of Petitioning, and construing them Libellers; so rendring the Laws a Nose of Wax, to serve their Arbitrary Ends. And many more such like, too long here to enumerate.</p>
                  <p>We being thus made sadly sensible of the Arbitrary and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical Government that is by the Influence of Jesuitical Counsels coming upon us, do unanimously declare, That not being willing to deliver our Posterity over to such a condition of Popery and Slavery, as the aforesaid Oppressions inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly threaten; we will, to the utmost of our Power, oppose the same, by joining with the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (whom we hope God Almighty hath sent to rescue us from the Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions aforesaid) will use our utmost Endeavours for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of our almost ruin'd Laws, Liberties, and Religion; and herein we hope all good Protestant Subjects will with their Lives and Fortunes be assistant to us, and not be bugbear'd with the opprobrious Terms of <hi>Rebels,</hi> by which they would fright us, to become perfect Slaves to their tyrannical Insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Usurpations; for we assure our selves, that no ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and unbyassed Person will judg it Rebellion to defend our Laws and Religion, which all our Princes have sworn at their Coronations: Which Oath, how well it hath been observed of late, we desire a <hi>Free Parliament</hi> may have the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of.</p>
                  <p>We own it Rebellion to resist a King that governs by Law, but he was always accounted a Tyrant that made his Will the Law; and to resist such an one, we justly esteem no Rebellion, but a necessary Defence; and in this Consideration we doubt not of all honest Mens Assistance, and humbly hope for, and implore the great God's Protection, that turneth the Hearts of his People as pleaseth him best; it having been observed, That People can never be of one Mind without his Inspiration, which hath in all Ages confirmed that Observation, <hi>Vox Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli est Vox Dei.</hi>

Stratagem be fooled, till this present storm that threatens the Papists, be past, assoon as they shall be resetled, the former Oppression will be put on with greater vigour: but we hope in vain is the Net spread in the sight of the Birds; For (1.) The Papists old Rule is, <hi>That Faith is not to be kept with Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> as they term Protestants, tho' the Popish Religion is the greatest Heresy. And (2.) Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s so ill observing her promises to the <hi>Suffolk</hi>-men that help'd her to her Throne. And above all, (3.) the Popes dispensing with the breach of Oaths, Treaties, or Promises at his pleasure, when it makes for the service of Holy Church, as they term it. These, we say, are such convincing Reasons to hinder us from giving Credit to the aforesaid <hi>Mock-Shews</hi> of Redress, that we think our selves bound in Conscience to rest on no Security that shall not be approved by a freely Elected Parliament, to whom, under God, we refer our Cause.</p>

                  <p>NOT doubting but you and the rest of your Body, as well as the whole City and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, may be allarmed by the great Concourse of Gentry, with the numerous Appearance of their Friends and Servants, as well as of your own <hi>Militia,</hi> here this Morning, I have thought this the most
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60825:36"/>
proper place, as being the most publick one, to give you an account of our Intentions.</p>
                  <p>Out of the deep sense we had that in the present unhappy Juncture of Affairs, nothing we could think of was possible to secure the Laws, Liberties and Protestant Religion, but a Free Parliament; WE ARE HERE MET TO DECLARE, that we will do our utmost to defend the same by declaring for such a Free Parliament.</p>
                  <p>And since His Majesty hath been pleased (by the News we hear this day) to order Writs for a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to sit the 15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Ianuary</hi> next, I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> can only add in the Name of my Self and all these Gentlemen, and others here met, That we will ever be ready to support and defend the Laws, Liberties and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion: And so GOD SAVE THE KING.</p>
                  <p>To this the Mayor, Aldermen, and the rest of the Corporation, and a numerous Assembly did concur with his Grace, and the rest of the Gentry.</p>
                  <p>His Grace at his lighting from his Horse, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving great numbers of Common People gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, called them to him, and told them, He desired they would not take any occasion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any Disorder or Outrage, but go quietly to their Homes; and acquainted them that the King had ordered a Free Parliament to be called.</p>

                  <p>THE deep sense we have had of the great Dangers your Majesties Sacred Person has been in, and the great Effusion of Christian Blood that threatned this your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Kingdoms, and in probability would have been shed, unless God of his infinite Mercy had put it into your Majesties Heart to call a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the only means, in our opinion, under the Almighty, left to quiet the Minds of your Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;

                  <head>THE EXPEDITION Of His HIGHNESS the Prince of ORANGE For <hi>ENGLAND.</hi> Giving an Account of the most remarkable Passages thereof, from the Day of his setting Sail from <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to the first Day of this instant <hi>December,</hi> 1688.</head>
                  <p>HIS Highness the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> set Sail from <hi>Holland</hi> with 51 Men of War, 18 Fire-ships, and about 330 Tenders, being Ships hired of Merchants for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of Horse and Foot, Arms, Ammunition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Fleet stood out at Sea to the <hi>Norward,</hi> which met with horrid Storms for two Days and two Nights together, in which bad Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there were lost above 500 Horse, and a Vessel parted from the Fleet, wherein were 400 Foot, supposed to be lost, but now known to be arrived safe at the <hi>Texel,</hi> but grievously shatter'd and torn by the Storms; two of the Prince's principal Men of War were forced to new Rigg at <hi>Helversluse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prince immediately, on his return back, inform'd the States of the condition of the Fleet, (which was not so dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified as was represented by the Vulgar and Ignorant) who
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60825:39"/>
thereupon, to lull a great Man asleep, the States, or some one employed by them, order'd, That the <hi>Harlem</hi> and <hi>Amsterdam</hi> Courantier should make a dismal Story of it, by representing to the World, that the Prince returned with his Fleet mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably shatter'd and torn, having lost nine Men of War, and divers others of less Concern; 1000 Horse ruin'd; a Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture among the Sea-men; the loss of Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> and the chief Ministers under the Prince; the ill Opinion the States had of the Expedition: In short, that a 100000 <hi>l.</hi> would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the Dammage sustained; and, almost next to an impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, that the Prince should be in a condition to pursue his Design till the Spring. And yet at the same time all hands were at work to repair the damaged Ships, which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confiderable; so that in eight days time they were all re-fitted. The Signal being given by the discharge of a Gun, all the Fleet immediately weigh'd Anchor and stood out at Sea, steering their Course <hi>Norward</hi> all that Night; next day, upon Tide of Ebb, they made a Stretch, and made a Watch above a League, and then stood <hi>Westward,</hi> and lay all Night in the same posture, not making two Leagues of Watch.</p>
                  <p>In the middle of the Night, an Advice-Boat brought us an Account, that the English Fleet, consisting of 33 Sail, lay to the <hi>Westward</hi> of ours. Upon which the Prince fired a Gun, which caused a great Consternation in the whole Fleet, we having a brisk <hi>Easterly</hi> Wind, concluded themselves to be all ruin'd: But the small Advice-Boats crusing for a more certain Account of the English, brought us back word, That instead of the English Fleet, which the former Advice had alarm'd us with, it was Admiral <hi>Herbert</hi> with part of our Fleet, which had been separated some hours from the Body of the Fleet: Upon whose arrival, great rejoicing was among us all, and a Signal of Joy was given for it by the Prince.</p>
                  <p>In the Morning, about Eight, the Prince gave a Signal, that the Admirals should come aboard him: Immediately after the whole Fleet was got into the <hi>North-foreland,</hi> upon which the Prince gave the usual Sign of Danger, (according to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Book) and ordered that the Fleet should all come up in a Body, some fifteen or sixteen deep, his Higness leading the Van, in the Ship <hi>Brill,</hi> (in English, <hi>Spectacles):</hi> His Flag was English Colours; the Motto impailed thereon, is, THE PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TESTANT
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60825:39"/>
RELIGION, AND LIBERTIES OF ENGLAND; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath, instead of <hi>Diu &amp; Mon Droit,</hi> AND I WILL MAIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAIN IT.</p>
                  <p>The Council of War, from aboard the Prince, sent three small Frigats into the Mouth of the <hi>Thames, viz.</hi> the <hi>Porpus, Postilion,</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi>; who on their return, brought us word, That the English Fleet lay in the <hi>Buoy of the Nore,</hi> consisting of 34 Sail, and three more which lay in the Downs. The Wind continuing at E. N. E.</p>
                  <p>The Prince immediately thereupon, gave another Signal of stretching the whole Fleet in a Line, from <hi>Dover</hi> to <hi>Callis,</hi> twenty five deep: So that our Fleet reached within a League of each place; the Flanks and Reer were guarded by our Men of War. This sight would have ravish'd the most curious Eyes of <hi>Europe.</hi> When our Fleet was in its greatest splendour, the Trumpets and Drums playing various Tunes to rejoyce our Hearts; this continued for above three hours.</p>
                  <p>Immediately after the Prince gave us a Sign to close, and we sailed that night as far as <hi>Beachy,</hi> and commanded us to follow the Signal by Lights he had hung out to us, <hi>viz.</hi> all the small Sail should come up to him by morning.</p>
                  <p>By the morning-day we espied the <hi>Isle of Wight,</hi> and then the Prince ordered the Fleet to be drawn into the same posture as before related: yet not stretching above half Channel over in this place. About five in the morning we made the Start, the Wind chopping about to the <hi>Westward</hi>; upon which we stood fair by <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> and so made for <hi>Tor-bay,</hi> where the Prince again ordered the whole Fleet into the same posture as at <hi>Dover</hi> and <hi>Callis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon his arrival at <hi>Tor-bay,</hi> the People on Land, in great numbers, welcom'd his Highness with loud Acclamations of Joy.</p>
                  <p>Immediately after the Prince gave two Signals, that the Admirals should come aboard him, which they did; and then order'd, that the whole Fleet should come to an Anchor, and immediately Land; and further order'd, that the Admirals should stand out at Sea as a Guard, as well as the smaller Men of War to Attend and Guard their Landing; and also order'd six Men of War to run in to Guard <hi>Tor-bay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60825:40"/>The Prince then put out a Red Flag at the Misen-yard-arm; and provided to land in sixty Boats, laid ready for that purpose: Upon which the Prince signified, that General <hi>Mackay</hi> with his six Regiments of <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> should first Land; and also, that the little <hi>Porpus</hi> with eighteen Guns should run a-ground to secure their Landing: But there was no Opposition; for the People bid us <hi>Heartily Welcome to</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and gave us all manner of Provisions for our Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>The fifth of <hi>November</hi> (a Day never to be blotted out of the <hi>English-man</hi>'s Heart) the Prince caused to be landed about 2000: The Country bringing in all manner of Provision both for Man and Horse, and were paid their Price honestly for it.</p>
                  <p>The Prince the same Day commanded Captain <hi>M</hi>— to search the Lady <hi>C</hi>—'s House, at <hi>Tor-Abby,</hi> for Arms and Horses; and so all other Houses which were <hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi> The Lady entertained them civilly, said her Husband was gone to <hi>Plymouth:</hi> They brought from thence some Horses, and a few Arms, but gave no further Disturbance to the Lady or her House. Nor shall it be forgotten, what was faithfully acted at this Lady's House, immediately on our arrival at <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bay:</hi> There was a Priest, and some others with him were upon a Watch-Tower to discover what our Fleet was, whether <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Dutch:</hi> At last they discovered the White Flags on some of our Men of War; the ignorant Priest concluded ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely we were the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, which with great impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience they had so long expected; and having laid up great Provisions for their Entertainment, the Priest ordered all to the Chappel to sing <hi>Te Deum</hi> for the arrival of their sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Forces; but being soon deceived, on our Landing, we found the benefit of their Provisions; and instead of <hi>Vostre Serviture Monsieur,</hi> they were entertained with <hi>Yeen Mijnheere, Can you Dutch spraken?</hi> Upon which they all ran away from the House, but the Lady and a few old Servants.</p>
                  <p>Presently after the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Landing, he sent a <hi>Quince</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Bath,</hi> which was supposed to intimate his coming in to him.</p>
                  <p>The whole Army, to the best of my knowledg, consisted of about 30000 Horse and Foot, Volunteers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The News of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60825:40"/>
Prince's landing was brought to the City of <hi>Exeter</hi> by several Expresses to the Earl of <hi>Bath:</hi> they landed all their Horse first of all, and after that the Foot, all the Army being ashore by <hi>Tuesday</hi> Three of the Clock in the Afternoon, all their Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, Provisions, and Ammunition being sent about for <hi>Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham,</hi> where they were brought up by Water to this City, there was abundance landed with the Prince at <hi>Torbay</hi> for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Service in case they should need it. The <hi>Wednesday,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 7<hi>th</hi> currant, one Captain <hi>Hicks</hi> came to Town (who is the Son of that worthy Divine Mr. <hi>Iohn Hicks</hi> the N. C. deceased) and as soon as he came, the Mobile in very great numbers flocked to him to list themselves in the Service of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> which the Mayor hearing of, sent for him and questioned with him, whether he had a Commission for what he did? but he would produce none, nor give any account of the Prince's Design, upon which he was committed to Prison; but the Concourse of People was so great about the <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> that they would not suffer him to be carried away, so he remained there till next day in the Custody of two Constables, and was very nobly provided for by the Mayor; <hi>Thursday</hi> the Lord <hi>Mordant</hi> with three or four Troops of Horse came to Town, and Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> with him, and when they came to the Gate of this City it was shut against them, upon which the Lord <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi> commanded the Porter to open the Gate on pain of Death, which was presently set open, and being open, required him on the same Penalty not to shut it again: as soon as they were entred, the Lord <hi>M.</hi> went to the Hall, and set Captain <hi>Hicks</hi> at liberty, and inquired of his Usage, who gave the Lord <hi>M.</hi> a very large Character of the Mayor's Civility &amp; Respect to him, upon which there was a Guinea given those that waited on him; that Afternoon the Lord <hi>M.</hi> and Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> waited on the Mayor to know if he would meet the Prince at the Gate, and govern the City under him? which he excused, and told them he was under the Obligation of an Oath to his Majesty, and therefore desired the Prince would lay no Commands on him that should be prejudicial to his Conscience, and after some debate of the Matter they departed, all the <hi>Thursday</hi> they kept coming to Town; the <hi>Friday</hi> the Prince came with his Guards, and were marching into, and some through the City to places adjacent about three hours without ceasing, and more
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60825:41"/>
or less they came in still until Night; Men better hors'd I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver saw in all my Life.</p>
                  <p>The Prince's Entry was in this manner:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Macklesfield</hi> with 200 Horse, the most part of which were <hi>English</hi> Gentlemen rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mounted on <hi>Flanders</hi> Steeds, (managed and used to War) in Head-Pieces, Back and Breast, bright Armour.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. 200 Blacks, brought from the Plantations of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> having on Imbroider'd Caps lin'd with white Fur, and Plumes of White Feathers, to attend the Horse.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. 200 <hi>Finlanders</hi> or <hi>Laplanders,</hi> in Bears Skins, taken from the Wild Beasts they had slain, the common Habit of that cold Climate, with black Armour, and broad flaming Swords.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. 50 Gentlemen, and as many Pages to attend and support the Prince's Banner, bearing this Inscrption, GOD and the PROTESTANT RELIGION.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. 50 Led-Horses, all manag'd and brought up to the Wars, with two Grooms to each Horse, and two Coaches of State.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. After these Rid the Prince on a Milk-white Palfrey, armed Cap-a-Pee, a Plum of White Feathers on his Head, all in bright Armour, and forty two Foot-men running by him.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. After his Highness followed likewise on Horseback 200 Gentlemen and Pages.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. 300 <hi>Switzers</hi> with Fuzees.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. 500 Volunteers, each two led-Horses.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. His Captain and Guards 600 armed Cap-a-Pee. The rest of the Army brought up the Reer.</p>
                  <p>Saturday most part of the day, and Sabbath-day, and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and Tuesday the main Body of the Army came, and most of them, only some few Regiments of Foot, marched to <hi>Tiverton, Collumpton, Honiton,</hi> &amp;c. and to the Neighbouring Parishes, and the Foot to <hi>Clist-beath,</hi> where they incamped and pitch'd their Tents. The Bishop fled, and is come for <hi>London,</hi> and we hear is made Arch-bishop of <hi>York</hi>; the Dean likewise withdrew, whose House the Prince took for his Lodgings. The Lord's-day Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> preach'd at the Cathedral on the last Verse of 107<hi>th</hi> Psalm, wherein he observed the wonderful Providence of God towards them in the whole Conduct of Affairs in this Undertaking, and how they intended to have landed the 4<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> if it had been possible, it being
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60825:41"/>
the Prince's Birth-day, and the Day of his Marriage to the Princess, but they could not possibly make the Land, and so could not get the Shoar till the 5<hi>th,</hi> that <hi>England</hi>'s Deliverance might be begun on the same Day that it was formerly designed for Ruin and Destruction. On Monday all the Canons that were in Town were summoned to appear in the Quire, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Singing-Men, when after they had sung <hi>Te Deum,</hi> Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> read the Prince's Declaration, and after the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, a short Prayer for the Success of the Prince, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. There was not one of the Canons appeared; and when the Declaration was reading the Singing-Men went away, they being commanded in the Service to forbear praying for the Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi> Monday Captain <hi>Burrington,</hi> who lives by <hi>Crediton,</hi> came to the Prince and offered him his Service, who was very kindly received by Him; after that every day the Gentry from all parts of <hi>Devonshire, Somersetshire,</hi> &amp;c. flocked to him in great numbers, it would take up too much time to name them, few absenting themselves, and those that did, there is great notice taken of them; they have entered into an Association to stand and fall with the Prince; several Lords came to him while here, as the Lord <hi>Colchester,</hi> the Lord <hi>Abbington,</hi> the Lord <hi>Cornbury,</hi> the Lord <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> &amp;c. It is incredible to tell you what they have brought with them, except you saw it, there being 200 of their Ships come into the River of <hi>Topsham. Plymouth</hi> Fort is surrendered to the Prince by the Lord of <hi>Bath,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Huntington,</hi> and the Popish Officers that were therein with Father <hi>Turner</hi> are seized and secured, and the Popish Souldiers discharged; and coming hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and owning themselves such, are committed by Mr. <hi>Seamour,</hi> who is made our Governour, and one Major <hi>Gibson</hi> Deputy-Governour. Here are several thousands of Souldiers that have listed themselves, and many thousands more would have done the same, but the Marschal <hi>de Schomberg</hi> told the Prince there was no need of them, so were dismist again. They have a vast Treasure with them, I am certainly informed of 50 Waggons loaded with Cash. They have landed about 120 Field-Guns, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of which remain still here, the other are gone with the Prince. The last News we had was, that the Prince was at the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi>'s, which is by <hi>Sherborn,</hi> where we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that Prince <hi>George,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Grafton,</hi> the Lord
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60825:42"/>
                     <hi>Churchill,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Trelawny</hi> met him, and that the Prince saluted them in the words of <hi>David</hi> to the Men of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.17. <hi>If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine Heart shall be knit unto you; but if ye be come to betray me to mine Enemies, seeing there is no Wrong in my Hands, the God of our Fathers look thereon, and rebuke it.</hi> And they replied in the words of <hi>Amasai</hi> in the 18<hi>th</hi> Verse, <hi>Thine are we,</hi> David, <hi>and on thy side, thou Son of</hi> Jesse: <hi>Peace, Peace be unto thee, and Peace be unto thine Helpers, for thy God helpeth thee. Then</hi> David <hi>received them, and made them Captains of the Band.</hi> The Prince at his going from hence, gave the Mayor this Character, That he was worthy to be trusted, for being faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his Trust.</p>

                  <head>A further Account of the Prince's Army, in a Letter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sent from <hi>Exon,</hi> dated <hi>Nov.</hi> 24.</head>
                  <p>HAD I not insensibly over-slipt my Time the last Post, you had received this then: When I came here, I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to inform my self, after the best manner I could, as to the Number and Quality of the Prince's Army, and all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally concluded them to be about 30000, all pick'd Men, and many of them personally present at the Siege of <hi>Buda.</hi> This I am certain of, that they appeared to be Men resolute, well Disciplined, and Stout, and of an extraordinary Stature, and their Arms suitable, Musquets, Swords, and Pikes, being far larger than ever I yet saw; and notwithstanding the Streets were thronged, almost as thick as yours on a Lord-Mayor's Day, yet was it even a rarity to see one of them shorter than six Foot, and some of them were, I am confident, six foot and a quarter, if not six foot and an half in Height: So that were it lawful to trust in an Arm of Flesh, they might have some cause to presume; but the tenour of their words were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, their civil deportment, and their honesty of paying for what they have, (and the strictness of their Discipline hinders
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60825:42"/>
them from being otherwise) winning not a little the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Country-men, who daily resort hither, forty or fifty in a Gang, to be Listed. My Lord <hi>Mordent</hi>'s Regiment was soon compleated, which with two others, was raised and maintained at the Charge of the Gentry in this County, of which <hi>Edward Seymour</hi> 
                     <abbr>Esq</abbr> is by the Prince made Governour. During his Highness stay here, which was till last <hi>Wednesday,</hi> there appeared a Court most splendid, composed, not only of Foreign, but of many of the English Nobility and Gentry, which came hither to wait on his Highness since his Arrival, of both Ranks, upwards to the number of Sixty, all mighty Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant in their Equipage, each striving thereby to add to the Glory of their Design. The Gentry of these Parts first seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed slow in their Advances to serve the Prince; but as soon as the Ice was broke by Capt: <hi>Burrington,</hi> the majority soon followed his steps, and have entred into an Association. It is to admiration to consider the vast Magazine of all War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Utensils brought hither by the Prince's Army, their Baggage having for a Fortnight together been continually Landing, and yet not fully ended: Were it not for the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Roads, as I was informed by a private Sentinel, they could draw into the Field an Artillery of above 200 Pieces: But the greatest Curiosity I yet saw, was a Bridg of Boats, such as I conceive the <hi>Imperialists</hi> use to pass over the <hi>Danube</hi> and <hi>Save</hi> with, which was for the speedy convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their Carriages, laid over the River in two or three Hours, and afterwards as soon removed; not to mention a Smith's Shop or Forge, curiously contrived in a Waggon; or another Contrivance the Foot carry with them to keep off the Horse, which in their manner may well yield the Service of a Pike.</p>
                  <p>There hath been lately driven into <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> and since ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, a <hi>French</hi> Vessel loaden altogether with Images, and Knives of a very large proportion, in length nineteen Inches, and in breadth two Inches and an half; what they were designed for God only knows.</p>

                     <head>I. A Letter from a Iesuit of <hi>Liege,</hi> to a Iesuit at <hi>Friburg,</hi> giving an Account of the Happy Progress of Religion in <hi>England.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IT cannot be said what great Affection and Kindness the K. hath for the Society, wishing much Health to this whole Colledg by <hi>R. P.</hi> the Provincial, and earnestly recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself to our Prayers. The Provincial, <hi>Alexander Regnes,</hi> being come back for <hi>England,</hi> the K. was graciously pleased to send for him; (several Earls and Dukes waiting his coming at the hour appointed) the Q. being present, the King discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing familiarly with him, asked him, <hi>How many young Students he had, and how many Scholasticks?</hi> To which (when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial had answered, That of the latter he had Twenty, of the former more than Fifty) he added, <hi>That he had need of double or treble that number to perform what he in his Mind had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for the Society</hi>; and commanded that they should be very well exercised in the Gift of Preaching; <hi>for such only</hi> (saith he) <hi>do we want in</hi> England.</p>
                     <p>You have heard, I make no doubt, that the K. hath sent Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to Father <hi>Le Cheese,</hi> the French King's Confessor, about <hi>Wadden</hi>-house, therein declaring, that he would take in good part from him, whatsoever he did or was done for the English Fathers of the Society. Father <hi>Clare</hi> Rector of the said House going about those Affairs at <hi>London,</hi> found an easy access to the King and as easily obtained his Desires. He was forbid to kneel
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60825:43"/>
and kiss the King's Hand (as the manner and custom is) by the K. himself, saying, <hi>Once indeed your Reverence kissed my Hand; but had I then known you were a Priest, I should rather have kneeled and kissed your Reverences hand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After the Business was ended, in a familiar Discourse, the K. declared to this Father, <hi>That he would either Convert</hi> England, <hi>or die a Martyr; and that he had rather die to morrow, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version wrought, than reign fifty Years without that in Happiness and Prosperity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Lastly, He called himself <hi>a Son of the Society,</hi> the Welfare of which, he said, he as much rejoiced at as his own: And it can scarce be said how joyful he shewed himself when it was told him, That he was made partaker, by the most Reverend Father <hi>N.</hi> of all the Merits of the Society; of which number he would declare one of his Confessors: Some report <hi>R. P.</hi> the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial will be the person, but whom he designs is not yet known. Many do think an Archbishoprick will be bestowed on Father <hi>Edmond Petre,</hi> (chiefly beloved) very many a Cardinals Cap, to whom, (within this Month or two) that whole part of the K. Palace is granted, in which the K. when he was Duke of <hi>York</hi> used to reside; where you may see I know not how many Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers daily attending to speak with his Eminency, (for so they are said to call him) upon whose Counsel, and also that of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Catholick Peers, highly preferred in the Kingdom, the K. greatly relyes, which way he may promote the Faith without violence. Not long since some Catholick Peers did object to the K. that he made too much haste to establish the Faith, to whom He answered, <hi>I growing old, must make great steps, otherwise, if I should die, I shall leave you worse than I found you.</hi> Then they asking him, why therefore was he not more sollicitous for the Conversion of his Daughters, Heirs of the Kingdom? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <hi>God will take care for an Heir; leave my Daughters for me to Convert; do you by your example reduce those that are under you, and others to the Faith.</hi> In most Provinces he hath prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Catholicks; and in a short time we shall have the same Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Peace (as they are called) in them all. At <hi>Oxford</hi> we hope Matters go very well; one of our Divines is always Resident therein; a publick Catholick Chappel of the Vice-Chancellor's, who hath drawn some Students to the Faith. The Bishop of <hi>Oxford</hi> seems very much to favour the Catholick
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60825:44"/>
Cause: He proposed in Council, Whether it was not expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that at least one Colledg in <hi>Oxford</hi> should be allowed Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, that they might not be forced to be at so much Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, by going beyond Seas to Study? What Answer was given, is not yet known. The same Bishop inviting two of our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen, with others of the Nobility, to a Banquet, drank the King's Health to an Heretical Baron there, wishing a happy Success to all his Affairs; and he added, That the Faith of Protestants in <hi>England,</hi> seemed to him to be little better than that of <hi>Buda</hi> was before it was taken; and that they were for the most part mere Atheists who defended it. Many do em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Faith, and four of the chiefest Earls have lately pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed it publickly.</p>
                     <p>The Reverend Father, <hi>Alexander Regnes,</hi> Nephew to our Provincial, to whom is committed the Care of the Chappel of the Ambassador of the most Serene Elector Palatine, is whole days busied in resolving and shewing the Doubts or Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions of Hereticks, concerning their Faith, of which number you may see two or three continually walking before the Dores of the Chappel, disputing about Matters of Faith amongst themselves.</p>
                     <p>Prince <hi>George,</hi> we can have nothing certain what Faith he intends to make profession of.</p>
                     <p>We have a good while begun to get footing in <hi>England.</hi> We teach Humanity at <hi>Lincoln, Norwich,</hi> and <hi>York.</hi> At <hi>Warwick</hi> we have a publick Chappel, secured from all Injuries by the King's Souldiers. We have also bought some Houses of the City of <hi>Wigorn</hi> in the Province of <hi>Lancaster.</hi> The Catholick Cause very much increaseth. In some Catholick Churches, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Holy Days above 1500 are always numbred present at the Sermon. At <hi>London,</hi> likewise, things succeed no worse. Every Holy Day, at preaching, People so frequent, that many of the Chappels cannot contain them. Two of ours, <hi>Darmes</hi> and <hi>Berfall</hi> do constantly say Mass before the King and Queen, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Edmund Newil</hi> before the Queen Dowager, Father <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Regnes</hi> in the Chappel of the Ambassador aforesaid, others in other places. Many Houses are bought for the Colledg in the <hi>Savoy</hi> (as they call it) nigh <hi>Somerset-house,</hi> London, the Palace of the Queen Dowager, to the value of about eighteen thousand <hi>Florins,</hi> in making of which, after the Form of a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60825:44"/>
Colledg, they labour very hard that the Schools may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened before <hi>Easter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In <hi>Ireland</hi> shortly there will be a Catholick Parliament, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other can satisfy the King's Will to Establish the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Cause there. In the Month of <hi>February,</hi> for certain, the King hath designed to call a Parliament at <hi>London</hi>: 1. That by a Universal Decree, the Catholick Peers may be admitted into the Upper House. 2. That the Oath or Test may be annulled. 3. Which is the best or top of all, That all Penal Laws made against Catholicks, may be Abrogated; which that he may more surely obtain, he desires every one to take notice, that he hath certainly determined to dismiss any from all profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Imployments under him, who do not strenuously endeavour the obtaining those things; also that he will Dissolve the Parliament: with which Decree some Hereticks being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, came to a certain Peer to consult him what was best to be done: to whom he said, the Kings pleasure is sufficiently made known to us; what he hath once said, he will most certainly do: if you love your selves, you must submit your selves to the Kings Will. There are great preparations for War at <hi>London,</hi> and a Squadron of many Ships of War are to be fitted out against a time appointed; what they are designed for is not certain. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> greatly fear they are against them, and therefore begin to prepare themselves. Time will discover more.</p>

                     <p>IF I have fail'd, for the last few days, to observe your Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, it was not from want of Affection, but Health, that occasion'd the neglect; and for which I shall endeavour to make amends by the length of this.</p>
                     <p>I shall begin where my former left off, and shall tell you, That since the appearing of a Letter in this Town, written by the Prince's Minister of <hi>Holland,</hi> which declares the Intentions of the Prince and Princess of <hi>Orange,</hi> relating to the Repealing the <hi>Test,</hi> or to speak more properly, their Aversion to it: This Letter has produc'd very ill Effects among the Hereticks; whom, at the return of some of our Fathers from those Parts, we had perswaded, that the Prince would comply with every thing relating to the <hi>Test</hi> that the King should propose to the next Parli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ment, in case he should call one; to which I do not find his Majesty much inclin'd. But the coming of this Letter (of which I have inclos'd a Copy) has serv'd for nothing but to incourage the Obstinate in their aversion to that Matter. The Queen, as well as my self, were of Opinion, against the sending of any such Letter to the <hi>Hague</hi> upon that Subject, but rather that some Person able to discourse and perswade, should have been sent thither: for all such Letters, when they are not grateful, produce bad Effects. That which is spoken Face to Face, is not so easi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y divulg'd, nor any thing disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60825:45"/>
to the People, but what we have a raind the Vulgar should know: And, I believe, your Reverence will concur with me in this Opinion. This Letter has extreamly provok'd the King, who is of a temper not to bear a refusal, and who has not been us'd to have his Will contradicted: And, I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, this very affront has hastned his Resolution of re-calling the <hi>English</hi> Regiments in <hi>Holland.</hi> I shew'd his Majesty that part of your Letter, that relates to the Opinion of his <hi>Most Christian Majesty,</hi> upon this Subject, which his Majesty well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of. We are interested to know the Success of this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, and what Answer the States will give. The King chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as many Heretick Officers as he can, to put Catholicks in their places; but the Misfortune is, that here we want Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Officers to supply them: And therefore, if you know any such of our Nation in <hi>France,</hi> you would do the King a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to perswade them to come over, and they shall be certain of Employments, either in the old Troops, or the New that are speedily to be rais'd; for which, by this my Letter, I pass my Word.</p>
                     <p>Our Fathers are continually employ'd to convert the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; but their Obstinacy is so great, that for one that turns, there are five that had rather quit their Commands. And there are so many Male-contents, whose Party is already but too great, the King has need of all his Prudence and Temper to manage this great Affair, and bring it to that Perfection we hope to see it in ere long. All that I can assure you is, That here shall be no neglect in the Queen, who labours night and day with unexpressible Diligence for the propation of the Faith, and with the Zeal of a holy Princess. The Queen Dowager is not so earnest, and Fear makes her resolve to retire into <hi>Portugal</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to pass the remainder of her days in Devotion: she has already ask'd the King leave, who has not only granted it, but also promised that she should have her Pension punctually paid; and that during her Life, her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that she leaves behind her, shall have the same Wages, as if they were in waiting. She stays but for a proper Season to imbark for <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and to live there free from all Stories.</p>
                     <p>As to the Queen's being with Child<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that great Concern goes as well as we could wish, notwithstanding all the Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Discourses of the Heriticks, who content themselves to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60825:46"/>
vent their Poyson in Libels, which by night they disperse in the Street, or fix upon the Walls. There was one lately found upon a Pillar of a Church, that imported, That such a day Thanks should be given GOD for the Queen's being great with a Cushion. If one of these Pasquil-makers could be discover'd, he would but have an ill time on't, and should be made to take his last Farewel at <hi>Tyburn.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You will agree with me (most Reverend Father) that we have done a great thing, by introducing Mrs. <hi>Celier</hi> to the Queen: this Woman is totally devoted to our Society, and zealous for the Catholick Religion. I will send you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the progress of this Affair, and will use the Cypher you sent me, which I think very admirable. I can send you nothing certain of the Prince and Princess of <hi>Denmark</hi>; he is is a Prince with whom I cannot discourse about Religion; <hi>Luther</hi> was never more earnest than this Prince. It is for this reason that the King (who does not love to be denied) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet press'd him in that matter, his Majesty thinking it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that the Fathers should first prepare things, before he undertake to speak to him. But this Prince, as all of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, has naturally an Aversion to our Society; and this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy does much obstruct the progress of our Affairs; and it would be unreasonable to complain hereof to the King, at present to trouble him, tho he has an intire Confidence in us, and looks upon our Fathers, as the Apostles of this Land. As for <hi>Ireland,</hi> that Country is already all Catholick; yea, all the Militia are so. The Vice-Roy merits great Praise; we may give him this Honour, That he is a Son worthy our Society; and I hope will participate of the Merits of it. He informs me, he has just writ to your Reverence of these matters, how things go there. Some Catholick Regiments from those parts will speedily be sent for over for the King's Guards; his Majesty being resolv'd to trust them, rather than others; and may do it better in case of any popular Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, against which we ought to secure our selves the best we can. His Majesty does us the Honour to visit our Colledg often, and is most pleas'd when we present him some new Convert-Scholars, whom he incourages with his gracious Promises. I have not Expression sufficient to let you know with what De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion his Majesty communicated the last Holy-days; and a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60825:46"/>
Heretick cannot better make his Court to him, than by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Catholick Faith. He desires that all the Religious, of what Order soever they be, make open Profession as he does, not only of the Catholick Religion, but also of their Order; not at all approving that Priests, or Religious should conceal themselves out of Fear; and he has told them, That he would have them wear the Habit of a Religious; and that he will take care to defend them from Affronts. And the People are already accustomed to it; and we begin to celebrate Funerals with the same Ceremony as in <hi>France</hi>; but it is almost a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to see that no body speaks one word against it, no not so much as the Ministers in their Pulpits; in so good order has the King managed these Matters. Many <hi>English</hi> Hereticks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort often to our Sermons; and I have often recommended to our Fathers to preach now in the beginning, as little as they can of the Controversy, because that provokes; but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present to them the Beauty and Antiquity of the Catholick Religion, that they may be convinc'd, that all that has been said and preach'd to them, and their own Reflections concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, have been all Scandal: For I find (as the Apostle says) they must be nourished with Milk, not being able to bear strong Meat. Many have desir'd me to give them some of our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and even the holy Mass in <hi>English:</hi> which I mean to do, to satisfy the meanest sort, of which the greatest part do not understand <hi>Latin,</hi> but not to take away from the new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts their Testaments, which is a matter of moment; and, that we may not disgust them at the beginning, we must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>m to have them for a time, till they part with them of themselves. I had need of <hi>C. H</hi>'s Counsel upon this Point, and not in this only, but also in a great many other matters that daily press me: for you may easily believe, that I have often more business than I can well dispatch; and we must work with so much Circumspection and Precaution, that I have often need of your Paternity's wise Counsel. But the Lord and the good Virgin do strengthen me as there is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                     <p>The Bishop of <hi>Oxon</hi> has not yet declar'd himself openly; the great Obstacle is his Wife, whom he cannot rid himself of: His design being to continue Bishop, and only change Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as it is not doubted but the King will permit, and our holy
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60825:47"/>
Father confirm: tho I do not see how he can be farther use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to us in the Religion in which he is, because he is suspected, and of no esteem among the Hereticks of the <hi>English</hi> Church: nor do I see that the-Example of his Conversion is like to draw many others after him, because he declar'd himself so suddenly. If he had believ'd my Counsel, which was to temporize for some longer time, he would have done better; but it is his Temper, or rather Zeal that hurried him on. There are two other Prelates that will do no less than he; but they hold off alike, to see how they may be serviceable to the Propagation, and produce more Fruits, while they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue undiscover'd.</p>
                     <p>That which does us most harm with the Lords and great Men, is the apprehension of a Heretick Successor: <hi>For</hi> (as a Lord told me lately) <hi>assure me of a Catholick Successor, and I will assure you, I and my Family will be so too.</hi> To this happy purpose, the Queen's happy Delivery will be of very great moment. Our zealous Catholicks do already lay two to one that it will be a Prince: God does nothing by halves; and ever day Masses are said upon this very occasion.</p>
                     <p>I have gain'd a very great point, in perswading the King to place our Fathers in <hi>Madalen-Colledg</hi> in <hi>Oxon</hi>; who will be able to tutor the young Scholars in the Roman Catholick Religion. I rely much on Father <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> to whom I have given necessary Instructions how to govern himself with the Heretick People; and to take care in the beginning, that he speak not to them any thing that may terrify. And, as I tell you, a Religious has need here of great Prudence at this time, that the King may hear of no Complaints that may displease him; and therefore we dare not at present, do all we shall be able, and bound to do hereafter, for fear of too much haring the <hi>Mobile.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I like well that Father <hi>Hales</hi> goes to stay some time at the <hi>Hague incognito,</hi> on pretence of solliciting for a Place, which is not soon to be got there; and I have given him a Letter to some of that Court: Father <hi>Smith</hi> that is there now, by reason of his great Age, not being able to do all he ought and wishes to do, and is also too well known there. And I shall often impart to you what I shall learn from those Quarters: from whence I shall weekly receive something of moment, so
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60825:47"/>
long as the two Courts are in so bad Intelligence together, as at present they are. For my part, to speak freely on this To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick to your Reverend Fatherhood, I am of opinion, we should rather endeavour to moderate, than aggravate the Difference between them; tho I know I do not in this matter altogether concur with the Sense of the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadour, who considers only his Master's Interest: But we are necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to take other Measures, and such as perhaps may not always agree with the Interest of <hi>France</hi> in this matter.</p>
                     <p>And I think aggravating this Breach at present, to be also prejudicial to the Catholick Religion it self. The great Design we have so long aimed at, is applying to the King of <hi>France</hi> to take from the Hereticks all hopes of a Head, or any other Protection, than what they must expect from their own King; whereby they finding themselves expos'd to his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, will the more readily subscribe to his Will. But this misunderstanding between us, will occasion an opportunity to the Hereticks to set up the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> for their Chief: And let me assure you not to deceive your selves, The Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious of <hi>England,</hi> as well as the Presbyterians themselves, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> as their <hi>Moses</hi>; and his Party is already so powerful in both these Kingdoms, that it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear terrible to any thinking Person, should things come to extremity; as may never happen, if matters are not push'd on too far, but managed with Moderation. And I desire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with great deference to you better Judgment, that this matter might be hinted to his <hi>Most Christian Majesty,</hi> as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity shall serve, and am sensible it must be done with very great caution.</p>
                     <p>I can tell you nothing at present concerning the certainty of calling a Parliament; it requires so many things to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd of, and measures to be taken, that his Majesty ought to be well assur'd of the success, before he convenes them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I am not of opinion with many other Catholicks, who say, That by calling them the King hazards nothing; for, if they will not answer his Ends, he need only prorogue them, as is usually done: But it is my Opinion, and the Sense of many others, That his Majesty hazards much; for if it should unfortunately happen, that they should in their Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly refuse to comply with his Majesty's Desires, it may be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60825:48"/>
long enough ere he compass his Ends by way of a Parliament, and perhap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> never: and then there rests no Expedient, or other Means but by Violence, to execute the Orders of his secret Council, which must be suppos'd by his Army; who, upon a pretence of Incamping, may be called together with the less Jealousie or Suspicion. So, you may see (most Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Father) that we do not want work in these Quarters; and I must be supported by your Prayers, which I beg of you, and from all those of our Society.</p>
                     <p>His Majesty is so desirous that things may be done in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and upon a sure Fund, so as to be the more lasting, that he makes great application to the Shires and Corporations, to get such Persons chosen f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r the Parliament, as may be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to his Ends, of which he may be sure, before they come to debate: And the King will make them promise so firmly, and exact such Instruments from them in writing, that they shall not be able to go back, unless they will thereby draw upon themselves his Majesty's utmost Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and make them feel the weight of his Resentment. And I have here inclos'd some Effects of his Majesty's En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours in this matter, which is an Address which the Mayor, Sheriffs and Burgesses of <hi>New-Castle</hi> in the County of <hi>Stafford,</hi> have presented to the King [see the <hi>Gazette,</hi> where this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, as well as <hi>Glocester</hi> and <hi>Teuxbury,</hi> and others, in their Addresses, promise to chuse such Members as shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with his Majesty's Desires.] If all Towns were in as perfect Obedience as these, we should certainly have a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament call'd, which the Catholicks and Nonconformists expect with great Impatience. But since this cannot be said of many of them, the King's secret Council think good to wait for the Queen's Delivery, that they may see a Successor, who may have need of the whole Protection of the <hi>Most Christian King</hi> to support him, and maintain his Rights. And, by the Grace of God, we hope, that that Prince, treading in his Father's steps, may prove a worthy Son of our Society, like his Father, who thinks it no Dishonour to be so call'd.</p>
                     <p>As to other things (most Reverend Father) our Fathers with me, as well as generally all the Catholicks, with what grief do we hear of the Disunion that arises between his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60825:48"/>
Holiness and the <hi>Most Christian King!</hi> How does my Head, in imitation of the Prophet's, become a Spring of Tears to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment night and day the Schism that I fores<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And what a Desolation, and what Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the Hereticks must this occasion? They begin already to bid us convert the Children of the Family, before we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to convert Strangers. And I must with grief confess, they have but too much reason for what they say; and if there does not come some present Assistance from above, I foresee this Affair will occasion great Prejudices in the <hi>North:</hi> Nor have we any hope that his <hi>British</hi> Majesty will interpose here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in openly, he receiving so little Satisfaction from his Holiness in some Demands made by his Ambassadour at <hi>Rome,</hi> which (morally speaking) ought not to have been denied so great a King, who first made this step (which his Predecessors for a long time were not willing to undertake) in sending his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour of Obedience to <hi>Rome:</hi> And yet for all this our holy Father had not any particular Consideration of this Submission and Filial Obedience: so that I dare not mention this matter but by way of Discourse, daily expecting that of himself he will be pleased to make some Proposal therein. I doubt not (Reverend Father) of your constant Endeavour to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date this matter, thereby to take away from the Hereticks, especially the <hi>Hugonots of France,</hi> this occasion to laugh and deride us: and we should think the Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nge much for the worse, if, instead of the <hi>French</hi> King's going to <hi>Geneva,</hi> he should march to <hi>Rome:</hi> What may not all this come to? especially since the Marquess <hi>de Lavardin</hi> has been so passionate in his Discourse to the Cardinal-Chancellor, as to call him Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; and so far to forget his Duty and Reverence toward our Holy Father, the Pope himself, as to say he Doted: as the Hereticks do confidently discourse in these parts. I have caused some Masses of the Holy Ghost to be said, That God would please to inspire the discontented Parties with a Spirit of Peace and Concord. You did acquaint me some time since,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60825:49"/>
That Madam <hi>Mainteron</hi> did take upon her the Title of <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Society</hi>; by virtue whereof, you may command her, by virtue of Obedience, to use her Credit and Eloquence with the King, to incline him to an Accommodation in this matter. In the mean time, I hear that at <hi>Rome,</hi> many eminent Persons endeavour the same with his Holiness, who says, He cannot, nor ought not to recede from what he has done; otherwise it were in effect to submit to the Articles made in <hi>France</hi> by the Clergy in 1682, and consequently of too great moment to recant: and therefore Submission ought to come from the Son, and not from the Father. I recommend my self (Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Father!) to your Prayers and Blessing, desiring you would continue to assist me with your Salutal Counsels, and rest for ever.</p>

                     <p>Most Reverend Father, to satisfy the desire I have to shew you by my Letters the Choice you ought to make of such Persons fit to stir-up, I will in few words (since you desire it) inform you of the Genius of the People of our Court, of their Inclinations, and which of them we make use of; that: by a Parallel which you will make between them and your <hi>English</hi> Lords, you may learn to know them.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I shall begin with the Chief: I mean our Great Monarch. It is certain he is naturally good, and loves not to do Evil, unless desired to do it. This being so, I may say, he never would have undertaken the Conversion of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, without the Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> and without our Societies Correspondence abroad. He is a Prince enlightned; who very well observes, that what we put him upon, is contrary to his Interest, and that nothing is more opposite to his Great Designs, and his Glory; he aiming to be the Terror of all <hi>Europe.</hi> The vast number of Malecontents he has caused in his Kingdom, forces him in time of Peace to keep three times more Forces, than his Ancestors did in the greatest Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick and Foreign Wars: which cannot be done without a prodigious Expence.</p>
                     <p>The Peoples Fears also begin to lessen, as to his aspiring to an Universal Monarchy: and they may assure themselves he has left those Thoughts; nothing being more opposite to his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60825:50"/>
Designs, than the Method we enjoyn him. His Candor, Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Toleration to the Hereticks, would undoubtedly have open'd the Doors of the <hi>Low Countries, Palatinate,</hi> and all other States on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and even of <hi>Switzerland:</hi> whereas things are at present so alter'd, that we see the <hi>Hollanders</hi> free from any fear of danger; the <hi>Switzers</hi> and City of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> resolv'd to lose the last drop of their Blood in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; Besides, some Diversion we may expect from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, in case we cannot hinder a Peace with the <hi>Turks,</hi> which ought to hasten his <hi>Britannick</hi> Majesty, while he can be assured of Succors from the most Christian King.</p>
                     <p>Sir, his Majesty's Brother is always the same; I mean, takes no notice of what passes at Court. It has sometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, that the King's Brothers have acted so, as to be noted in the State; but this we may be assur'd will never do any thing to stain the Glory of his Submission and Obedience: And is willing to lend a helping-hand for the Destruction of the Hereticks; which appears by the Instances he makes to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, who now has promised him to cause his Troops to enter into the <hi>Palatinate</hi> the next Month.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>

                           </gap>auphin</hi> is passionately given up to Hunting, and little regards the Conversion of Souls; and it does not seem easy to make him penetrate into Business of Moment; and therefore we do not care to consult him which way, and how the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks ought to be treated. He openly laughs at us, and slights all the Designs, of which the King his Father makes great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. The Dauphiness is extreamly witty, and is, without doubt, uneasy to shew it in other Matters besides Complements of Conversation. She has given me a Letter for the Queen of <hi>England</hi>; wherein after her expression of the part she bears of the News of her Majesty's being with Child, she gives her several Advices about the Conversion of her Subjects.</p>
                     <p>Most Reverend Father, She is undoubtedly born a great Enemy to the Protestants, and has promoted all she could with his Majesty, in all that has been done, to hasten their Ruin; especially having been bred in a Court of our Society, and of a House whose hatred against the Protestant Religion is Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, because she has been raised up by the Ruin of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Protestant Princes, especially that of the <hi>Palatinate.</hi> But
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60825:50"/>
the King having caused her to come to make Heirs to the Crown, she answers expectation to the utmost.</p>
                     <p>Monsieur <hi>Louvois</hi> is a Man who very much observes his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which he performs to admiration; and to whom we must ack<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>owledg <hi>France</hi> owes part of the Glory it has hitherto gained, both in regard of its Conquests, as also the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Hereticks; to which latter I may say, he has contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as much as the King: he has already shewed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> himself Fierce, Wrathful, and Hardhearted in his Actions towards them; though he is not naturally inclin'd to Cruelty, nor to harrass the People. His Brother, the Arch-bishop of <hi>Rheims,</hi> has Ways which do not much differ from those of his Soul; and all the difference I find between them is, That the Arch-bishop loves his own Glory, as much as Monsieur <hi>de Louvois</hi> loves that of, his Majesty. He is his own Idol; and give him but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense, and you may obtain any thing. Honour is welcome to him, let it come which way it will. The least Thing provokes this Prelate; and he will not yield any thing derogatory to his Paternity. He will seem Learned; he will seem a great <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logian,</hi> and will seem to be a good Bishop, and to have a great care of his Diocess; and would heretofore seem a great Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher. I have hinted in my last, the Reasons why I cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together like him; which are needless to repeat.</p>
                     <p>The Arch-bishop of <hi>Paris</hi> is always the same, I mean, a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Man; whose present Conversation is charming, and loves his Pleasures, but cannot bear any thing that grieves or gives trouble, though he is always a great Enemy of the <hi>Iansenists,</hi> which he lately intimated to Cardinal <hi>Camus.</hi> He is always with me in the Council of Conscience, and agrees very well with our Society, laying mostly to Heart the Conversion of the Protestants of the three Kingdoms. He also makes very good Observations and Designs, to give some Advice to your Reverence, which I shall convey to you. I do sometimes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to him what you write to me.</p>
                     <p>My Lord <hi>Kingston</hi> has embrac'd our good Party: I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent when he Abjur'd in the Church of St. <hi>Denis</hi>; I will give you the Circumstances some other time.</p>
                     <p>You promised to send me the Names of all Heretick Officers who are in his Majesty's Troops; that much imports me, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60825:51"/>
you shall not want good Catholick Officers to fill up their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. I have drawn a List of them who are to pass into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and his most Christian Majesty approves thereof: Pray observe what I hinted to you in my last, on the Subject of the Visits, which our Fathers must give to the Chief Lords, Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the next Parliament; those Reverend Fathers who are to perform that Duty, must be middle-aged, with a lively Count<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nance, and fit to perswade. I also advised you in some of my other Letters, how the Bishop of <hi>Oxford</hi> ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himself, by writing incessantly, and to insinuate into the People the putting down the <hi>Test</hi>; and at the same time calm the Storm, which the Letter of Pentionary <hi>Fagel</hi> has raised. And his Majesty must continue to make vigorous Prohibitions to all Booksellers in <hi>London,</hi> not to print any Answers; as well to put a stop to the Insolency of Heretick Authors, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to hinder the People from reading them.</p>
                     <p>In short, you intimate to me, That his Majesty will follow our Advice: It's the quickest way, and I cannot find a better, or fitter, to dispossess his Subjects from such Impressions as they have received. His Majesty must also, by the same Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, profess in Conscience, that (if complied with) he will not only keep his Word, to maintain and protect the Church of <hi>England</hi>; but will also confirm his Promises by such Laws, as the Protestants shall be contented with. This is the true Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick way; for by his granting all, they cannot but consent to something.</p>
                     <p>His most Christian Majesty has with great success expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced this Maxim: And though he had not to struggle with Penal Laws and Tests, yet he found it convenient to make large Promises, by many Declarations; for, since we must dissemble, you must endeavour all you can to perswade the King it is the only Method to effect his Design.</p>
                     <p>I did also in my last, give you a hint of its Importance, as well as the ways you must take to insinuate your selves dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously with the King, to gain his good Will.</p>
                     <p>I know not whether you have observed what passed in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> some Years since; I will recite it, because Examples in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct much.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:60825:51"/>One of our Assisting Fathers of that Kingdom, (which was Father <hi>Parsons</hi>) having written a Book against the Succession of the King of <hi>Scots</hi> to the Realm of <hi>England.</hi> Father <hi>Creighton,</hi> who was also of our Society, and upheld by many of our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, defended the Cause of that King, in a Book Intituled, <hi>The Reasons of the King of Scots, against the Book of Father Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:</hi> And though they seem'd divided, yet they understood one another very well; this being practised by order of our General, to the end, that if the House of <hi>Scotland</hi> were Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, they might shew him who had the Government, the Book of Father <hi>Parsons</hi>; and on the other Hand, if the King happened to be restored to the Throne, they might obtain his good Will, by shewing him the Works of Father <hi>Chreighton:</hi> So that which way soever the Medal turn'd, it still prov'd to the advantage of our Society.</p>
                     <p>Not to digress from our Subject, I must desire you to read the English Book of Father <hi>Parsons,</hi> Intituled, <hi>The Reform of England</hi>; where, after his blaming of Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> and made some observations of Faults in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> he finally concludes, That suppose <hi>England</hi> should return (as we hope) to the Catholick Faith in this Reign, he would reduce it to the State of the Primitive Church: And to that end all the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Revenue ought to be used in common, and the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof committed to the care of Seven Wise Men, drawn out of our Society, to be disposed of by them as they should think fit. Moreover, he would have all the Religious Orders forbidden on Religious Penalties, not to return into the Three Kingdoms, without leave of those Seven Wise Men; to the end it might be granted only to such as live on Alms. These Reflections seem to me very judicious, and very suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the present State of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The same Father <hi>Parsons</hi> adds, That when <hi>England</hi> is redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the True Faith, the Pope must not expect, at least for Five Years, to reap any benefit of the Ecclesiastical Revenue; but must leave the whole in the hands of those Seven Wise Men, who will manage the same to the Benefit and Advancement of the Church.</p>
                     <p>The Court goes this day for <hi>Marli,</hi> to take the Divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are there prepared: I hope to accompany the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60825:52"/>
King, and will entertain him about all Business; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly as he likes what you hint to me in your Letter, I shall give you notice.</p>
                     <p>I have acquainted him with his <hi>Britannick</hi> Majesty's Design of building a Citadel near <hi>Whitehal</hi>; Monsieur <hi>Vauban,</hi> our Engineer, was present: After some Discourse on the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Subject, his Majesty told Monsieur <hi>Vauban,</hi> that he thought it convenient he should make a Model of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, and that he should on purpose go over into <hi>England</hi> to see the Ground.</p>
                     <p>I have done all I could to suspend the Designs of our Great Monarch, who is always angry against the Holy Father; both Parties are stubborn: the King's natural Inclination is, to have all yield to him; and the Pope's Resolution is unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

The present <hi>Duke,</hi> who undertook this last Persecution, was not content to destroy them with his own Troops, but call'd in the <hi>French</hi> to assist at the Comedy, to shoot them off the Rocks, to hunt them over the <hi>Alps,</hi> and to sell the strongest of them to the Gallies, that the very <hi>Turkish</hi> Slaves themselves might deride and insult over them. <hi>Catholicks,</hi> who have not Power or Opportunity to execute the same things, seem to condemn the Conduct in Publick, but sing <hi>Te Deum</hi> in Private, and as soon as ever they have got a sufficient Force, commit the like Barbarities, so essential to their Religion, that all the Instinct of Nature cannot separate them. The Holy Father at <hi>Rome</hi> (tho he sets up for a moderate and merciful <hi>Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate</hi>) order'd <hi>Te Dèum</hi> to be sung up and down, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of Heresy out of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Piedmont</hi>; and our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Catholicks have given us (as their Army and Interest encreas'd) several Proofs how well they can juggle and disguise themselves; setting up Courts of Inquisition, turning Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants out of all Employs, and even out of their Freeholds, dispensing with Laws, Ravishing Charters, packing Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all under a notion of Liberty or a Divine

If Mr. <hi>Pen</hi> and his Disciples had condemn'd the unlawfulness of the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and the Dispensing Power, when they wrote so fast for Liberty of Conscience, they had then shew'd a generous Zeal for a just Freedom in Matters of Religion, and at the same time a due Veneration to the <hi>Legislative</hi> Power (<hi>King, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi>) but the secret of the <hi>Machine,</hi> was to maintain and erect a Prerogative above all Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and consequently to introduce upon that bottom <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi>; yet, notwithstanding all this uncontroulable Power, and shew of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Reign of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> is another Scene of the Infidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Treachery of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; what Oaths did she take?

The <hi>Swedes</hi> have taken an effectual and commendable way to keep Popish <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Iesuits</hi> (those <hi>Boutefeus</hi> and Disturbers of Societies, the declared Enemies to the Welfare of Mankind) out of their Countries by Gelding them, and consequently rendring them incapable of Sacerdotal Functions, tho the <hi>Priests</hi> have found out a <hi>Salvo,</hi> and will say Mass and Confess, if they can procure their <hi>Testicles</hi> again, and carry them in their Pockets, either preserv'd or in Powder: In <hi>Aethiopia, China,</hi> and <hi>Iapan,</hi> the Romish Priests have been so intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly turbulent, and such extravagant Incendiaries, that they have been often banished and put to Death; so that now they disguise themselves all over the Eastern Nations, under the Names and Characters of <hi>Mathematicians, Mechanicks, Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> &amp;c. and dare not own their Mission to propagate a Faith which is grown ridiculous all over <hi>Asia.</hi>

                  <p>The long and dreadful Civil Wars of <hi>France</hi>; the many <hi>Massacres</hi> and <hi>Persecutions,</hi> and lastly, the Siege of <hi>Rochel,</hi> are living Instances how far we may rely upon Engagements and Laws, both as to the taking of that <hi>Bulwark,</hi> and the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Relief from hence.

a Most <hi>Christian King,</hi> had this <hi>City</hi> granted them as a Cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Town for their Security; for before they had always been deluded out of their Advantages by fair Promises, insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant Treaties, and the Word of a King; yet <hi>Lewis</hi> the 13<hi>th</hi> following the vitious Examples of Treacherous Princes, fell upon this Glorious <hi>City,</hi> which, upon the account of their Laws and Privileges, made a Resistance and brave Defence, (having never heard of Passive Obedience amongst their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors) thinking it more lawful to defend their Rights, than it was for <hi>Lewis</hi> to invade them.</p>
                  <p>As for the late and present <hi>Reign</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> they are too nice and tender Things for me to touch; whether the <hi>Transactions</hi> of them are consistent with the <hi>Coronation Oaths,</hi> the many <hi>Declarations, Protestations,</hi> publick and solemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, I am no fit Judg; they are more proper for the Gravity of an Historian, or the Authority of a Parliament to handle, than for a private Gentleman in a Letter to his Friend. The Bishops Papers, and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Declarations, are the best <hi>Memoires</hi> of them; but they only begin where the two parts of the History of the growth of Popery and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Government left off, and how far we may trust to Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Stipulations, Oaths and Treaties, the Facts of past and the present Age are the best <hi>Criterions</hi> and Rules to guide and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine us; for what happens every day, will in all probability happen to morrow, the same Causes always produce the same Effects; and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is still the same Church it was an hundred Years ago, that is, a Mass of Treachery, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariety, Perjury, and the highest Superstition; a <hi>Machine</hi> without any Principle or setled Law of Motion, not to be mov'd or stop'd with the weights of any private or publick Obligations; a Monster that destroys all that is Sacred both in Heaven and Earth, so Ravenous that it is never content, unless it gets the whole World into its Claws, and tears all to pieces in order to Salvation; a <hi>Proteus,</hi> that turns it self into all shapes; a <hi>Chameleon,</hi> that puts on all Colours according to its present cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, this day an <hi>Angel</hi> of Light, to morrow a <hi>Beelzebub.</hi> Amongst all the <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Christendom</hi> where I have conversed, that of <hi>Holland</hi> is the freest from Tricks and Falsehood; and tho I am naturally jealous and suspicious of the Conduct of Princes, yet I could never discover the least Knavery within

those Walls, it appear'd to me another <hi>Athens</hi> of Philosophers, and the only Seat of Justice and Vertue now left in the World. As for the Character of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> it is so faithfully drawn by Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> Doctor <hi>Burnet,</hi> and in a half sheet lately printed, that I, who am so averse from Flattery, that I can scarce speak a good word of any Body, or think one good thought of my self, will not write any further Panegerick upon his Highness, only that he is a very Honest Man, a Great Souldier, and a Wise Prince, upon whose Word the World may safely rely.</p>
                  <p>A late Pamphleteer reviles the Prince, with breaking his Oath when he took the Stat-holder's Office upon him; not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that the Oath was impos'd upon his Highness in his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority by a French Faction, then jealous of the aspiring and true Grandeur of his Young Soul; that the States themselves (to whom the Obligation was made) freed his Highness from the Bond; and that the Necessity of Affairs, and the Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the People forced that Dignity upon him, which his Ancestors had enjoy'd, and he so well deserv'd, that he sav'd the sinking Common-wealth, (their Provinces being almost all Surpriz'd and Enslav'd by the French) compared to the gas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping State of <hi>Rome</hi> after the loss at <hi>Cannae</hi>; His Highness was no more puft up with this Success, than he had been daunted with Hardships and Misfortunes; always the same <hi>Hero,</hi> Just, Serene, and Unchang'd under all Events, an Argument of the vastness of his Mind; whereas on the contrary, Mutability (sometimes Tyrant, sometimes Father of a Country, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Huffing, other times Sneaking) is often-times a Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of a Mean and Cowardly Soul, vile and dissolute, born for Rapine and Destruction.</p>
                  <p>As for the Princess, she may without any flattery be stiled the Honour and Glory of her Sex; the most Knowing, the most Vertuous, the Fairest, and yet the best Natur'd Princess in the World; belov'd and admir'd by her Enemies, never seen in any Passion, always under a peculi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Prince at the Devotion of his Church. She dispences with the use of the Surplice, bowing to the Altar, and the Name of Jesus, out of Compliance to a Country that adores her, being more intent upon the Intrinsick and Substantial Parts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Prayer and Good Works. She speaks several Languages even to Perfection; entirely obedient to the Prince, and he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly dear to her. In a word, She is a Princess of many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Vertues and Excellencies, without any appearance of Vanity, or the least mixture of Vice; and upon whose Promise the World may safely depend. As for the many Plots and Conspiracies against this Royal Couple, a short time may bring them all to light, and faithful Historians publish them to the World.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, We may observe that whereas it hath been the Maxim of several Kings, both at home and abroad of late Years, to contend and outvie each other in preying upon and destroying not only their Neighbours, but their own Protestant Subjects, by all methods of perfidiousness and cruelty; the only way to establish Tyranny, and to enslave the natural Freedom of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, being to introduce a general Ignorance, Superstition, and Idolatry; for if once People can be perswaded, that Statues and Idols are Divinities and adorable, and tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>On the contrary, it hath always been the steady and immutable Principle of the House of <hi>Orange</hi> to rescue <hi>Europe</hi> from its Oppressours, and to resettle Governments upon the Primitive and Immortal Foundation of <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property</hi>; a Glorious Maxim, taken from the Old <hi>Roman Common-wealth,</hi> that Fought and Conquer'd so many Nations, only to set them Free, to Restore them wholsome Laws, their Natural and Civil Liberties; a Design so Generous; and every way Great, that the <hi>East</hi> groaning under the Fetters and Oppressions of their Tyrants, flew in to the <hi>Roman Eagles</hi> for Shelter and Protection, under whose Wings the several Nations liv'd

                  <p>From the foregoing Relation of matter of Fact, it appears most plain, that the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> are not to be ty'd by Laws, Treaties, Promises, Oaths, or any other bonds of Humane Society; the sad experience of this and other <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares to all Mankind the invalidity and insignificancy of all <hi>Contracts</hi> and <hi>Agreements</hi> with the <hi>Papists,</hi> who notwithstanding all their Solemn <hi>Covenants</hi> with <hi>Hereticks,</hi> do watch for all Advantages and Opportunities to destroy them, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thereunto by their <hi>Councils</hi> and the principles of their <hi>Church,</hi> and instigated by their <hi>Priests.</hi>

                  <p>IT is both certain, and evident to all Men, that the Publick Peace and Happiness of any State or Kingdom, cannot be preserved, where the Laws, Liberties, and Customs esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, by the Lawful Authority in it, are openly Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and Annulled: More especially where the Alteration of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is endeavoured, and that a <hi>Religion</hi> which is contrary to Law is endeavoured to be introduced: Upon which those who are most immediately concerned in it, are indispensably bound to endeavour to preserve and maintain the established Laws, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and Customs; and above all, the Religion and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God that is established among them; and to take such
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60825:62"/>
an effectual care, that the Inhabitants of the said State or Kingdom, may neither be deprived of their Religion, nor of their Civil Rights. Which is so much the more necessary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Greatness and Security, both of Kings, Royal Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and of all such as are in Authority, as well as the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of their Subjects and People, depend in a most espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner, upon the exact observation and maintenance of these their Laws, Liberties, and Customs.</p>
                  <p>Upon these Grounds it is, that we cannot any longer forbear to declare, That to our great regret, we see that those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors who have now the chief Credit with the King, have overturned the Religion, Laws, and Liberties of those Realms; and subjected them in all Things relating to their Consciences, Liberties and Properties, to Arbitrary Government; and that not only by secret and indirect ways, but in an open and undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised manner.</p>
                  <p>Those Evil Counsellors, for the advancing and colouring this with some plausible Pretexts, did invent and set on foot, the King's <hi>Dispensing Power,</hi> by virtue of which they pretend, that according to Law, he can <hi>Suspend</hi> and <hi>Dispense</hi> with the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Laws, that have been enacted by the Authority of the King and Parliament, for the Security and Happiness of the Subject, and so have rendred those Laws of no effect: Though there is nothing more certain, than that as no Laws can be made, but by the joint concurrence of King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; so likewise Laws so enacted, which secure the Publick Peace and Safety of the Nation, and the Lives and Liberties of every Subject in it, cannot be repealed or suspended but by the same Authority.</p>
                  <p>For though the King may pardon the Punishment that a Transgressor has incurred, and to which he is condemned, as in the Cases of <hi>Treason</hi> or <hi>Felony,</hi> yet it cannot be with any colour of Reason inferred from thence, that the King can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely suspend the Execution of those Laws relating to <hi>Treason</hi> or <hi>Felony:</hi> Unless it is pretended, that he is clothed with a Despotick and Arbitrary Power, and that the Lives, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Honours and Estates of the Subjects, depend wholly on his good Will and Pleasure, and are entirely subject to him; which must infallibly follow, on the King's having a Power to suspend the Execution of the Laws, and to dispense with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:60825:62"/>Those Evil Counsellors, in order to the giving some credit to this strange and execrable Maxim, have so conducted the Matter, that they have obtained a Sentence from the Judges, declaring that this <hi>Dispensing Power</hi> is a Right belonging to the <hi>Crown</hi>; as if it were in the Power of the Twelve Judges to offer up the Laws, Rights and Liberties of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the King, to be disposed of by him Arbitrarily and at his Pleasure, and expresly contrary to Laws enacted, for the Security of the Subjects. In order to the obtaining this Judgment, those Evil Counsellors did before-hand examine se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly the Opinion of the Judges, and procured such of them as could not in Conscience concur in so pernicious a Sentence, to be turned out, and others to be substituted in their Rooms, till by the Changes which were made in the Courts of Judicature, they at last obtained that Judgment. And they have raised some to those Trusts, who made open profession of the Popish Religion, though those are by Law rendred incapable of all such Employments.</p>
                  <p>It is also manifest and notorious, that as his Majesty was, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his coming to the Crown, received and acknowledged by all the Subjects of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as their <hi>King,</hi> without the least Opposition, though he made then open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Popish Religion, so he did then promise, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly swear, at his Coronation, That he would maintain his Subjects in the free enjoiment of their Laws and Liberties; and in particular, that he would maintain the <hi>Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>as it was established by Law:</hi> It is likewise certain, that there have been, at divers and sundry times, several Laws en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted for the preservation of those Rights, and Liberties, and of the Protestant Religion: And among other Securites, it has been enacted that all Persons whatsoever, that are advanced to any Ecclesiastical Dignity, or to bear Office in either Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as likewise all other, that should be put in any Imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Civil or Military, should declare that they were not Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, but were of the Protestant Religion, and that, by their taking of the Oaths of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and the <hi>Test</hi>; yet these Evil Counsellors have in effect annulled and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished all those Laws, both with relation to Ecclesiastical and Civil Emploiments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60825:63"/>In order to Ecclesiastical Dignities and Offices, they have not only, without any colour of Law, but against most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Laws to the contrary, set up a Commission of a certain Number of Persons, to whom they have committed the Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance and Direction of all Ecclesiastical Matters: In the which Commission there has been, and still is, one of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Ministers of State, who makes now publick profession of the Popish Religion, and who at the time of his first professing it, declared, That for a great while before, he had believed that to be the only true Religion. By all this, the deplorable State to which the Protestant Religion is reduced is apparent, since the Affairs of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are now put into the Hands of Persons, who have accepted of a Commission that is manifestly Illegal; and who have executed it contrary to all Law; and that now one of their chief Members has abjured <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The said Commissioners have hitherto given such proof of their submission to the Directions given them, that there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to doubt but they will still continue to promote all such Designs as will be most agreeable to them. And those Evil Counsellors take care, to raise none to any Ecclesiastical Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but Persons that have no Zeal for the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> and that now hide their unconcernedness for it, under the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretence of <hi>Moderation.</hi> The said Commissioners have suspended the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> only because he refused to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey an Order that was sent him to suspend a Worthy Divine, without so much as citing him before him, to make his own Defence, or observing the common Forms of Process. They have turned out a President, chosen by the Fellows of <hi>Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

And the only Reason that was given for turning them out, was, their refusing to chuse for their President, a Person that was recommended to them by the i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60825:63"/>
lose Life or Goods, but by the Law of the Land.</hi> And now these Evil Counsellors have put the said Colledg wholly into the Hands of Papists; though, as is above said, they are incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all such Imploiments, both by the Law of the Land, and the Statutes of the Colledg. These Commissioners have also cited before them all the Chancellors and Arch-deacons of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> requiring them to certify to them the Names of all such Clergy-men as have read the King's Declaration for <hi>Liberty of Conscience,</hi> and of such as have not read it; without consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the reading of it, was not enjoined the Clergy, by the Bishops who are their Ordinaries. The illegality and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency of the said Court of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, was so notoriously known, and it did so evidently appear that it tended to the subversion of the <hi>Protestant Rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ion,</hi> that the most Reverend Father in God, <hi>William</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> Primate and Metropolitan of all <hi>England,</hi> seeing that it was raised for no other end, but to oppress such Persons as were of eminent Virtue, Learning, and Piety, refused to sit or concur in it.</p>
                  <p>And though there are many express Laws against all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or Chappels, for the exercise of the Popish Religion, and also against all Monasteries and Convents, and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly against the Order of the Jesuits: yet those Evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors have procured Orders for the building of several Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Chappels for the Exercise of that Religion. They have also procured divers Monasteries to be erected; and in contempt of the Law they have not only set up several Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of <hi>Iesuits</hi> in divers places, for the corrupting of the Youth, but have raised up one of the <hi>Order,</hi> to be a Privy Counsellor, and a Minister of State. By all which they do evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently shew, that they are restrained by no Rules or Law whatsoever, but that they have subjected the Honours and Estates of the Subjects, and the Establish'd Religion, to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotick Power, and to Arbitrary Government: In all which they are served and seconded by those Ecclesiastical Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners.</p>
                  <p>They have also followed the same Methods with Relation to Civil Affairs: For they have procured Orders to examine all Lords-Lieutenants, Deputy-Lieutenants, Sheriffs, Justices of Peace, and all others that were in any Publick Employment,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60825:64"/>
if they would concur with the King in the Repeal of the <hi>Test</hi> and <hi>Penal Laws</hi>; and all such whose Consciences did not suffer them to comply with their Designs, were turned out, and others were put in their places, who they believe would be more compliant to them, in their Designs of defeating the Intent and Execution of those Laws, which had been made with so much Care and Caution for the Security of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion.</hi> And in many of these places they have put professed Papists, though the Law has disabled them, and warranted the Subjects not to have any regard to their Orders.</p>
                  <p>They have also invaded the Priviledges, and seized on the Charters of most of those Towns that have a right to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>heir Burgesses in Parliament, and have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured Surrenders to be made of them, by which the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates in them have delivered up all their Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, to be disposed of at the pleasure of those Evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors, who have thereupon placed new Magistrates in those Towns, such as they can most entirely confide in; and in many of them they have put Popish Magistrates, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Incapacities under which the Law has put them.</p>
                  <p>And whereas no Nation whatsoever can subsist without the Administration of good and impartial Justice, upon which Mens Lives, Liberties, Honours, and Estates do depend; those Evil Counsellors have subjected these to an Arbitrary and Despotick Power: In the most important Affairs they have studied to discover before-hand the Opinions of the Judges, and h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ve turned out such as they found would not conform themselves to their Intentions, and have put others in their places, of whom they were more assured, without having any regard to their Abilities. And they have not stuck to raise even professed Papists to the Courts of Judicature, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their Incapacity by Law, and that no Regard is due to any Sentences flowing from them. They have carried this so far as to deprive such Judges, who in the common Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of Justice, shewed that they were governed by their Consciences, and not by the Directions which the others gave them. By which it is apparent they design to render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the absolute Masters of the Lives, Honours and Estates of the Subjects, of what Rank or Dignity soever they may be;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60825:64"/>
and that without having any regard either to the Equity of the Cause, or to the Conscience of the Judges, whom they will have to submit in all things to their own will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; hoping by such ways to intimidate those who are yet in Imployment, as also such others as they shall think fit to put in the rooms of those whom they have turned out, and to make them see what they must look for, if they should at any time act in the least contrary to their good liking, and that no failings of that kind are pardoned in any Persons whatsoever. A great deal of Blood has been shed in many places of the Kingdom by Judges governed by those Evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors, against all the Rules and Forms of Law, without so much as suffering the Persons that were accused, to plead in their own Defence.</p>
                  <p>They have also, by putting the Administration of Justice into the hands of Papists, brought all the matters of Civil Justice into great uncertainties; with how much Exactness and Justice soever that these Sentences may have been given. For since the Laws of the Land do not only exclude Papists from all places of Judicature, but have put them under an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity, none are bound to acknowledg or to obey their Judgments; and all Sentences given by them, are null and void of themselves: so that all Persons who have been cast in Trials before such Popish Judges, may justly look on their pretended Sentences, as having no more force than the Sentences of any private and unauthorized Person whatsoever. So deplorable is the Case of the Subjects, who are obliged to answer to such Judges, that must in all things stick to the Rules which are set them by those Evil Counsellors, who as they raised them up to those Imployments, so can turn them out of them at pleasure, and who can never be esteemed lawful Judges; so that all their Sentences are, in the Construction of the Law, of no Force and Efficacy. They have likewise disposed of all Military Imployments in the same manner; for tho the Laws have not only excluded Papists from all such Imployments, but have in particular provided that they should be disarmed; yet they, in Contempt of these Laws, have not only armed the Papists, but have likewise raised them up to the greatest Military Trusts both by Sea and Land, and that Strangers as well as Natives, and <hi>Irish</hi> as well as <hi>English,</hi> that so by those
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60825:65"/>
means, having rendred themselves Masters both of the Affairs of the Church, of the Government of the Nation, and of the course of Justice, and subjected them all to a Despotick and Arbitrary Power, they might be in a Capacity to maintain and execute their wicked Designs by the assistance of the Army, and thereby to enslave the Nation.</p>
                  <p>The dismal Effects of this Subversion of the established Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Laws and Liberties in <hi>England,</hi> appear more evident to us, by what we see done in <hi>Ireland:</hi> Where the whole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is put into the Hands of Papists, and where all the Protestant Inhabitants are under the daily Fears of what may be justly apprehended from the Arbitrary Power which is set up there; which has made great numbers of them leave that Kingdom, and abandon their Estates in it, remembring well that cruel and bloody Massacre which fell out in that Island in the Year 1641.</p>
                  <p>Those Evil Counsellous have also prevailed with the King to declare in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that he is clothed with <hi>Absolute Power,</hi> and that all the Subjects are bound <hi>to obey him without Reserve:</hi> upon which he has assumed an Arbitrary Power, both over the Religion and Laws of that Kingdom, from all which it is apparent what is to be looked for in <hi>England,</hi> as soon as matters are duly prepared for it.</p>
                  <p>Those great and insufferable Oppressions, and the open Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of all Law, together with the apprehensions of the sad Consequences that must certainly follow upon it, have put the Subj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ts under great and just Fears, and have made them look after such lawful Remedies as are allowed of in all Nations; yet all has been without Effect. And those Evil Counsellours have endeavoured to make all Men apprehend the loss of their Lives, Liberties, Honours, and Estates, if they should go about to preserve themselves from this Oppression by Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Representations, or other means authorised by Law. Thus did they proceed with the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the other Bishops, who having offer'd a most humble Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition to the King, in terms full of Respect, and not exceeding the number limited by Law, in which they set forth in short the Reasons for which they could not obey that Order, which, by the Instigation of those Evil Counsellors, was sent them, requiring them to appoint their Clergy to read in their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60825:65"/>
Churches the Declaration for <hi>Liberty of Conscience,</hi> were sent to Prison, and afterwards brought to a Trial, as if they had been guilty of some enormous Crime. They were not only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to defend themselves in that pursuit, but to appear before professed Papists, who had not taken the Test, and by Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence were Men whose Interest led them to condemn them; and the Judges that gave their Opinion in their Favours were thereupon turned out.</p>
                  <p>And yet it cannot be pretended, that any Kings, how great soever their Power has been, and how Arbitrary and Despo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick soever they have been in the exercise of it, have ever reckoned a Crime for their Subjects to come in all Submission and Respect, and in a due Number, not exceeding the Limits of the Law, and represent to them the Reasons that made it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for them to obey their Orders. Those Evil Counsellors have also treated a Peer of the Realm as a Criminal, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he said that the Subjects were not bound to obey the Orders of a Popish Justice of Peace; tho it is evident, that they being by Law rendred incapable of all such Trusts, no regard is due to their Orders. This being the Security which the People have by the Law for their Lives, Liberties, Honours and Estates, that they are not to be subjected to the Arbitrary Proceedings of Papists that are contrary to Law, put into any Employments Civil or Military.</p>
                  <p>Both We our selves, and our Dearest and most Entirely Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Consort, the Princess, have endeavoured to signify in terms full of Respect to the King, the just and deep Regret which all these Proceedings have given us: and in Compliance with his Majesties Desires signified to us, We declared, both by word of Mouth to his Envoy, and in writing, what our Thoughts were touching the repealing of the <hi>Test</hi> and <hi>Penal Laws</hi>; which we did in such a manner, that we hoped we had proposed an Expedient, by which the Peace of those Kingdoms, and a happy Agreement among the Subjects of all Perswasions might have been settled; but those Evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors have put such ill Constructions on these our good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, that they have endeavoured to alienate the King more and more from us; as if We had designed to disturb the Quiet and Happiness of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:60825:66"/>The last and great Remedy for all those Evils, is <hi>the calling of a Parliament,</hi> for securing the Nation against the evil Practices of those wicked Counsellors; but this could not be yet compassed, nor can it easily be brought about. For those Men apprehending that a lawful Parliament being once assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, they would be brought to an account for all their open Violations of Law, and for their Plots and Conspiracies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Protestant Religion, and the Lives and Liberties of the Subjects, they have endeavoured under the specious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Liberty of Conscience,</hi> first to sow Divisions among Protestants, between those of the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the Dissenters: The Design being laid to engage Protestants that are all equally concerned to preserve themselves from Popish Oppression, into mutual Quarellings; that so by these, some Advantages might be given to them to bring about their Designs; and that both in the Election of the Members of Parliament, and afterwards in the Parliament it self. For they see well that if all Protestants could enter into a mutual good Understanding one with another, and concur together, in the preserving of their Religion, it would not be possible for them to compass their wicked Ends. They have also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired all Persons in the several Counties of <hi>England,</hi> that either were in any Imployment, or were in any considerable Esteem, to declare before-hand, that they would concur in the Repeal of the <hi>Test</hi> and <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> and that they would give their Voices in the Elections to Parliament only for such as would concur in it: Such as would not thus preingage themselves, were turned out of all Imployments, and others who entred into those Engagements were put into their places, many of them being Papists. And, contrary to the Charters and Priviledges of those Buroughs that have a Right to send Burgesses to Parliament, they have ordered such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations to be made, as they thought fit and necessary, for assuring themselves of all the Members that are to be chosen by those Corporations; and by this means they hope to avoid that Punishment which they have deserved, tho it is apparent, that all Acts made by Popish Magistrates are null and void of themselves; so that no Parliament can be lawful, for which the Elections and Returns are made by Popish Sheriffs and Mayors of Towns; and therefore, as long as the Authority
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60825:66"/>
and Magistracy is in such hands, it is impossible to have any lawful Parliament. And tho according to the Constitution of the <hi>English</hi> Government and immemorial Custom, all Elections of Parliament-Men ought to be made with an entire Liberty, without any sort of Force, or the requiring the Electors to chuse such Persons as shall be named to them; and the Persons thus freely elected, ought to give their Opinions freely upon all matters that are brought before them, having the Good of the Nation ever before their Eyes, and following in all things the Dictates of their Consciences, yet now the People of <hi>England</hi> cannot expect a Remedy from a free Parliament le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally called and chosen: But they may perhaps see one called, in which all Elections will be carried by Fraud or Force, and which will be composed of such Persons, of whom those Evil Counsellors hold themselves well assured, in which all things will be carried on according to their Direction and Interest, without any regard to the Good or Happiness of the Nation. Which may appear evidently from this, that the same Persons tried the Members of the last Parliament, to gain them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the Repeal of the <hi>Test</hi> and <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> and procured that Parliament to be dissolved when they found that they could not, neither by Promises nor Threatnings, prevail with the Members to comply with their wicked Designs.</p>
                  <p>But to crown all, There are great and violent Presumptions, inducing us to believe, that those Evil Counsellors, in order to the carrying on of their ill Designs, and to the gaining to themselves the more time for the effecting of them, for the encouraging their Complices, and for the discouraging of all good Subjects, have published that the <hi>Queen</hi> hath brought forth a <hi>Son</hi>; tho there have appeared both during the <hi>Queen</hi>'s pretended Bigness, and in the manner in which the Birth was managed, so many just and visible grounds of Suspicion, that not only We our selves, but all the good Subjects of those Kingdoms, do vehemently suspect that the pretended Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> was not born by the <hi>Queen.</hi> And it is notoriously known to all the World, that many both doubted of the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Bigness, and of the Birth of the Child, and yet there was not any one thing done to satisfie them, or to put an end to their Doubts.</p>
                  <p>And since our Dearest and most Entirely Beloved Consort
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60825:67"/>
the Princess, and likewise We our Selves, have so great an Interest in this Matter, and such a Right as all the World knows to the Succession to the Crown: Since also the <hi>English</hi> did in the Year 1672. when the States General of the <hi>Vnited Provinces</hi> were invaded in a most unjust War, use their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost Endeavours to put an end to that War, and that in opposition to those who were then in the Government; and by their so doing they run the hazard of losing both the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Court, and their Imployments: And since the <hi>English</hi> Nation has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ver testified a most particular Affection and Esteem, both to our Dearest Consort the Princess, and to Our Selves, We cannot excuse our selves from espousing their Interests in a Matter of such high Consequence, and from contributing all that lies in us for the maintaining both of the Protestant Religion, and of the Laws and Liberties of those Kingdoms, and for the securing to them the continual Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all their just Rights. To the doing of which we are most earnestly solicited by a great many Lords both Spiritual and Temporal, and by many Gentlemen and other Subjects of all Ranks.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is that we have thought fit to go over to <hi>England,</hi> and to carry over with us a Force sufficient, by the Blessing of God, to defend us from the Violence of those Evil Counsellors. And We being desirous that our Intentions in this may be rightly understood, have for this end prepared this <hi>Declaration,</hi> in which as We have hitherto given a true Account of the Reasons inducing us to it; so we now think fit to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that this our Expedition is intended for no other Design, but to have a free and lawful Parliament assembled, as soon as possible; and that in order to this, all the late Charters by which the Elections of Burgesses are limited, contrary to the Ancient Custom, shall be considered as null and of no force; and likewise all Magistrates who have been injustly turned out, shall forthwith resume their former Imployments, as well as all the Buroughs of <hi>England,</hi> shall return again to their Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Prescriptions and Charters: And more particularly that the Ancient Charter of the great and famous City of <hi>London,</hi> shall again be in force; and that the Writs for the Members of Parliament shall be addressed to the proper Officers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law and Custom. That also none be suffered to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60825:67"/>
choose or to be chosen Members of Parliament but such as are qualified by Law; and that the Members of Parliament being thus lawfully chosen, they shall meet and sit in full Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; that so the two Houses may concur in the preparing such Laws as they, upon full and free debate, shall judg ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and convenient, both for the confirming and executing the Law concerning the <hi>Test,</hi> and such other Laws as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the Security and Maintenance of the Protestant Religion; as likewise for making such Laws as may establish a good Agreement between the Church of <hi>England</hi> and all Protestant Dissenters, as also for the covering and securing of all such who will live peaceably under the Government as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes good Subjects, from all Persecution upon the account of their Religion, even <hi>Papists</hi> themselves not excepted; and for the doing of all other things which the two Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall find necessary for the Peace, Honour and Safety of the Nation; so that there may be no more danger of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions falling at any time hereafter under <hi>Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> To this Parliament we will also refer the Enquiry into the Birth of the pretended Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and of all things relating to it, and to the Right of Succession.</p>
                  <p>And We for our part, will concur in every thing that may procure the Peace and Happiness of the Nation, which a Free and Lawful Parliament shall determine; since We have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before our Eyes in this our Undertaking, but the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the Protestant Religion, the covering of all Men from Persecution for their Consciences, and the securing to the whole Nation the free Enjoyment of all their Laws, Rights and Liberties, under a just and legal Government.</p>
                  <p>This is the Design that We have proposed to our Selves in appearing upon this occasion in Arms: In the Conduct of which, We will keep the Forces under our Command, under all the strictness of Martial Discipline, and take a special care that the People of the Countries through which we must march, shall not suffer by their means; and as soon as the State of the Nation will admit of it, We promise that We will send back all those Foreign Forces that we have brought along with us.</p>
                  <p>We do therefore hope that all People will judg rightly of us, and approve of these our P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the Blessing of God for the Success of this our Undertaking, in which We place our whole and only Confidence.</p>
                  <p>We do in the last place invite and require all Persons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, all the Peers of the Realm, both Spiritual and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, all Lords-Lieutenants, Deputy-Lieutenants, and all Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Citizens, and other Commons of all Ranks, to come and assist us in order to the executing of this our Design, against all such as shall endeavour to oppose us, that so we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all those Miseries which must needs follow upon the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being kept under Arbitrary Government and Slavery; and that all the Violences and Disorders which have overturned the whole Constitution of the <hi>English</hi> Government, may be fully redressed in a FREE AND LEGAL PARLIAMENT.</p>
                  <p>And We do likewise resolve, that as soon as the Nations are brought to a State of Quiet, We will take care that a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall be called in <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the restoring the Ancient Constitution of that Kingdom, and for bringing the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion to such a Settlement, that the People may live easie and happy, and for putting an end to all the injust Violences that have been in a course of so many Years com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted there.</p>
                  <p>We will also study to bring the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> to such a State, that the Settlement there may be religiously observed; and that the Protestant and British Interest there may be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured. And we will endeavour by all possible means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure such an Establishment in all the three Kingdoms, that they may all live in a happy Union and Correspondence together, and that the Protestant Religion, and the Peace, Honour and Happiness of those Nations may be established upon lasting Foundations.</p>

                  <head>His Highnesses Additional Declaration.</head>
                  <p>AFter We had prepared and printed this our Declaration, we have understood, that the Subverters of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Laws of those Kingdoms, hearing of our Preparations to assist the People against them, have begun to retract some of the Arbitrary and Despotick Powers that they had assumed, and to vacate some of their unjust Judgments and Decrees. The sense of their Guilt, and the distrust of their Force, have induced them to offer to the City of <hi>London</hi> some seeming Relief from their great Oppressions, hoping thereby to quiet the People, and to divert them from demanding a Secure Reestablishment of their Religion and Laws under the shelter of our Arms. They do also give out, that we intend to Conquer and Enslave the Nation; and therefore it is that we have thought fit to add a few words to our Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>We are confident, that no Persons can have such hard Thoughts of us, as to imagine that we have any other Design in this Undertaking, than to procure a Settlement of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and of the Liberties and Properties of the Subjects upon so sure a Foundation, that there may be no danger of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion's relapsing into the like Miseries at any time hereafter. And as the Forces we have brought along with us, are utterly disproportioned to that wicked Design of Conquering the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if we were capable of intending it; so the great Numbers of the principal Nobility and Gentry, that are Men of Eminent Quality and Estates, and Persons of known Integrity and Zeal, both for the Religion and Government of <hi>England</hi>; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them being also distinguished by their constant Fidelity to the Crown, who do both accompany Us in this Expedition, and have earnestly solicited Us to it, will cover Us from all such Malicious Insinuations: For it is not to be imagined, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those who have invited Us, or those that are already come to assist Us, can join in a wicked Attempt of Conquest, to make
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60825:69"/>
void their own lawful Titles to their Honours, Estates and Interests. We are also confident, that all Men see how little weight there is to be laid on all Promises and Engagements that can be now made, since there has been so little regard had in Time past to the most solemn Promises. And as that imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Redress that is now offered, is a plain Confession of those Violations of the Government that we have set forth; so the defectiveness of it is no less Apparent; for they lay down no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which they may not take up at pleasure: and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve entire, and not so much as mentioned their Claims and Pretences to an Arbitrary and Despotick Power; which has been the root of all their Oppression, and of the total sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the Government. And it is plain, that there can be no Redress nor Remedy offered but in Parliament, by a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the Rights of the Subjects that have been invaded, and not by any pretended Acts of Grace, to which the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of their Affairs has driven them. Therefore it is that we have thought fit to declare, that we will refer all to a Free Assembly of the Nation in a Lawful Parliament.</p>

                  <p>THO we know not all your Persons, yet we have a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of your Names, and remember the Character of your Worth and Interest in your Country. You see we are come according to your Invitation and our Promise. Our Duty to God obliges us to protect the Protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and our Love to Mankind, your Liberties and Properties. We expected you that dwelt so near the place of our Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, would have joyn'd us sooner, not that it is now too late, nor that we want your Military Assistance so much as your Countenance and Presence, to justify our declar'd Pretensions; rather than accomplish our good and gracious Designs. Tho we have brought both a good Fleet, and a good Army, to render these Kingdoms happy, by rescuing all Protestants from Popery, Slavery, and Arbitrary Power; by restoring them to their Rights and Properties established by Law, and by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of Peace and Trade, which is the Soul of Government, and the very Life-Blood of a Nation; yet we rely more on the Goodness of God and the Justice of our Cause, than on any Humane Force and Power whatever. Yet since God is pleased we shall make use of Humane means, and not expect Miracles, for our preservation and Happiness; let us not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect making use of this gracious Opportunity, but with Prudence, and Courage put in Execution our so honourable Purposes. Therefore, Gentlemen, Friends and Fellow-Protestants, we bid you and all your Followers most heartily Well come to our Court and Camp. Let the whole World now Judg, if our pretentions are not Just, Generous, Sincere, and above Price; since we might have even a Bridg of Gold to Return back; But it is our Principle and Resolution, rather to dye in a Good Cause, than live in a Bad one, well knowing that Vertue and True Honour is its own Reward, and the Happiness of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind Our Great and Only Design.</p>

                  <p>WE doubt not but the World believes that, in this Great and Dangerous Conjuncture, We are hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and zealously concerned for the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the Laws of the Land, and the Liberties and Properties of the Subject. And We did reasonably hope, that the King having Issued His Proclamation, and Writs for a Free Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, We might have rested Secure under the Expectation of that Meeting: But His Majesty having withdrawn Himself, and, as We apprehend, in order to His Departure out of this Kingdom, by the Pernicious Counsels of Persons ill Affected to Our Nation and Religion, We cannot, without being wanting to Our Duty, be silent under those Calamities, wherein the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Counsels which so long prevailed, have miserably invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved these Realms. We do therefore Unanimously resolve to apply Our Selves to His Highness the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who with so great Kindness to these Kingdoms, so vast Expence, and so much hazard to his own Person, hath Undertaken, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to Procure a Free Parliament, to rescue Us, with as little Effusion as possible of Christian Blood, from the immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Dangers of Popery and Slavery.</p>
                  <p>And We do hereby Declare, That We will, with our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Endeavours, assist his Highness in the obtaining such a Parliament with all speed, wherein Our Laws, Our Liberties and Properties may be Secured, the Church of <hi>England</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, with a due Liberty to Protestant Dissenters, and in general the Protestant Religion and Interest ov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:60825:73"/>In the mean time, We will Endeavour to Preserve, as much as in Us lies, the Peace and Security of these great and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminister,</hi> and the Parts Adjacent, by taking Care to Disarm all Papists, and Secure all Jesuits and Romish Priests, who are in or about the same.</p>
                  <p>And if there be any thing more to be performed by Us, for promoting His Higness's Generous Intentions for the Publick Good, We shall be ready to do it as occasion shall Require.</p>

                  <p>His Majesty, as He hath already declared, was resolved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this to call one, but thought that in the present State of Affairs it was adviseable to defer it till things were more compos'd.</p>
                  <p>Yet seeing that His People still continue to desire it; He hath put forth His Proclamation in order to it, and hath Issued forth His Writs for the calling of it.</p>
                  <p>And to prevent any Cause of Interruption in it, He will consent to every thing that can be reasonably required for the Security of all those that shall come to it.</p>
                  <p>His Majesty hath therefore sent Us to attend Your Highness for the adjusting of all Matters that shall be agreed to be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to the Freedom of Elections, and the Security of Sitting, and is ready immediately to enter into a Treaty in Order to it.</p>
                  <p>His Majesty proposeth that in the mean time the respective Armies may be restrained within such Limits, and at such a Distance from <hi>London,</hi> as may prevent the Apprehensions that the Parliament may in any kind be disturbed, being desirous that the Meeting of it may be no longer delay'd than it must be by the usual and necessary Forms.</p>

                     <p>We therefore now unanimously present to Your Highness our just and due Acknowledgments for the Happy Relief You have brought to us, and that we may not be wanting in this present Conjuncture, we have put our selves into such a Posture, that (by the Blessing of God) we may be capable to prevent all ill Designs, and to preserve this City in Peace and Safety till your Highness's Happy Arrival.</p>

                  <p>In which, labouring for Words, we cannot but come short in Expression.</p>
                  <p>Reviewing our late Danger, we remember our Church and State, over-run by Popery and Arbitrary Power, and brought to the Point of Destruction, by the Conduct of Men (that were our <hi>true</hi> Invaders) that brake the Sacred Fences of our <hi>Laws,</hi> and (which was worst) the very Constitution of our <hi>Legislature.</hi>

                  <p>Your Highness, led by the Hand of Heaven, and called by the <hi>Voice</hi> of the People, has preserved our dearest Interests.</p>

                     <p>Whereby it appears, that as soon as the <hi>Papacy</hi> is admitted, all Title and Property is lost and extinct among us: And therefore we must not think that <hi>Pope</hi> acted extravagantly, who declared, <hi>That all his Majesty's Territories were his own, as forfeited to the Holy See for the Heresie of Prince and People.</hi> Not only Abby-Lands are in danger, who ever possess them; but all Estates are forfeited to his Exchequer, and legally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscated: All is his own which <hi>Protestants</hi> in these three Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have or ever had, if he can but meet with a Prince so wise as to help him to catch it; whose process follows them beyond their Grave, and ruins their Children, and Children's Children after them. And when they have strip'd the <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> of his All, they provide that no other shall relieve him, viz. <hi>That none shall receive him into their Houses, nor afford him any Help, nor shew him any Favour, nor give him any Counsel.</hi> We are here in <hi>England</hi> zealous for Property; and all the

Though Popish Princes, the better to promote their Interest, and to insnare the Protestant Subjects, to get advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage upon them, to their Ruin, have made large Promises, and plighted their Faith to them, when they did not intend to keep it.

                     <p>But may not Parliaments secure us by Laws and Provisions restraining the Power which endangers us? Not possible, if once they secure and settle the Throne for Popery: For, <hi>First,</hi>
                        <pb n="7" facs="tcp:60825:83"/>
They can avoid Parliaments as long as they please; and a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that is more Arbitrary and Violent, is more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their Designs and Principles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It being apparent, that the English Papists have lost the Spirit of their Ancestors, who so well asserted the English Liberties, being so generally now fix'd for the Pope's Universal Monarchy, sacrificing all to that <hi>Roman Moloch,</hi> being much more his Subjects than the King's; and though Natives by Birth, yet are Foreigners as to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Principle, Interest, Affection and Design; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Friends to Parliaments, as our Experience hath told us.</p>
                     <p>But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> if their Necessity should require a Parliament, there is no question but they may get such a one as will serve their turns: For so have every of our former Princes in all the Changes of Religion that have been amongst us: As <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th,</hi> when he was both for and against Popery; <hi>Edward</hi> the 6<hi>th,</hi> when he was wholly Protestant; Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> when she was for Burning Alive; and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when she ran so Counter to her Sister. And the Reason is clear, that he who has the making of the publick Officers, and the Keys of Preferment and Profit, influenceth and swayeth Elections and Votes as he pleaseth. And by how much the Throne comes to be fix'd in Popery, the Protestants must expect to be excluded from both Houses, as they have excluded the Papists: For as Hereticks and Traitors, they, as ignominous Persons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you have heard, forfeit all Right, either to chuse, or be chosen in any Publick Councils: And then all Laws which have been made for the Protestants, and against the Popish Religion, will be null and void, as being enacted by an incompetent Authority, as being the Acts of Hereticks, Kings, Lords, and Commons, who had forfeited all their Rights and Priviledges.</p>
                     <p>But, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> suppose our Laws were valid, as enacted by competent Authority, and such good and wholsome Provisions, as were those Statutes made by our Popish Ancestors, in those Statutes of Provisoes in <hi>Edward</hi> the I. &amp; <hi>Edward</hi> the III. Time, and that of Praemunire in <hi>Richard</hi> the II. and <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. for Relief against Papal Incroachments and Oppressions: Yet being against the Laws and Canons of Holy Church, the Sovereign Authority, they will be all superseded: For so they determine, <q>That when the Canon and the Civil Laws clash, one requiring
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60825:84"/>
what the other allows not, the Church-Law must have the observance, and that of the State neglected: And Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>(they say)</hi> made against the Canons and Decrees of the <hi>Roman</hi> Bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nor did ever any well-wisher to the <hi>English</hi> Nation deny, that these Two Princes were the Glory of their Age, and of our <hi>British</hi> History. If I should reckon up all the evident Mistakes and false Inferences in this Libel, it would be too tedious, since a careless Eye cannot easily overlook them.</p>
                  <p>If the Pamphlet finds so undeserved a Reception in the World, as to need a Second Impression, the Author is desired to add to it this <hi>Postscript</hi>; which being founded on the Principles asserted by him, will shew the World that he hath wilfully, and perhaps partially, forborn to speak of as notorious an Usurper, as any that are mentioned in his Scheme.</p>
                  <p>Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> the Off-spring of an Incestuous Marriage, had no other unquestionable Divine Right to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> than what was given her by an Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> made in her Father's Reign, and the common Consent of the Nobility and People after the Death of her Brother King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. whose disposal of the Crown, by Letters Patents under the Great Seal, being directly contrary to the former Entail of it, limited by a higher Authority; His Sister, the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Queen. Therefore, according to our Author's abstruse Notions, She (as well as her Grand-father <hi>Henry</hi> VII.) must be reckoned among the Usurpers of the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> Let us now see what success attended her, and whether the Nation was happy under her Government.

She barbarously used her only Sister, the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and designed to have taken away her Life, for no other Cause, but her firm adherence to the Protestant Religion. She imprisoned and burnt Arch-Bishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly sheltered her from her Father's Fury.

The Inhabitants of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> who were the first that took up Arms for her, (upon her Promise to permit them the Exercise of their Religion) were the first that suffered Persecution under her. And after she had put to death near three hundred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, (without respect to Quality, Age, or Sex) it pleased God to put an end to the Romish Cruelty and Idolatry, by her unexpected and unlamented Death.

The second Thing that deserves your Consideration, is, The Service of your Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country, wherein you drew your first Breath, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed a free English Air. Now I would desire you to consider, how well you comply with these two main Points, by engaging in this present Service.</p>
                  <p>Is it in the Name of God, and for his Service, that you have joined your selves with <hi>Papists</hi>; who will indeed fight for the <hi>Mass-Book</hi> but burn the <hi>Bible,</hi> and who seek to Extirpate the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> with <hi>Your Swords,</hi> because they cannot do it with their <hi>Own?</hi> And will you be Aiding and Assisting to set up <hi>Mass-Houses,</hi> to erect that Popish Kingdom of Darkness and Desolation amongst as, and to train up all our Children in <hi>Popery?</hi> How can you do these Things, and yet call your selves <hi>Protestants?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then what Service can be done your Country, by being under the Command of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Irish Papists,</hi> and by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60825:86"/>
the Nation under a Foreign Yoke? Will you help them to make forcible Entry into the Houses of your Country-men, under the Name of <hi>Quartering,</hi> directly contrary to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the <hi>Petition of Right?</hi> Will you be Aiding and Assisting to all the Murders and Outrages which they shall commit by their void Commissions? Which were declared Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal, and sufficiently blasted by both Houses of Parliament, (if there had been any need of it) for it was very well known before, That a <hi>Papist</hi> cannot have a Commission, but by the Law is utterly Disabled and Disarmed. Will you exchange your Birth-right of <hi>English Laws</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> for <hi>Martial</hi> or <hi>Club-Law,</hi> and help to destroy all others, only to be eaten last your selves? If I know you well, as you are English Men, you hate and scorn these Things. And therefore be not unequally yoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with <hi>Idolatrous</hi> and <hi>Bloody Papists. Be Valiant for the Truth, and shew your selves Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The same Considerations are likewise humbly offered to all the <hi>English Seamen,</hi> who have been the Bulwark of this Nation against <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery</hi> ever since <hi>Eighty Eight.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. Because there are no <hi>Irish Papists</hi> in the <hi>Militia,</hi> who are certainly the best Souldiers in the World, for they have slain Men, Women, and Children, by Hundreds of Thousands at once.</p>

                  <p n="6">6. Because it is a thousand pities that a brave <hi>Popish Army</hi> should be a Riot.</p>
                  <p n="7">7.

                     <p n="1">I. RELATION is nothing else but that State of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Respect and Reference, which one Thing or Person has to another.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Such are the Relations of Father and Son, Husband and Wife, Master and Servant, Magistrate and Subject.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The Relations of a Father, Husband, and Master, are really distinct and different; that is, one of them is not the other; for he may be any one of these who is none of the rest.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. This distinction proceeds from the different Reasons, upon which these Relations are founded.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. The Reason or Foundation, from whence arises the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a Father, is from having begotten his Son, who may as properly call every old Man he meets his Father, as any other Person whatsoever, excepting him only who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat him.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. The Relation of an Husband and Wife is founded in We<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ter is founded in that Right and Title which he has to the Possession, or Service of his Slave or Servant.</p>
                     <p n="8">
                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:60825:88"/>VIII. In these Relations, the Names of Father, Husband, and Master, imply Soveraignty and Superiority, which varies notwithstanding, and is more or less absolute, according to the Foundation of these several Relations.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. The Superiority of a Father is founded in that Power, Priority, and Dignity of Nature, which a Cause hath over its Effect.</p>
                     <p n="10">X. The distance is not so great in Wedlock, but the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of the Husband over the Wife, is like that of the Right-Hand over the Left in the same Body.</p>
                     <p n="11">XI. The Superiority of a Master, is an absolute Dominion over his Slave, a limited and conditionate Command over his Servant.</p>
                     <p n="12">XII. The Titles of <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> and <hi>Sponsus Regni,</hi> Father of the Country, and Husband of the Realm, are Metaphors and improper Speeches: For no Prince ever begat a whole Country of Subjects; nor can a Kingdom more prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p n="13">XIII. And to shew further, that Magistracy is not Paternal Authority, nor Monarchy founded in Fatherhood; it is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably plain, that a Son may be the Natural Soveraign Lord of his own Father, as <hi>Henry</hi> the Second had been of <hi>Ieffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="14">XIV. Neither is Magistracy a Marital Power, for the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band may be the obedient Subject of his own Wife, as <hi>Philip</hi> was of Queen <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="16">XVI. Neither is the Relation of Prince and Subject the same with that of a Master and hired Servant, for he does not hire them, but as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>They pay him Tribute,</hi> in conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his continual <hi>Attendance</hi> and <hi>Imployment</hi> for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good.</p>

                     <p n="8">VIII. The Law of <hi>England</hi> gives the King his Title to the Crown. For, where is it said in Scripture, that such a Person or Family by Name shall enjoy it?

                     <p n="11">XI. The Scripture supposes Property, when it forbids Steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it supposes Mens Lands to be already butted and bounded, when it forbids removing the Ancient Land-marks: And as it is impossible for any Man to prove what Estate he has by Scripture, or to find a Terrier of his Lands there; so it is a vain thing to look for Statutes of Prerogative in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

Nor can the keenest Jesuit blunt the edge of this Argument by a Retortion from the Consideration of your Highnesses Illustrious Mother: For though Papists are so au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious, as to place the Keys of Heaven at the Pope's Girdle, and uncharitably doom us All to unquenchable flames, not affording us so much as a Room in Purgatory: yet Protestants are not so unchristian (but according to Scripture) leave secret things to God, and allow grains for Education, Prepossessions, Ignorance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is yet no more a Reason for any Man to turn Papist, than 'tis for him that stands safe on the shore to leap off into a Vessel so rotten and leaky as just ready to sink, upon a presumption that still some of those that are in her may escape the danger: Or to chuse an impudent Quack, who boasts he <hi>only</hi> can cure him; and refuse a Learned Physician, who modest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grants he may peradventure be healed by the other, though very improbably; but withal, that 'tis a Million to one, but the Patient, under such hands, miscarries; and that in this case, eternally.</p>

                  <p>I am a dutiful and hearty Lover of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and when establish'd on such an <hi>Equi-pois'd Basis</hi> of Wisdom as ours is, shall ever assert it to be the best Form of Government in the World, and most agreeable to the Genius of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish-men: But that <hi>lineal descent</hi> is so sacred a thing, that the Heir presumptive can for no <hi>default</hi> or <hi>crime</hi> whatsoever be debarr'd from the Crown by an <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament, or publick Decree of State, I do not understand; For I am sure the practice in <hi>all Ages,</hi> both at home and abroad in almost every Nation in the Earth, hath run contrary: And as to Right; those that pretend such Succession in all Cases to be <hi>Iure Divino,</hi> would do well to shew in what Texts of Scripture the same is prescribed; till then, they do but <hi>talk,</hi> not <hi>argue</hi>; and if a Candidate to the Crown, for <hi>any Reasons</hi> whatsoever, may without offence to the Law of God or Nature, be Excluded by an Act of King, Lords and Commons; Then the <hi>Iune-divino</hi>-ship vanishes, and nothing is left to be considered: But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such next Heir have done <hi>such Acts,</hi> or is so qualified, that in Prudence it be necessary for the Tranquillity of the Publick to Exclude him. Now I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there are but few of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but if the Bill had passed the <hi>Lords,</hi> and his Majesty had given his <hi>Royal Assent</hi> to it, would have acquiesc'd
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60825:95"/>
therein, and consequently they do not believe the Exclusion to be simply unlawful by the Law of God or Nature, for against either of them no <hi>Humane Ordinances</hi> ought to prevail.</p>
                  <p>But all true Loyalists do not despair, but your Highness may yet prevent all Occasions of such Disputes by opening your eyes; or rather that <hi>God</hi> (in whose <hi>hands are the Hearts of Princes</hi>) may irradiate your Royal Understanding, and let you see the horrid <hi>Blackness</hi> of those Men who have endeavour'd to seduce you, and of those <hi>Principles</hi> to which they would have inveigled you, on purpose to have made your Highness a <hi>Property</hi> to their <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Avarice,</hi> and that under the shadow of your Illustrious Name they might one day <hi>Tyrannize</hi> at Pleasure over these Three Kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>If Heaven shall be pleased to work such an happy <hi>Inclination</hi> in your Highness, you shall presently see the whole <hi>British Empire</hi> echoing with Praises and <hi>Acclamations,</hi> and instead of murmurs of <hi>Seclusion,</hi> every good Subject shall erect you a <hi>Throne</hi> in his heart.</p>
                  <p>But the grand difficulty will be to satisfie the prejudiced World of your <hi>sincerity</hi> herein; for if your Highness (which God forbid) should declare your self a Protestant only to serve a present <hi>turn,</hi> and use the Sacred Name of <hi>our Religion</hi> but as an Engine to advance the design of our <hi>bloody Enemies,</hi> you would act at once the most disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably and (in the end) most <hi>prejudicially</hi> to your own Interest, in the world, and must certainly expect the <hi>blasts</hi> of Heaven, and <hi>curses</hi> of Earth on all your future proceedings; for <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> is odious to God and Man, nor is there any Monster so abominable to serious Men of both sides, as a <hi>Church-Papist.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your Royal Highness, I hope, will excuse our <hi>fears,</hi> for we are not ignorant of the Arts and Craft of <hi>Rome,</hi> that she esteems <hi>no means unlawful</hi> to obtain her <hi>ends.</hi> How shall any <hi>Oaths</hi> be sufficient Tests, when a private <hi>dispensation</hi> may at once allow the <hi>taking,</hi> and warrant the <hi>breaking</hi> of them? Or what signifies the participation of our <hi>Sacraments</hi> to one that is taught, We have no true <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> of Christ; if so, no <hi>consecration,</hi> consequently nothing but an <hi>ordinary Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast</hi> of common <hi>Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Not that I dare imagine your Highnesses Understanding would suffer you to believe the <hi>lawfulness,</hi> or your <hi>Princely Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity</hi> permit you to practise these lewd <hi>dissimulations</hi>; yet since <hi>such Doctrines</hi> are daily taught in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, how shall Protestants be assured they have no Influence on your Conduct? I must therefore with all humble freedom assure your Highness, that after so general an Opinion of your Highnesses having been a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, though you should go never so duly to Church, receive the Sacrament a <hi>thousand times,</hi> and take <hi>Oaths</hi> all the way from <hi>Holy-rood</hi> House to St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s, yet the People would scarce <hi>believe</hi> the reality of your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, unless withal they see it accompanied with some other <hi>Demonstrations.</hi> For as <hi>Faith</hi> without works is dead, so Profession of a Religion, without agreeable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to advance it will be vain. If his Royal Highness, will the People say, be a <hi>good Protestant,</hi> he will undoubtedly discourage <hi>all Papists,</hi> the sworn inveterate Enemies of our Religion, he will not suffer a Popish Priest to approach his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or Palace. If he <hi>have had</hi> any intimation of any ill designs, if any have been tampering to reconcile him to <hi>Popery</hi> (which is no less than <hi>Treason</hi>) he will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently detect those <hi>mischievous Instruments,</hi> that they may be brought to condign Punishment, and applaud the <hi>Iustice</hi> that has been done on <hi>Coleman,</hi> the five Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits,

                  <p n="3">III. Whether this King in his Brother's Reign did not cause the Persecution against Dissenters to be more violent than otherwise it would have been.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Whether he doth not now make use of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters to pull down the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as he did of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to ruin the Dissenters, that the Papists may be the better enabled in a short time to destroy them both?</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Whether any ought to believe he will be for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty any longer than it serves his Turn? and whether his great eagerness to have the Penal Laws and Test repealed be only in order to the easie establishing of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery?</p>

                  <p n="7">VII. Whether the forcing of all that are in Offices of Profit or Trust in the Nation, to lose their Places, or declare they will be for Repealing the Penal Laws and Test, be not Violating his own Declaration for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conscience, and a new Test upon the People?</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. Whether the suspending the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> the Dispossessing of the Fellows of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge of their Freeholds, the Imprisoning and Prosecuting the Seven Bishops for Reasoning according to Law, are not sufficient instances how well the King intend to keep his Declaration for Liberty of Conscience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he promiseth to protect and maintain all his Bishops and Clergy, and all other his Subjects of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in quiet and full enjoyment of all their Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions with any molestation or disturbance whatsoever.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. Whether the Usage of the Protestants in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Savoy</hi> for these three years past, be not a sufficient Warning not to trust to the Declaration, Promises or Oaths in matters of Religion of any Papist whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever?</p>
                  <p n="10">X. Whether any Equivalent whatsoever under a Popish King, that hath a standing Army, and pretends to a Dispensing Power, can be as equal Security as the Penal Laws and Test, as affairs now stand in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi>

                     <p>THE Students of the University here, designed some time ago to burn the Pope's <hi>Effigies</hi>; but that was not more zealously desired to be prevented by some, than to be done by others: Notwithstanding all the imaginable Care taken to prevent it, yet it was done about Ten Days ago, after day-light gone, at the Cross, and blown up with Art, that seems to have been beyond their Invention,

above four Stories high. Two Days thereafter they went to the <hi>Parliament-House,</hi> at mid-day, passing by the Guards, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>No Pope, No Papist:</hi> And being got into the <hi>Parliament-House,</hi> (after they had required the Guards to be present at the Sentence) and having got upon the Bench, they Arraigned his <hi>Holiness</hi> before his Judges, and gave the Jury their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, who brought him in Guilty; whereupon, he was sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to be burnt publickly at the Cross the Twenty Fifth of this Instant; and withal declared, and protested for a <hi>Free Parliament.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On <hi>Sunday</hi> last, Advertisement was given by a Papist, to a Gentlewoman, to remove her self out of this City, and to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry out her Husband's Papers forthwith, because that Night there should be here a hot Wakening, such as had not been heretofore; and advised her to give the same Advice to any of her Friends she pleased.</p>
                     <p>Your Friend Mr. <hi>M.</hi> being acquainted with this, he revealed the same to several of our Magistrates, (which, as is alledged, was not regarded) he went thereafter and acquainted the Guard of our <hi>Trained-Bands</hi> therewith; whereupon Captain <hi>Patrick Iohnstone (Hilton</hi>'s Brother) caused to beat the Drums, and the Noise having gone abroad, and several Persons having ordered their Arms, and People flocking together to consider what was fit to be done, the Magistrates, with the Council, convened for the same purpose. A great many Boys met also, and went through the whole Town, crying aloud, <hi>No Pope, No Papist, No Popish Chancellor, No</hi> Melfort, <hi>No Father</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. But the Gates were shut, the Magistrates went along the Streets for the keeping of the Peace; and nothing more was done that Night, except the breaking of three or four Glass-Windows of <hi>Papists</hi> Houses, and that some of the Boys got up to the Cross, and proclaimed a <hi>Free-Parliament,</hi> and offered Two Thousand Pounds for <hi>Melford</hi>'s Head; so that Night past over, when all People here were in fear of some ill Designs, and the rather, because of their certain knowledg that there were lying in the Suburbs, a great many Hundreds of <hi>Highland-m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>

                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:60825:100"/>On <hi>Monday,</hi> about mid-day, the Chancellor parted thence and went towards the <hi>Highlands,</hi> by Advice of several of the Privy Council and his Friends, and took a good Guard with him. At Night the Students went (without Arms) to the Abbey, to condemn the Pope, and to Proclaim a <hi>Free Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and perhaps to burn what was contained in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, but without asking Questions, were repulsed by a shower of Ball, whereby several were wounded, and some since dead of their Wounds; which coming to the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils Knowledg, (which was then sitting) they called the Town Council (then also met) and Captain <hi>Grahame</hi>; desired them to see to the preservance of the Peace, and sent Six Heralds with an Order to Captain <hi>Wallace</hi> and his Men, to lay down their Arms, render themselves Prisoners, and deliver their Guards to the Magistrates, but they were answered by Ball; which being reported to the Privy Council, they forthwith or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Captain <hi>Grahame</hi> and his Company, Trained-Bands and <hi>Militia,</hi> to fall upon them, which they did; <hi>Wallace</hi> and his Men fled, several of them were taken, and some wounded, as were some of Captain <hi>Grahame</hi>'s Men. The Rabble were so incensed upon the firing, and supposition that it was Boys were killed, that they burnt all that was contained in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, the Jesuits Colledg, the Popish Printing-house, the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey Church, the Chancellor's Lodgings; and generally, all that was contained in the Houses of Papists, in the Town and Cannon-gate, excepting what was taken away by some People who designed Plunder.</p>
                     <p>They had Fires in the Abbey-Court, and at the Cross, all the Night, and spared nothing they got in Papists Houses. Some few Houses were spared at the intercession of some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants their Friends, and after true enquiry, I heard the Loss is called greater than it is. None of the Papists themselves were killed or wounded; they met with few of them, those they got they carried into the Guard.</p>
                     <p>In some of the Popish Houses, they found Arms and Barrels of Powder, which provoked to a more narrow search. All this time the Castle never fired one Gun, which is more attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Duke of <hi>Gordon,</hi> than to any other inferior Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. I am told, the Council sent and discharged an Execution from the Castle. Some of the Boys are dead of their Wounds.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60825:101"/>
                        <hi>Traquair</hi> (a Popish Lord) and several others went to, and continue in the Castle for their security. The Council ordered the searching for Ammunition and Arms in some Popish Houses in the Country, and this day committed a Warrant for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing of what was plundred out of the Papists Houses.</p>
                     <p>I had forgot to tell you, that on <hi>Monday</hi> last the Privy Council disbanded Six Hundred Men, taken on the <hi>Friday</hi> before, and commanded all the <hi>Highlanders</hi> forthwith to depart upon pain of Death; and yesterday ordered all Gentlemen to depart out of the Town, excepting such as should give account of their Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness to some of the Privy Council. I am credibly informed, that this day in the Privy Council, was voted an Address to be made to his Majesty for a <hi>Free Parliament</hi>; there are several Noblemen and Gentlemen gone from hence into <hi>England,</hi> and more to follow, but it's suspected they are going to the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>

                     <p>WHen the Chancellor went away privately from the Abbey for <hi>Castle Drummond,</hi> he gave strict Command to Captain <hi>Wallace</hi> to preserve the Chappel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Rabble having gathered and procured Links, without any Fire-Arms, about Six at Night went to the Abbey, and were denied access; whereupon, some pressing forward, <hi>Wallace</hi> commanded his Souldiers to fire, which they did, and killed and wounded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Twenty, whereof one half died shortly after. The Rabble retired to the City with a great Noise, towards the Entry to the Court of the Parliament-House, where some of the Lords of the Privy-Council were sitting. There some West-Country Gentlemen encouraged them to prosecute a Revenge, and got the Provost of the City to go to the House of Lords, and told them, if they would not give a Warrant to assault <hi>Wallace,</hi> and force him from the Abbey, they would do it without it. The Lords being alarm'd with the Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and a Report that several Gentlemens Sons were killed,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60825:101"/>
and some of their own; they ordered a Herald at Arms, with sound of Trumpet, to command <hi>Wallace</hi> in the King's Name to give up his Guard at the Abbey to the City: And the Company under the Cities Pay marched first, commanded by Captain <hi>Grahame,</hi> and after them all the Train'd-Bands and Militia, to force him in case of refusal; several Gentlemen accompanying <hi>Grahame,</hi> and the Magistrates attending, <hi>Wallace</hi> refused the Herald, and fired upon <hi>Grahame,</hi> and the rest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, wounded some Gentlemen and a few Souldiers: But <hi>Grahame</hi> marched quickly down a Lane on the South-side of the Porch of the Abbey-Court where <hi>Wallace</hi> was posted, and by a back way entered the Court, came upon <hi>Wallace</hi>'s Reer, and the Town Companies fronting him; after the first Fire he and all his Men fled, only a few of them were taken, the most part escaping under the Darkness of the Night. The City being thus Master of the Abbey, the Rabble immediately, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out opposition, went first to the Chappel, forced the Doors, broke all to pieces, and carried several parcels in Triumph up to the Cross, and burnt them there.</p>
                     <p>The next day strong Guards were set through the whole City and Suburbs, in convenient places, to repress any farther Tumults; and so all was quiet, and continues so.</p>
                     <p>This Morning there was coming into <hi>Leith</hi> a Boat from <hi>Burnt-Island,</hi> with eighty Men aboard, being a part of two or three hundred which had been sent for by the Duke of <hi>Gordon</hi> from the North to reinforce the Castle, and the rest to follow. But the Bayliff of <hi>Leith</hi> having notice before-hand of their coming, sent on Board and discharged their coming into the Harbor, and desired to speak with their Commander, who came ashoar, and owned the Design, being believed to be all Papists: He was seized, and the Men commanded back to the other Shoar, under the highest Pains.</p>
                     <p>The Lords of the Treasury have called in all Commissions given to Papists, for collecting His Majesty's Revenue.</p>

                     <p>THE Chancellor thinking, as Affairs stood, he was not secure at home, resolved for <hi>France</hi>; and with all the Privacy imaginable, he in Womans and his Lady in Mans Clothes, got aboard a Vessel bound from this <hi>Firth</hi> the 20<hi>th</hi> instant, being Thursday; which set Sail, the Wind being fair: But a certain Person on Horse-back, riding by <hi>Kircal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi> where the Seamen use to walk, called to them and told them, there was a good Prize in that Ship under Sail, namely, the Chancellor of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Whereupon, about thirty six common Sea-men, commanded by one <hi>Wilson,</hi> that had been a Bucaneer in <hi>America,</hi> which had Guns or Muskets, manag'd a light Boat, and without any Provision save a little Brandy, or any Order from a Magistrate, set Sail immediately, and came up with the Ship that Night, boarded her, inquired for the Chancellor, whom they denied to be aboard; but after search, found him and his Lady cloathed as aforesaid, brought the Ship back, and carried the Prisoners, with Mr. <hi>Nicolson</hi> (a Priest, late Regent in the Colledg of <hi>Glasgow</hi>) ashoar to <hi>Kircaldie</hi> Talbooth (or Prison.) The Chancellor wrote Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters yesterday to several of the Privy-Council, complaining of the Injury done him. The Council have ordered him to be carried by the Earl of <hi>Marr,</hi> and a Company of the <hi>Militia,</hi> to <hi>Sterling</hi>-Castle.</p>
                     <p>The Duke of <hi>Gordon</hi> has been desired by the Council to lay down his Charge of Governour of the Castle, but he still de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines it; alledging, that seeing he has his Commission imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from the King, and to be accountable to none else, he cannot in Honour lay it down till he has His Majesty's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for it, and says he had sent a Gentleman expresly to know His Majesty's Pleasure upon that point fourteen days ago, and expects his return every day: And in the mean time, has assured the Council by Letters, and this day the Provost and Magistrates of the City, whom he sent for to speak with, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60825:102"/>
he will upon his Word and Honour be a good Neighbour, and not do them or the City any Prejudice.</p>
                     <p>Two days ago his Captain put an Oath to the Souldiers, whereby they bound themselves to be faithful to His Majesty, and their Superior Officers, and to defend the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which being refused by twenty or thirty, whereof five were Papists, they were turned out.</p>
                     <p>There was a Pink arrived at <hi>Leith</hi> on <hi>Thursday,</hi> sent by His Majesty. The Searchers seized two Boxes in it directed to the Chancellor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and being brought to the Council, there were found in them several Precepts upon the Treasury for payment of certain Sums to Papists, and some Commissions; in particular, a Commission to one <hi>Peter Winste</hi> (a Papist) to be Major of the Gates of the Castle, and have Power of all the Keys, without being accountable to the Lieutenant (who is a Protestant) but only to the Duke, and his Deputy, who is a Papist too.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>THE only Reason that induced me to undergo so Great an Vndertaking, was, That I saw the</hi> Laws <hi>and</hi> Liberties <hi>of these Kingdoms overturned, and the</hi> Protestant Religion <hi>in Eminent Danger: And seeing you are here so many Noblemen and Gentlemen, I have called you together, that I may have your Advice, what is to be done for Securing the</hi> Protestant Religion, <hi>and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing your</hi> Laws <hi>and</hi> Liberties, <hi>according to my</hi> Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>

But as they were about to part for that Dyet, the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> proposed to them, as his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's Advice, that they should move the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to desire the <hi>King</hi> to return and call a <hi>Free-Parliament,</hi> which would the best way to Secure the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion and <hi>Property,</hi> and to Heal all <hi>Breaches.</hi> This Proposal seemed to dissatisfy the whole Meeting, and the Duke of <hi>Hamilton</hi> their President, Father to the Earl, but they presently parted.</p>

                     <hi>Wednesday,</hi> the Ninth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> they met at three of the Clock in the same Room, and Sir <hi>Patrick Hume</hi> took notice of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he Proposal made by the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> and desired to know if there was any there that would second it: But none ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to do it; he said, That what the Earl had proposed, was evidently opposite and inimicous to his Highness the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Undertaking, his Declaration, and the Good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of preserving the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion, and of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing their Laws and Liberties exprest in it; and further, desired that the Meeting should declare this to be their Opinion of it. The Lord <hi>Cardross</hi> seconded Sir <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Motion: it was answered by the Duke of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> President of the <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> That their Business was to prepare an Advice to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the Prince; and the Advice being now ready to go to the Vote, there was no need that the Meeting should give their Sense of the Earl's Proposal, which neither before nor after Sir <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Motion, any had pretended to own or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond;

so that it was fallen and out of doors; and that the Vote of the Meeting, upon the Advice brought in by their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, would sufficiently declare their Opinion: This being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by the Earl of <hi>Sutherland,</hi> the Lord <hi>Cardross,</hi> and Sir <hi>Patrick</hi> did acquiesce in it; and the Meeting voted una<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I Doubt not but the Wisdom of the Nation will take the most effectual way to secure our <hi>Religion,</hi> our <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Property.</hi> However, being a Lover of all these, I can't forbear communicating my Thoughts unto you with an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance you'l consider them.</p>
                  <p>God hath done great things for us, and yet the greatest thing is not yet done; there are many Difficulties in the way, and many more will be thrown into it. <hi>Slavery</hi> is most to be dreaded at this time: What is done must be chiefly to guard against it. How to do it, is the principal business of the Great Men in the next <hi>Convention.</hi> To know where we are, is the first step to be taken. Is the Government dissolved, or only under some Disorders? If the latter; Are the Disorders such as must be laid to the Charge of the King, or to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60825:106"/>
or both? If to the King; Are they sufficient to depose him? If that be done, Are we more secure from <hi>Slavery</hi> than now? Will there be more than a Change of Persons in the Throne? A Child for a Father, a Protestant for a Papist? And in a few Years the Succession may fall to the Queen of <hi>Spain,</hi> or Dutchess of <hi>Savoy,</hi> both Roman Catholicks, and we in as great, or greater danger of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery</hi> than we were the other day; the Constitution remains the same, the <hi>Iura Majestatis,</hi> viz. the <hi>Militia</hi>; the Power to make War or Peace; the choosing Judges, Sheriffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> still in the Person of the King; or if only by one Parliament restored to the People, another Parliament may give them the King again. <hi>Leges Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriores priores abrogant.</hi> And who can tell what Contests there may be about the Right of the Crown. The Deposed Prince is alive, and his Right by Sword will be disputed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Government be dissolved, the Power devolves on the People; no one can claim the Crown; the Royal Family is as it were extinct; the People may set up what Government they please, either the old, or a new; A Monarchy absolute, or limited; or an Aristocracy or Democracy. If a Monarchy limited, supposing it mostly suited to the temper of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> they may choose what Family they please to sit in the Throne: They may settle it on the <hi>Princess of Orange, Princess Ann,</hi> the <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi> and for want of Issue, on whom else they think meet. These hold not by virtue of an old Right, but by reason of the People's placing it upon them, and the Monarchy may be thus, <hi>de Novo,</hi> made Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Prince of Wales</hi> gone, having lost their Right by the Dissolution of the Government. The <hi>Iura Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestatis,</hi> the <hi>Militia,</hi> the Power of War and Peace, or the Power of the Sword, with the Power of making Judges, Sheriffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be lodged where now the Power of Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, <hi>viz.</hi> in King, Lords, and Commons, which will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitate frequent Parliaments, and make it impossible for the Monarch to enslave us. There are but two ways by which <hi>Slavery</hi> can be brought on us, <hi>viz. Force</hi> or <hi>Injustice.</hi> The <hi>Militia,</hi> or Power of the Sword, being in the People, we are secured from the mischief of <hi>Force.</hi> The Power of making Judges and all the Ministers of Justice being also in the People, they cannot be ruin'd by <hi>Injustice.</hi>

If there be a Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, Is it of the Constitution, or only of the Form of Administration? I confess my self not States-man enough to be acquainted with the Fineness of the Politicks, but am apt to run the old Road, and please my self with an old Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, All Power is <hi>Originally,</hi> or <hi>Fundamentally</hi> in the People, <hi>Formally</hi> in the <hi>Parliament,</hi> which is one Corporation made up of three <hi>Constituent Essentiating</hi> Parts, King, Lords and Commons, so it was with us in <hi>England.</hi> When this Corporation is broken, when any one Essentiating Part is lost or gone, there is a Dissolution of the Corporation. The <hi>Formal</hi> Seat of <hi>Power,</hi> and that <hi>Power</hi> devolves on the People. When it's impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to have a Parliament, the Power returns to them with whom it was originally. Is it possible to have a <hi>Parliament?</hi> It's not possible. The Government therefore is dissolv'd.</p>
                  <p>If what is essential to our Constitution be invaded or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished from us, the Constitution is broken. I will instance in two things essential to the Constitution. That the People choose their own <hi>Representatives.</hi> And that their <hi>Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> have such an Interest in the <hi>Legislation,</hi> that no Laws be made or abrogated without their Consent. The destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one or both of these, subverts the Foundation of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                  <p>The Government being dissolved, what must the People do? C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The way of doing it must be <hi>Great, Awful,</hi> and <hi>August,</hi> that none may be able to quarrel it. A National Convention made up of the <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives</hi> of the Community: That the Convention may be truly National, and represent the Community, it must be larger than a House of Commons ordinarily is. It's this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention that sets up what kind of Government they please. If they'l have a Parliament made up of King, Lords and Commons, it's sufficient that this Convention is so pleased. The Power of this Convention must be absolute and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable, accountable to none but God. It gives Laws to

Kings, yea to the whole Parliament, and sets bounds unto it; it shall go so far, and no further. No Act of Parliament can be strong enough to move the Foundation laid by this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. The Convention therefore, as it has more Power than a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and is it's <hi>Creator,</hi> it must have a larger Body. What think you therefore if the first thing done by the approaching Convention be the increasing their Number. What if they double it? Whether by ordering every Market-Town to send up their Representatives, or every Hundred, Wapentake, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or by some other way; according to the proportion of People, and publick Payments, as the wise Men of this Convention shall judg most practicable, that it may be the <hi>Grand Council</hi> of the Nation.

                  <p>Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was declared a <hi>Bastard</hi>; and by Vertue of an Act of Parliament of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, she Succeeded; which Act being Repealed in the First of her Reign, and the Crown being Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted otherwise by Parliament, all the Limitations of the Crown in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's Reign were avoided; so that</p>
                  <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who was declared a <hi>Bastard,</hi> by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time, and limitted to Succeed, in another Act in his time, and that Act repealed by Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> became Queen in the force of her own Act of Parliament, which declares her Lawful Queen.</p>
                  <p>The Crown was Entail'd in <hi>Richard</hi> the Second's time; again, in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth; again, in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth; again, in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth; again, in the time of <hi>Richard</hi> the Third; again, in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth; Thrice in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth.</p>

                  <p>So that it was agreed by the States of both Kingdoms, and the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and therefore, probably, the Universal Opinion of the Great Men of that Age, That Kings and Sovereign Princes, with the Consent of their States, had a Power to Alter and Bind the Succession of the Crown; and never denied to be Law till the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second.</p>

There was a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> against <hi>Conecticot Colony</hi> (whose Charter was granted to them by King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second) only Letters were sent to them in the King's Name, signifying, that (in case they did resign their Charter) they should take their choice of being under <hi>New-York</hi> or <hi>Boston.</hi> Several of the Magistrates there returned a most humble and supplicatory Answer, praying, That their former Government might still continue; but that if it must be taken from

them, they had rather be under <hi>Boston</hi> than <hi>New-York:</hi> This was by some at Court interpreted a Resignation of their Charter, and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission sent to Sir <hi>Edmond Andross,</hi> who went with some armed Attendants to <hi>Hartford</hi> (their principal Town) and declared their Charter and former Government to be void. As for <hi>Road-Island,</hi> they submitted themselves to His Majesties pleasure.</p>
                  <p>Before these Changes happened, <hi>New-England</hi> was of all the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Plantations (their Enemies themselves being Judges) the most flourishing and de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>irable.</p>
                  <p>But their Charters being all (one way or other) declared to be void and insignificant, it was an easy matter to erect a French Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in that part of the King's Dominions, (no doubt intended by the Evil Counsellors) as a <hi>Specimen</hi> of what was designed to be here in <hi>England,</hi> as soon as the times would bear it. Accordingly Sir <hi>Edmond Andross</hi> (a <hi>Gernsey</hi>-man) was pitched on as a fit Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be made use of; and a most Illegal Commission given him, bearing date <hi>Iune</hi> 3, 1686, by which he, with four of his Council, (perhaps all of them his <hi>absolute Devotees</hi>) are impower'd to make Laws and raise Moneys on the Kings Subjects without any Parliament, Assembly, or Consent of the People.</p>
                  <p>It was thought by Wise Men, that the Remembrance of <hi>Dudley</hi> and <hi>Empson,</hi> who were in the days of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for acting by a like Commission, would have deterred them from doing so; But it did not, for Laws are made by a few of them, and indeed what they please: nor are they printed, as was the Custom in the former Governments, so that the People are at a great loss to know what is Law, and what not. Only one Law they are sensible of, which doth prohibit all Town-Meetings, excepting on a certain Day once a Year; whereas the Inhabitants have occasion to meet once a Month, sometimes every Week, for relief of the Poor, or other Town-Affairs. But it is easy to penetrate into the Design of this Law, which was (no Question) to keep them in every Town from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining to <hi>England,</hi> of the Oppression they are under: And (as Laws have been Established) so Moneys have been Raised by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in a most Illegal and Arbitrary way, without any consent of the People. Sir <hi>Edmond Andross</hi> caused a Tax to be leavied of a Penny in a Pound on all the Towns then under his Government: And when at <hi>Ipswich</hi> and other places, the <hi>Select Men</hi> (as they are there stiled) voted, That inasmuch as it was against the Common Priviledges of English Subjects, to have Money raised without their
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60825:114"/>
own Consent in an Assembly or Parliament; That therefore they would petition the King for liberty of an Assembly before they made any Rates; the said Sir <hi>Edmond Andross</hi> caused them to be Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Fined, some 20 <hi>l.</hi> some 30 <hi>l.</hi> and some 50 <hi>l.</hi> as the Judges, by him instructed, should see meet to determine; Yea, and several Gentlemen in the Country were Imprisoned and bound to their Good Behaviour, upon meer suspicion, that they did incourage their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours not to comply with these Arbitrary Proceedings. And that so they might be sure to effect their Pernicious Designs, they have caused Juries to be pick'd of Men who are not of the Vicinity, and some of them meer Strangers in the Country, and no Freeholders: which actings are highly Illegal. One of the former Magistrates was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Prison without any Crimes laid to his Charge, and there kept half a Year without any Fault; and tho he petitioned for a <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> it was denied him. Also inferiour Officers have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted what Fees they please to demand, contrary to all Rules of Reason and Justice. They make poor Widows and Fatherless pay 50 <hi>s.</hi> for the Probate of a Will, which under the former easy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment would not have been a Tenth part so much. Six Persons who had been illegally imprisoned, were forced to give the Officers 117 <hi>l.</hi> whenas upon Computation, they found that here in <hi>England</hi> their Fees would not have amounted to 10 <hi>l.</hi> in all. And yet these things (tho bad enough) are but a very small part of the Misery which that poor People have been groaning under, since they have been go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by a Dispotick and Absolute Power. For, their new Masters tell them, that their Charter being gone, their Title to their Lands and Estates is gone therewith, and that All is the Kings; and that They represent the King; and that therefore all Persons must take Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents from them, and give what they see meet to impose, that so they may enjoy the Houses which their own Hands have built, and the Lands, which at vast Charges in subduing a Wilderness, they have for many Years had a rightful possession of, as ever any People in the World had or can have: Accordingly the Governor ordered the Lands belonging to some in <hi>Charles-Town</hi> to be measured out, &amp; given to his Creatures, and <hi>Writs of Intrusion</hi> to be issued out against others: And the Commons belonging to several Towns have been given to some of the Governours Council, who begged them, to the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verishing, if not utter ruining of whole Townships. And when an Island belonging to the Town of <hi>Plimouth</hi> was petitioned away from them by one <hi>Nathaniel Clark</hi> (whom Sir <hi>Edmond Andross</hi>

                  <p>Besides this, Mr. <hi>Inc. Mather,</hi> with two <hi>New-England</hi> Gentlemen, presented a Petition and humble Proposals to the King, wherein they prayed that the Right which they had in their Estates before the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was changed, might be confirmed; And that no Laws might be made, or Moneys raised, without an Assembly, with sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry other particulars; which the King referred to a Committee for Foreign Plantations, who ordered them into the Hands of the Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-General to make his Report. The Clerk, <hi>William Blathwait</hi> sent to the Attorney-General a Copy, wherein the Essential Proposal of an Assembly was wholly left out. And being spoke to about it, he said the Earl of <hi>Sunderland</hi> blotted out that with his own Hand; likewise a Soliciter in this Cause related that the said Earl of <hi>Sunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> affirmed to him, that it was by his Advice that the King had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a Commission to Sir <hi>Edmond Andross</hi> to raise Moneys without an Assembly, and that he knew the King would never consent to an Alteration, nor would he propose it to His Majesty. When of late all Charters were restored to <hi>England,</hi> it was highly rational for <hi>New-England</hi>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:60825:116"/>
to expect the like; for if it be an illegal and unjust thing to deprive good Subjects here of their <hi>Antient Rights and Liberties,</hi> it cannot be consistent with Justice and Equity to deal so with those that are afar off; Applications therefore were made to the King, and to some Ministers of State. It was urged, that if a Foreign Prince or State should, during the present Troubles, send a Frigate to <hi>New-England,</hi> and promise to protect them, as under their former Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, it would be an unconquerable temptation; yet no Resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Charters would be granted to <hi>New-England,</hi> which has opened the Eyes of some thinking Men. Thus hath <hi>New-England</hi> been dealt with: This hath been, and still is the bleeding state of that Country.</p>
                  <p>They cannot but hope that <hi>England</hi> will send them speedy Relief; especially considering that through the ill Conduct of their present Rulers, the French Indians are (as the last Vessels from thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form) beginning their cruel Butcheries amongst the English in those parts; And many have fears that there is a design to deliver that Country into the Hands of the French King, except his Highness the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> whom a Divine Hand has raised up to deliver the O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>IT is a Maxim of the <hi>Law of England</hi> concerning the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That there is no <hi>Interregnum.</hi> Of necessity there must be a Change in the Person, yet there is a Continuation of the Government. Which shews the Prudence and Perfection of the Constitution, in preventing that, which of all things is most De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable, a Failure of Government. This Rule is therefore of that Importance, as not to be given up upon the trivial Saying of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo est haeres viventis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true, the common and ordinary cause of a Change in the Person that is invested with the <hi>Royal Authority,</hi> is Death.</p>
                  <p>But we are now in a rare and extraordinary Case, where the King is living, and yet may be said to be divested of the <hi>Royal Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> as having by his Encroachments upon the Peoples Rights, provoked them to resort to Arms; and being vanquished by that Force, followed with a total Defection from him, and his Relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hing the Kingdom thereupon, without providing any ways for the Administration of the Government.</p>
                  <p>This seems to be a <hi>Cesser</hi> of this Government, and may in Civil and Politick Construction amount to as much as if he had died.</p>
                  <p>But because this is a <hi>Cess</hi> of that nature that requires a Judgment to be made upon it, it seems necessary to have a <hi>Convention</hi> of the Estates of the Nation, to make a Declaration thereupon (for 'tis not for private Persons to determine in the Cases aforesaid, how or when the King has lost his Government) and till such Authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Declaration made, the King may be supposed in some kind of possession of the Kingly Office.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t after the Judgment made and declared, there seems to be no d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>fference in the consequence and result of the thing, between such an extraordinary case of the <hi>Cesser</hi> of the <hi>Royal Dignity,</hi> and the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60825:118"/>
case of Death or voluntary Resignation; or as if the King had been prosest, and made himself a Recluse in a Religious House.</p>
                  <p>Then it must devolve upon the next Heir, her Royal Highness the Princess of <hi>Orange.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the pretended Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> if there had been no Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions as to his Birth, (as there are many violent ones) yet his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conveyed into unknown Places, by Persons in whom no credit can be reposed, and at an Age which exposes him to all manner of Practices and Impostures, touching his Person; then can there here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be no manner of Certainty of him, so as to induce the Nation ever to consider any Pretence of that kind.</p>
                  <p>These things being considered;</p>
                  <p>First, Whether will not the declaring her Royal Highness <hi>Queen of England,</hi> as next in Succession, be the surest and be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, If that Conceit of devolving to the People be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Whether must we not conclude, that the Misgovernment of King <hi>Iames</hi> the Second, hath not only determin'd his Roylaty, but put a period to the Monarchy it self? And then 'tis not only a loss as to his Person, but to the whole Royal Family.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Whether those Persons that have started this Notion, upon pretence of giving the Nation an opportunity of gratifying his Highness the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> in proportion to his Merits (which it must be acknowledged no Reward can exceed) if they were searched to the bottom, did not do it rather to undermine this Ancient and Hereditary Monarchy, and to give an Advantage to their Republican Principles, than out of any Affection and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to his Highness? For if the latter was that they had t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then it will be capable of expressing its Gratitude to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> in matters touching even the Royal Dignity it self, without making such a Stroke upon the Government, as the Electing of a King, or making any other immediate Alteration in the right of the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy (before the Parliament is compleated and constituted in all its parts) must amount unto.</p>

The Gentry were reduced to the utmost degree of Contempt, and the Nobility, who only were capable of putting a stop to such notorious and impolitick Encroachments on our Birth-rights and Liberties, were not only closeted, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd, re-examin'd, turn'd out of their Stations, brow-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, ridicul'd at Court, and in short, driven into the Country; but they were also by all the Arts that were possible rendred odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Crown, contemptible to one another, and of no use to their Inferiours.</p>
                  <p>The Army, which was the next great Engine to bring about their Design, was managed with more Art than is commonly considered; for first there was a Party of Roman Catholicks mixed with the Common Souldiers, to be as it were Spies and Tempters, to creep into all the places of their resort, to observe their Words, Looks and Actions, and to take the opportunity of all their Needs, Crimes, Vices and Follies, to pervert them, and draw them over to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; and in the mean time to secure them from contriving any thing that might inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt their Projects upon us.

And thirdly, They sent them to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in those places that had in any degree refused to comply with their Wills, and not only suffered, but encouraged them to outrage, and sometimes to murder their Hosts; but to be sure in all places they very much impoverish'd those that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd them, and in the Interim they kept all in awe and quiet, whilst the State-Mountebanks practised upon their Lives, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, Liberties and Properties.</p>
                  <p>A People thus harassed and beset, one would have thought had been consigned to Ruin and Destruction; for where could our Deliverance begin?

To deprive us of this remote Comfort, that Scene was laid, and the Lady of <hi>Loretto</hi> sollicited to procure a Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> to reduce us to an utter Desperation of any Redress for ever. And now they thought they were so secure of the Day, that they might attack the Heretical Bishops, and the whole body of our Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy at once, and make them eat their own <hi>Dung</hi> in the Faces of their respective Congregations; if they had comply'd, the whole Nation would have abhorred them, as a parcel of Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards; if they did not, the Ecclesiastical Commission was to have mowed them down by whole sale; and when the People had been once deprived of their faithful and learned Shepherds, the Wolves in Sheeps-clothing hoped to have had much better Success than hitherto: but the Bishops interposing so, united the inferior Clergy, that this Design proved abortive, and the declaring the Bishops Petition a Seditious Libel, and so much the more dangerous because penn'd with great Modesty and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, so far opened the Eyes of all Men, that the most Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant saw nothing less than the Extirpation of the Protestant Religion was aim'd at.</p>
                  <p>The Army however, which was the great Wheel in this most dreadful Machine, was for the most part Protestant, and had express'd so much Joy at the acquittal of the Bishops, in the Camp at <hi>Hownslow-Heath</hi>; that they clearly saw, till it was new-modell'd, it could n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

for this Offence they were brought up Prisoners to <hi>London,</hi> and it was given out they should be hanged, as perhaps they had been, if <hi>Monsieur de Avaux</hi>'s Memorial given in at the <hi>Hague,</hi> had not come in that very Post to enlighten our little <hi>Statesmen,</hi> and shew them their approaching Danger, and yet after all, the 10<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> last they were cashier'd at <hi>Windsor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And when the Storm from <hi>Holland</hi> seemed unavoidable, with what Insolence did they treat the Eleven Proposals made by the Bishops, and the Petition presented the 17<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> last, by the Bishops and Peers about the Town? So that till the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my began to go over to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the greatest part of the Nation had declared for him: No Parliament was to be thought of, and the <hi>Dispensing Power</hi> was the most Sacred of all the Prerogatives of the Crown.</p>
                  <p>That we may not imagine all this was undertaken, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon without good Consideration of the Difficulties the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> were to met with, I would desire the Reader to peruse a small Piece by them published in the Year 1685, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the first Session of Parliament of <hi>Iames</hi> the Second, stil'd, <hi>Salus Britannica, or the Safety of the Protestant Religion, against all the present Apprehensions of Popery,</hi> in <hi>Folio.</hi> 
                     <q>The Design of which, as the Author himself tells us, is to examine what National Operation or Influence a Real Popish Crown'd Head <hi>can</hi> have over the Lives, Liberties, or Estates of <hi>English-men</hi> as now enjoyed, and the Religion of the Kingdom, as at present Establish'd, and by confuting even the most substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of their imagined Dangers, to dissipate those false fears of Popery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> page 1.</q> And in truth I believe no Man can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but he has very effectually proved, that it is utterly impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a Popish Prince, who has none but these Three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, to set up Popery in this Nation, and that all he can gain by the Attempt, will be the Ruine of himself. And certainly they could not but apprehend this might possibly, if not proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, be the Event; yet after all, King and Kingdom was at last to be sacrificed to the holy See of <hi>Rome</hi>; and on they went when they had proved it impossible to succeed.</p>
                  <p>I need be the less exact in setting down what they have done, it being within the space of four Years last past, that they have had the management of Affairs, and so all things are as fresh in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60825:121"/>
all Mens Memories, as if they had been acted but yesterday: I think then, that I may from these Premises safely conclude, that a more daring, restless and implacable Faction never appeared under the Sun than this is; And that it is the Interest of every true <hi>English</hi> Protestant, of what Perswasion soever he be, to do his utmost to free this miserable Nation from the Danger and Fear too (if it be possible) of ever feeling again the dire Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Popish Zeal, or rather Fury.</p>
                  <p>Our wise Ancestors, for above these three hundred Years, have been labouring to restrain this <hi>Demon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ick,</hi> by <hi>Laws, Oaths</hi> and <hi>Tests</hi>; and when all the Methods of Severity fail'd, we have tried the Charms of Kindness, Trust, Friendship and Reliance: We set up a Prince of their Communion, and opposed all those that would have Excluded him, with a Zeal which made us look a little too much in love with one who seem'd designed to be our Scourge by Heaven it self. When he had declared his Religion, and some of his Party, amongst whom <hi>Nevel Paine</hi> was one, had given us clear Indications of their Rage against us; yet we in Parliament, not only attainted, and thereby ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and his Party, but when some Gentlemen propos'd to have the Security of the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion taken into Consideration, the House declared they would <hi>intirely rely upon his Majesty's Promise for the Security of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which they valued more than their Lives.</hi> And before this, when <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, the 30<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1679, to avoid the Exclusion-Bill, propos'd very advantageous Restrictions of the Authority of a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Prince, the <hi>Church-of-England-men</hi> rejected them, for fear they should too much weaken and expose the Regal Authority, not to mention the Favours shewn to all the whole <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Party, during the fierce Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Popish Plot in that Prince's Reign: Well, what could have been done more than was, to oblige Men or Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to treat us like Friends, when they had an opportunity to express their Gratitude? No, stay you there Gentlemen, we Roman Catholicks have but one Friend in this World, and if you are not for him too, stand off; expect nothing from us but Ruin and Desolation. Will you <hi>Repeal the Penal Laws and the Tests?</hi> Why I cannot betray my Religion: Then make room for one that will, Turn out, <hi>Ite Procul, Ite Profani.</hi> And we all know what follow'd, and I suppose no body in this Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60825:122"/>
will have so little wit as to pretend any more to oblige a Roman Catholick by any of these things.</p>
                  <p>Well, will Oaths bind them? No, they have a Pope, and a Maxim that will frustrate that Ligament, when ever it is for their convenience to be free. And of this we have seen and felt too much already. Will Laws? If you catch and hang the Priest, the Traitor, the Cut-throat, he is made a Martyr, his Crime's deny'd, palliated, excus'd, or it may be justified and defended as occasion serves, and yet after all, they shall have the Satisfaction of clamouring against you for a persecuting Church, and a bloody Nation.</p>
                  <p>Well, what is to be done? Why, for my part, I can see but one possible Method to quiet the Nation, and that is once for all to clear it of these Monsters, and force them to transplant themselves, not out of the <hi>English</hi> Dominions, but out of this Island: As long as they continue amongst us, they neither can nor will be quiet; Priests they must and will have, and that Ferment will suffer nothing near it to be at rest. The remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of what is past will irritate the Minds of Men, and make them jealous of future Evils, so that no care of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest and best Governours can long keep the Nation in Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Peace, if these Men-catchers are suffered to nestle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us. But then I would have this extended only to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> because <hi>Ireland</hi> would be laid desolate by such an Expedient, and if the <hi>English</hi> Nation, which has not above 40000 Roman Catholicks, were once cleared, it would very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily suppress and revenge any Attempt could be made in that Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Besides this, all Feme Coverts, all Persons above sixty or fifty years of Age, all Day-labourers and Handy-crafts-men might be excepted; these can maintain no Priests, nor much imbroil the Peace of the Nation, or at least for no long time; but then all the Nobility, Gentry, Merchants and rich Tradesmen of that Religion, I think ought to be sent packing, and for the future a Law be made to disfranchise them, and make them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of possessing, purchasing, inheriting or transmitting any Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments, to the value of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Shillings <hi>per Annum,</hi> or upwards.</p>
                  <p>To make this the more easy, yet it were fitting that every individual Person should be asked whether he had rather leave
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60825:122"/>
Country, or his Religion? and all that would promise the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon Oath, to be excused, but so as to forfeit their Estates if they relapsed after the Oath so taken, or brought up their Children in that Religion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To allow all that would transplant themselves the full value of their Estates, both Real and Personal, their Debts being first paid and deducted. This would enable them to live in as great or a greater Equipage and Grandeur in our Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as they ever had here in <hi>England</hi>; and if they removed into <hi>Germany</hi> or <hi>France, Italy</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> their Estates would make their Lives easy, and their Banishment honourable. The World is wide, and if I were one of them I should never stay for an Act of Parliament, but would certainly sell what I had and be gone, that I might enjoy my Religion and my Estate in a warmer Climate.</p>
                  <p>But, alas, they love their Country too dearly to leave it: what is it in <hi>England</hi> they love? The Civil Liberties they had brought to the utmost limits of Destruction: The Religion of <hi>England</hi> they hate above all other; the Earth is not more Fruitful, and the Air is much colder than that of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and I am confident the English Humour is so far exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated against Popery, that half a hundred Years will not allay the Fever the last four Years have raised in the English Blood against Popery; so that they have nothing to attach them to <hi>England,</hi> but the sullen hopes of being a Plague and a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to us.</p>
                  <p>But it will be said, The transporting so much Wealth out of the Nation will too much impoverish us: This ought well to be considered, and a true Estimate made both of the Estates and Debts of the Roman Catholicks, and of the Methods of returning their Effects beyond the Seas, and then perhaps it would rather increase our Trade than abate our Wealth. And as for the weakning us by the taking off so many of our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, this I am sure is a meer <hi>Chimera,</hi> two or three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Persons would be the utmost that we should lose: And those who bought their Estates would be better Subjects and Neighbours than ever they will be as long as they continue <hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:60825:123"/>It is not to be imagin'd, that all or any considerable Part of this Wealth will be transported in <hi>English</hi> Mony in <hi>specie,</hi> but in Merchandise, Bills of Exchange, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident we have more sent away to the <hi>Iesuits</hi> Colledg beyond the Seas in seven Years, than would be carried out in <hi>specie</hi> on such an occasion; and hereby we should at once rid our selves of one of the greatest Plagues that any Nation ever strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled so long with.</p>
                  <p>Nor would it be only Profitable but <hi>Iust.</hi> They have given us the greatest Provocation that ever was given by Men, to Men. Did ever 40000 Men in any other part of the World ever before endeavour to do what they themselves had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be impossible? Did ever such an handful of Men before, by Fraud and Violence, design to enslave a Free, to impoverish a Rich, to subdue a Valiant and Generous Nation? What could they mean by the Force they in Print, and in common Discourse intimated, that was, to compel us to give up our Laws, if fair Means would not do, but a Massacre, or a French Invasion? Let them consider how they have treated thofe of our Religion in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Piedmont</hi>; and then tell me, and all the World, if we have treated them in the same manner, when we have sent them away with all they can justly call their own, only that we might not be forced to ruin them by a flower Prosecution.</p>
                  <p>The Facility is equal to the Justice of this Method; they are few in number, hated by all the rest of the Nation; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides all their former Misdemeanours, have, by the late At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts upon the Religion and Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> so far en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased the Aversion of all degrees of Men amongst us, that they will find very few to pity them, and not many to speak for them.</p>
                  <p>The only Objections I can foresee, are, first, That it will impoverish <hi>England</hi> to suffer them to carry away their Estates, and look too like Popish Cruelty, to turn them out despoiled of what they have, or of a great part of their Fortunes. Now this Objection must be considered in Parliament, because no one Man can make any thing near a true Estimate what the value will be, their Debts being deducted, till a true Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is given of their Estates and Debts, and then I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60825:123"/>
believe it will be found much less than it seems at first.</p>
                  <p>The second Objection is, That it will weaken us and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our Enemies, to lose so many of our People. To this, I say, it is apparently otherwise; For if those Estates were in the Hands of Protestants, they would much more contribute to the Union and Strength of <hi>England,</hi> than the Persons of these Roman Catholicks do, of whom we can make little or no use in Civil or Military Affairs, at Home or Abroad, in Peace or War. And if they were added to any other Country, the Peace and Union they would leave us in, would infinitely over-ballance the loss of their Persons, and, as I believe, of their Estates too.</p>
                  <p>But now, on the contrary, if they be continued still amongst us, we must still struggle with all those Inconveniences, which have necessitated our Ancestors to make so many Laws against them, and the Severities which must be used to keep them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, will, by degrees, when the Memory of the late Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions is worn off, beget compassion, and that will grow grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as they grow fewer and less dangerous, and yet at last one single <hi>Iesuit</hi> may destroy the best of our Princes, and two or three Gentlemen of Estate, may disquiet and enjealous a whole County; and when all is done, no hopes is left that any las<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing Peace can be made with them; so that as long as there is any of that Religion in <hi>England,</hi> there is a Ferment in the Veins of the Nation, which will cause dreadful Paroxims.</p>
                  <p>Their Emissaries will also sow Dissentions between us and the Dissenters, and exasperate the Parties against each other; so that the good Correspendence which is now between us and them, will, in short time, be turn'd into Hatred on both sides, if all the Care imaginable be not taken on both Sides of these Incendiaries, which will never be wanting whilst we have a Popis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Nobility and Gentry, how small soever it is in Number.</p>
                  <p>The Seminaries at St. <hi>Omers, Doway,</hi> &amp;c. are kept up by the Nobility and Gentry of that Communion, and tend very much to the imbroiling and weakning <hi>England,</hi> and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the Interest of <hi>France</hi>; but would soon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The retiring of His late Majesty into <hi>France,</hi> is another strong Inducement: as long as He or the <hi>Child</hi> is living, they will have a pretence to Plot and cut Throats, and they will have some to pity, and others to applaud them; so that if there were no other Reason, this alone were suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to determine the Question, unless we are resolved to shew our selves as careless of a Protestant Prince, as we have been over-fond of a Roman Catholick, which will be an ill Recompence for our Deliverance.</p>

But after their Transmigration hither, Religion changing, other things changed with it; and the times for their publick Assemblies, in Conformity to the great Solemnities celebrated by Christians, came to be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the Feasts of <hi>Easter, Pentecost,</hi> and the <hi>Nativity.</hi> The lower we come down in Story, the seldomer we find these general Assemblies to have been held; and sometimes (even very anciently) when upon extraordinary Occasions, they met out of Course, a <hi>Precept,</hi> an <hi>Edict,</hi> or <hi>Sanction</hi> is mentioned to have issued from the King; But the times, and the very place of their ordinary Meeting having been certain, and determined in the very first and eldest times that we meet with any mention of such Assemblies, which times are as ancient as any Memory of the Nation it self; hence I infer, that no Summons from the King can be thought to have been necessary in those Days, because it was altogether need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Succession to the Crown did not in those Days, nor till of late Years, run in a course of lineal Succession by right
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60825:125"/>
of Inheritance: But upon the Death of a Prince, those Persons of the Realm that composed the then Parliament, assembled in order to the choosing of another. That the Kingdom was then Elective, though one or other of the Royal Blood was always chosen, but the next in lineal Succession very seldom, is evident from the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogies of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, from an old Law made at <hi>Calchuyth,</hi> appointing how, and by whom Kings shall be chosen; and from many express and particular Accounts given by our old Historians, of such Assemblies held for electing of Kings. Now such Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies could not be summon'd by any King; and yet in Conjunction with the King that themselves set up, they made Laws, binding the King and all the Realm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> After the Death of King <hi>William Rufus, Robert,</hi> his elder Brother, being then in the <hi>Holy Land, Henry,</hi> the youngest Son of King <hi>William</hi> the first, procur'd an Assembly of the Clergy and People of <hi>England,</hi> to whom he made large Promises of his good Government, in case they would accept of him for their King; and they agreeing, that if he would restore to them the Laws of King <hi>Edward the Confessor,</hi> then they would consent to make him their King: He swore that he would do so, and also free them from some Oppressions, which the Nation had groan'd under in his Brothers and his Fathers time. Hereupon they chose him King, and the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and the Archbishop of <hi>York</hi> set the Crown upon his Head; which being done, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the <hi>English</hi> Liberties pass'd the Royal Assent in that Assembly, the same in Substance, though not so large as King <hi>Iohn</hi>'s, and King <hi>Henry</hi> the thirds <hi>Magna Charta</hi>'s afterwards were.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> After that King's Death, in such another Parliament, King <hi>Stephen</hi> was elected, and <hi>Mawd</hi> the Express put by, though not without some Stain of Perfidiousness upon all those, and <hi>Stephen</hi> himself especially, who had sworn in her Father's Life-time, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg her for their Sovereign after his Decease.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> In King <hi>Richard</hi> the firsts time, the King being absent in the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> then his Chancellor, being Regent of the Kingdom in his Absence, whose Government was intolerable to the People for his Insolence and manifold Oppressions, a Parliament was convened at <hi>London,</hi> at the Instance of Earl <hi>Iohn,</hi> the King's Brother, to treat of the great and weighty Affairs of the King and Kingdom; in which Parliament this same Regent was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60825:125"/>
from his Government, and another set up, <hi>viz.</hi> the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Roan</hi> in his stead. This Assembly was not conven'd by the King, who was then in <hi>Palestine,</hi> nor by any Authority de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from him, for then the Regent and Chancellor must have call'd them together; but they met, as the Historian says ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, at the Instance of Earl <hi>Iohn.</hi> And yet, in the Kings Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, they took upon them to settle the publick Affairs of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> When King <hi>Henry</hi> the 3<hi>d.</hi> died, his eldest Son, Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> was then in the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> and came not home till within the third Year of his Reign; yet, immediately upon the Father's Death, all the Prelates and Nobles, and four Knights for every Shire, and four Burgesses for every Borough, assembled together in a great Council, and setled the Government till the King should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; made a new Seal, and a Chancellor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I infer from what has been said, that Writs of Summons are not so essential to the being of Parliaments, but that the People of <hi>England,</hi> especially at a time when they cannot be had, may by Law, and according to our old Constitution, assemble together in a Parliamentary way without them, to treat of and settle the publick Affairs of the Nation. And that if such Assemblies so conven'd, find the Throne vacant, they may proceed not only to set up a Prince, but with the Assent and Concurrence of such Prince, to transact all publick Business whatsoever, without a new Election; they having as great Authority as the People of <hi>England</hi> can dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate to their Representative.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The Acts of Parliaments not formal nor legal in all their Circumstances, are yet binding to the Nation so long as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in force, and not liable to be questioned as to the Validity of them, but in subsequent Parliaments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> The two <hi>Spencers, Temp. Edvardi Secundi,</hi> were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by Act of Parliament, and that Act of Parliament repealed by <hi>Dures &amp; Force</hi>; yet was the Act of Repeal a good Law, till it was annull'd 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Some Statutes of 11 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. and Attainders thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were repealed in a Parliament held <hi>Anno</hi> 21. of that King, which Parliament was procur'd by forc'd Elections; and yet the Repeal stood good, till such time as in 1 <hi>Henry</hi> 4. the Statutes of 11 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. were revived and appointed to be firmly held and kept.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:60825:126"/>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Parliament of 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. consisted of the same Knights, Citizens and Burgesses that had served in the then last dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved Parliament, and those Persons were by the King's Writs to the Sheriffs commanded to be returned; and yet they passed Acts, and their Acts tho never confirmed, continue to be Laws at this Day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Parliament that restored the Pope's Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, was notoriously known to be pack'd, insomuch that it was debated in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, whether or no to declare all their Acts void by Act of Parliament. That course was then upon some prudential Considerations declined; and therefore the Acts of that Parliament, not since repealed, continue binding Laws to this Day.</p>
                  <p>The Reason of all this, is, Because no inferior Courts have Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to judg of the Validity or Invalidity of the Acts of such Assemblies, as have but so much as a Colour of Parliamentary Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
                  <p>The Acts of such Assemblies being entred upon the Parliament-Roll, and certified before the Judges of <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> as Acts of Parliament, are conclusive and binding to them; because Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are the only Judges of the Imperfections, Invalidities, Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>lities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of one another.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament that call'd in King <hi>Charles</hi> the second, was not assembled by the King's Writ, and yet they made Acts, and the Royal Assent was had to them; many of which indeed were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards confirmed, but not all, and those that had no Confirmation, are undoubted Acts of Parliament without it, and have ever since obtained as such.</p>
                  <p>Hence I infer that the present Convention, may, if they please, assume to themselves a Parliamentary Power, and in Conjunction with such King or Queen as they shall declare, may give Laws to the Kingdom as a legal Parliament.</p>

                  <p>I will not dispu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e with you about what is past, or what is to come; it is too late to do the first, and as for the second, whatever becomes of other Arguments, Interest is most apt to prevail, and therefore all that I beg of you, is to take care that you do not mistake your own and the Nations Interest in a matter of such high Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment.</p>
                  <p>There is no less Affair before you than the Fate of Princes, and of three Kingdoms, which requires the most calm, mature, and deliberate Advice; and yet when you come to <hi>London,</hi> you will find such Distractions and Divisions in Mens Counsels, that all the threatning Dangers of <hi>Popery</hi> were not a more formidable prospect to Considering Men, all old Animosities are revived, and new ones fomented every day; some are visibly acted by Ambition, others by Revenge; the <hi>Dissenter</hi> is very busie to undermine the Church, and the <hi>Commonwealths Man</hi> to subvert Monarchy, and <hi>the Lord have Mercy upon us all.</hi> I doubt not but you will readily confess, that it is the common Interest to have things settled upon such a bottom, as is most like to last, and then, I am sure, you must consult both Law and Conscience in the matter, and keep to your old Establishment as near as you can; for when there are so many Distempers in Mens Minds, and such contrary Interests, it is no time to innovate, it is no time to lay new Foundations, when there are frequent Earthquakes,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60825:127"/>
which will not give them time to settle: The Revolutions of State have been so quick and sudden of late, that all prudent Men will be cautions how they try Experiments, which are commonly dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and uncertain, but especially in matters of Government, which depend on the good liking of free and moral Agents, and when so many Hundred Thousands are to be satisfied, you can never guess at the prevailing Opinion, by the major Vote of a Convention.</p>
                  <p>Let us then consider, what is most likely to give the most gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral satisfaction to the Nation, for that, I am sure, is most likely to be lasting, and because you may be a Stranger to these Matters yet, I will give you an Account of the different Projects now on foot, as well as I can learn them.</p>
                  <p>Some are for sending to the King, and Treating with him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his Government, under such Legal Restraints, as shall give security to the most jealous Persons, for the preservation of their Liberties, Laws, and Religion; and if he will not consent to this, to make the next Heir Regent. Others are for declaring the Crown forfeited or demised, and proclaiming the <hi>Princess</hi> of <hi>Orange.</hi> Others will have the Government dissolved, and begin all <hi>de novo,</hi> and make the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> King, or Crown him and the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess</hi> together, and <hi>postpone</hi> the Title of the <hi>Princess Ann,</hi> till after the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Death, if he survive the <hi>Princess.</hi> I shall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to tell you, which of these I should prefer, were it <hi>Res inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra</hi>; for the Question is not, which you and I should like best, but which will be the firmest Foundation for the Peace and Settlement of these Kingdoms.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As for the first, though it be horribly decried, and such Men foolishly exposed as Friends to <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi>; yet I could never meet with any Man yet, who had the face to reject all Treaty with the King upon any other pretence, but that it was in vain, that it is impossible he should give any Security to the Nation that he would Govern by Law; which is so ridiculous a pretence, that it will satisfy no Body, but those who are resolved, that he shall never return. For, as little as I am versed in this matter, I could frame such Laws, as should put it utterly out of the King's Power to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade our Liberties or Religion: However, I am sure we should have thought our selves very secure, would the King have called a <hi>Free Parliament,</hi> and given them liberty to have made what Laws they please<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and that which would have given such general satisfaction before, had it been granted, I suspect, should it be now granted,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60825:127"/>
and refused that would give as general dissatisfaction; nay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the very refusal to Treat, will be thought such a scandalous neglect of our Duty to a Sovereign Prince, and give such Jealousies to People, that those who oppose it, are only afraid that the King should comply, as will be the foundation of universal Discontents, which will shew themselves upon the first occasion. It is certain, would the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention</hi> Treat with the King, either they would agree, or they would not agree; if they could not agree upon the proposal of reasonable Securities, this would satisfie Multitudes of People that they had tried; if they did agree, this would give universal satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and there were an happy end of all our Troubles.</p>
                  <p>But now let us suppose, that part of the <hi>Convention</hi> should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail which is against Treating with the King, and for deposing or setting him aside without more ado; let us consider what is like to be the most probable Consequence of this.</p>
                  <p>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> is certain, this fundamental Change in the Government can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made by any Legal Authority; for the <hi>Convention</hi> will not pretend to any such Legal Power, and there can be no Parliament without a King; and a King whose whole Authority depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>Convention</hi> that has no such Authority, is but in a weak state as to Civil Right: No Man will think himself bound in Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to obey him, and when every Mans Conscience is free, let such a Prince beware of Epidemical Discontents. And let you and I calmly consider, what Discontents may probably arise upon such a Juncture.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. First then, All those who think themselves bound by their Oath of Allegiance to defend the King's Person, Crown and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, who wonder at Men of Law, who talk of a Forfeiture or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the Crown while the King lives, and flies out of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms only for the safety of his Person, and because he will not trust himself in the power of his Enemies; I say, all such Persons will be greatly discontented at Deposing the King, and will never own any other King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> while their own King, to whom they have sworn Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance lives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and tho you should suppose such Conscientious Men to be very few, yet if these few should happen to be Persons of Character, of known Prudence and Abilities, Integrity and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty, in Church or State, their Examples would give a terrible Shock to such a new tottering Government, tho they were never so Tame and Peaceable, void of Faction and Sedition themselves.</p>

                     </gap>hese Men by the late general defection. The whole Nation, I confess, was very unanimous for the <hi>Prince,</hi> great numbers of Gentlemen, nay, of the King's own Soldiers went over to him, very few but Papis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pery, and very desirous to see the Laws and Religion of the Nation settled upon the old Foundations by a <hi>Free Parliament,</hi> which was all the Prince declared for; but many who were Well-wishers to this Design, will not renounce their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to their King; and now they see what is like to come of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, are ashamed of what they have done, and ask God's pardon for it, and are ready to undo it as far as they can.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Besides a thousand occasions of Discontent which may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in such a Change of Government as this, which no Body can possibly foresee, and yet may have very fatal Consequences, there are some very visible occasions for it besides the sense of Loyalty and Conscience.</p>
                  <p>How many Discontents, think you, may arise between the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry, who attend the new Court? Every Man will think he has some Merit, and expect some marks of Favour to have his share of Honour, and Power, and Profit, and yet a great many more must miss, than those who speed, and many of those who are Rewarded, may think they han't their Deserts, and be disconternted to see others preferred before them; and those whose expectations are disappointed, are disobliged too, and that is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous thing when there is another, and a righful King to oblige; for Duty and Discontent together, to be revenged if a new King, and to be reconciled to an old One, will shake a Throne which has so sandy a Foundation: The like may be said of the Soldiery, who are generally Men of Honour and Resentment, and have the greater and sharper Resentments now, because they are sensible of their mistake when it is too late; yet as they ought not to have Fought for Popery, nor against the Laws and Liberties of their Country, fo neither ought they to have deserted the defence of the King's Person and Crown, but have brought the Prince to Terms, as well as the King.</p>
                  <p>Thus you easily foresee what a heavy Tax must be laid upon the Nation, to defray the Charge of this Expedition, and I believe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60825:128"/>
the Country would have paid it very chearfully and thankfully, had the Prince res<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ored to them their Laws, and Liberties, and Religion, together with their King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but you know Men are apt to complain of every thing, when Money is to be paid, and it may be it will be thought hard to lose their King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to pay so dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> for it too: And tho what the <hi>Convention</hi> does is none of the Prince's fault, no more than it was his design, yet angry People don't use to disti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish so nicely.</p>
                  <p>But there is a greater Difficulty still than all this: There are no Contentions so fierce as those about Religion; this gave Life and Spirit to the Prince's Design, and had the main stroke in this late Revolution: And though Popery were a hated Religion, yet most Men are as zealous for their own Religion, as they are against Popery. Those of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are very glad to get rid of Popery, but they will not be contented to part with their Church into the Bargain, for this would be as bad as they could have suffered under Popery. The several Sects of Dissenters are glad to get rid of Popery also; but now they expect glorious Days for themselves, and what they expect God Almighty knows, for I am confident they don't know themselves. Now consider how difficult it will be, for any Prince, who has but a crazy Title to the immediate possession of the Crown, to adjust this matter so, as neither to disgust the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor the Dissenters, and if either of them be disobliged, there is a formidable Party made against them.</p>
                  <p>This being the Case, should the King be deposed, and any other ascend the Throne, it will be necessary for them to keep up a standing Army to quell such Discontents; for where there are and will be Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents without any tye of Conscience to restrain Men, there can be no defence but only in Power; and this will raise and encrease new Discontents; for it alters the frame of our Constitution, from a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to a Military Government, which is one of the great Grievances we have complained of, and I believe <hi>English</hi> People will not be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleased with <hi>Dutch,</hi> or <hi>German,</hi> or any foreign Souldiers, than they were with their own Country-Men; and I believe <hi>English</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers will not be extreamly pleased to see themselves disbanded, or sent into other Countries to hazard their Lives, while their Places are taken up by Foreigners, who live in ease, plenty, and sasety: And
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60825:129"/>
when things are come to this pass, which is so likely, that I cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ee how all the Wit of Man can prevent it; I will suppose but one thing more, which you will say is not unlikely, that the King return with a foreign Force to recover his Kingdoms, how ready will the Men of Conscience, and the Men of Discontent be to join him, nay to invite him Home again; and if he returns as a Conqueror, you will wish, when it is too late, that you had treated with him, and brought him back upon safe and honourable Terms.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Let us suppose now, that all this should be over-voted (for I am sure it can never be answered) and the Convention should resolve to proclaim the next Heir.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You must be sure to examine well who is the next Heir, that is, you must throughly examine the Pretences of the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi>; and yet if you have not good Proofs of the Imposture, you had better let it alone. For tho the Nation has had general presumptions of it, yet a Male Heir of the Crown is mightily desired, and People would be very fond of him, if they had one, and seem to expect some bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Proofs than meer Presumptions against him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because common Fame has promised a great deal more, and if you should either say nothing to it, or not what is expected, it would be a very plausible pretence for discontented People to quarrel.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Suppose the Princess of <hi>Orange</hi> should a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pear to be the next Heir, what if a Lady of her eminent Vertue should scruple to sit upon her Father's Throne, while he lives? Or what if she should scruple it hereafter, and place her Father in his Throne again? This is not impossible; for Vertue is greater than a Throne. For my part, I think you will put a very hard thing upon so excellent a Lady, and I pray God give her Grace to resist the Temptation. A Regency is more tolerable, because a Nation must be governed, and none so proper to govern it as the next Heir; but I should think, none who expect to wear a Crown, should countenance Subjects in deposing their King, nor accept of a Crown upon such Terms, as to take it off of a Father's Head: It is a dangerous thing for a Prince who has a Title to the Crown, to own that the Crown may be forfeited or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised by such a withdrawing; if this be not so, the Princess has no Right to the possession of the Crown yet; and if it be so, her Crown is worth a great deal less than formerly it was, especially if she own
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60825:129"/>
this Secret by accepting the Crown<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which her Ancestors always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, and which the best Subjects of <hi>England</hi> would not believe before; what they may do after this, I know not.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The next Design (I verily believe without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg or thought of the Prince, who has too great a Mind to think of any thing, which in the opinion of any wise Man could stain and fully his Glory) is to give the Crown to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> for it must be a Gift, if any thing; for he has no immediate Title to it, that I know of: This is upon a pretence, that the Government is dissolved, and therefore we must begin <hi>de novo,</hi> which is very ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, when the King is still alive, and the Laws in as full force as ever, only the Regular Administration of Government at present in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by the King's absence; but this is not the worst of it, for it is a dangerous pretence too, especially to Men of Quality and Es<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>tes, as you are; for if the Government be dissolved, our Laws are dissolved, and Honour and Property dissolved with them, and then I doubt the Mobile will come in for their share in the new Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of the Lands, and set up for Men of as good Quality as any; for if our Laws are gone, we return to a state of Nature, in which all Men are equal, and all things common; this I believe you will not be for, for the Reason above-mentioned.</p>
                  <p>If then the Laws continue, the Government is not dissolved, and the Crown is not a Gift, but an Inheritance still, as much as your Estate is; and then the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> cannot have it in his own Right, because his own Princess, and the Princess <hi>Anne</hi> are before him; consider then what the consequence of this Project would be.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This alters the essential Constitution of the <hi>English</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by changing an Hereditary into an Elective Monarchy, a thing which I know some Men are very fond of; for then the next occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion they can find to quarrel with their Prince, they may with as much ease turn it into a Common-Wealth; for when the Crown is at the Peoples disposal, they may if they please keep it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This will entangle all Men of Conscience in new Difficulties; for the Oath of Allegiance does not only bind us to the King, but to his Heirs and Successors, which must be understood of the next lineal Heir, where there is no Authority to alter it; and whatever a Parliament may be thought to have with the Authority and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60825:130"/>
of the King, no Man pretends, that a Convention of the Estates has any Legal Authority to do it. I should be as heartily glad as any Man, to see the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> legally seated on the <hi>English</hi> Throne; but these are Difficulties I cannot break through. Thus I have given you my hasty Thoughts, and pray God to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you.</p>

                  <p>YOur Name, your Quality, your Religion, and your Design in Publishing this Letter are wholly unknown to me, but the confident Assertion, <hi>pag.</hi> 3.6.16. <hi>That you are sure it can never be Answered</hi>; sounds so like a Son, or rather a Father of the <hi>Infallible Church,</hi> that it has provoked me, if not to answer, yet at least to reflect upon some Passages in this Magisterial Composure.</p>
                  <p>§. 2. <hi>Whatever becomes of other Arguments, Interest is most likely to prevail.</hi> You, Sir, suppose your Parliament-Man, in these words, to be one who will regard no Arguments from Justice, Reason, Religion, or the Laws of God or Man; <hi>Interest</hi> is the only thing which is <hi>likely to prevail</hi>; an excellent Complement to a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Man; but it goes higher yet, and takes in the Majority of the States, for no one Man shall ever determine these great things.</p>

                     <hi>Common-wealth-Men, Dissenters ambitious and revengeful Wretches,</hi> which you have so artfully mustered up to fright the <hi>Country Esquire</hi> with, can over-ballance. Strange it is in the mean time, that the <hi>Dangers of Popery,</hi> which last <hi>October</hi> appeared so formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, should in so short a time vanish, or rather dwindle into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: But God, by the Ministry of the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> and his Friends, has brought this about. In the rest of that Section I agree with you, and approve of it.</p>
                  <p>The two next Sections being only a representation of the different Parties of Men now upon the Stage, I leave as I find them.</p>
                  <p>§. 6. <hi>Though the Opinion of those who are for sending to the King, and treating with him to return to his Government, under such legal Restraints, as shall give security to the most jealous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for the preservation of their Laws, Liberties, and Religion i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But then if you leave him the Name, and take away the Power of a King, you set up a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> immediately, which will not end with your <hi>Popish Prince,</hi> but there will be stickling to keep all things in the same State in the following Reign, of what Religion soever the <hi>Prince</hi> is, which was the Reason why the Limitations offered by <hi>Charles</hi> II. in 1679, were rejected.</p>
                  <p>[And let it be remember'd also how well that <hi>Prince,</hi> that was supposed to be a <hi>Protestant,</hi> kept his Word, and the Solemn League and Covenant, which he solemnly with Hands and Eyes lifted up to Heaven, swore to observe in <hi>Scotland, &amp;c.</hi>]</p>

Now I say, Sir, If you cannot remember this, you shall never be trusted to <hi>frame Laws,</hi> if I can help it.</p>
                  <p>There is another and a better Reason to refuse a Treaty, than the <hi>fearing the King should comply.</hi> Suppose that he should grant all that you can ask, bating <hi>White-Hall, the Reve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>But if the <hi>Convention</hi> should refuse to treat, and <hi>Depose the King, it would act without a Legal Power,</hi> §. 8.

Well, but the next Heir, it seems, shall have small joy of it, <hi>his whole Authority depending on a Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that has no Authority:</hi> In good time! Will the Authority of this Prince, when acknowledged, depend on the Authority of the <hi>Convention?</hi> Did Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> or King <hi>Iames</hi> I owe all their Authority to the Parliaments which recognized their respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Rights? <hi>But no Man will think himself bound in Conscience to obey this Heir.</hi> Have you, Sir, the keeping of all Mens Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; or the knowledg of their Thoughts?

                  <p>§. 9. <hi>All those who think themselves bound</hi> [still] <hi>by their Oath of Allegiance to defend the King's Person, his Crown, and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>will be greatly discontented.</hi> Why Sir, then they may

Or are they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as weary of their Delivery as they were before of Popery? Or, will they sacrifice their <hi>Laws, Religion, old Foundations,</hi> and <hi>Free Parliaments</hi> to their Allegiance to their King?

                  <p>Well, but here <hi>Duty and Discontent will mix, because they are sensible of their Mistake when it is too late: For as they ought not to have fought for Popery, nor against the Laws and Liberties of their Country; so neither <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>What if</hi> the Princess of <hi>Orange</hi> be a Lady of that <hi>eminent Virtue</hi> that she should scruple to sit upon <hi>her Father's Throne</hi> whilst he lives? Well, his Majesty has deserted his Throne and Kingdom when he needed not, except he had pleased; and some Body must sit upon his Throne, though he is yet Alive: Now if it be her Right after his Death, why not now? Our Author is at his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that <hi>God would give her Grace to resist the Temptation</hi>; and I at mine, That the Author may never be one of her Chaplains till he is better inform'd. The rest of that Section is not unanswera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but not worth answering.</p>
                  <p>He has all along supposed the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> Crown'd, yet in the 19th Section he proves he can have no Right to it, neither by <hi>Descent</hi> nor <hi>Gift</hi>; and truly I am of the same mind for many Reasons, and especially for the sake of the Three alledged by him, <hi>Sect.</hi> 20, 21, 22. and for some others too of as great weight, which may be found <hi>in the Lord</hi> Virulam<hi>'s History of</hi> Henry VII. And yet our Case now before us has three Difficulties that had not, 1. A King living. 2. A Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> true or false. 3. A Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion divided in Religion; to which I might perhaps add the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive Power</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Excessive Zeal</hi> of this Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to preserve the Descent of the Crown in the Right Line, and in the Legal Steps and Degrees. And this being done, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded nothing can divide the <hi>English</hi> Nation, or lessen their Zeal and Affection to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who has deserved the Crown, if it were ours to give him.</p>
                  <p>The Postscript, which is an <hi>Huy and Cry</hi> after the <hi>French League to cut our Throats,</hi> I leave to the <hi>Convention</hi>: And if I durst be so bold as to ask a Favour of them, it should be to enquire what the <hi>Ro.

If therefore I have met with any Thing that I think worthy of your Consideration, I should think my self wanting in that Duty which I owe to my Country and Mankind, if I should not lay it before You.

                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:60825:136"/>
                     <hi>FIrst,</hi> 'Tis necessary to distinguish between <hi>Power</hi> it self, the <hi>Designation</hi> of the <hi>Persons Governing,</hi> and the <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. All Power is from God as the Fountain and Original.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Designation of the Persons, and the Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is eirther, First, immediately from God, as in the Case of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and the Government of the <hi>Ievs</hi>; or, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, from the Community, chusing some Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and subjecting themselves to it. But it must be noted, that though <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> had a Divine Designation, yet the People assembled; and in a General Assembly, by their Votes, freely chose them: Which proves, that there can be no order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or lasting Government, without Consent of the People Tacit or Express'd; and God himself would not put Men under a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor without their Consent. And in case of a Conquest, the People may be called <hi>Prisoners</hi> or <hi>Salves</hi> (which is a State con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Nature of Man) but they cannot be properly <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> till their Wills be brought to submit to the Government: So that Conquest may <hi>make Way</hi> for a Government, but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>constitute</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is a <hi>Supreme Power</hi> in every Community, essential to it, and inseparable from it; by which, if it be not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited immediately by God, it can form it self into any kind of Government. And in some extraordinary Occasions, when the Safety and Peace of the Publick necessarily require it, can supply the Defects, reform the Abuses, and re-establish the true Fundamentals of the Government; by Purging, Refining, and bringing Things back to their first Original: Which Power may be called, <hi>The Supreme Power Real.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When the Community has made choice of some Form of Government, and subjected themselves to it, having invested some Person or Persons with the <hi>Supreme Power:</hi> The Power in those Persons may be called, <hi>The Supreme Power Personal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If this Form be a mix'd Government of <hi>Monarchy, Aristocracy</hi> and <hi>Democracy</hi>; and, for the easy Execution of the Laws, the <hi>Executive Power</hi> be lodg'd in a <hi>single Person</hi>; He has, <hi>A Supreme Power Personal,</hi> quoad hoc.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:60825:136"/>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The <hi>Supreme Power Personal of</hi> England, is in Kings, Lords, and Commons; and so it was in Effect agreed to, by King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, in his Answer to the nineteen Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and resolved by the Convention of Lords and Commons in the Year 1660. And note, That the Acts of that Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tho never confirmed by Parliament, have been taken for Law, and particularly by the Lord Chief Justice <hi>Hales.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The <hi>Supreme Power Personal</hi> of <hi>England</hi> fails three Ways.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. 'Tis Dissolved: For two Essential Parts fail. 1. A King. 2. A House of Commons; which cannot be called according to the Constitution, the King being gone, and the Freedom of Election being destroyed by the King's Incroachments.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The King has forfeited his Power several Ways. Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> is the Subjection against which our Laws cry loudest: And even <hi>Barclay</hi> (that Monarchical Politician) acknowledges, That if a King alienate his Kingdom, or subject it to another, he forfeits it. And <hi>Grotius</hi> asserts, That if a King really attempt to deliver up, or subject his Kingdom, he may be therein resisted: And that, if the King have part of the <hi>Supreme Power,</hi> and the People or Senate the other part, (the King invading that part which is not his) a just Force may be opposed, and he may lose his Part of the Empire. <hi>Grotius de Bello,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Cap.</hi> 72. But that the King has <hi>subjected the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the Pope,</hi> needs no Proof; That the has <hi>usurp'd an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Power superior to all Laws,</hi> made the Peoples Share in the Legislative Power impertinent and useless, and thereby invaded their just Rights, none can deny. 'Twere in vain to multiply Instances of his Forfeitures: And, if we consider the Power exercis'd by him of late, it will most evidently appear to all who understand the <hi>English</hi> Constitution, that it admits of no such King, nor any such Power.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The King has deserted,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>(1.) By incapacitating himself by a Religion inconsistent with the Fundamentals of our Government.</item>
                     <item>(2.) By forsaking the Power: the Constitution allow'd him, and usurping a Foreign one: So that tho the Person remained, the King was gone long ago.</item>
                     <item>(3.) By Personal Withdrawing.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60825:137"/>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The <hi>Supreme Power Real</hi> remains in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity; and they may act by their Original Power: And tho every Particular Person is, notwithstanding such Dissolution, Forfeiture, or Desertion, subject to the Laws which were made by the <hi>Supreme Power Personal,</hi> when in Being; yet the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities Power is not bound by them, but is paramount all Laws made by the <hi>Supreme Power Personal:</hi> And has a full Right to take such Measures for Settling the Government, as they shall think most sure and effectual, for the lasting Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Peace of the Nation. For we must note, that it was the Community of <hi>England,</hi> which first gave Being to both King and Parliament, and to all the other Parts of our Constitution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eighthly,</hi> The <hi>most Renowned Politician</hi> observes, That those Kingdoms and Republicks subsist longest that are often renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or brought back to their first Beginnings; which is an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of Self-evident Truth, and implies, That the <hi>Supream Power Real</hi> has a Right to Renew, or bring back. And the most ingenious <hi>Lawson</hi> observes (in his <hi>Politica</hi>) That the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of <hi>England,</hi> in the late Times, had the greatest Advantage that they or their Ancestors had had for many Ages, for this purpose; tho God hid it from their Eyes: But the wonderful Concurrence of such a Series of Providences, as we now see and admire, gives ground to hope; That the Veil is removed, and the Nation will now see the Things that concern their Peace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ninthly,</hi> The Acts done and executed by the <hi>Supreme Power Personal</hi> (when in Being) have so model'd the Parts and Persons of the Community, that the Original Constitution is the best, justest, and the most desirable. The <hi>Royal Family</hi> affords a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that both Heaven and Earth point out for King. There are Lords, whose Nobility is not affected by the Dissolution of the Government, and are the subject Matter of a House of Lords; And there are Places, which by Custom or Charter have Right to choose Representatives of the Commons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tenthly,</hi> There are are inextricable Difficulties in all other Methods. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is no Demise of the King, neither Civil nor Natural.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is consequently no Descent.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Community only has a Right to take Advantage of the King's Forfeiture or Desertion.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:60825:137"/>4. Whatever other Power may be imagin'd in the two Houses, as Houses of Parliament, it cannot justify it self to the Reason of any, who understand the Bottom of our Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. By this Method all <hi>Popish Successors</hi> may be excluded; and the Government secured, in case all the <hi>Protestants</hi> of the Family die without Issue: And this by the very Constitution of <hi>England.</hi> And the Question can never arise about the Force or the Lawfulness of a Bill of Exclusion.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Convention will not be oblig'd to take Oaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> If these things be granted, and the Community be at Liberty to act as above; it will certainly be most advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable, not only for the Security and Welfare of the Nation, but (if rightly understood) for the Interest of their Royal Highnesses, to limit the Crown as follows: — To the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> during his Life (yet with all possible Honour and Respect to the Princess, whose Interests and Inclinations are inseparably the same with his) Remainder to the Princess of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the Heirs of her Body; Remainder to the Princess of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and the Heirs of her Body; Remainder to the Heirs of the Body of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>; Remainder as an Act of Parliament shall appoint.</p>
                  <p>This will have these Conveniences among others.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Husband and Wife are but one Person in Law, and her Husband's Honour is hers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It puts the present Kingly Power into the best Hand in the World; which (wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>out Flattery) is agreed on by all Men.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. It will be some Acknowledgment to the Prince for what he has done for the Nation: And it is worthy Observation, that before the <hi>Theocracy</hi> of the <hi>Iews</hi> ceased, the manner of the Divine Designation of their Judges, was by God's giving the People some Deliverance by the Hand of the Person, to whose Government they ought to submit; and this even in that time of extraordinary Revelations. Thus <hi>Othniel, Gideon, Iephthah, Samson,</hi> and others were invested by Heaven with the Supreme Authority: And though <hi>Ioshua</hi> had an immediate Command from God to succeed <hi>Moses,</hi> and an Anointing to that purpose, by the laying on of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Hands: Yet the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60825:138"/>
Foundation of the People's Submission to him was laid in <hi>Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan.</hi> And I challenge the best Historians to give an Instance (since that <hi>Theocracy</hi> ceased) of a Designation of any Person to any Government, more visibly Divine than that which we now admire. If the Hand of Providence (miraculously and timely disposing Natural Things, in every Circumstance to the best advantage) should have any Influence upon Mens Minds; most certainly we ought not here to be insensible. If <hi>the Voice of the People be the Voice of God,</hi> it never spoke louder: If a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of various Opinions, Interests and Factions, from a turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and fluctuating State, falls into a serene and quiet Calm, and Mens Minds are strangely united on a sudden; it shews from whence they are influenced. In a word, if the Hand of God is to be seen in Human Affairs, and his Voice to be heard upon Earth; we cannot any where (since the ceasing of Miracles) find a clearer and more remarkable Instance, than is to be observ'd in the present Revolution. If one examines the Posture of Foreign Affairs, making way for the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Expedition by some sudden Events and Occurrences, which no Human Wisdom or Power could have brought about; if one observes that Divine Influence which has directed all his Counsels, and crown'd his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, notwithstanding such innumerable Dangers and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, with constant Honour and Success: If one considers how happily and wonderfully both Persons and Things are changed in a little time, and without Blood: It looks like so many Marks of God's Favour, by which he thinks fit to point him out to us in this extraordinary Conjuncture.</p>
                  <p>I will trouble you but with one Consideration more; which is, That the two things most necessary in this Affair, are Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity and Dispatch: For without both these of your Counsels will have little Effect. In most things 'tis good to be long in resolving; but in some 'tis fatal not to conclude immediately: And presence of Mind is as great a Vertte, as Rashness is a Vice. For the turns of Fortune are sometimes so quick, that if Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage be not taken in the critical hour, 'tis for ever lost. But, I hope, your Lordships, and all those Gentlemen who compose this August Assembly, will proceed with so much Zeal and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that the Result of your present Consultations may be a lasting and grateful Monument to Posterity, of your Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, Courage and Conduct.</p>

                  <head>SEVERAL QUERIES Relating to the present Proceedings in Parliament; More especially recommended to the Consideration of the BISHOPS.</head>
                  <p n="1">I. HOW the House of Commons can answer it to those People whom they Represent, if now they have an Opportunity, they do not settle the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment upon such a Foundation as will be likely, not only to preserve the Nation from Foreign Enemies, but also from falling into the like unhappy Circumstances which it is but just now escaped out of, and which in a great measure have proceeded from a want of a right Settlement of Publick Affairs at the Restauration of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Whether this can be done without altering the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, since the Birth of the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> is not proved sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posititious, (though perhaps no Body doubts but it is so)? And supposing it proved so, Whether it would not be more feasible to make a President now, than to try the Experiment first, when the next Right of Succession is claimed by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi>; or perhaps some Prince her Heir, too strong to resist without the Assistance of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60825:139"/>
if there happen to be such Divisions amongst Us as are at this Time?</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Whether it can be immagined to be worth the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s while to leave <hi>Holland,</hi> where he is the chief Man, and become a Subject in <hi>England</hi>; nay, and have such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Interest in his stay here, that if his Wives Life chance to drop, perhaps he may be banished in a Years time, and not have a Place, as things may happen, to put his Head in? For his Interest in <hi>Holland</hi> must necessarily fall into other Hands; And no Body knows what fallings out may happen betwixt Us and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> or what other Contingencies may happen that may give cause of Disgust.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Whether (considering the present State of Affairs) the Strength of the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Irish</hi> Rebellion, (to say nothing of the Effects which the Entreaties, and subtile In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuations of a Father must necessarily have upon any one that is good natur'd) it be safe to trust the Administration of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs to a Woman, though never so vertuous? And whether we shall be able to protect our selves against all these formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Enemies, and bring things to a due Settlement, without the Assistance of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> whose Foreign Allian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are such as we can never hope to obtain if we confer the Crown upon any other?</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Whether it would be a greater real Kindness to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of <hi>Orange</hi> to make her sole Queen, after such a manner as she will be likely to be turned out again; or to make her and her Husband joint King and Queen during their two Lives? I say, her Husband, who is a Prince, not only able to defend her and her Kingdom from all the Dangers that may happen, but also to take all the Trouble which may occur in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of Affairs off her Hands, so that she will enjoy all the Pleasure of being Queen without any thing of Trouble: And we may add to this, that if it had not been for him, she had never enjoyed the Crown, nor the Nation their Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:60825:139"/>VI. Whether the Terms the Parliament shall make with one that can pretend no Right to the Crown but what they give him, will not be more likely to be kept by him, than by one that pretends a Title, and will be flatter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d up, both by Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers and Divines, (I mean, the Scum of them) with Notions of a Right <hi>jure Divino,</hi> and a Prerogative which cannot be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with or abolish'd, though by the King's Consent, or Act of Parliament?</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. Whether the House of Commons, upon these Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and divers others too long to mention, will not think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that the Prince and Princess of <hi>Orange</hi> be crowned King and Queen for their two Lives? And whether it can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that the Commons should so far betray their Country as to recede from this Point (so necessary for its Preservation) notwithstanding all the Disturbances which the Bishops shall make in the House of Lords, and though they do not meet with the Concurrence of that House so soon as in reason might be expected?</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. Whether the House of Lords will suffer themselves any longer to be imposed upon by the Bishops in a thing that will be so injurious to the Nation, as it will be not to comply with the House of Commons in this great Point; which must necessarily put such a damp upon Trade, that it will certainly be the Ruin of many hundreds of Families in the Nation whose dependance are upon Handy-Craft-Trades, to say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Disadvantages which may accrue by such a Delay to the poor Protestants in <hi>Ireland?</hi> and admitting they should, whether the Circumstances of Affairs would not in a little time force them to a compliance with the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons?</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. Whether the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> will not shew himself one of the unkindest Men in the World if he doth not stick by these People, till he seeth them secured, that have ventured their Lives and Fortunes for Him and their Country in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of his Protection? and whether he as Head of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60825:140"/>
Protestant Religion, be not obliged to stand by the 48 Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Lords, and House of Commons, that have served their Country so faithfully?</p>
                  <p n="10">X. Whether it would not be Prudence in the Bishops (supposing their Designs be good, as I would hope they are) to shew their readiness to assist the Nobility and Gentry in carrying on this great Work, whereby they might settle the Church upon the surest Foundation, the Laws of God and of the Land, and continue themselves in the Affections of the People?</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. Whether all the Protestant Blood which shall be spilt in <hi>Ireland</hi> by reason of these long Delays, will not be justly laid at the Bishops doors, if they proceed after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they have begun?</p>
                  <p>And lastly, To answer the great Objection, that we shall lose the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> if we make the King Elective for this Turn.</p>
                  <p>Whether the <hi>Scots</hi> can chuse any body that will be more agreeable to their Interests than the Prince of <hi>Orange?</hi> and supposing they can, Whether it be not madness to imagine, since they have a different Parliament, different Laws, and a different Original Contract (so that the King may commit a Forfeiture there, when he hath committed none here, or a Forfeiture here, when he hath committed none there) that they will not place the Crown upon him without any respect to what is done here, whether we make it a Forfeiture, or only a bare Demise?</p>

                  <p>IF Necessity, which is a great Branch of the Law of Nature, did not press us at this time, to come to some speedy and pertinent Determinations, as to the business, especially, of settling the Government, that Nicety, which seems to be promoted and set afoot in all our Counsels, might, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Weightiness of the business in hand, rather claim the just Commendation and Applauses of every good Man, than, as it seems now, fall under their Censure; and I may say Indignation. If the matter debated were extraneous, and the Kingdom within it self peaceably and firmly settled; if the Circumstances of our Affairs were ordinary and usual, and could admit of an unlimited time for their Decision; if we were secure from injurious Resolutions of our Enemies abroad, or from the private Machinations of disaffected Persons at home: If these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ace and Settlement of them for the future; I say, it were then worthy the Wisdom of these Men to dissect every particular of so important an Affair, before they made any Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the General. As we all acknowledg the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Circumstances of this Juncture, so they themselves have not been a little contributing to this happy Revolution: The Prince's first Declaration tells us, he had the Invitation of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal. Was it Justice and agreeable to Conscience then, to call for Foreign Arms to assist
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60825:141"/>
us against our own King, in the recovery of those Rights, Liberties and Properties, which, contrary to Law, he had invaded and taken from us? And is it now become a Scruple in those same Consciences, to be confirm'd in those Rights, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the same Arms and Power? Is that pretended, absolute, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Power, which in their Prayers and Sermons they have so often nibbled at, and endavoured to retrench, now in its <hi>just Debasement</hi> become so Inviolable and Sacred, that it must become a Point of Faith entirely to submit to it? Has this small fit of Fear and Discouragement in our implacable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, so well secur'd us from any future Enchroachments, that we need not be careful of any further Assurance? Has these Men's Re-embellish'd Honours so obliterated the Memory of the Dangers some of them so lately have escap'd, and the rest justly fear'd, as to free them from all Apprehensions for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? What is it these Gentlemen would be at? what do they fear? Is it without Reason, without Justice, without Precedent, that we desire to be everlastingly secur'd from <hi>Popery</hi> &amp; <hi>Slavery?</hi> Not without Reason; for when we have seen many of our fairest Branches lopp'd off, many of our Liberties invaded, many of our Laws perverted, and the Axe at last laid to the Root of our Government, 'tis high time then, I say, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for our our Safety, and to put a stop to that Current which would have quickly over-run and drowned us: Not without Justice, for where my Life and Property is hunted after, and assaulted, I may, by the Law of God and Man, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>epel the Injury, and stand in my own Vindication: Not without Precedent, even in Protestant Kingdoms, (not to mention the Romanists, who both teach and practise the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of evil and wicked Magistrates) and though in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> we may perhaps think the Changes we have very lately seen among our selves admit of no Precedent, it may easily be prov'd that which hath been done of late in this Nation, hath been in great part formerly presented and <hi>allowed</hi> of upon Foreign Stages; yea, and not many Years out of the Memory of some yet living, if we would but look into the Actions of other Regions, and those too wherein the Reform'd Religion is professed, we shall find that they, by their publick Records, acknowledged that in case of Tyranny and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, it was lawful not only to defend their Lives and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60825:141"/>
Liberties against all Assaults, but reduce and declare the Persons so offending, incapable of holding the Government.</p>
                  <p>A lively Example of this, and almost exactly parallel with ours, was the Case of <hi>Sigismond</hi> the Third, Hereditary King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who by a Convention of the States of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, was Excluded, even with his Heirs, (a Severity, which both the Honourable Houses of Parliament here have, with great Justice and Wisdom, declined) from that Crown for ever: Some of the Articles drawn up against him were these; First, For swerving from their received Christian Religion; as also, from his Oath and Promise, and Solemn Engagement made to his People at his Coronation, to preserve their Rights and Priviledges; as also, their Holy Reform'd Religion Invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated; For departing the Country without the Consent, and unwilling to the States and Orders of the Realm; For export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing several Acts of great Concernment out of the Cancellarie; For prosecuting such as would not embrace or favour the Romish Superstition; For contemning, and endeavouring to undermine and annul those laudable Institutions and Laws made for the Security of the Realm, and the Establishment of the Protestant Reformed Religion; For raising up what Enemies he could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Native Country, thereby to involve his Subjects in a Deluge of Blood, which he intended, and had almost effected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For inhumanely designing and suborning Russians and Villains, to Murder and Assassinate one of the chief Nobles, for no other Reason, but that out of Conscience and Duty, he would have perswaded him from those Irregularities and notorious Breaches of the known Laws of the Land. For these, and many more Causes, as <hi>the sending his Son out of the Land,</hi> without the Consent of the States, and causing him to be brought up and educated in the Romish Superstition, did the <hi>Swedes</hi> (submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the same to the Judgment of all sincere and candid Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tratours) justify their Abdication for ever, of King <hi>Sigismond</hi> the Third, and his Heirs, from the Crown of <hi>Sweden,</hi> &amp;c. and proceeded strait to the Constituting and Electing of <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Sudermannia; vid.</hi> Spanheim <hi>'s Hist. of</hi> Sweden, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in conclusion, they pray for, and doubt not of a candid Construction, a benign and favourable Acceptation, from all Christian Emperors, Kings, Princes, States, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of this their Legitimate Defence, and to vindicate them and their most

                     </gap>il Interpretation whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. The Circumstances relating to this present Juncture in <hi>England,</hi> bear so near a resemblance almost in all these Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances objected against the said <hi>Sigismond,</hi> that our late King, by a sort of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, seems to have breath'd his Soul, rather than to have copy'd after him, though indeed in some Cases he has plainly out-done the Original, especially in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his supposed Son. And as our King thought fit to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py a King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> I cannot apprehend how it can lessen our Judgments or Integrity, our Piety, or our Loyalty, to follow the Example of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> excepting in the case of the Lawful Heirs (whom every good Englishman and Protestant, to their utmost Danger and Peril, are ready to defend and maintain) to take such Measures for our future Security, and lawful Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment, as shall not by any Humane Art or Endeavour, be liable to Interruption.</p>
                  <p>But as Precedents are least satisfactory, or least confronting to obstinate Opposers; where they make only for one party: A Popish <hi>Sigismund</hi> deposed for Male-Administration in a Protestant Kingdom, may not perhaps be allowed to carry its sufficient Justification with the <hi>Romanists</hi>; and therefore the Tables ought to be turn'd, and the Ballance made by Parallels of their own side; the most prudent way of combating, and securing a Victory in this matter, being to lay the Scene of War in the Enemies Country.</p>
                  <p>To confute therefore, and silence all the Romish Pretensions of Disgust and Murmur, against the Injustice of such a Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, from Examples of Popish Deposals of Male-admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string Protestants; we'll begin with <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Navarre,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of <hi>France.</hi>

                  <p>Let it suffice, here was a Prince, the unquestion'd Inheritor of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> actually by all Open and Hostile Means (and all such Hostility avowed and abetted, and his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60825:142"/>
very Birth-right fore-closed by the Pope himself) opposed and denied his Accession to the Throne, for no other Unquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, but be a <hi>Hugonot</hi>; that is, of a Perswasion contrary to the Establish'd, and Regnant Romish Religion in <hi>France</hi>; being in all other Respects acknowledged a most excellent Prince: Insomuch, that after all other ineffectual Endeavours of recovering his Birth-right; he had no means left to repeal his Exclusion and Debarment from the Throne, but by his Abjuration of the Reformed Religion, and return to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Worship.</p>
                  <p>This Case of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, instead of a Parallel to ours, does not come up to half the Justification of the present Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of <hi>England.</hi> For here was a Soveraign Prince under De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation, for no other Default, but his meer Religion: for this <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth being then but in his Entrance to the Empire (if truly that) was consequently yet at least (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they might fear) under no <hi>Dilemmas</hi> of the least breach of Compact with his People, no Forfeitures for Male-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration, or Violation of the Laws of the Land, or Rights of his Subjects; their Dangers as then being only Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. If therefore the meer private Opinion of a Crowned Head, different from the Establish'd Religion of the Land, has been of weight enough (it self alone) in their own Scales to oversway the Birth-Right of Princes, and make a Bar to Empire; and that too, so solemnly confirmed and ratified, even by the Sanction Apostolick, the Decretals of <hi>Rome</hi> it self: What Objections or Allegations can our <hi>Romish</hi> Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, whether Foreign or Domestick, make against the like Bar in Empire, after so notorious an actual Male-Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the present Case of <hi>England,</hi> such too visible Ruptures of the Laws of the Land, and in defiance of all Obligations of Engagements, Covenant, Word, Honour, or OATHS themselves?</p>
                  <p>The next Example I shall point them to, is, that of the late <hi>Portuguese</hi> King, who by the Ordinance of the States of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> ratified by the Pope's Assent, was dethroned, and his Brother invested with the Soveraignty; and not only that, but his Queen too taken from him, Divorced, and by a Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion married to his Brother.

                  <p>I recite this unjust Deposal of a Lawful Queen, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Authority of the Pope, no other, than to let the World know, that the Romish Party have the least Reason in Nature, to complain of the Deprivation of Princes. They, whose Infallible Guides can so insolently and arbitrarily place or displace Crown'd Heads (not to mention the Illegality of the Pope's Interposition, in the Affair in any kind) for only

acting by <hi>Law,</hi> in Matters of Religious Changes, for such were all Ecclesiastick Alterations of that Queen, by the unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion'd Authority of Acts of Parliament; can be but ill fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd with Arguments, against the present Deprivation, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by the whole Community of <hi>England,</hi> for such violent Measures and Foundations, already form'd and begun, for the subversion of Church and State against all Law.</p>

                  <head>Reasons humbly offer'd, for placing his Highness the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> singly in the Throne during his Life.</head>
                  <p n="1">I. IT will be a clear Assertion of the Peoples Right, Firm Evidence of a Contract Broken, and a sure Precedent to all Ages, when, after a most Solemn Debate, the Estates of <hi>England</hi> Declare, That the King having <hi>Abdicated</hi> the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and the <hi>Throne</hi> thereby Legally Vacant, They think fit to Fill it again with One who is not Immediate in the Line.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. It will be a Caution to Succeeding Kings, of what Fatal Consequence a general Derogation from the Laws may be, when they find, by this Instance, the Exercise of the Kingly Office in Danger, not only with Reference to Themselves, but Precarious to their Family by the Misgovernment. And Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations to come shall praise our Conduct, when reading the History of this Day, it appears we understood our Case; had Honour and Honesty to maintain it, and Wisdom enough to transmit it Perfect to our Posterity.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. It will be the highest Obligation upon the Two <hi>Princesses</hi> that can be expected from a sensible People; when, next to As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting our own Right, by a Fact (which is absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and above all other humane Arguments) they see themselves of Inestimable Value with Us, by Recontinuing the Line in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder; And that their own strict Adherence to the <hi>Protestant
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60825:144"/>
Religion</hi> and <hi>Interest,</hi> out-weighs the Demerits of their Unhappy Father.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. The <hi>Princess of Orange</hi> will share in all the Glory of a Crown, without the Trouble of it: Easy from <hi>Popish</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, That <hi>She sits in her Father's Throne while he lives.</hi> And it concerns the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as well as the <hi>Princess,</hi> to take care, That She be at Rest from those Sollicitations on the Behalf of <hi>Papists,</hi> which, under the Countenance of Her Father will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually assault Her tender Breast. Nor is there any room for the <hi>Princess of Denmark</hi> to think Her self Neglected; The Exchange being attended with many Advantages, such as it would be lost Time to repeat, they are so very Obvious, and likewise too many for the Compass of this Paper.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. If the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> be not <hi>King</hi> in His own Right, His Interest cannot be intirely Ours; For though His Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try be an Assurance of Sincerity to Us; yet, if there remain any Probability of His Returning to <hi>Holland,</hi> as upon the Death of His Wife, if She only be Sovereign, his Interest must be divided: Nor will it, according to the Art of Government, become the Prudence of any Nation to open the Secrets of their Policy to One, whom they may be so Unfortunate as to part with into a Country that may possibly interfere with Us.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. It is dangerous to the <hi>Government</hi> it self to vest the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> in Both, for they may differ in Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of things: and if there be a possibility of Division, it would be an unancountable Weakness, and great Oversight, not to secure our selves in so Important a Point.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. It is Repugnant to grant the <hi>Crown</hi> to Both, and fix the Administration in One; For the Administration is an Incident Inseparable from the <hi>Sovereignty.</hi> To be a <hi>King,</hi> or <hi>Queen,</hi> and not to have the Exercise of <hi>King,</hi> or <hi>Queen,</hi> is a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: a Departure from all the Rules that were ever laid down in Government, unless in case of Personal Incapacity, and therefore below a Masculine way of Reasoning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly.</hi> It supports the noble Maxim, <hi>That a neighbouring Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may take Arms to assist the Rescue of a People oppressed by Tyranny.</hi> And Foreign Princes will be apt to look into them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, when they hear, by our Example of Gratitude, That they are no longer Safe, than Just to their Subjects.</p>

                  <p>WHereas we cannot but be made very apprehensive by those several efficacious Papers, such as Dr. <hi>B</hi>'s, Mr. <hi>F</hi>'s, <hi>A Word to the Wise</hi>; and another as close, <hi>Four Questions Debated,</hi> and the like; which go about, left the swaying part of the Nation should be so much intent upon One Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We therefore judg it meet, That this ensuing Paper, which was in a few Copies given to some Members of the Houses, for preventing that Evil, should also be made publick, to go abroad with such Papers as those of the former Nature. For, as it is wise in a People when they make any Compact, whether with their Rulers, or others, that though they believe the Party they deal with to be the best in the World, to treat with him for all that, and be as punctual upon the Terms to make all secure, as if they were dealing with the worst: So it is also honest for them, in seeking the Good of their Country, to deny Self-interest, and to prefer the benefiting a Nation, before the magnifying any single Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whatsoever.</p>

                  <head>The BREVIATE.</head>
                  <p>THE People of this Nation are by Birth a Free People, who are born to a Liberty of Person and Propriety in their Goods and Lands; and therefore <hi>England</hi> is rightly call'd a <hi>Free State.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To understand the Government, we must know that these two Things are always to be distinguished, the <hi>Constitution,</hi> and the <hi>Administration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Constitution</hi> of a Government does lie in the Original Agreement of the People, which they make between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or with their intended Governour, or Governours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Government be set up, whether there be none before, or the Former at an end.</p>
                  <p>When the People are in such a State, while there is no Order of Superiority, or Inferiority introduced, it is called a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity:</hi> When a Ruler is chose, so that there is a Ruling and Ruled Part, it is a Society, or called a <hi>Common-Wealth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us suppose a Company of Families, that having no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on one another, nor any one having Power over the other, yet living near each other, do find it convenient to join together in a Society, for mutual Defence against some Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Enemy, or for the reaping several Advantages which they shall receive by it. The Heads or Representatives of these Families assembled, are to consider what is to be done in order to these Ends.</p>
                  <p>Three Things more especially they must consult upon;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What Government (as to the Sort or Kind) is best for them?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Who shall be Governour or Governours?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And by what Laws or Rules they shall govern, who are entrusted with the Supreme Power?</p>
                  <p>And more particularly, in relation to what Measure of it they will allow them to have over their Persons and Estates, to use them as they have Occasion, for the Publick Good. For when they are yet free in both, the Governour can have Power so far, but no farther than they at first consent. Whatsoever
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60825:145"/>
Reservations of Liberty the People make in their Agreement, these are to be look'd upon as their Rights by the Laws of the Constitution, and essential thereunto, and consequently invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable by any of these Governours whom they set up for the Administration; the very Laws of the Administration being void, so far as they interfere with any of these of the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
                  <p>The Constitution and Laws thereof being agreed upon, and it being impossible for Humane Prudence to foresee all Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, which must be provided for; therefore as they arise, the Administration necessarily must lie in these two Things: The making farther Laws (subordinate still to those fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd) as occasion requires, and seeing them executed, that is, in Legislation and Judgment. The One is the Business of the Supreme Authority; the Other of the Inferior Magistrates or Officers, and Executioners of the same, according to that Fundamental Agreement made by the People.</p>
                  <p>Our Government now, as constituted in order to this Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration, is, we know, a mixt Government. A Government is known to be pure or mixt, by the placing the Supreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. If the People place it singly in the King, or singly in the Nobles, or singly in the People, then it is a pure Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, Aristocracy, or Democracy: But when it is placed in all Three, it is a mixt Government, as Ours is, where there are no Laws in the Administration made but by King, Lords, and Commons.</p>
                  <p>These Things I pursue only so far as is necessary, to the reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my main Purpose; and the leading me to a right discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the present Condition into which we are now brought in regard to this said Government.</p>
                  <p>The Supreme Power of the Nation being placed in a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is a Corporation of King, Lords, and Commons, that is, the Supreme Authority residing in King, Lords and Commons, as One Corporation, there does appear, at this Conjuncture, a Dissolution of the Government; A Dissolution manifestly, as to the Exercise of it. This Appearance does arise from the opening of the last Scene. For the King being now gone, gone from his People, and departing from his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that One Corporation (we speak of) is broke; so that there remains now no subject for that supreme Authority;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60825:146"/>
It being evident, that a Parliament, wherein an Essential point of our Constitution does consist, cannot now be Assembled: And the Providence of <hi>God</hi> it self hath extraordinarily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd our Case. If a King dies, he hath a Successor, and the Right devolves upon Him; but whilst the King lives, he hath no Successor, and the Right remaining in Him and no Other; and he being divided from his Lords and Commons, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Supreme Power, or this One Corporation (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the King is a Chief, Essential, and Constituent Part) does perfectly cease, and must necessarily cause a Dissolution.</p>
                  <p>I choose not to found this upon what does more convince Others, which comes to this Account: The King, by his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Malversation in the Government, and rooted Design of subverting our Religious and Civil Rights, for the Introduction of Arbitrary Power and Popery, which being aggravated by such an Endeavour, as the destroying that Share in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which every Commoner hath, that hath Right to choose his Representative in Parliament, by his Garbling Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, and so evacuating this Liberty in effect; and by such an endeavour also, as the exterminating his Protestant Subjects; seeing that Religion which he would have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, is such, as by the Principles of it, if it comes into Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, must do so to all Hereticks; and thereupon may he be look'd on no longer as <hi>Rex,</hi> but <hi>Hostis,</hi> and <hi>Hostis Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus:</hi> Besides, the subjecting us to a Foreign Jurisdiction, and the very changing the Government, by that indefinite Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Power over the Laws, as was carved to him by his Judges, from Regal to Despotical: It is judged by them, that he is fallen thereupon from his Royal Dignity; and that the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality thereby have Warrant not only to defend themselves against him, but by Vertue of that Sanction, which is tacitly implyed in the Laws of the Constitution, to proceed on to take the Forfeiture He hath made of his Government, and Depose Him: For it is a fond thing, (think they) to imagine any Laws without a Sanction; and impossible there should be any other Sanction in Treaties between Free Nations, or between a Free People, and the Governour they set over Themselves, than Force to be used by the Parties concern'd; there being no Third Party on Earth to appeal to, in such Cases.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:60825:146"/>However this be, it being taken for granted, That the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is dissolved, and I suppose upon that preceding Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, of the One Corporation (I say) being broke, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority that lay before in the Three as united in One, does escheat, or fall to the Community; who must therefore choose a new Subject for that Power; and it lies at their Discretion to place it in what Subject they please: They may lodg it in the Lords and Commons alone, without a King, if they think that Government best; the matter lies altogether upon their Agreement, and Consent. I suppose it most likely, that they will agree to place it again in a Monarch, Lords and Commons (the Person only left at Choice, and Care had to prevent all Danger of Law in the Case) according to the Ancient Constitution; Though what Man can know the Mind of a Nation, when once come together, if he knows his own Mind?</p>
                  <p>There is one thing we have now Opportunity to obtain, which we can never recover again, if it be lost; and that is, what His Highness the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> hath made one of his two Designs, <hi>The Delivery of the People from Slavery</hi>; which can never be done effectually, and radically, but upon this <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</hi> The delivering us from <hi>Popery,</hi> is contained in the setling our Religion; and that being a Work of great length, is the business more properly of a Parliament; but this is a thing must be done by the Community, and consequently by thofe that are the Representatives of it, a <hi>Convention,</hi> so called (in regard to a higher Capacity hereunto) and not a <hi>Parliament</hi>; for that represents the People, not as in a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity,</hi> but as in a <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> where there is <hi>pars imperans,</hi> as well as <hi>subdita,</hi> which now is not. A <hi>Parliament</hi> makes Laws for the <hi>Administration,</hi> but the <hi>People</hi> as in a <hi>Community</hi> make Laws for the <hi>Constitution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I would therefore humbly offer it to the Consideration of those, who shall meet as Members of this <hi>Convention,</hi> That, in order to the Effect premised, they do but agree and pitch upon this one certain Point of <hi>good Policy,</hi> that where they place the <hi>Supream Authority,</hi> they lay also the <hi>Rights</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties</hi> of it; that is, the <hi>Iura Majestatis (Majestas</hi> being <hi>Maxima Potestas</hi>) all together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:60825:147"/>The Rights of <hi>Majesty,</hi> or the <hi>Supream Power,</hi> are mainly these: The first is <hi>Legislation,</hi> or making Laws; and this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly lies in a Parliament. The next, is the Power of raising <hi>Arms,</hi> or Armies, or the <hi>Militia,</hi> the Power of making Peace and War, or the Power of the Sword, which is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to maintain those Laws. The third is a Power over our Estates, or the Purse, or raising Mony, which must maintain the Sword. A fourth, is the Power of <hi>choosing Magistrates</hi> to rule Us according to these Laws; such as Judges and Sheriffs, to name no other. A fifth, is the <hi>last Appeal.</hi> Now let but the Power of the <hi>Militia</hi> and <hi>choosing Magistrates,</hi> be laid where <hi>Legislation</hi> is, and we shall be fundamentally delivered from all <hi>Slavery</hi> for ever in the Nation.</p>
                  <p>If we be <hi>enslaved</hi> or oppressed by any <hi>Prince</hi> for the time to come, it must be either by <hi>Force</hi> or by <hi>Injustice.</hi> We cannot be oppressed by <hi>Force,</hi> because no Forces then can be raised by Him, but by a Parliament. He cannot rule by an <hi>Army,</hi> or by Violence; for the <hi>Militia</hi> is in the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> as well as in Him, and they will not let him do so: We cannot be oppressed with <hi>Injustice</hi>; for the <hi>Iudges</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> entrusted with the Execution of <hi>Iustice,</hi> shall be chosen also by them, and they will look to that.</p>
                  <p>It is true, while no Parliament sits, the King by Virtue of the Executive Power lying in him, may raise Arms, and put in Officers and Magistrates as there i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> need; but both these are to be done under the Controul of the next Parliament (which are therefore to sit often by ancient Statutes) there being no War to be levied, nor Magistrates confirmed, without their Approbation.</p>
                  <p>Let us remember the State we are in, a State that puts the <hi>Supream Power</hi> in the Hands of the People, to place it as they will: and therefore to bound and limit it as they see fit for the publick Utility; and if they do it not now, the Ages to come will have occasion to blame them for ever. When the Supream Power is upon the disposing, if they do not take this <hi>Item,</hi> as part of their proper Work, <hi>To bind the Descent of it to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant,</hi> I shall blame them: But I shall do so much more, if after the Danger we have been in, of Arbitrary <hi>Domination</hi> and <hi>Popery,</hi> by the King's raising Arms, and putting Judges in and out at his Pleasure, they do not take more care of the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60825:147"/>
Supream Power, to lay it and its Rights better together: Especially, seeing nothing can indeed be that in Nature, which it is, without its Properties. This is uniform (I must persist) to the Nature of Government; that where the Supream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is, there must be its <hi>Prerogatives</hi>; and where the chief or principal <hi>Rights</hi> of it is, there should all the rest which depend upon, and belong to it, be placed also: Where <hi>Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is lodged, there should the <hi>Militia,</hi> there should the Power of making Judges, to name nothing more than serves my turn, be lodged also. It is this hath been the great Declension, Fault, or Defect of our English Common-Wealth, that the People have suffered these Rights of Soveraignty, to come to be divided, arising (we must conceive) from the <hi>Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,</hi> that is, <hi>Male-Administration,</hi> as appears, for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, in the <hi>Militia,</hi> which upon the fresh coming in of the late King, was in two or three hot <hi>Acts,</hi> declared now and ever to have been in the King; when both the Assertion was gross Flattery, and such Acts void, as fundamentally repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the <hi>Constitution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is one <hi>Difficulty</hi> to be thought on, and that is, the <hi>Negative Voice</hi> of the <hi>Prince</hi> in his <hi>Parliament.</hi> The <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> may agree upon some Law for the publick Benefit, and the King alone may refuse to pass it. If he be obstinate, this is a great Evil, and might really make one think, it would be better therefore (for the preventing this Inconv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But forasmuch as these <hi>Prerogatives</hi> may be disputed, and the <hi>Negative Voice</hi> hath been deny'd by many Judicious Men, who have pleaded the Obligation of former Princes to confirm those Laws, <hi>quas vulgus elegerit</hi>; it is to be hoped that the Wisdom of the Nation will be able to find out some Expedient or Salve for this Difficulty, and for more than that also; so long as they have the <hi>Golden Opportunity,</hi> to bring a <hi>Crown</hi> in one Hand, with their <hi>Terms</hi> or <hi>Conditions</hi> in the other.</p>
                  <p>As for the several Grievances that need Redress, and many good Things that are wanting to compleat the Happiness of

our Kingdom; there may be some Foundation laid happily, or Preparations made in order thereunto by this <hi>Convention</hi>; but as belonging to the <hi>Administration,</hi> and being Matters of long Debate, they are the Work more properly of an ensuing Parliament. Only let not the Members of this present <hi>Great Assembly</hi> forget, that they having so unlimited a Power, and the Nation such an Opportunity, which, as the <hi>Secular Games,</hi> they are never like to see but once, they are more strictly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bound in <hi>Conscience,</hi> and in Duty to their <hi>Country,</hi> to neglect no kind of thing, which they judg absolutely necessary to the publick Good. I care not if I commend three or four such Particulars against the time to Consultation, which shall be these: A Regulation of <hi>Westminster-Hall:</hi> A Provision a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst buying or selling of Offices: A Register of <hi>Estates:</hi> A Freedom from <hi>Persecution</hi> (by a Bill for <hi>Comprehension</hi> and <hi>Indulgence</hi>) in the business of Religion: A Redemption of the <hi>Chimny Mony,</hi> which bringing the King to be Lord of every Man's House, is against <hi>Property</hi>; and an <hi>over-Ballance</hi> in the <hi>Revenue,</hi> is against the <hi>Interest</hi> of the <hi>Nation.</hi>
                  </p>

If the Being of them be inconsistent one with another, there is no doubt, but it is better that a King cease, than that a <hi>whole Nation should perish.</hi> And upon such a Supposition as this, all Obligation as to Duty must cease likewise. There are some tacit Conditions in all Oaths, as the best <hi>Casuists</hi> tell us (such as <hi>Rebus sic stantibus,</hi> for one) that we must steer our <hi>Consciences</hi> by in these Cases; <hi>He is the Minister of God for our Good,</hi> says the Scripture: And if any

If they obey him longer, it is for <hi>Wrath,</hi> not for <hi>Conscience sake.</hi> If his Majesty now of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> out of some deep Sense, that he, being a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rule, and be true to his <hi>Religion,</hi> (which he may suppose does oblige him to an Establishment thereof by all the ways and means of his Church, though never so destructive to ours (but it will be to the Hurt, not Good of us who are <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi>) hath been pleased to withdraw himself from his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to make us more quiet and happy; We are in all Gratitude to acknowledg his <hi>Piety, Goodness,</hi> and <hi>Condescention</hi> to be so much, as very few of his Subjects could ever have suspected: But if it be out of another Mind he hath done it, We have still more Reason to bless <hi>Almighty God,</hi> who does often serve his <hi>Providence</hi> by Mens <hi>Improvidence</hi>; and cutting off Mens Ends from their Means, he uses their Means to his own Ends, when he is pleased to work <hi>Deliverance</hi> for a People; as he hath at this Season, so graciously and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully done for Us, that there is nothing more needful, even to the most scrupulous Conscience, than an humble and awful Acquiescence in the <hi>Divine Counsel,</hi> to give Satisfaction in this Matter.</p>

                     <p>IN these our Times we are to distinguish betwixt the State of Kings in the first Original, and between the State of settled Kings and Monarchs, that do at this Time Govern in Civil Kingdoms: For even as God, during the Time of the Old Testament, spake by Oracles, and wrought by Miracles; yet how soon it pleased him to settle a Church, (which was Bought and Redeemed by the Blood of his only Son Christ) then was there a Cessation of both: He ever after governing his Church and People within the Limits of his revealed Will. So in the first Original of Kings, whereof some had their beginning by <hi>Conquest,</hi> and some by <hi>Election</hi> of the People, their Wills at that Time served for a Law; yet how soon Kingdoms began to be settled in Civility and Policy, then did Kings set down their Minds by Laws, which are properly made by the King only; but at the Rogation of the People, the King's Grant being obtained thereunto; and so the King came to be <hi>Lex lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quens,</hi> a speaking Law, after a sort binding himself by a double <hi>Oath</hi> to the Observation of the <hi>Fundamental Laws</hi> of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: Tacitly, as by being a King, and so bound to protect, as well the People, as the Laws of his Kingdom; and expresly by his Oath at his Coronation: So as every just King in a set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled Kingdom is bound to observe that Paction made to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by his Laws, in framing his Government agreeable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, according to that Paction which God made with <hi>Noah</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Deluge: <hi>Hereafter, Seed-time and Harvest, Summer and Winter, Cold and Heat, Day and Night shall not cease, so long as the Earth remains.

                     <p>That Just Kings will ever be willing to declare what they will do, if they will not incur the Curse of God. I will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that my Power be disputed upon, but I shall ever be willing to make the Reason appear of all my Doings, and rule my Actions according to the Laws.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And afterwards speaking of the Common Law of</hi> England, <hi>which some conceived he contemned, saith to this purpose</hi>; That as a King, he had least cause of any Man to dislike the Common Law; for no Law can be more favourable or advantageous for a King; and extendeth further his Prerogative than it doth; and for a King of <hi>England</hi> to despise the Common Law, is to neglect his own Crown. It is true, that no Kingdom in the World, but every one of them hath their own Municipal Laws agreeable to their Customs, as this Kingdom hath the Common Law. Nay, I am so far from disallowing the Common Law, as I protest that if it were in my Hand to chuse a new Law for this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60825:150"/>
I would not only prefer it before any other National Law, but even before the very Judicial Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> for convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to this Kingdom at this Time, tho in another respect I must say, both our Law, and all Laws else are very inferiour to that Judicial Law of God; for no Book nor Law is perfect nor free from Corruption, except only the Book and Law of God. And therefore I could wish that some Corruptions might be purged and cleared in the Common Law, but always by the Advice of Parliaments; for the King with his Parliament here are Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, in making or forming any sort of Laws.</p>
                     <p>First, I could wish that it were written in our Vulgar Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; for now it is an old mixt corrupt Language, only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by Lawyers: Whereas every Subject ought to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Law under which he lives; since it is our Plea against the Papists, that the Language in God's Service ought not to be in an Unknown Tongue, according to the Rule in the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> That <hi>the Law should be written in the Fringes of the Priests Garment, and should be publickly read in the Ears of all the People</hi>; so me thinks ought our Law to be made as plain as can be to the People, that the excuse of Ignorance may be taken from them for conforming themselves thereunto.</p>
                     <p>Next, our Common Law hath not a settled Text, being chiefly grounded upon old Customs, which you call <hi>Responsa Prudentum</hi> — I could wish that some more certain were set down in this case by Parliament: for since the Reports themselves are not are not always so binding, but that divers times Judges do disclaim them, and recede from the Judgment of their Predecessors: It were good that upon a mature deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, the Exposition of the Law were set down by Act of Parliament, and such Reports therein confirmed, as were thought fit to serve for Law in all times hereafter, and so the People should not depend upon the bare Opinions of Judges, and uncertain Reports.</p>
                     <p>And lastly, there be in the Law contrary Reports and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents; and this Corruption doth likewise concern the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and Acts of Parliament, in respect there are divers cross and cuffing Statutes, and some so penn'd as they may be taken in divers, yea contrary Sences. And therefore could I wish both those Statutes and Reports, as well in the Parliament, as Common Law, to be once materially reviewed and reconciled.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:60825:151"/>And that not only Contrarieties should be scraped out of our Books, but that even such Penal Statutes as were made but for the use of the time (for breach whereof no Man can be free) which do not now agree with the condition of this our time, might likewise be left out of our Books, which under a tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and avaricious King could not be endured.</p>
                     <p>And this Reformation might, we think, be made a worthy Work, and well deserves a Parliament to be set of purpose for it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>And as to the Point of Grievances, tells them,</hi> That there are two special Causes of the Peoples presenting Grievances to their King in time of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>First, For that the King cannot at other times be so well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of all the Grievances of his People, as in time of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which is the Representative Body of the whole Realm. Secondly, The Parliament is the highest Court of Justice, and therefore the fittest place where divers Natures of Grievances may have their proper Remedy, by the establishment of good and wholsome Laws: Wherein he addresses himself especially to the Lower House, who as representing the Body of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, may, as it were, both <hi>Opportunè &amp; Inopportunè,</hi> in Season, and out of Season; I mean, either in Parliament as a Body, or out of Parliament as private Men, present your Grievances unto me.—</p>
                     <p>I am not to find fault that you inform your selves of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Grievances of the People: <hi>Nay, I must tell you, ye can neither be just nor faithful to me, or to your Countries that trust and employ you, if you do not; for true Plaints proceed not from the Persons employed, but from the Body represented, which is the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> And it may very well be, that many Directions and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions justly given forth by me, may be abused in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof upon the People, and yet I never receive Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, except it come by your means at such a time as this is.</p>

                     <p>Indeed our <hi>Passive Obedience</hi> and your <hi>Addresses</hi> have been the two great Supporters of the King's Hopes; but he has now found, to his Sorrow, that we no more designed to obey Arbitrary Commands, than you Address'd for Establishment of Popery: But here's the Mischief of it, you Dissenters will still Be condemning us before you have heard us either Explain our Doctrines, or Distinguish the Times.</p>

                     <p>I must confess I cannot expect you should defend the Excesses of every Novice; but I can by no means reconcile these late Proceedings to those Doctrines which were Asserted by the most Learned of your Clergy.</p>

                     <p>Your Objection I confess is weighty, though obvious and the common talk; but being prepared by many Premeditations on this Subject, if you please to lend me a little Attention, I shall endeavour to satisfy your Difficulties.</p>

                     <p>First, therefore, to deal ingenuously with you, I confess, at the beginning of this Revolution I was under a very great Surprize: I, who have been in Arms for His Majesty, a warm stickler for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> puffed up with all the Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vado's and Excesses of an <hi>Oxford</hi> Loyalty, must needs be Alar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to hear our Nobility and Gentry beating up for the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> even in the Bowels of our Country. But when I came more seriously to reflect upon the Foundations of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as well as those antecedent Obligations which God Almighty has reserved as his own inviolable Prerogative, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to regulate my Zeal by calmer measures. And making a more impartial and strict Inquiry into the Opinions of Learned Men concerning the Regal Power, I found this most generally agreed upon; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Obedience and Disobedience of Subjects must be measured by the peculiar Constitutions of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Kingdom, without respect either to the Jewish Polity, where things were determined by God Almighty's special Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or the Behaviour of the Primitive Christians, who had few or no Legal Rights to Assert.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Diss.</speaker>
                     <p>Ay, but you Churchmen flattered the Court so long, till our Constitutions were all swallowed up in the Abyss of Prerogative.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ch.</speaker>
                     <p>I must confess while Kings are a Protection to Liberty, Property and Religion, the World is naturally prone to flatter them; neither would it be good Breeding to make too nice Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries into the Limits of a Prince while he does not exceed them; but when Distress comes impetuously upon a Nation, when Life and All that is Sacred to us lies at Stake, then the Inquiry is not only just; but necessary.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <p>Why, I shall present you with a short, but impartial view of the Constitutions of this Kingdom, as I find them most faithfully and ingenuously represented by the Royal Martyr in his Answer to the Nineteen Propositions, in these Words, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                        <q>There being Three kinds of Government among Men, <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Monarchy, Aristo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>racy,</hi> and all these having their particular Conveniences and Inconveniences, the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and Wisdom of our Ancestors hath so moulded this out of a <hi>mixture</hi> of these, as to give to this Kingdom the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences of all Three, without the Inconveniences of any one, as long as the Balance hangs even between the Three Estates, and they run jointly on in their proper Chanel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In this Kingdom the Laws are jointly made by a King, House of Peers, and House of Commons, chosen by the People, all having free Votes, and particular Priviledges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in this Kind of <hi>Regulated Monarchy,</hi> that the Prince may not make not use of his Power to the Hurt of those for whose Good he hath it, and make use of the Name of Publick Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity for the Gain of his private Favorites and Followers, to the detriment of his People; the House of Commons (an excellent Conserver of Liberty) is solely entrusted with the Levying of Monys, and the Impeaching of those, who for their own Ends, though countenanced by any surreptitiously gotten Command of the King, have violated that Law which he is bound to protect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Since therefore the <hi>Power Legally</hi> placed in both Houses, is more than sufficient to <hi>Prevent</hi> and <hi>Restrain</hi> the Power of <hi>Tyranny, &amp;c.</hi> Our Answer is, <hi>Nolumus Leges Angliae mutari.</hi>
                        </q> So far this Royal Author. And indeed what could a generous Prince acknowledg, or a Priviledg-as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting Subject desire more? Therefore, upon the whole, it appears by the Confession of the best of Men, as well as the wisest of Princes, that we are under a Government so well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for Society and the Exigencies of Humane Kind, that nothing but Folly can think of Establishing a better, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Jesuit disturb it: The Scriptures themselves seem to have meant it when they tell us that <hi>Caesar's</hi> Prerogative must never come in Competition with that of God Almighty, and that Governors shall be a Terror to evil Works. Here King
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60825:155"/>
and People have each their Territories, and all the Provision imaginable made against those Distractions which either Interest or Passion should attempt. From all which what can be more naturally inferred, but that we in this Kingdom are by no means obliged to resign up our selves to Violence and Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but that Passive Obedience has its Limits, and the Oath of Allegiance its Restrictions: A regulated and conditionated Monarch can expect no Obedience from me but what is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional too; and what an Absurdity does it seem, that by a Legal Oath I should swear an absolute Obedience to that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which is not Absolute? Besides, those Subsidies which were granted by the Clergy in several of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments for the Relief of the <hi>French, Dutch</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, against their Oppressors, plainly shew that it was all along the Opinion of the Church to Resist in case Rights and Religion were Invaded: Neither am I perswaded that the learned and unbyass'd Clergy of our present Church ever meant any other Obedience than an active Conformity to the Intent of the Law, or a Passive Submi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>sion to the Penalties of it. Therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hough upon the Foundations of our Government, an impatient Spirit might with a great shew of Reason establish a very extensive Latitude, in asserting the Subjects Right; yet in Favour of Monarchy, which I Reverence, and with Respect to the <hi>Present Conjuncture,</hi> I shall only now trouble you with these four Propositions, supposing a mixt Government; 1. That Suspicions and Jealousies of a Prince's sinister Designs are no sufficient Grounds for Subjects violently to assert their Rights, but in this Case the Event of things mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t be left to Providence. 2. That though one Man, or a greater number of Men receive manifest Injuries by the Abuses of Government, yet while they are but an inconsiderable part of the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they are in Duty bound rather to submit to Oppression, than interrupt the common Peace: But, 3. When Dangers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come demonstrable, when Religion it self, and the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Government are so undermined by the Insinuations of an inconsiderable party, who have obtained the Ear of their Prince, that its unavoidable Ruine must necessarily follow. In this Case I cannot see any Reason why Right may not be as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But, 4. When a Foreign Prince with a considerable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Invades a Nation, upon pretence of putting a stop to such
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60825:156"/>
violent Proceedings, besides, perhaps some just Causes of a War; I say in this Case, That the whole Nation may and ought to rise and put themselves in such a Posture, that they may be able to return him Thanks acording to the Merits of his Favours, without being jealous of his Greatness. And indeed our present Case is so circumstantiated, that I Question whether it may be paralle'd in History; and let any Man tell me where the Subjects of a <hi>Limited Monarchy,</hi> tired out with the Abuses of Government, did by sighting for their King en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Oppression by the Blood of Thousands, when they might effect a Treaty in all probability with little or no Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, by joining with a Prince of their own Interest, who, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, can shew more just Causes of a War than one?</p>

                     <p>Let but a moderate Papist lend me one grain of his own Principles, and I am confident he cannot but be of my Mind; for may we but modestly measure the King's future Proceedings (had we trusted him with Victory) by those we had already seen, how dismal would the Prospect be? Should we but recollect how barefacedly he has been striking at the Northern Heresy ever since the <hi>Oxford</hi> Parliament; what Mercy could we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect? How far some of the Protestant Nobility were engaged in an Association to assert their Rights, I shall not here pretend to determine, but this we may modestly presume, That all their Crimes were seen through a Popish Magnifying-Glass, and no Artifice neglected to ruine them. An ingenious Gentleman was deservedly applauded for his Rhetorical Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours in the Narrative of that Conspiracy, and I was well pleased with a Gentleman's Fancy, who imagined another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest would now engage him to atone for his unhappy Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in the High-Commission Court, by Writing what he observed of the Popish Designs, during his stay there. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eminent Instance of those Violences which were Encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above, was the Presenting Two and fifty Persons in the County of <hi>Northampton</hi> as disaffected to the Government, and branding them with all the Scandals imaginable; many of which I personally know to be as Faithful to the Crown, and in all Respects as honest and worthy Gentlemen as any in the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60825:156"/>
Kingdom. But to come nearer the <hi>Present Conjuncture,</hi> how were our Law, Properties, and all, prostituted by a few Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing Gentlemen, some of them perfectly incapable of any Place of Trust, and all of suspected Integrity. How surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing was it to see persons of the most contemptible Character placed among our Bishops; and all the sacred Authority lodged in a Court which was erected against an express Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? What a Riddle was it that our learned Prelates (hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the great Supporters of the Crown) should be Imprisoned for acting according to their Consciences, in refusing to Read that which pretended to establish the greatest <hi>Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science?</hi> Could any one that saw Six hundred Scholars up in Arms, and chearfully demonstrating their Loyalty in the Western Rebellion, ever think to see the Fellows of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledg ingratefully turned out like Dogs, and perhaps one of the finest Foundations in <hi>Europe,</hi> become a Kennel for Miscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, who were more unworthy to be Members of an University, upon the account of their Insufficiency, than they were inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of it by Law? It seem'd almost a Jest to me to see in <hi>Christ-Church</hi> persons of that eminent Character and Learning, superintended by a Wretch not fit for common Converse. In which Society there is a Person in whom the Gentleman and the Scholar do very eminently meet, and who for his happy Conduct and great Care to maintain the Repute of that Colledg during these Violences, has certainly now all the Title to the Deanry that either merit, or the common Rules of Gratitude can afford him. But to proceed, I say to see how all Freedom of Elections to Parliament was in a manner taken away; how the Poll at <hi>Northampton</hi> was like to be Regulated by Powder and Bullet, and the whole Government managed by Father <hi>Petre, Pen, Lob,</hi> and a few more such mercenary Wretches; and all this to introduce a Religion contrary to Scripture, and destructive of all Society, for which we expected great things would have been said while the Asserters of it had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Press, and the Countenance of a Prince, yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was produced but Fallacy and Nonsense: These, I say, (not to mention the subverting Succession, a League with <hi>France,</hi> and those horrid Murthers laid to the Court) are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations too great even for Primitive Obedience: But seeing these Violences have in all probability found their period, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60825:157"/>
the Betrayers of God and their Country are now coming to Answer for themselves, I shall leave further Reflections to a free and unbyass'd Parliament.</p>

                     <p>Ay, but what was it that encouraged these Violences? Was it not your unseasonable Zeal for an unlimited Obedience? your <hi>Oxford</hi> Decree, and such like Monuments of the Heats of that Age?</p>

                     <p>Why, to tell you sincerely my Opinion in the Case; I am perswaded there were Two Parties in the Nation under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the Government; the one by more secret and myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Methods endeavoured to introduce Popery; the other by more evident and bare-faced Proceedings, attempted the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of Monarchy: Therefore the Generality of the Churchmen being more sensible of the Designs of the latter, endeavoured to stand like <hi>Moses</hi> in the Gap with those you term unseasonable Doctrines, which I also take to be the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of the <hi>Oxford</hi> Decree; for though in my own private Opinion I never approv'd of it, but wished it might have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd in the same <hi>Rogus</hi> with the Books it condemned; yet I am so well satisfied of the Learning and Integrity of those worthy Gentlemen who were chiefly concerned in it, that I do really believe it was only promoted for the Preservation of the Government.</p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60825:157"/>
between Papist and Protestant, I am not only highly sensible of the Prince's Generosity, but have inserted the Justice of his Cause from the marvellous Providences when have wrought his Success: It is certainly part of his Character, that as his first Pretences were modest, so Fortune has not tempted him to exceed them; and we have still all the Reason in the World to imagine that he only generously designed to relieve us from Oppression, without any sinister Intent of making himself Great: The Noble Cause he has undertaken is the Protestant Interest, and I doubt not but the Lord of Hosts will fight his Battels. Indeed the Success of this his first Enterprize has been so wonderful and surprizing, that it will make an Annal suspected, and seem a Fable to Posterity: For who will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that a King, who, had he acted agreeably to the true Interest of Himself and People, might have been almost the Balance of Christendom, who was prepared with a standing Army, and always Remarkable for his Conduct in War, should be invaded by a near Neighbour, Son, and Nephew; and now in a Months time so generally deserted by his Nobility, Gentry, and Military Forces, as to choose, before the Sword was drawn, to fly for Refuge to a Prince whose Title he and his Ancestors had long disputed? This, I say (as the Learned Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> Argues at large) was the Lords doing, and ought to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous in our Eyes.</p>

                  <p>MY Lords, When we saw that it was no longer safe for Us to remain within Our Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and that thereupon. We had taken Our Resolutions to withdraw for some time, We left to be communicated to you and to all Our Subjects, the Reasons of Our withdrawing: And were likewise resolved at the same, time to leave such Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders behind Us to you of our Privy Councel, as might best suit with the present state of Affairs: But that being altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe for Us at that time; We now think fit to let you know, that though it has been Our constant care since Our first Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession to the Crown, to govern Our People with that Justice and Moderation, as to give, if possible, no occasion of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint; yet more particularly upon the late Invasion, seeing how the Design was laid; and fearing that Our People, who could not be destroy'd but by themselves, might by little ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Grievances, be cheated into a certain Ruine: To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent so great Mischief, and to take away not only, all just Causes, but even Pretences of Discontent; We freely, and of our own accord redressed all those things that were set forth as the Causes of that Invasion: And that we might be informed by the Councel and Advice of our Subjects themselves, which way we might give them a further and a full Satisfaction, We resolved to meet them in a Free Parliament; And in order to it, We first laid the Foundation of such a Free Parliament, in restoring the City of <hi>London</hi> and the rest of the Corporations to their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Charters and Priviledges; and afterwards actually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Writs to be issued out for the Parliaments meeting on the 15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Ianuary:</hi> But the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> seeing all the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60825:159"/>
Ends of his Declaration answered, the People beginning to be undeceived, and returning apace to their ancient Duty and Allegiance; and well fore-seeing that if the Parliament should meet at the time appointed, such a Settlement in all Probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would be made, both in Church and State, as would totally defeat his ambitious and unjust Designs, resolved by all means possible to prevent the meeting of the Parliament: And to do this the most effectual way, he thought fit to lay a restraint on Our Royal Person; for as it were absurd to call that a Free Parliament, where there is any force on either of the Houses, so much less can that Parliament be said to act freely where the Soveraign, by whose Authority they Meet and Sit, and from whose Royal Assent all their Acts receive their Life and Sanction, is under actual Confinement. The hurrying of Us under a Guard from Our City of <hi>London,</hi> whose returning Loyalty We could no longer trust, and the other Indignities We suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Person of the Earl of <hi>Feversham</hi> when sent to him by Us; and in that barbarous Confinement of Our own Person, We shall not here repeat, because they are We doubt not by this time very well known; and may, we hope, if enough considered and reflected upon, together with his other Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Breaches of the Laws and Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> which by this Invasion he pretended to restore, be sufficient to open the Eyes of all our Subjects, and let them plainly see what every one of them may expect, and what Treatment they shall find-from him, if at any time it may serve his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, from whose Hands a Soveraign Prince, an Uncle, and a Father could meet with no better Entertainment. However, the sense of these Indignities, and the just Apprehension of further Attempts against Our Person, by them who already endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to murther Our Reputation by infamous Calumnies (as if We had been capable of supposing a Prince of <hi>Wales</hi>) which was incomparably more injurious, than the destroying of Our Person it Self; together with a serious Reflection on a Saying of Our Royal Father of blessed Memory, when He was in the like Circumstances, <hi>That there is little distance between the Prisons and the Graves of Princes</hi> (which afterwards proved too true in His Case) could not but persuade Us to make use of that which the Law of Nature gives to the meanest of Our Subjects of freeing Our selves by all means possible from that unjust Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60825:159"/>
and Restraint. And this We did not more for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of our own Person, then that thereby We might be in a better Capacity of transacting and providing for every thing that may contribute to the Peace and Settlement of Our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms: For as on the one hand, no change of Fortune shall ever make Us forget Our Selves, so far as to condescend to any thing unbecoming that High and Royal Station, in which God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty by Right of Succession has placed Us: So on the other hand, neither the Provocation or Ingratitude of Our own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>cts, nor any other Consideration whatsoever, shall ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with Us to make the least step contrary to the true Interest of the <hi>English</hi> Nation; which We ever did, and ever must look upon as Our own. Our Will and Pleasure thereof is, That you of Our Privy Councel, take the most effectual care to make these Our Gratious Intentions known to the Lords Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral in and about Our Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> to the Lord Mayor and Commons of our City of <hi>London,</hi> and to all Our Subjects in general; and to assure them, that We desire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, than to return and hold a Free Parliament, wherein We may have the best Opportunity of undeceiving Our People, and shewing the Sincerity of those Protestations We have often made of the preserving the Liberties and Properties of Our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi>; more especially the <hi>Church of England</hi> as by Law establish'd, with such Indulgence for those that dissent from Her, as We have always thought Our selves in Justice and Care of the general Welfare of Our People bound to procure for them. And in the mean time You of Our Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, (who can judg better by being upon the place) are to send Us your Advice, what is fit to be done by Us towards Our return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the accomplishing those good Ends. And We do require you in Our Name, and by Our Authority, to endeavour so to suppress all Tumults and Disorders, that the Nation in general, and every one of Our Subjects in particular, may not receive the least Prejudice from the present Distractions that is possible. So not doubting of your Dutiful Obedience to these Our Royal Commands, We bid you heartily Farewel. Given at St. <hi>Germans on Laye</hi> the 4/4 <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1688/9. And of Our Reign the fourth Year.</p>

                  <head>Some Remarks on the late Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Letter to the <hi>LORDS,</hi> and Others of his Privy Council.</head>
                  <p>IT begins thus, <hi>My Lords, When we saw that it was no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger safe for us to remain within our Kingdom of</hi> England, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Majesty would have given great Satisfaction to the World in discovering where the Danger lay in tarrying here; from whom, and for what cause.</p>
                  <p>He is pleased to say farther: <hi>We now think fit to let you know, that though it has been our constant care since our first Accession to the Crown, to govern our People with that Iustice and Moderation as to give, if possible, no occasion of Complaint,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I do not understand why his Majesty would not let us know these his Gracious Intentions before, when they might have done Himself and Us Good.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>quid verba audiam cum facta videam,</hi> to what purpose are Words when we see Facts? And as to his Moderation, I appeal to the Pope himself, or the French King, who chiefly blame him for his Rashness and want of Temper; and as for his Justice, among a thousand publick Instances to the contrary, he should remember his discountenancing and turning out of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments all such as would not enter into his Idolatrous Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and comply with his illegal and arbitrary Designs. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, what Justice can Hereticks expect from a Prince, who is not only a Papist, but wholly devoted to the Order of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits, and values himself for being a Member of those Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Cut-throats? <hi>Yet more particularly upon the late Invasion, seeing how the Design was laid, and fearing that our People, who could not be destroyed but by themselves.</hi> The Design was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Nation from falling under the cruel Dominion of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60825:160"/>
French, and to keep our selves from being dragg'd by the Hair of the Head to Mass, and from undergoing all those Miseries which those of the same Religion, and for the same Cause, have endured now lately in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Savoy. To prevent so great a Mischief,</hi> (that is to say, destroying our selves,) <hi>and to take away not only all just Causes, but even Pretences of Discontent: We freely and of our own accord, redrest all those things that were set forth as the Causes of that Invasion.</hi> I appeal to the common Faith of Mankind touching the Insinserity of these Words, whether if this Invasion had not been, these and worse Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances had not followed. <hi>And that we might be informed by the Counsel and Advice of our Subjects themselves, which way we might give them a further and full Satisfaction; We resolved to meet them in a Free Parliament,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The late Kings of <hi>England</hi> have been as desirous of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as Popes of a Free and General Council; there being nothing they have more studiously avoided, and greatlier feared.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the Prince of</hi> Orange <hi>seeing all the Ends of his Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion answered, the People beginning to be undeceived, and returning apace to their ancient Duty and Allegiance, resolved by all possible means to prevent the meeting of the Parliament,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>How far the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> has been from preventing the meeting of a Parliament, we need only consult our sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The hurrying us under a Guard from our City of</hi> London, <hi>whose returning Loyalty we could no longer trust, and the other Indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties we suffered in the Person of the Earl of</hi> Feversham, <hi>when sent to him by us, and in that barbarous Confinement of our own Person, we shall not here repeat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Do's any Man think the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> would have had the same gentle Treatment from the King, had he been in like manner under his Power? And as to the Kings concernment for the unheard of Suffering of the E. of <hi>F.</hi> I do not wonder at it, having ever had so little Affection, or rather so great an Antipathy to his English Subjects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This will be sufficient to open the Eyes of all our Subjects, and let them plainly see what every one of them may expect, and what Treatment they shall find from him, if at any time
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60825:161"/>

                  <p>All wise and good Protestants are so certain of happy times under the Government of this most excellent and incompora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Prince, that they have nothing left to fear or desire, but that God would preserve him from the Hellish Fury of the Papists And as to all these Relations of a Soveraign Prince, an Uncle, and a Father: The King would have done well to have acquitted himself to the Prince as became all these Relations.</p>

the Trust of the Regal Inheritance of the Executive Power, both in Himself, and in His Heirs, Lineal and Collateral; so that the same is devolved back to the People, who have also the Legislative Authority; and consequently may of Right Give and Dispose thereof, by their Representatives, for their future Peace, Benefit; Security, and Government, according to their good Will and Pleasure. And forasmuch as it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely Necessary, that the Government be speedily setled on sure and lasting Foundations, and consequently, that such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or Persons be immediately placed in the Throne, in whom the Nation has most reason to repose an entire Confidence: It therefore now lies upon Us to make so Judicious a Choice, that we may, in all Humane Probability, thereby render Our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a Happy People, and give Our Posterity cause to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, when they shall read the Proceedings of this Wise and Grand <hi>Convention.</hi> Who is it therefore that has so highly Merited the Love and good Opinion of the People, the Honour of Wearing the Crown, and Swaying the Scepter of this Land, as His Illustrious Highness the Prince of <hi>Orange?</hi> who with so great Expence, Hazard, Conduct, Courage, and Generosity, has happily Rescued Us from <hi>Popery,</hi> and <hi>Slavery</hi>; and with so much Gallantry Restored Us to Our Ancient Rights, Religion, Laws, Liberties, and Properties: for which Heroick Action, we can do no less, in Prudence, Honour, and Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, than Pray Him to Accept Our Crown.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. It is better to settle the Exercise of the Government in One who is not immediate in the Line, than in One that is; (1.) Because it is a clear Asserting of a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Right, that manifests the Constitution of the <hi>English</hi> Government, and covers the Subjects from Tyranny and Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. (2.) It cuts off the Dispute of the pretended Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi> (3.)

The present State of <hi>Europe</hi> in General, and of these Kingdoms in Particular, require a Vigorous and Masculine Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration. To recover what's lost, rescue what's in danger, and rectify what's amiss, cannot be effected but by a Prince that is consummate in the Art both of Peace and War.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It's highly necessary and prudent, rather to vest the Administration in the Husband, than in the Wife.</p>
                  <p>(1.) Because a Man, by Nature, Education and Experience, is generally rendred more capable to Govern than the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>

The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> is not more proper to Govern as he's Man, and Husband only, but as he is a Man, a Husband, and a Prince of known Honour, profound Wisdom, undaunted Courage, and incomparable Merit; as he's a Person that's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally inclin'd to be Just, Merciful and Peaceable, and to do all Publick Acts of Generosity for the Advancement of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest and Happiness of Humane Societies, and therefore most fit under Heaven, to have the sol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>PRay give me leave to cast in my <hi>Mite</hi> at this time upon this great Debate; and though it be with an entire dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to some Leading Lords, to whom I bear great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, it is according to my Conscience, and that is the <hi>Rule</hi> of every honest Man's Actions.</p>
                  <p>My, Lords, I cannot forbear thinking, that a greater Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach can hardly come upon any People, than is like to fall upon us <hi>Protestants,</hi> for this unpresidented usage of our poor King: We feared the security of our Religion because of Him, and are now like to <hi>Violate</hi> a great part of it by forfeiting our Loyalty towards Him; <hi>Religion</hi> is the Pretence, but some fear, a <hi>New Master</hi> is the Thing: This I take to have been to Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of to Day; for, notwithstanding we see how feeble a thing <hi>Popery</hi> is in <hi>England,</hi> that it is beaten without Blows, and routed so effectually, that it can never hope, nor we justly fear, it should return upon us, and consequently our Religion pretty secure, yet I don't see that this satisfies us, unless the <hi>King</hi> goes also: He must be <hi>turned away,</hi> and the Crown <hi>change</hi> its Head; for if the <hi>Crown</hi> be not the <hi>Quarrel</hi> more than Property, and his <hi>Majesty's Person</hi> than his <hi>Religion</hi>; Why did not the <hi>Prince</hi> stop, when he heard a <hi>Free Parliament</hi> was calling by the <hi>King's</hi> Writs, (where all Matters, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that of the <hi>Prince of Wales,</hi> might have been considered) or at least, where his Majesties Commissioners of Peace met <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I and who is there now that does not see it is not so?</p>
                  <p>We can, my Lords, no longer doubt of this, if we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the same Night the <hi>Prince</hi> should have answered his Majesty's kind Message, <hi>The King's Guards were changed, and at midnight the Prince's Guards were clapt upon hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Many are angry (and yet pleased) that he is gone for <hi>France</hi>; but where, my Lords, should he go? <hi>Flanders</hi> dared not receive him: <hi>Holland,</hi> you could not think he should go to; and <hi>Ireland</hi> you would have liked less; and when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how far a <hi>League</hi> with <hi>France</hi> has been made the cause of his Misfortune (though to this day it is in the Clouds) what other <hi>Prince</hi> had the same Obligation to receive and succor him: Therefore whatever Arts are used to <hi>blacken</hi> his Retreat, we cannot, with any shew of Reason, imagine that he could think himself safe with us, that had <hi>exercised Soveraign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er without him our Soveraign Lord,</hi> and under the protection of a <hi>Forraign Prince</hi> and his <hi>Army</hi>; though at the same time, we had <hi>Sworn Allegiance to him, and that it was unlawful for us to take up Arms against him under any Pretence whatever.</hi>

                  <p>My Lords, if this be not virtually and in effect to pull the <hi>Crown</hi> off his Head, and dethrone him unheard, I am to learn my Alphabet again. This is short warning to give Kings, for us at least, my Lords, that boast of Loyalty, and were brought to these Seats by the favour of the <hi>Crown.</hi> What can other Nations think of the Nobility of this, if we come not to a juster temper? God defend us, and our Children after us, from the ill Consequences of what has been done, and prevent the rest. Had we imbraced the happy Providence of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestyes return, we might have improved it, that the Children unborn should have blessed us: Then we had reformed safely, for by joyning <hi>Title</hi> to our Actions, we had made them legal: This we should have had from his Majesty, or a plain denial, which would in some measure have excused so rare and unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual an Enterprise: Nor can I comprehend which way it is possible to <hi>guard the Prince's Honour,</hi> but by doing his Majesty

                     <hi>Rights,</hi> for your Lordships may please to remember, that in the <hi>Memorial of the States,</hi> that was printed among us, which they gave to all the publick Ministers at the <hi>Hague,</hi> to justify their lending the <hi>Prince</hi> their <hi>Forces</hi> upon this Expedition, they do expresly say, <hi>It was upon condition not to dethrone the King, or alter the Succession</hi>; and in my Opinion we are in the high way to both.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, we are <hi>Protestant Christians,</hi> as well as <hi>Peers</hi> of the Realm; and are now <hi>upon our Religion and Conscience,</hi> as well as <hi>Honour,</hi> to do right: Let us so act as we can answer it to God and Man, and not <hi>stumble at Straws and leap over Blocks</hi>: Errors cannot be corrected by committing greater; nor one part of the Government be mended, by beating out another to do it. I need not tell your Lordships, that by our Laws, Kings cannot err, and therefore they are not accountable, but their Ministers are, without whom a King cannot perform any Act of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is the reason of the Maxim; and therefore let them be punished that the Law only makes guilty. This our wise Ancestors contrived to save the <hi>Head of the Government whole,</hi> and to prevent the Confusion and Disorder that might otherwise be apt to attend the Form of it; nor is it indeed a thing that ought to be indured by us <hi>Peers,</hi> to suppose that he that raised us so high, could be for any Reason thrown by us so low.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, Let us limit the King if you please, but not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Him; there is a difference between restraining and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying Him.

are not alike, and then the Danger we have apprehended from <hi>Papists,</hi> is not universal, as we have affirmed, but that they are to be lived with, since we are to be saved and guarded from the Danger of <hi>Popery</hi> by them; or we have ill luck to think we can be safe from that Religion by those that are of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are <hi>Dutch-men.</hi> My Lords, I am sorry we can take such Pleasure to see Strangers tread our Courts, pray God it does not show the way to other Countries to take their turns. But that a <hi>Dutch Papist</hi> should be so <hi>harmless</hi> a thing with us, that though no <hi>Papists</hi> could be so, shows our Contradictions to a Madness. I know not how well our <hi>Souldiers</hi> like to give way to <hi>Dutch-Men,</hi> that though they had purchased a Prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to Strangers at a dear rate; but it is the justest thing in the World upon them, that the <hi>Prince</hi> should distrust those to guard him, that had betrayed their own Master that loved them to a fault; they may serve to be sent for <hi>Holland,</hi> to be knookt on the Head in the <hi>Dutch-mans</hi> quarrel, but never to be trusted at home, though they have given up their Quarters with their <hi>King</hi> to Foreigners, so that the Proverb is true up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, they have hereby brought their Noble to Nine-pence. Yet to be just, I must confess it is a Reproach due to their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and not all of them neither, and time may give those the Opportunity to retrieve the Credit they have lost by other Mens Faults.</p>
                  <p>We were also very apprehensive of the ill Consequences of the <hi>dispensing Power,</hi> especially in the case of Sr. <hi>Edward Hales</hi>; but it seems the <hi>Common Council of London</hi> are forbid to take the usual Oaths, and yet required to act, which is an unqualified Capacity. We were in hopes we had lost a rude Army, but we have found a ruder; twenty places cry out of them; and <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone</hi> certainly with great Justice, that in two Nights time was two hundred Pounds the worse for them. And for <hi>Closseting</hi> we have got <hi>Questioning,</hi> that they that won't enter into <hi>Associations</hi> to protect the <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi> without one of our <hi>King,</hi> is to have no Imployment; so that if the <hi>Prince</hi> should take the <hi>Crown,</hi> I am bound to defend him against my own <hi>King,</hi> and my <hi>sworn Allegiance</hi> though he come in the right of his <hi>Crown.</hi> Believe me, my Lords, it is the boldest bid that ever Men made; I see <hi>Forty one</hi> was a Fool to <hi>Eighty eight</hi>; and that we Church of <hi>England</hi> Protestants shall cancel all the Merits of our Fathers, overthrow

God help us, this my Lords makes me say, that either we must turn from being Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Men, or steer another course, for it is but too plain that <hi>Presbytery</hi> is leading us out of our ancient way; and whether we believe it or no, our Church sinks, and will more, for that is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest that suits best with a <hi>Dutch Humour and Conjunction</hi>; and be sure, if we are so base to leave our <hi>King,</hi> God will be so just as to leave us; and here, my Lords, I shall leave you, with this <hi>humble motion,</hi> that we make an <hi>humble Address to his Majesty to return home to us,</hi> that we may act securely, and not go out of the good old way, which may intail Misery upon us and our Posterity. I should think we have had enough of <hi>sending our Princes abroad,</hi> in that much of the Inconveniency we have lain under since their Restoration, has been chiefly owing to it: We have driven him where we would not have him go, and do what we can to provoke that League we have been afraid of; and made a great part of the reason of this strange Alteration in the Kingdom. Some tell us, <hi>it is too late,</hi> but I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the good sence of such an Objection; Is it at any time too late for a <hi>King</hi> and his People to agree? after bloody Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels it has not been thought so, in all times and Nations; and why it may not be without them, I never heard a good reason yet: If his going was unreasonable, it has hurt him more than us, since we may thence hope for the better terms; if it was not a Fault to go, it will be a great one in us, if we can have him home upon good terms, and will not; for if I may with leave speak it, his return is as much our Conveniency as his Advantage.</p>
                  <p>The offensive part of Him is gone, that is to say, the Power of <hi>Popery,</hi> and what remains is our great Interest to keep and improve to our own Benefit and Safety; I mean, my Lords, <hi>His undoubted Title and Kingship.</hi> And whatever some hot Men say, that are more governed by private Avarice and Revenge, then the publick Good of these Kingdoms, I cannot but renew

my motion to your Lordships, that we may send a <hi>Duke,</hi> an <hi>Earl,</hi> a <hi>Viscount</hi> and a <hi>Baron,</hi> and two <hi>Spiritual Lords</hi> to invite his Majesty home, upon the Constitution of the Government. And my Lords, forgive me if I say, that if we can but get our <hi>Iuries, Sheriffs, Iudges, High Courts of Chancery and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> setled as they ought to be; the <hi>Army</hi> at least reduced, the <hi>Militia</hi> better regulated, and a due <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi> established to all Protestant Dissenters, and so far to Papists only, as the <hi>Law against Conventicles does admit,</hi> we may yet be happy; and upon these terms, my Lords, and no other, will his Highness the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> become truly meritorious with the <hi>English Nation.</hi>

                  <p>THIS Noble Lord would have done ingenuously in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the World know his Name, and whether he be a Lord or not; for one cannot gather it from his Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, <hi>of casting in a mite</hi> at this time, when mean People, such as Trades-men, have more generosity, and effectually contributed to the publick Peace and Honour of the Nation. And as to <hi>his dissenting to some leading Lords on the account of Conscience</hi>; we are in the dark as to what sort of Conscience his is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Papist or Phanatick Conscience, or indeed whether it be any Conscience at all, which makes him differ from some leading Lords; for the making of Speeches within or without Doors, is no infallible Mark of either.</p>
                  <p>But he says, <hi>He cannot forbear thinking that a greater Reproach can hardly come upon a People, than is like to fall on us Protestants.</hi> Ah, good Soul, what's the matter?

Jesuit i'le warrant thee, that has entred (with <hi>Campian</hi>) into an Holy League and Covenant to destroy all Protestant Kings and Princes, unless they become as bigotted to the Society as the <hi>poor King</hi> was. But let me take the Boldness to ask your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour one Question; Is there no time when compassion is due to the Country? <hi>Religion is the Pretence, but some fear a new Master is the thing.</hi> And is it any wonder if a new Master be desired, when the old one will not let me serve him, but will destroy me, and perhaps himself too; this being a clear case, and evident to all Orders and Degrees of Men among us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We see how feeble a thing Popery is in</hi> England: and it is, I do not doubt, your Lordships great Grief that your old Master may not be let in again, to strengthen and revive her drooping and almost decayed Spirits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But why did not the Prince stop, when he heard a Free-Parliament was calling by the Kings Writs, where all matters, especially of the Prince of</hi> Wales, <hi>might have been considered,</hi> &amp;c. As to a Free-Parliament, is it not evident to all the World that the King could not bear it? Besides, who told his Lordship, that his old Master would abide by the Decisions of a Free-Parliament, touching the Legitimacy or Spuriousness of his Prince of <hi>Wales?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Kings Guards were changed, and at Midnight the Prince's Guards were clapt on his Majesties Person.</hi> And I pray what harm befel him from this change?</p>
                  <p>It seems he might, notwithstanding, dispose of himself as he pleased. And was it decent, when his own People forsook him, that he should be left at the Discretion of the Rabble?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It becomes us too to ask where the King is? how he came to go? and who sent him away?</hi> A notable Question indeed, and which every Apple-woman, or Broom-man can resolve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But many are angry, and yet pleased.</hi> This is <hi>Nokes</hi> all over: Why then, angry and pleased is one and the same thing with your Lordship.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That he is gone for</hi> France: <hi>but where, my Lords, should he go?</hi> Flanders <hi>dared not receive him.</hi> Good your Honour why? is not his Catholick Majesty as zealous and hospitable as the most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian King? Ay but the Spaniard had no private Leagues of assisting each other to root out the Northern Heresy, and other Intimacies which every Body must not know of.</p>

                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:60825:167"/>Holland <hi>you could not think he should go to.</hi> Yet there was a time when <hi>Holland</hi> was more kind to him and his Brother than <hi>France,</hi> and he has rewarded the former very well for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore we cannot, with any shew of Reason, imagin that he could think himself safe with us, that had exercis'd Soveraign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er without him our Soveraign Lord.</hi>

                  <p>Sure I am, no Man of Sense could think himself safe under his Power, that was unwilling to part with his Religion and Property.</p>

                     <hi>And under the protection of a Foraign Prince and his Army.</hi> And without his Protection, what wou'd have become of us?</p>

                  <p>I would know of your Lordship, Whether the Oath, in your Honour's sence, does not make our Lives and Estates to depend on the Prince's mere Will and Pleasure?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Lords, let us limit the King, if you please, but not renounce him.</hi> Did he tell your Reverence he would be limited? And was he not limited before? Besides, a Prince of his Humour, and in his Circumstances, must needs be very easy, and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects very secure, under these Chimerical Limitations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But we had lost a Lawful King</hi>; and gotten a more Lawful, and infinitely Better in his room.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And that any of us should be numbred among the Heroes for our running away, cannot surely be the Lord's doing, let Dr.</hi> Burnet <hi>say what he will.</hi> This Gentleman do's very well to put himself among the Run-aways; but its' more likely his Reverence wou'd have bin Sainted, and made an Hero by staying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.</p>

                  <p>But says he further, <hi>This is not all our loss, we have rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the</hi> 5th <hi>Commandment also, Honor thy Father; and though we have got that of leaving Father of the sake of Religion, we could have but little Religion to do it in such a manner, to so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate a Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here his Reverence, I find, is not serious, but jokes on his <hi>poor King</hi>; for give me an instance where his Paternal Affection appear'd, unless his Fatherly care of dragging us up in his own Religion be one?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nor did it,</hi> says he, <hi>lessen the Error, to have a Church-of</hi>-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>Apostle to be Captain of her Life Guard,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I wou'd ask my Noble Sir here one Question, (for the Jesuits are wont to be excellent Casuists) Whether a Churchman, observing his own, and his Neighbours Houses a going to be fired by Rogues, he may not use another Sword besides that of the Spirit, to drive them away?</p>
                  <p>Now he is troubled, and in great conflicts of Spirit, <hi>how our Soldiers are like to give way to Dutch-men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Dutch Soldiers have behaved themselves with that Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Moderation, where-ever they come, as may make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of that Profession blush at a Comparison in this point.

There will be care taken that our Soldiers shall not give way to Foreigners, nor to every Irish-man, who you know were the Sparks and Darlings of the last Reign.</p>
                  <p>But now <hi>it is but too plain, that Presbytery is leading us out of our Ancient Way.</hi> Never fear it, good Father, for there's no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of either that, or Popery, being the National Religion in <hi>England.</hi> And having satisfi'd you so far, I am not willing to tire my self with writing Replies to every Word of your <hi>Speech without Doors.</hi>

                  <p>For that as she had already by her poyson'd Baits, brought to Destruction more Noble-men and their Houses, and a greater multitude of Subjects, during her being here, than she would have done if she had been in Possession of her own Country, and arm'd in the Field against them; so would she be still continually the cause of the like spoil, to the greater loss and peril of this Estate; and therefore this Realm neither could nor might endure her.</p>
                  <p>For that her Sectaries both Wrote and Printed, that the <hi>Protestants</hi> would be at their Wits end, Worlds end, if she
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60825:169"/>
should out-live Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; meaning thereby, that the end of the <hi>Protestant</hi> World was the beginning of their own; and therefore if she the said Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> were taken away, their World would be at an end before its beginning.</p>
                  <p>For that since the sparing of her in the Fourteenth Year of Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign, Popish Traitors and Recusants had multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied exceedingly: And if she were now spared again, they would grow both innumerable and invincible also: And therefore Mercy in that case would prove Cruelty against them all: <hi>Nam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And those Magistrates were much conmmended, who put to Death those mischeivous and wicked Queens, <hi>Iezabel</hi> and <hi>Athaliah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now I would desire our <hi>Grumbletonians</hi> (especially they of the Clergy) to consider how extreamly they have degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the good and laudable Principles of their Fore-fathers. They may see how urgent the Bishops, and others, in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s days, were to have the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> removed, (as above said) and how they encouraged the Queen to assist the <hi>Dutch</hi> against their Soveraign Lord, when he attempted them in their Religion and Laws; but now they that first opposed <hi>One</hi> that has broken the <hi>Original Contract between King and People,</hi> and done horrid things, contrary to the Laws of God, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Land, yet when God, out of his merciful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and singular favour to us all, has inclined him (being sensible of his own Guilt) to leave the Throne, these Very Men that first withstood him (as I said) begin to pitty him, plead for him, and extol him; and continually, both in Pulpit, (for one of them lately said there, <hi>That a parcel of Attoms could as soon make a World, as a Convention make a King</hi>) and also in Coffee-houses, mutter and grumble against the Proceedings of the great and Honorable <hi>Convention</hi> of the Kingdom, and are busy in sending out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and privately scattering their puling

Pamphlets, under the Titles of <hi>Mementoes, Speeches,</hi> and <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> empty of ought else, but the spleen of a foolish and frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Faction. Good God! what inconstancy, folly, and madness possesses the Breasts of these Men? to what a miserable slavery would they lead us, and how fond and eager do they seem to have him rule over Us, who (like the Stork in the Fable) has, and would make it his greatest delight, to devour the best of free-born Subjects? But, I hope, that in a little time they will know the Things that belong to the Kingdom's Peace, and dutifully pray for (tho at present there is no uniformity in their Pulpits save in the Dissenters) and submit chearfully and thankfully to him whom God has made the <hi>Glorious Instrument of our Deliverance from Popery and Slavery.</hi>

                  <head>Reflections upon our Late and Present Proceedings in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THO no Man wishes better to the Protestant Religion in general, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> in particular, than I do; yet I cannot prevail with my self to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove all those Methods, or follow all those Measures, which some Men propose as the only Security both of the one and the other.</p>
                  <p>Never perhaps was there a more proper time wherein to secure our Religion (together with our Civil Liberties) than now of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it self, if we have but the Skill and Honesty rightly to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this critical Opportunity; but if we shall either let it slip, or abuse it, we may in vain hereafter wish that we had been wise in time; and have cause to repent of our Error, when it will be too late to correct it.</p>
                  <p>What we do now will transmit its good or ill Effects to after-Ages, and our Children yet unborn, will in all probability, be happy or miserable, as we shall behave our selves in this great Conjuncture. They are likely to enjoy their Religion, Laws and Liberties, according to the old English Standard, if we shall now take the right course to secure them.</p>
                  <p>But if we do ingage in wrong Counsels, and build upon false Foundations, instead of a Blessing we may leave a Curse to our Posterity, and entail upon them Popery, Slavery, Arbitrary Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and all the miserable Consequences of a divided Kingdom, which (as sure as the Word of God is true) can never stand.</p>
                  <p>Let us not therefore be too hasty, but pause a while; let us make a stop, look about us, and consider, First, What we have done. Secondly, With what Intent we did it. Thirdly, What it is that some Men would be at. And, Fourthly, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we can in Honour and Conscience join with them in the Designs now in hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:60825:172"/>I shall confine my self to these Heads: But here before I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon any of them, I shall take it for granted, that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> hath done a great thing for us, and (under God) hath wrought such a Deliverance for the Nation, as ought never to be forgotten, and can never be sufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited. He must be mentioned with Honour and Gratitude, so long as the Protestant Name shall be remembred: He came not as the antient Romans and Saxons, to conquer, and lead in Triumph after him our Religion and Laws, our Lives and Liberties; but to defend, preserve and secure us in them all. To this end he undertook this dangerous and chargeable Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which hath hitherto proved as much to our Advantage, as it will be to his lasting Reputation: What he has done ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, that he is moved by an higher Principle than any this World affords, and can overlook his own Ease and Security, when the Publick Good, and the Concerns of Christianity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire his seasonable Assistance. I could easily make a Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick upon his Vertues, and equal him to the most famous Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian or Roman Captains; but I need not set forth his Praises, which do so loudly, and yet so silently speak for themselves. I need not draw any tedious Parallels betwixt his Highness and the Worthies of other Ages, since I am, I question not, herein prevented by all who have read the History of former Times, and are Witnesses of what he (with so much Courage, Mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Prudence) hath done in this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Things prospered so well under his Conduct, that all of us were ready to submit our selves to his Direction, and come under his Protection, as the Tutelar Genius of the Nation. The Effects of his Enterprise have been so strange, so wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and surprising, that had we not seen, we should scarce have believed them.</p>
                  <p>As soon as the Prince was landed, with what Joy and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal good Wishes was the News received? How forward were all sorts of People to declare for his Highness? How wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling were they to lend him an helping Hand for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing his great Work? How did we all generally concur and unanimously agree to forget our Obligations to our Sovereign, and assist the Prince rather than the King against our selves, and his own true Interest?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:60825:172"/>Nay, the Army it self soon began to go over, chusing rather to he under the imputation of Cowardise and Disloyalty (which yet a <hi>true English-man</hi> had rather die than really deserve) than to be instrumental in enslaving their <hi>Native Country,</hi> and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it again under the <hi>Papal Yoke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In short, all Orders of Men, Ecclesiastick, Civil, and Military, had their Eyes fix'd upon the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> as their Common Deliverer, were resolved to espouse his Cause; and accordingly (after the King was withdrawn) did put the <hi>Regal Administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> into his Hands.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. So far we have gone; this we have done; and we hope that (the case being extraordinary, and Necessity giving a Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) the Intent of our proceeding, will at least excuse, if not justify us, if we have not kept our selves within the <hi>Common Laws</hi> of Action.</p>
                  <p>For let every Man lay his Hand upon his Heart, and seriously ask himself, for what Reason, and with what Intent he became a Party in this general Defection? Was it utterly to ruin the King and subvert the Government? Was it because he was displeas'd with the ancient Constitution, and had a mind to mould and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion it to his liking? Was it because he had an Intent to shake off the Government (that <hi>easy, equal, and well-poised, and never-enough to be commended Government,</hi> as King CHARLES I. calls it) of the <hi>English</hi> Nation? Was it any honest Mans meaning to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert this Government, to make way for his own Dreams of some <hi>Poetical Golden-Age,</hi> or a <hi>Fanciful Millenium?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Was it (let me ask again) to divest the King of all Power to protect his Subjects, and then to pronounce roundly, that all the Bonds of Allegiance to him are dissolved? Was the end of our uniting together, to bind his Hands, and then prick this Doctrine upon the points of our Swords: <hi>Protection and Allegiance are Duties so reciprocal, that where the one fails wholly, the other falls with it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Was it to frighten the King out of his Dominions, and then to vote that he hath <hi>Abdicated</hi> his Government? Was this the Intent, and were these the Reasons of our Declaring for the Prince of <hi>Orange?</hi> No, certainly, whatever some obnoxious and ambitious Men might aim at, all good Christians and worthy Patriots had other Intentions, and were led on by other Motives.</p>
                  <p>They were sensibly concerned for the Preservation of their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60825:173"/>
Religion, in the first place; their Lives, their Laws, and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the next. <hi>After the way, which some call Heresy, so</hi> were they desirous still <hi>to worship the God of their Fathers:</hi> And after that manner which some might say was <hi>Rebellion,</hi> so they thought themselves oblig'd to stand up for the <hi>Laws and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their Forefathers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For these Ends, and for bringing about these worthy Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, they withdrew themselves from the Kings personal Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that they might be the better enabled to serve his real Interest. They hoped by this means to deliver him from his evil Counsellors, and secure both him and his Subjects from the evil and pernicious Practices of some wicked and unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Men.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. These and such like were the Inducements which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with all well-affected and honest Men, to withdraw from his Majesty, and suspend the actual Exercise of their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance for the present, that they might afterwards exert it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fix'd and stated Rules of Law, Conscience, and right Reason.</p>
                  <p>But now, how contrary is this to those new Models, which some politick Architects are proposing to, or rather imposing upon the Nation? What is it they would be at? And what are the Ends they are driving on? Are they just and good? Are they generous and honorable? Or are they not rather such as would undermine the Government both in Church and State, and reduce us to a state of Nature, wherein the People are at Liberty to agree upon any Government, or none at all?</p>
                  <p>Plainly, they would reduce us to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> or some other foreign Measures (which how well soever they may agree with that Country, where they are setled and confirmed, partly by Custom, and partly by the peculiar Necessity of their Affairs) can never be well received in <hi>England,</hi> till an Act be passed to abolish Monarchy, Episcopacy, and all the Fundamental Laws establish'd by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and all succeeding Parliaments ever since.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Enquixy into the Measures of Submission to the Supreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> is a Treatise calculated for the times; but surely it is not written according to the Principles and Practice of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the time of the renowned <hi>Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth:</hi> I am apt to think, that some regard was then had to the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60825:173"/>
Passages which we find in the Scriptures (especially the Old Testament) relating to the <hi>Measures of Submission.</hi> But these Examples weigh nothing with our Author, because they are not for his purpose, <hi>pag.</hi> 5, 6. I am also apt to suspect that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> would not have thanked any Politician for vending this as a certain and fundamental Principle, <q>That in all Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes between Power and Liberty, Power must always be proved, but Liberty proves it self; the one being founded only upon a positive Law, and the other upon the Law of Nature, <hi>pag.</hi> 4.</q> She, I perswade my self, on the contrary, would have challenged any such States-man to have prov'd his Liberty; as for her Power (she would have answered) it was ready to prove it self against all who should presume to questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. But what's the meaning of <hi>Power being founded only on a positive Law, and Liberty upon the Law of Nature?</hi> Is not a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Power founded (as he grants) upon the Law of Nature? and is not all Power, even of the greatest Princes, (as far as it is just and honest, and for the Benefit of the Subject) derived from this Paternal Authority of the Father over his Son? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, doth not the Law of Nature prescribe the Necessity of putting Power into the Hands of one or more for the Benefit of the whole, which otherwise would be in danger of destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it self by intestine Divisions? In short, If Liberty be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Law of Nature, so is all just and lawful Power, since the end of it is only to regulate our Liberty, and in truth to make us more free. Liberty in general is a right to use our Faculties according to right Reason; and the Law in particular tells us which are those Rules of right Reason by which we must govern our selves. And what is Law, but the Commands of the Supreme Power (where-ever it is lodg'd, in the hands of the Prince, the Senate, or the People, or of all of them together) or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what we are to do or avoid, under the Sanction of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Penalties?</p>
                  <p>I beg the Learned Author's Pardon for questioning his Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures: in my Judgment they are not taken from the <hi>English Standard,</hi> and therefore I hope I may without Offence use my Liberty in refusing them (a Right which proves it self) till he can prove his Power to impose them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Enquiry into the present State of Affairs,</hi> is a Discourse which seems (by its bold strokes) to resemble the former. I
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60825:174"/>
will say no more of it but this, If what he there lays down for a certain Truth be really so, then all that follows must be granted, as reasonable Deductions from this fundamental Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple: but if this be false, all that he hath said falls to the Ground, for want of a firm and solid Foundation to support it.</p>
                  <p>Now the Position, which (like a first Principle in Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks) he takes for granted, is this, <q>It is certain (says he, <hi>pag.</hi> 1.) that the reciprocal Duties in Civil Societies, are Protection and Allegiance; and wheresoever the one fails wholly, the other falls with it.</q> This is his Doctrine which I have mentioned before, but shall now consider a little more particularly.</p>
                  <p>'Tis indeed most fit and reasonable, that <hi>Protection</hi> and <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance</hi> should always go together, and accompany one another; but that they do not do so, is but too plain in the present case of <hi>England:</hi> but doth it follow, that because the King is not in a Capacity to protect his Subjects, therefore he is no longer to be look'd upon as a King? And if he be a King, doth not this suppose that he hath some Subjects? And if so, I would gladly know what kind of Subjects they are who owe no Allegiance?</p>
                  <p>But let this Question be rul'd by his own Instance, The Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty betwixt Father and Son. Suppose my Father to be so desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute that he cannot, and so perverse, that he will not protect and sustain me; suppose him as churlish as <hi>Cain,</hi> and as poor as <hi>Iob</hi>; yet still he is my Father, and I am his Son; that is, he still retains all that Power which (by the Law of Nature) a Father ought to have over his Child: still the Relation holds betwixt us, and whilst it doth so, the Father's Faults or Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities cannot evacuate the Duty of a Son; which is founded not in the Fathers good Will or Abilities to defend him (though it must be confess'd they are chiefly consider'd) but in that fix'd and immutable Relation which God and Nature have establish'd betwixt them, not to be dissolv'd but by Death. So that if this learned Author will yield (as he seems to do) that <hi>Kingly Power</hi> is nothing else but the <hi>Paternal,</hi> consign'd (by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon consent of the Fathers of Families) to one Person, upon such and such Conditions, (specified in the Contract;) I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see how this Relation betwixt King and Subject can any
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60825:174"/>
more be utterly dissolved, than that betwixt a Father and his Son.</p>
                  <p>I shall say no more to this Discourse; and if what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready said do offend either against the Principles of Reason, or the Law of <hi>England,</hi> I am willing to be corrected, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg my Error.</p>
                  <p>There is another little Paper which yet gives such a great stroke to the Government, that it ought not to be pass'd over without some Animadversion. The Sheet which I mean is, that which is call'd <hi>Advice before it be too late,</hi> or <hi>A Breviate for the Convention.</hi> This Paper bespeaks its Author to be of the same Complexion and Principles with him who writ <hi>the Word to the Wise,</hi> and <hi>the four Questions debated.</hi> They do all of them suppose, that the Government is fallen to its Centre, or Root from whence it sprang, that is, to the People (as the <hi>Word to the Wise</hi> expresses our present case.) I know not what can be a more effectual Answer to these Pamphlets, and take away the Foundation upon which they argue, than that Maxim in our Law, received by all honest and learned Lawyers, <hi>The King of</hi> England <hi>never dies.</hi> For if so, how is the Government laps'd? And if it be not laps'd, how can the Throne be said to be vacant? And if the Throne be not vacant, we are still a Body Politick, (consisting of Head and Members) though much distemper'd and out of order, by reason of the Infirmities of the Head. We still live, tho we are not in good Health; and our Case doth not require the Sexton to make our Grave, but calls for the Physician to apply proper Remedies to cure our Disease. If the King can dye, 'tis such a defect in our Government as doth strangely disparage it, and further supposes, that (which hitherto we are all to learn) the Crown is not Successive.</p>
                  <p>Now if it be successive, it cannot be disposed of by the Will of the People, but only by the Will of God; who in that very moment calls the lawful Heir to the Crown, wherein he is pleased to put a Period to the Life of his Predecessor. If he be said that the Voice of the People is the Voice of God, I believe that (should this be granted) it will not do their Business: for I doubt not, but that if the Pole was taken, and the Question put to all People who are of Years of Discretion; the Answer would be, That they have still a King, and that they are as willing to keep him, as they are desirous to exclude Popery
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60825:175"/>
for ever; that which hath made both him and them so unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. This, I do not much question, would be the Answer, if we should appeal to the sense of the People in general; who yet (if the Government be fallen to them) must be allowed to have a right of Suffrage, and a Liberty to speak their Minds as freely as other Commoners in this great Convention.</p>
                  <p>Further still, If the King never dies by our Law, how can he be lawfully depos'd? For by Deposition the Throne necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily becomes void for some time. There must be some Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, some space of time, before they who depos'd a King can set up another; and till the King in Designation be actually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested with the Regal Office, there must of Necessity be an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terregnum</hi>; that is, The King (contrary to the Mind of our Law) may dye.</p>
                  <p>The Government of <hi>England</hi> always supposes a Monarch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by Law, and therefore 'tis presumed that he can do no wrong; that is, though he may err, as well as other Mortals, yet the Law, of which he is the Guardian, brings no Accusation against him, but only against his evil Ministers. If therefore the King hath err'd, (as doubtless he hath very much) in God's Name let his Ministers be called to an account; but why must the Government be dissolved, and the King arraign'd, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd, and depos'd, to make way for any new Scheme of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment whatsoever, whether <hi>French, Italian,</hi> or <hi>Dutch?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our History indeed affords two Examples since <hi>William</hi> the First's time; that of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, and the other of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second: but they did both of them actually resign; and besides, what they did, or was done to them, ought to preclude the right of no succeeding Prince. These Examples ought no more to be urged than the stabbing King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of <hi>France,</hi> or the murthering King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the First of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Historian, in the Life of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, gives no very good Character of that Parliament, which pass'd the Vote for this Deposition: <q>The Noblemen (says he) partly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by Favour, partly aw'd by Fear, gave their Voices; and the Commons (commonly are like a Flock of Cranes) as the first fly, all the Followers do the like.</q> 
                     <hi>Continuat. Dan. Hist. p.</hi> 46.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:60825:175"/>Let it be here observed, that I do not dispute whether the King, together with his Parliament, may not regulate and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail the Succession, as shall by them be thought fit; but only whether whilst the King lives, whether the Throne can be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, and the Government be truly said to be laps'd? This we deny: But however, supposing that these things may be so, who can make so fair a Claim (and so generally satisfactory to the People) as the next Heir by Proximity of Blood; I mean (if the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> be proved supposititious) that incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Lady, the Princess of <hi>Orange?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These Reflections I have thought fit to make upon some new Notions of our present States-men, by which we guess what they would be at. In my Opinion, I think it is but too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that they are taking Advantage of our present Fears and Distractions, to run us into those Extremes which the State (as well as the Church) of <hi>England</hi> hath always carefully avoided, and taken particular care to provide against.</p>

In this Design can we in Honour and Conscience go along with them; whom yet we cannot but highly esteem and value for their Learning and Parts, and more especially for their happy and successful Labours, in rescuing us from those gross Corruptions of Christian Religion, and human Nature, Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Slavery?</p>
                  <p>But shall we run into <hi>Popery,</hi> and perhaps Slavery too, when we have been so long stri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing against both, and are now (Thanks be to God) in a great measure freed from the Danger of either? And is not the Deposing a Popish Doctrine? And is it not as Antichristian for any Assembly to put it into Practice, as it was for the Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> at first to establish it?</p>
                  <p>And as for <hi>Slavery,</hi> must not a standing Army be necessarily kept up, to maintain a Title founded only upon the consent of the fickle and uncertain People (granting that the major part of them are willing?) And in such a case must we not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to the Goodness of the Prince, rather than the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Laws, if an Arbitrary and Despotick Power be not again introduced?</p>
                  <p>We have, as yet, no Law which wholly disables and excludes a Popish Successor from the Throne; and till we have one (which I question not but we shall have soon) I do not see how we can disanul the King's Title, or vacate his Regal Capacity,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60825:176"/>
howsoever his Power may be restrained. Innovations without former Precedent, are always dangerous, especially those of this Nature. It will be much more wise, as well as safe, to bear with some Inconveniencies, than bring upon our selves those Mischiefs, which such unparallel'd Proceedings may produce.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in his additional Declaration hath these Words: <q>We are confident, that no Persons can have such hard Thoughts of us, as to imagine that we have any other Design in this Undertaking, than to procure a Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Religion, and of the Liberties and Properties of the Subjects upon so sure a Foundation, that there may be no danger of the Nations relapsing into the like Miseries at any time hereafter.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>How far some Persons may extend this Clause [that there may be no Danger of the Nations relapsing into the like Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for the future] I cannot tell; but for any one to understand it so, as if his Highness meant, that there could be no Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty against the Nations Relapse, if the King be not deposed, and he himself put into Possession of the Throne, is (I am sure) an Interpretation very disadvantageous to his Honour, and looks more like a Jesuitical Equivocation, than that Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and Christian Sincerity, which hath brightned and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered illustrious all the Actions of his Highness, both at home and abroad.</p>
                  <p>The Answerer also to the Reflecter upon (his Highness's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, will not permit us to harbour any such Suspicions, as if a Crown was the End of this Expedition. <q>All such (says he, <hi>pag.</hi> 23, 24.) as believe the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> has brought this Army, and intends to make War upon <hi>England,</hi> and subdue it to his mere Will and Pleasure, trample all Laws both Divine and Human under feet; dethrone his present Majesty, and make himself King; they will stay and fight for him (<hi>sc.</hi> the King) or at least to the best of their Power, in some manner assist and help him: On the contrary, such as believe that the Prince's meaning is nothing of all this, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here, you see, that this Author (who, 'tis to be supposed, was not unacquainted with the Prince's Intentions) utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects it, as a false Imputation, that his Highness came to dethrone
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60825:176"/>
                     <hi>his present Majesty, and make himself King.</hi> Nay, he thought himself obliged so fully to declare against this scandalous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that he seems to have encouraged all those who believed it, <hi>To stay and fight for the King; or at least, to the best of their power, in some manner assist and help him.</hi> So far was this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman from entertaining any such thoughts of the Prince's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition; which some Men, nevertheless, do now so industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously labor to make the effect of it.</p>
                  <p>There is another thing which makes well-meaning Men apt to suspect the present management, and with holds them from closing with it so fully, as otherwise, its probable they might do. That Paper which goes under the Title of the <hi>Prince's Third Declaration,</hi> is (as I am credibly informed) none of his, and is disowned by the Prince himself. Now this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Declaration (coming out when the Army was in such a dubious Condition, and fluctuating betwixt the King and the Prince) did more harm to the King's Affairs, than all the other Papers (I believe) published at that time.</p>
                  <p>And if this was no real, but a sham Declaration, and yet was permitted without Contradiction, 'tis plain that Sophistry and Tricks are made use of, as lawful Polices, and that any kind of means are permitted, if they will but do the business, and serve the present turn. This makes plain and honest Men, who have no Ends to serve, but what are just, and are willing to use no kind of Means but what are so: This makes them shie and cautious of engaging too far in those Designs, which they see carried on by crafty and deceitful Artifices working under a Military Power and Force ready to defend them.</p>
                  <p>I might mention the great number of Papists in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Army, as another disswasive from venturing our selves in this bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom: We are afraid of Papists of all sorts and of all Countrie, <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> as well as <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi>; the Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the one may be more harmless than of the other; but the Principles of both (we know) are equally destructive; and when occasion serves, who knows but that the Principle may prevail over the Constitution, and the <hi>Papist</hi> get the better of the <hi>Dutch-man?</hi> 'Tis ill trusting Popery in any shape: This is a Root, which wherever it is planted, can bring forth no good Fruit. The Bogs of <hi>Holland</hi> cannot (we think) make it less malignant, than those of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:60825:177"/>To come to a conclusion, there remain several things to be cleared, before we can altogether comply with what is now prosecuted with so much Zeal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the</hi> Prince of W. <hi>is a supposititious Child: That a League was made by our King with the King of</hi> France <hi>for the Destruction of his Protestant Subjects, and rooting out our Religion, under the Notion of the Northern Heresy: That the late King was poysoned; and that the Earl of</hi> Essex <hi>was murthered.</hi> These things, we desire, may be proved; and then we cannot but agree, that nothing can be too bad for the guilty Authors.</p>
                  <p>These are such damnable Villanies, such horrid Crimes, that both the Principles and Accessories ought to be esteemed, and treated no better than <hi>Tories</hi> and <hi>Banditti,</hi> Men of seared and profligate Consciences, forsaken of God, and Enemies to Mankind.</p>
                  <p>But then seeing these are such heavy Accusations and grievous Charges, they ought certainly to be well proved before they be believed, and produced as Arguments against the Life, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Estate of any Person: for <hi>si satis esset accusasse,</hi> &amp;c. If it be enough to accuse, where should we find an innocent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?</p>
                  <p>If these dreadful things can be made out, it would, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, not only confirm Protestants in their deserved Dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station of Popery, but create even in the minds of honest Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists themselves, an Aversation to their own Religion, when they shall see it contriving and executing such cruel and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural <hi>Works of darkness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To see a Father setting up a pretended Son against the Interest of his own undoubted Children; to behold a King bargaining for the Destruction of his own Subjects; to represent to our Minds one Brother preparing the deadly Cup for the other, who yet ventur'd his Crown rather than he would <hi>exclude</hi> him from the hopes of it in <hi>Reversion</hi>; to look upon the same Royal Person plotting and managing the <hi>Assassination</hi> of a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and helpless Peer. These are such dismal Sights and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick Scenes, so full of Horror and barbarous Cruelty, that they must needs make sad Impressions upon the Hearts even of the boldest Spectators; insomuch, that if they were proved, they would most effectually prejudice all Men against the Author of such monstrous Barbarities, and go near to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60825:177"/>
all Obligations of Duty which otherwise they might owe to his Person and Authority.</p>
                  <p>We must therefore call again for the Proof of these things, or else we cannot (because we ought not to) believe them upon bare Surmise and Hear-say. If these Accusations be cleared once, who can reverence the Person guilty of them, as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Country, and not rather avoid and fly from him as the worst of Tyrants?</p>
                  <p>But if these things be still kept in the Clouds, and wrap'd up in uncertain Ambiguities, all wise Men will think that it would have been better, if they never had been mentioned; because this doth but raise the Peoples Zeal for the present, which (if not kept up by real Evidence) will be apt to turn to the other Extream, and commiserate the Cause which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it prosecuted with so much violence. The higher Mens Resentments are raised by objecting the most notorious Crimes, the lower will they fall, if Truth and plain matter of Fact doth not back and maintain them. And this is an Advantage which I would not have us give our Adversaries in these things, no more than we have done in the matters of Dispute betwixt them and us. Here we have proved all our Charges against their Religion; let us therefore prove, or else not so eagerly insist upon these Accusations brought against their Persons.</p>
                  <p>I shall add nothing further, but my real Wishes, That I could (tho with the loss of all that's dear to me in this World) contribute to the utter <hi>Exclusion of Popery</hi> by all lawful means; and I do, and shall always pray for a Blessing upon their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, who sincerely endeavour to <hi>procure a Settlement of the Religion, Liberties and Properties of the Subjects, upon so sure a foundation, that there may be no danger of the Nations relapsing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the like miseries at any time hereafter.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>A Man must read much of this Author's profound Work, before he can fathom the Depths of it, and find what his Design is, or whether indeed he has any Design at all, unless it be that of making a Book.</p>
                  <p>He tells us at length after much Strugling, and a tedious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of what every body knows (perhaps) better than himself, <q>That all Orders of Men, Ecclesiastick, Civil, and Military, did put the Regal Administration into the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Hands, and that the Intent of our Proceedings will at least excuse, if not justify us.</q> I would have this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gentleman inform the World into what Hands the Regal Administration could be better put? And if the Nation could not do better, whether this their Action does not justify it self? But says he a little above, <q>How did we all generally concur, and unanimously agree to forget our Obligations to our Soveraign. And in Page 4, he tells us, That the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> hath done a great thing for us, and wrought such Deliverance for the Nation as ought never to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and can never be sufficiently requited.</q> I do not at all doubt but this Gentleman can more easily write half a dozen such Books as this is, than reconcile these notable Passages. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges we have been rescued out of the Hands of him that hated us, and would have destroyed us without a cause, and yet reproaches us with <hi>forgetting our Obligations to our Soveraign.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Page 5. he has this sharp Question, <q>Let every Man ask himself, for what reason he became a party in this general Defection? Was it to divest the King of all Power to protect
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60825:178"/>
his Subjects? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> To repeat these Absurdities is a sufficient Answer to them.</p>
                  <p>And then again in the next Page, <q>That whatever some obnoxious and ambitious Men might aim at, all good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians had other Intentions. They were sensibly concerned for the Preservation of their Holy Religion, in the first place: Their Lives, their Laws<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their Liberties, in the next: And after the way which some call Heresy, so were they desirous still to worship the God of their Fathers; and after that manner which some might say was Rebellion, so they thought themselves oblig'd to stand up for the Laws and Liberties of their Forefathers.</q> What measures of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence this Man is for, and what he would have us to do, or not to do, I am not able to divine from his Book, for he seems to dislike in one place, what he approves in another. But he tells us in Page 6, &amp; 7 of his Fears of the Government being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined both in Church and State, and that he shall be reduced to the <hi>Dutch</hi> or some other foreign measures, which can never be well received in <hi>England</hi> till an Act be past to abolish Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, Episcopacy, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>If this Gentleman's Distractions be not so great as to hinder him the use of his two chief Senses, he may now perceive that his Fears are as vain, as others perceive his Reasoning to be.</p>
                  <p>But in Page 8. he states a notable Question, for he supposes <hi>his Father to be as churlish as</hi> Cain, <hi>and as poor as</hi> Job, and yet maintains he is his Father.</p>
                  <p>O admirably put! But what's this to a King's apparent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of ruining and enslaving a People, who have the same both Natural and Civil Right to their Lives and Liberties, as he has to his?</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But shall we run (says he) into Popery, and perhaps Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very too? and is not the Deposing a Popish Doctrine? <hi>p.</hi> 11. and as for Slavery, Must not a standing Army be necessarily kept up to maintain a Title founded only on the consent of the fickle and uncertain People?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Lords and Commons of <hi>England</hi> are this fickle and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain People; I know not where our Author will find more substantial Folks, unless he fancies they are to be met with amongst the <hi>Mobile.</hi> And as to the Popish Deposing Doctrine, I have already shewed our case comes in no sort near it; for
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60825:179"/>
the late King's Religion did not hinder his possessing himself of the Throne, neither was that the Cause of his leaving it, for he might have enjoyed it and made the best of it, as to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, in all Freedom, but he thought it beneath him to stop here, and not impose his false Worship on all his Subjects, tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling all the Laws of the Kingdom under his Feet, and thereby claiming not only an absolute Empire over the Bodies, but the Minds of his Subjects.</p>
                  <p>Our Author likewise shews himself a notable Well-wisher to our Religion and Liberties, when he represents a standing Army (<hi>page</hi> 11.) in the present Exigency of Affairs, to be such a Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and that too under a Prince, who has not been only born and educated in the greatest Aversion to Popery, and the only Prince uncorrupted by the French King, but whose Genius and Interests do every ways so answer the Necessity of our Nation, that we have no other cause of Fear or Trouble, but at the sense of our own Unworthiness of so great a Blessing.</p>
                  <p>He seems in <hi>p.</hi> 12, and 13, to be in great Labour, left the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> should make himself a King contrary to the express Terms of his Declaration, and Pretences of coming over here. To which may be answered, that he has in no sort violated that Declaration, for he did not thrust himself into the Throne; and as to his being so now, both <hi>de jure</hi> and <hi>de facto,</hi> this being a matter decided by the Justice, Wisdom and Supream Authority of the Nation, it's foolish Presumption, and no less conceited Ignorance for any private Person to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue it.</p>
                  <p>Our wise Author seems to be moreover concerned and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubled at the Effects produced by the third Declaration, for he says, <q>It did more harm to the King's Affairs, than all the other Papers publisht at that time; whence he concludes its plain that Sophistry and Tricks are made use of, if they will but do the Business.</q> What would this Man have? would he have both to succeed, when he elsewhere acknowledges, that the late King's Design was to ruin us, and the Prince's to prevent it? As to Tricks and Sophistry, I detest them as much as any Man, yet think such harmless Guides (who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was the Author) less pernicious and destructive than force and bloodshed.</p>

                  <p>But before this worthy Author can come to a Conclusion of his Book, he must have several things proved to him: to wit, <q>That the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> is a supposititious Child; that a League was made by our King with the King of <hi>France,</hi> for the Destruction of his Protestant Subjects, and rooting out our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion under the Notion of the Northern Heresy; that the late King was poyson'd; and that the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.

                  <p>IN the Tract of these Years, although Informing was a Trade more encouraged than in the Reign of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> yet they arraigned Multitudes without Informer or Accuser; and whosoever appeared not upon their Summer Citation (which often times was impossible) were treated as Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals.</p>
                  <p>They seized many of all Ranks, and detained them Months, and Years, without any Signification of the cause of their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment; and seldom liberate any such without Exorbitant Bail: but if they could find the least Shadow to prosecute any suspected to mislike their Arbitrary Courses, they precipitated their Process, not allowing them time or means to vindicate their Innocency.</p>
                  <p>They sent their Inquisitors through their Prisons and Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens Houses, to examine whom they pleased, upon most intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Questions of Church and State Government, and made their refusing to answer, or dissatisfactory Answers, the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of their Indictments; others seized in the Crowd at Executions, and some when visiting the imprisoned, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and executed, for refusing to justify their Severities
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60825:180"/>
against their Brethren, and disowning their <hi>Dagon</hi> of Nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance.</p>
                  <p>They frequently sent out Spies to Prisons, Cities and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, under Disguise, who by simulating their Dissatisfaction at the Exorbitances of the Government, and Zeal for perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted Piety, might draw Words from the most wary, sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such and other Informers as habil Witnesses to the taking away the Lives of many Innocents, notwithstanding of one Express Act of Parliament to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>They often prosecuted without a Libel: and when they formed Libels, they seldom restricted themselves to the Points therein contained, holding them, as confessed who refused to answer their captious and extraneous Questions.</p>
                  <p>They not only employed Emissaries, but Judges themselves were active to suborn Witnesses against the Lives, Estates and Honours of Peers and worthy Patriots (a palpably gross Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of such an Intrigue, having qualified a Person for a chief Seat in their High Court of Justice) and when they could not find such Execrable Russians to serve their turns, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Pannals to answer <hi>de super Inquirendis,</hi> in the most Criminal Cases. They have often sustained Jurors and Witnesses, who could not purge themselves of Prejudice or partial Counsel.</p>
                  <p>They have Indicted, Tryed, Condemned and executed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in one day; and when Intercession hath been made for some time to prepare for Death, it hath been answered, They shall have no time to prepare for Heaven, Hell is too good for them. They have kept some in Expectation of Reprieves and Pardons, till the very Day and Hour of their Execution; others they have hanged early in the Morning, thereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the Peoples seeing their Cruelty, and hearing the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Persons last Words, and too palpably designing by such Surprizals the Ruine of their Souls. They frequently beat Drums about the Scaffolds, their Cause being such as could not bear the Words of dying Christians. They searched several, when removing them from the Prison to the Scrffold, seized their Testimonies, that so they might not come to publick.</p>
                  <p>They would have their Laws to reach Thoughts as well as Actions, and many against whom they could charge no matter of Fact, they sought to reach their Lives for their Thoughts, asking them, What think you of the Government, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> Some
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60825:181"/>
they have wheedled to Confession, by promising to favour their Ingenuity, upbraiding them for Dissemblers if they would not speak freely, and by mock-Expostulations; <hi>viz.</hi> Are ye asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of your Principles? Are ye afraid to give a Testimony, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> and forced them to subscribe their Confessions before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, which they produced as Witness against them at the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Court, whereupon they were Sentenced and Executed.</p>
                  <p>When any refused to give Categorical Answers, then could they extort all by Torture, with their Engines of Cruelty, the Boots, fired Matches betwixt the Fingers and Thumkins; and after torturing, hanged several, though thereby they could extort nothing.</p>
                  <p>When some had answered all their Questions, and cleared themselves of all charged against them, yet would they not pass them so, but impose some of their wicked Oaths, which they concluded they would not take, and according to the measure of Tenderness they discovered in any, they apporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the Oaths; to the stricter the more smooth; to the laxer the more harsh, such as once their own Natural Consciences did fear at.</p>
                  <p>They required not only to have their Laws obeyed, but subscribed also, holding it not sufficient that People transgress them not, but likewise own the Justice of them, and the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of the Authority enacting them, and swear to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them; and yet when some have complyed to all they sought, yet would they not discharge them, but upon Bond to answer again when called.</p>
                  <p>Not only Extrajudicial Confession will sustain with them, but when they have given the publick Faith, the King's Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Act and Oath of Council, that such Confession should not militate, yet they have brought it in as Evidence, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it upon Oath, when their former Act and Oath was produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in open Court in Demonstration of their Perjury.</p>
                  <p>They used frequently to pack Juries, picking out such as they thought any thing tender, and not bloody enough, and sometimes listed some who they concluded would not concur, that thereupon they might get occasion to exact their Fines.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes when the Jury hath brought in their Verdict in Favour of the Pannal, they have made them return and resume the Cognition of the Process again, and threatned them with
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60825:181"/>
an Assize of Error if they did not bring him in Guilty, yea frequently the Advocate theatned them under most peremptory Certifications if they found not the Impannalled Guilty; so that their using Juries was but for the Fashion.</p>
                  <p>They have sentenced innocent Persons twice, once to have their Ears cut off and banished, and after the lopping of their Ears, they have re-examined them, and sentenced them to Death.</p>
                  <p>They used to stage several together, of whom they knew some would comply, to tantalize others with the sight of their Liberty, thereby tempting them to bite more eagerly at their snaring Baits, to wound the Conscience.</p>
                  <p>They have not only Murdered many innocent Christians in taking their Lives, but also endevou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Some they arraigned whom they could neither reach by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing many Witnesses against in Tryal, nor by their Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with their cruel Torture of the Boots, yet hath had their whole Estate seized, and also been sent to P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">I. THE necessity of a Parliament agreed by the Lords and Commons Voting that the Throne is Vacant; for there being a Vacancy, there follows an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate necessity of settling the Government, especially the Writs, being destroyed, and the Great Seal carryed away, put a peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od to all publick Justice, and then there must be a supply by such means as the necessity requires, or a failure of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Consider the Antecedents to the calling the Convention; that is, about three hundred of the Commons, which is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of the fullest House that can be made, above sixty Lords, being a greater number, than any part divided amounted to at this great Meeting, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council of the City of <hi>London,</hi> by application to His then Highness the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> desired him to accept of the Administration of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

he was pleased to do, to the great satisfaction of all good Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and after that His Highness was desired to Issue forth His Circular Letters to the Lords; and the like to the Coroners, and in their absence to the Clerks of the Peace, to Elect Knights, Citizens and Burgesses; this was more than was done in Fifty nine, for the calling a Parliament in <hi>April</hi> 1660. for there the Summons was not real, but fictitious, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) in the names of the Keepers of the Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> a meer No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion set up as a Form, there being no such Persons, but a meer <hi>Ens rationis,</hi> impossible really to exist: so that here was much more done than in 1659, and all really done which was possible to be invented, as the Affairs then stood. Besides King <hi>Ch.</hi> the 2d. had not abdicated the Kingdom, but was willing to return, and was at <hi>Breda,</hi> whither they might have sent for Writs, and in the mean time have kept their form of Keepers of the Liberties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in the present case there was no King in being, nor any style or form of Government, neither real, or notional left; so that in all these respects, more was done before, and at the calling of this Great Convention, than for calling that Parliament (for so I must call it) yet that Parliament made several Acts, in all thirty seven, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by <hi>Keebles</hi> Statutes, and several of them not confirmed; I shall instance but in one, but it is one which there was occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to use in every County of <hi>England</hi>; I mean the Act for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming and Restoring Ministers, being the 17<hi>th</hi> of that Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; all the Judges allowed of this as an Act of Parliament, tho' never confirmed, which is a stronger case than that in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, for there was only fictitious Summons, here a real one.</p>

and as if the King had been present at the beginning of the Parliament, this I take to be a full Judgment in full Parliament of the case in question, and much stronger than the present case is, and this Parliament continued till the 29<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> next following, and made in all thirty seven Acts, as abo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The 13 <hi>Caroli</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 7. (a full Parliament called by the Kings Writ) recites the other of 12 <hi>Caroli</hi> 2. and that after his Majesties return they were continued till the 29<hi>th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> and then dissolved, and that several Acts passed; this is the plain Judgment of another Parliament.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because it says they were continued, which shews they had a real being capable of being continued; for a Confirmation of a void Grant has no effect, and Confirmation shews a Grant only voidable so the continuance there shewed it at most but voida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and when the King came, and confirm'd it, all was good.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The dissolving it then, shews they had a being, for, as <hi>ex nihilo nihil sit,</hi> so <hi>super nihil nil operatur,</hi> as out of nothing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be made, so upon nothing nothing can operate.</p>
                  <p>Again, the King, Lords and Commons, make the great Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration or Body of the Kingdom, and the Commons are le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally taken for the Free-holders, <hi>Inst.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 2. Now the Lords and Commons having Proclaimed the King, the defect of this great Corporation is cured, and all the Essential parts of this great Body Politique united and made compleat, as plainly as when the Mayor of a Corporation dies, and another is chosen, the Corporation is again perfect; and to say, that which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the great Body Politique should in the same instant destroy it, I mean the Parliament, is to make contradictions true, <hi>simul &amp; semel,</hi> the perfection, and destruction of this great Body at one instant, and by the same Act.</p>
                  <p>Then if necessity of Affairs was a forcible Argument in 1660, a time of great peace, not only in <hi>England,</hi> but throughout <hi>Europe,</hi> and almost in all the World; certainly 'tis of a greater force now, when <hi>England</hi> is scarce delivered from Popery and Slavery; when <hi>Ireland</hi> has a mighty Army of Papists, and that Kingdom in hazard of final destruction, if not speedily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented; and when <hi>France</hi> has destroyed most of the Protestants there, and threatens the ruin of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> from whence God has sent the wonderful Assistance of our Gracious, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60825:183"/>
therefore most Glorious King; and <hi>England</hi> cannot promise safety from that Forreign Power, when forty days delay, which is the least can be for a new Parliament, and considering we can never hope to have one more freely chosen, because first it was so free from Court-influence, or likelihood of all design that the Letters of Summons issued by him, whom the great God in infinite Mercy raised to save us, to the hazard of his Life, and this done to protect the Protestant Religion and at a time when the people were all concerned for one Common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of Religion, and Liberty, it would be vain when we have the best King and Queen the World affords, a full house of Lords, the most solemnly chosen Commons that ever were in the remembrance of any Man Living, to spend Mony and lose time (I had almost said to despise Providence) and take great pains to destroy our selves.</p>
                  <p>If any object Acts of Parliament mentioning Writs and Summons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I answer, the Precedent in 1660 is after all those Acts.</p>
                  <p>In private cases as much has been done in point of necessity; a Bishop Provincial dies, and <hi>sede vacant</hi> a Clerk is presented to a Benefice, the Presentation to the Dean and Chapter is good in this case of Necessity; and if in a Vacancy by the Death of a Bishop a Presentation shall be good to the Dean and Chapter, rather than a prejudice should happen by the Church lying void; Surely <hi>â fortiori</hi>—Vacancy of the Throne may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied without the formality of a Writ, and the great Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on turn'd to a Real Parliament.</p>
                  <p>A Summons in all points is of the same real force as a Writ, for a Summons and a Writ differ no more than in name, the thing is the same in all Substantial parts; the Writ is Record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Chancery, so are His Highnesses Letters; the proper Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer Endorses the Return, so he does here, (for the Coroner in defect of the Sheriff is the proper Officer;) the People Choose by virtue of the Writ, so they did freely by Virtue of the Letters, <hi>&amp;c. &amp; quae re concordant parum differunt,</hi> they agree in Reality, and then what difference is there between the one and the other?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> A Writ must be in Actions at Common Law, else all Pleadings after, will not make it good, but Judgment given may be Reversed by a Writ of Error.</p>

                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:60825:184"/>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The case differs, first, because Actions between party and party, are Adversary Actions, but Summons to Parliament are not so, but are Mediums only to have an Election.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In Actions at Law the Defendant may plead to the Writ, but there is no plea to a Writ for electing Members to serve in Parliament; and for this I have <hi>Littleton's</hi> Argument, there never was such Plea, therefore none lies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> That they have not taken the Test.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> They may take the Test yet; and then all which they do will be good, for the Test being the distinguishing Mark of a Protestant from a Papist, when that is taken, the end of the Law is performed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> That the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy ought to be taken, and that the new ones are not legal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The Convention being the Supream Power, have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolish'd the old Oaths, and have made new ones; and as to the making new Oaths, the like was done in <hi>Alfreds</hi> time, when they chose him King; <hi>vide</hi> Mirror of Justice. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. for the Heptarchy being turn'd to a Monarchy, the precedent Oaths of the seven Kings could not be the same King <hi>Alfred</hi> swore.</p>
                  <p>Many Precedents may be cited, where Laws have been made in Parliament, without the King's Writ to summon them, which for brevity's sake I forbear to mention.</p>

                  <p>The Catholicks are for one Universal Organical Church throughout the World, whereof the Pope is Head, according to some; and the Bishops Convened in a General Council, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to others.</p>

                  <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> then is a Political Society of all the Christians in the Land, united in the King as Head, and organized by the Bishops, for the executing those Laws or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which he chooses for their spiritual Good and the publick Peace.</p>
                  <p>There is this difference between a Church <hi>National,</hi> the Church <hi>Catholick,</hi> and <hi>Particular</hi> Churches: The two latter-are of <hi>Divine Right</hi> and <hi>Essential Consideration,</hi> but the former is and can be only of <hi>Humane Institution,</hi> for it is manifestly <hi>Accidental</hi> to the Church of Christ that the chief Magistrate and the whole People should be <hi>Christian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Distinguish we here of the Government of the Church as <hi>Internal</hi> belonging to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>External</hi> which belongs to <hi>Men:</hi> And of the <hi>External</hi> Regiment thereof, which is either <hi>Formal</hi> belonging to the <hi>Ministers,</hi> or Officers of Christ; or <hi>Objective,</hi> belonging to the <hi>Magistrate:</hi> the one being only by the <hi>Keyes,</hi> the other by the <hi>Sword.</hi> Whether the Community now of Christians in <hi>England</hi> may be accounted a National Church in respect to any Formal Government of it, we leave for dispute to others; let them judg according to the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Definition of a Political Church: But that the main Body of the Nation are, or may be constituted a proper Political Church National in respect to that External Objective Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is, or should be exercised by the Bishops as the proper Organs thereof under the King, is what we hold rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, and would lay as the Foundation-Stone of Peace, in

                  <p>Let the Parliament therefore we have, be heartily for the Publick Good, and thriving of <hi>England,</hi> which must and can be only by an entire Liberty of Conscience in opposition to the narrow Spirit of any single Party or Faction, and when such a Parliament as this shall set themselves about the Business of Union to purpose, a Bill should be brought in, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>An Act for declaring the Constitution of our Church of England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Parliament is the Representative of the whole Nation, and no doubt but by Consent and Agreement they might (upon the account mentioned) <hi>Make</hi> a new Constitution, and much more may they <hi>Declare</hi> the Constitution of it.</p>
                  <p>It should be declared then in such a Bill or Act that the Church of <hi>England</hi> consists of the King as the Head, or <hi>pars Imperans,</hi> who is to give Laws thereto, and all the several As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies of Christians which he shall tolerate, as the <hi>pars sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dita,</hi> or Body.</p>
                  <p>Some Discrimination between the <hi>Tolerable</hi> and <hi>Intolerable</hi> is indeed never to be gainsaid by any wise and good Man; unto whom there is no Liberty can be desirable, which is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent at least with these three things, the <hi>Articles</hi> of our <hi>Creed,</hi> a <hi>Good Life,</hi> and the Fundamental <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom.</hi>

Again, the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters</hi> of all sorts, even the <hi>Congregationalists</hi> of every Sect, are ready to submit to any power legally derived from the King and upon such an account will admit of a superintendency of the Bishops, as Ecclesiastical Magistrates under him, when they cannot own any Authority that they have over other Ministers from <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>; and will not Papists also be subject to all Authority that is exercised legally in his Name, howsoever they may question the Spiritual Title of the English Clergy and their succession?</p>
                  <p>We would have the Bishops then (<hi>qua Bishops,</hi> as distinct in <hi>Office</hi> from <hi>Priests</hi>) declared no other than the King's Officers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whose power is but <hi>Objectively</hi> Ecclesiastical, and to act <hi>Circa Sacra</hi> only, by Vertue of his Authority and Commission.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> did comit the Charge incumbent upon him as Supreme Magistrate, in regard to all <hi>Matters of the Lord,</hi> unto the care of <hi>Amariah,</hi> being <hi>Chief Priest,</hi> and in regard to the <hi>King's Matters</hi> unto <hi>Zebadiah,</hi> being as the <hi>Chief Iustice</hi> of the Realm: so should the Diocesian Bishop be in our <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> as the Judges are in <hi>Civil</hi> Matters the Substitutes altogether of His Majesty, and execute his Jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>This is indeed at State point which was throughly canvased by <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Eight,</hi> whose Divines did agree on two Orders alone, <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>Deacon,</hi> to be of <hi>Divine</hi> Appointment, and that the Superiority of a Bishop over a Presbyter, or of one Bishop over another, was but by the <hi>Positive</hi> Laws of Men only, as appears in that Authentick Book then put out, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>The Necessary Eru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To the making such Canons, we humbly motion a third <hi>Clerk</hi> for the <hi>Convocation,</hi> to be added to the two in every <hi>Diocess,</hi> and chose out of the <hi>Dissenters</hi> with indifferent respect to all sorts of them, that mutual Satisfaction and Concord my there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be prosecuted with unanimity of Heart and Good will throughout all the Churche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:60825:187"/>
and <hi>York</hi> should <hi>unite</hi> in this Convocation for the making them one <hi>National Church,</hi> and not two <hi>Provincial</hi> ones in a diverse Assembly.</p>
                  <p>By this means shall one Organ more be added to this great Political Society for deriving an influence from the Head to these parts of the Body as well as others, which now seem neglected, and to have no care taken of them.</p>
                  <p>The more especial business of such an equally Modell'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation should be the revising the Book of Canons for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing the main body of them, having been fitted to that nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row scantling which is unworthy the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and for the leaving only those, and making new (as we have exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified in one or two for instance-sake even now) which do, and will suit to that larger Constitution thereof intended by this Paper.</p>
                  <p>And having now said thus much for Explanation of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, we must say some little also in favour of it.</p>
                  <p>The Design of such an Accommodation as this, shall <hi>advance</hi> not <hi>lessen</hi> the outward power and honour of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it over those who before had no conscientious regard for their Function: while yet it would ease them of the tremendous burden of such a <hi>Cura Animarum</hi> they take on them otherwise, as must be of impossible performance.</p>
                  <p>This Design (which is suppos'd to find us in our Divisions, and not to make any) shall by little and little (with God's bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing on it) cool Animosities, and enkindle Charity and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness among all parties, which now is so much wanting, while those that are Catholicks, and those that are Protestants, and much more those that are <hi>Conformists,</hi> and those that are <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confrmists,</hi> do agree in the substance of one Christianity, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the same Scriptures, the same Articles of Faith in the three Creeds, and the same Rule of Manners in the Decalogue, <hi>There is one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism.</hi> They cannot indeed have both Communion in the same Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Worship, but they can have it in the Internal Adoration of the same blessed Trinity, and in One Hope of our calling unto eternal Life through <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi> They must separate into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Congregations, but there shall be no <hi>Schism</hi> in the <hi>Body</hi> by this means for all that.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:60825:187"/>For as while the Supreme Power allows only the Parochial Meetings, as established by Law, it hath bin accounted Schism to go to Separate Assemblies: So if the Scene be altered, and these <hi>Separate</hi> Congregations be also made <hi>Legal,</hi> this <hi>Schism,</hi> or Mens being called <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> in that regard, must vanish and be at an end. Indeed these divers Congregations will Accuse one another as guilty of Sin and Schism before <hi>God,</hi> for each separating from the others Communion, and threaten <hi>his</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but so long as there is no separating from the Church, whereof the King is Head, while he tolerates the Meetings of both, and makes them parts of it as National, there shall be no prosecution of Law against any, but all quiet, as fellow-Members upon that account.</p>
                  <p>Only, as to the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> it is not indeed for them to imagine that a Protestant King and Parliament should allow of their <hi>Mass</hi> in Publick, as they do of the Service-Book. This were not to <hi>tolerate</hi> the <hi>Papists,</hi> but to <hi>set up Popery</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Determining</hi> what is to be permitted to <hi>one</hi> Party, and what to <hi>another,</hi> so as no <hi>Detriment</hi> may be brought to the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> and no Sin or Guilt upon the Nation by that permission, is a nice thing, and the business of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>There is one Motion farther should be added, and that is for another Bill also to be brought in to take away <hi>Pluralities,</hi> (which is the Pest of our present Conforming Clergy) I mean both of <hi>Livings</hi> and <hi>Dignities</hi> impartially, to this end, that the King may have wherewithal to engage those he receives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church thus enlarged, and consequently restores to their Labours, by this Accommodation; for that is a thing will make the favour indeed significant to such persons.</p>
                  <p>I will conclude with one Argument for what I have proposed. There is no power given upon Earth for any Man to command that which he in his Conscience does judg to be Sin. <hi>Non da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur potestas ad malum.</hi> But to conform in all things to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Church according to Law, is Sin in the judgment of <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters, Catholicks</hi> and others; and the Late King was a <hi>Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of one sort himself. The King therefore that was so late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, could not really put the <hi>Catholicks</hi> upon Conformity; and if he would appear equal to all his People, he could not put

                     </gap>ny other <hi>Dissenters</hi> on it neither, for the same Cause. That which the Law requires was both in his Conscience and in theirs, a thing prohibited of God. He could not therefore put the Laws in Execution being against God. And if He could not do it acting only but as an honest Man that abides by his Principles: we have no reason to apprehend that so good a King and Queen as we have now, should be ever brought to do it, maugre all the Enticements of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or Frowns of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                  <head>AN ANSWER TO THE DESERTION DISCUSS'D.</head>
                  <p>IF many of our Long-Rob'd Divines, pust up with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of their own Parts, would but keep closer to their Texts, and their Duties, most certainly our Peace and Union would be much firmer, and more assured then it is. For being sway'd by Interest and Profit, they are more afraid of losing the Advantages of Earthly Preferment, then the Treasures of Heavenly Felicity. Unless they swim in their own Wishes and Desires, all Things are out of Order. The Church is in danger, they cry; here are <hi>Sharers</hi> coming in among Us: And by an odd kind of Ecclesiastical Policy, seem rather inclinable to return under the Yoke of Popery, then to endure the Equality of a Dissenting Protestant; rather to be at the check of a Pope's Nuncio, then suffer the Fraternity of a Protestant Nonconformist. They said nothing to the late King, till he began to touch their Copy-holds: then they call'd out for Help; and now they are angry with their Relief, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are afraid of well they know not what. And this is their Misfortune, that if all things answer not the full Height of their Expectations, they are the first that should be last dissatisfied. If all things go not well, as they imagine, they
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60825:190"/>
presently grow moody and waspish; and while they insinuate their empty Notions into others, who admiring the fluency of their Pulpit Language, either out of Ignorance, or Laziness, allow them a Prerogative over their Understandings, the whole Nation must be embroyl'd by their Surmises and Mistrusts.</p>
                  <p>Else what had that Gentleman, who wrote the <hi>Desertion Discuss'd,</hi> to do to busy his Brains with a <hi>Subject,</hi> neither ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to his Function, nor proper for his Talent? Why should he be setting himself up against the voted Judgment of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he chiefest and greatest part of the Kingdom? A Man of his Profession would have doubtless better employ'd himself, in contemplating the Story of the <hi>Three Murmurers</hi> against <hi>Moses</hi>; and there have learn'd a more sanctifi'd Lesson, then to exalt his Sophistry against the Debates of a Solemn Assembly contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Publick Preservation. For certainly never was a fairer Prospect then now, since the many Revolutions under which the British Monarchy has labour'd, of its being restor'd to its ancient Grand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ur and Renown, and of enjoying the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Peace and Prosperity in a higher measure then ever. So that it must be look'd upon as the Effect, either of a most pernicious Malice, or a strange distraction of Brain, for such <hi>Discussers</hi> as these, to be throwing about the Darnel of their nice and froward Conceptions, on purpose to choak the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of so glorious a Harvest. For they must be Men that want the government of right Reason within themselves, as being enslav'd either to vicious Custom, or partial Affection, or else they would never run themselves and others with so much precipitancy, into the shame and ignominy of upholding the subvertors of National Constitutions. And all this to blacken and defame the noble Endeavours, and prudent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of those renowned Patriots that pursu'd the only means to rescue a languishing Monarchy from impending Thraldom and Ruin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He does not wonder,</hi> he says, <hi>that a Man of so much sense and integrity as his Friend is, should be surprized at the Thrones being declared Vacant by the Lower House of Convention. For how,</hi> says his Friend, <hi>can the Seat of the Government be empty, while the King, who all grant, had an unquestionable Title, is still liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Discusser</hi> here forgot, that it had been the resolv'd
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60825:190"/>
Opinion of two Parliaments already, That there was no Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for the Protestant Religion, the King's Life, or the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd Government of the Kingdom, without passing a Bill for disabling the Duke of <hi>York</hi> to inherit the Imperial Crown of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>; and that unless a Bill were pass'd for excluding the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the House could not give any Supply to the King, without Danger to his Person, the Hazard of the Protestant Religion, and Breach of the Trust in them repos'd by the People. Upon which a Bill did pass the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and was sent up to the Lords for their Concurrence, by which <hi>Iames</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> was excluded and made for ever uncapable to Inherit, Possess or Enjoy the Imperial Crown of this Realm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and he adjudg'd Guilty of High Treason, and to suffer the Pains and Penalties as in Case of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, if after such a Time he should claim, challenge, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to possess or exercise any Authority or Jurisdiction, as King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in any of the said Dominions. 'Tis true, the Lords did not pass this Bill, for Reasons well known; yet was it such a mutilation to the Duke's Title, to be disabled from succeeding in the Kingdom, by the whole Body of the Commons, who are the Representatives of the Nation, that it can never be said, that all Men <hi>granted his Title unquestionable,</hi> as the <hi>Discusser</hi> imposes upon the World. Besides the many Instances in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, of several Princes who have forfeited their Succession, and consequently their Title to the Crown, for revolting from the Establish'd Religion of the Realm.</p>
                  <p>But, says the <hi>Discusser,</hi> for I look upon his Friend and Him to be all one; (and that he does but put the Question with one side of his Mouth, and answer it with the other) <hi>I had thought our Laws, as well as our Religion, had been against the Deposing Doctrine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That's not the Question; but whether a Prince may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit those Miscarriages in Government, whether he may not so far, <hi>peccare in Leges &amp; Rempublicam,</hi> as to incur the Forfeiture of his Regal Power? and whether a Prince may be allow'd to subvert the ancient Constitutions and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of a Nation, and yet be said to be the Lawful King of that Realm? These are the Questions: For the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> it is not the Law that deposes him, nor the Religion that justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies it. But it is He that deposes Himself: 'tis the bad Advice
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60825:191"/>
of Evil Counsellors to which he Listens, and which he follows to the ruin of the Kingdom, contrary to the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Contract between Princes and People, grounded upon the Foundations of all Original Government; I say, 'tis that Adhering to Evil Counsel which deposes a Prince by degrading him from a Lawful King to an Unlawful Tyrant, and renders him Liable to the Animadversion of the Law, and the impeachments of the oppress'd and injur'd People. To assert otherwise were to deprive all National Law and Religion of their self Defence; which is against all the Law and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the World. I am apt to believe that Christ himself had no very good Opinion of the lawfulness of <hi>Herod</hi>'s Regality, when he sent him that Message, <hi>Go tell that Fox, Herod:</hi> Which I look upon as a Deposal and Degrading of that Arbitrary Prince by the Founder of our Religion, in his own Breast and Judgment, though he forbore the Execution of his Celestial Power. And therefore it is not the Error of Religion, but the Fault of those that do not well distinguish, that Religion suffers in her Doctrines. For only he who governs according to Law is a King, he that endeavours to subvert the Law, is none. Nor is every rambling and precipitate Brain to be Judg of this neither, but the Solid Law, and fundamental Constitutions of the Realm. So that the Country Gentleman was mistaken in his Thoughts, both of our Laws and our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. However the pretended Scrupulous Country-Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man desires the <hi>Discusser to expound the State-Riddle of the Vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and to give him the Ground of the late extraordinary Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which the <hi>Discusser</hi> gives no direct answer at present, but desires his Friend to take notice, <hi>That the Gentlemen of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, who declar'd a Vacancy in the Government, lay'd the main Stress of their opinion upon the King's withdrawing himself. For that since the Story of the French League, and the Business of the Prince of</hi> Wales <hi>were pass'd over in silence, most Men believed that the pretended Breach of that which they called the Original Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract was no more then a popular Flourish.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All which is such an imperfect peice of Incoherence, that none but a madman would have thrust in by Head and Should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as the <hi>Discusser</hi> has done. For how can it be inferr'd that the <hi>Breach of the Original Contract,</hi> should be a <hi>Popular
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60825:191"/>
Flourish,</hi> because the Clandestin League, and the <hi>False Birth</hi> are hitherto pass'd over in silence? As for the <hi>surreptitious Birth,</hi> one would think it was sufficiently dilated upon in the Declaration of the Lords; and why it is not farther brought upon the Stage, there may be several Reasons given; and among the rest, because it may be thought that the Imposture will vanish of it self, and so there will be no need of casting an Eternal Blot upon the memory of them that contriv'd and own'd it. Then for the Clandestin League, it Suffices that there is apparent Proof of it in Bank. But to call the Breach of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Contract <hi>pretended,</hi> and a <hi>Popular Flourish,</hi> is a yerk of Malitious Reflection, which only serves to expose the <hi>Discusser</hi> to Publick censure. For as there is nothing more certain, then that there is an Original Contract between the King and People of <hi>England,</hi> the Breach of which has cost the Effusion of so much Blood; so is it as certain that that Original Contract was never so infallibly broken then it was of late. Which as it is allow'd by all the Laws of God and Man, to be a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground to seek a Remedy; so was nothing more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously urg'd by the Convention. Which might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd the <hi>Discusser,</hi> that they did not pretend it for a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Flourish.</p>
                  <p>But now, lest the Country Gentleman should <hi>be shogg'd by seeing the Votes of so considerable a Meeting, debated by a private Hand</hi>; the <hi>Discusser</hi> reminds him, <hi>That a Parliament and a Convention are two different Things. The latter, for want of the King's Writs and Concurrence, having no share in the Legislative Power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Discusser</hi> forgets, that it was only a Convention of Lords that sent to <hi>Richard</hi> the Second to meet them at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>; which the King at first promis'd to do; but upon altering his Mind, sent him another peremptory Message, that if he would not come according to his Promise, they would chuse another King; and then proceeding farther, according to that Power they had, expell'd against the King's Will seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of his chiefest Favourites from the Court; constrain'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to put in Sureties to appear at the next Parliament, and caus'd several others to be arrested and committed to several Prisons. If a Convention could do this where the King was present, what signifi'd the Writs and Concurrence of an
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60825:192"/>
absent Prince. Nor did they contend for Legislative Power, but only met in a kind of embodied Dictatorship to take care of the present Necessity of Affairs.</p>
                  <p>But this, says the Discusser, was not justifiable, for that <hi>the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessity which they pretended, was either of their own making, or of their own submitting to, which is the same Thing.</hi> But this is all Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. For if the Necessity was of their own making, then were the Lords and Commons the Authors of all the Miscarriages which they laid to the late King's Charge; If of their own submitting to, then would they never have call'd out for succour and crav'd Relief from their Oppressions. No—They were those crying Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces sum'd up in the Declaration of the Lords Spiritual and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Commons assembl'd at <hi>Westmister</hi> presented to their Present Majesties upon the Twelfth of February Last; which when the late King could not justify them by force of Arms, but fled for it, not being able to answer his endeavours to subvert and Extirpate the Protestant Religion and the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom, put them to that necessity of assembling after an Unusual Manner, to provide for the Common Safety.</p>
                  <p>How ever the Discusser will have it a Necessity of their own creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, tho never so false. <q>For, says he, if the King had either not bin driven out of his Dominions, or invited back upon honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Terms, they needed not have had recourse to such unusual singular Methods of proceeding.</q> And thus the Discusser rambles out of one Untruth into another. For he fled from offer'd Treaty, forsook the defence of his own Forces, and left them to be disbanded in Arrears and without Payment; slipt from his own Council by Night, after he had appointed to meet them in Consultation the next Morning. Nor could he justly suspect, that any Violence would have been offer'd to Him in particular, being so well assur'd as he could not choose but be, of the Generous Inclination, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Respect which the Prince had to his Person. But if the Guilt of peculiar Miscarriages hasten'd his Departure, or oversway'd him toleave the He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m of Rule without any Form or Face of Goverment: That could ne're be call'd an Expulsion out of his Dominions. And therefore when a certain Gentleman waiting on him at <hi>Fever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham</hi> besought him to return to <hi>London,</hi> he gave the Person this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, <hi>That he was an honest Gentleman, but knew not what he knew.</hi> And when he had once abandon'd the Kingdom all forlom without either Head or Conduct, without Council, or any Countenance of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60825:192"/>
Authority, then according to the Judgment of the Common-wealth of <hi>Venice</hi> in reference to the Succession of <hi>Henry</hi> the 4<hi>th.</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to the Nobility and chief Persons of the Land, as they are the chief Defence of the Royal Authority, to take care of the Publick Safety, whether by usual or unusual Methods of proceeding it matters not; and they have both <hi>the Authority</hi> of Law and Necessity to justify their Proceedings.</p>
                  <p>As for his being <hi>invited back upon Honourable Terms,</hi> 'tis well known how he return'd back, and went through the City on the Sunday Night, attended by his own Guards, and lodg'd in <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and this most certainly in order to an Accommodation. Only because the Prince was coming to Town, he was sent to, and for the avoiding any Disturbance that might be prejudicial to his Person, was humbly desir'd to retire to <hi>Ham</hi>-House, with Liberty to make choice of what Persons he thought fit to attend him. Which he promised to do; but recollecting himself, and desiring to know whether he might not return back to <hi>Rochester,</hi> word was sent him the next Morning that he might do as he pleas'd. All this while here was no Constraint put upon him; so that he could not be said to be driven out of his Dominions, but that it was his own Choice to forsake it.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding all this, The <hi>Discusser</hi> will undertake to prove, <q>That the King before his withdrawing had sufficient Grounds to make him apprehensive of Danger, and therefore it could not be call'd an <hi>Abdication.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But through the whole Pursuit of his Argument, the <hi>Discusser</hi> most wretchedly mistakes the Point, quite mistaking the Effects for the Causes. <q>For, says he, Had not the King great Reason to retire to secure his Person and his Honour, when he had met with so many unfortunate Disappointments, with so many surprising and unparallel'd Accidents? When part of the Army was revolted, and the Remainder too apparently unserviceable; When the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had such fatal and unremoveable Prejudices against his Service? When there were such terrible Disorders in the Kingdom, and all Places were either flaming or ready to take Fire? What should a Prince do when he had scarce any thing left him to lose but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but consult his Safety, and give way to the irresis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>able Evil?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>These are very great Disappointments and evil Accidents indeed to befal a Prince. But the <hi>Discusser</hi> forgets to tell ye, That the Prince
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60825:193"/>
brought all these Inconveniencies upon himself. The <hi>Discusser</hi> tells ye that part of the Army revolted, but he omits to tell ye, that it was out of a Generous Principle, for that being Protestants, they would not embrue their Hands in the Blood of their Fellow-Protestants and Countreymen, nor be Instruments to enslave the Nation. He tells ye of terrible Disorders in the Kingdom; but does not tell ye, it was time for the People to be in Disorder, when they saw such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments upon their Ancient Franchises, such Inundations of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery flowing in upon their Consciences, and such a rapid Violence of French Thraldom tumbling in upon their Necks. He complains that all Places were either flaming or ready to take Fire, but forgets to tell you who were the Incendiaries.</p>
                  <p>These therefore, with several others of the same Nature, being the true Causes that drew the foresaid Inconveniencies upon the King, it follows, that tho the Secondary Constraint of his withdrawing might be occasion'd by the Effects, yet the Primary Cause of his withdrawing proceeded from the First Causes which produced the Effects. Consequently such a Retiring was voluntary and not forc'd; because he may be justly said to fly from something of dreaded Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, rather then pursuing Danger, from which he was always at a distance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ar enough off, but dubious what would become of him as to the Former.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Discusser</hi> makes many other grievous Complaints to justify the King's First withdrawing (for hitherto he is altogether upon that) but when he comes to sum up all. <q>In short, says he, when the Forts and Revenue were thus disposed of; when the Papists were to be disbanded, and the Protestants not to be trusted; when the Nation was under such general and violent Dissatisfactions; when the King in case of a Rupture had nothing upon the matter but his single Person, to oppose against the Princes Arms, and those of his Subjects; when his Mortal Enemies were to sit Judges of his Crown and Dignity, if no farther; when Affairs were in this tempestuous Condition, to say that a Free and Indifferent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might be chosen, with the Relation to the King's Right as well as the People's, and that the King had no just visible Cause to apprehend himself in Danger, is to out-face the Sun and trample upon the Understandings, and almost upon the Senses of the whole Nation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the Fortified Towns, it was but Reason that his then Highness the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who came over to rescue the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60825:193"/>
from Arbitrary Violence and Oppression, should demand them to be put into his Power, well Knowing them to be then in the Hands of <hi>Irish</hi> Papists and Cut-Throats, of whom the People stood in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Fear, and who were rather a Consternation then Security to the Kingdom. And the same reason holds in Relation to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue. For all the World knows, what Vast Sums had been Squander'd away by the late King, when Duke, to keep off the sitting of Parliaments, and to buy off the Members when they Sate; and when that Money was spent so much to the Detriment of the Realm, what Sollicitations were made to the French King for more, to carry on the Popish Cause and Interest. It was as well known how the Revenue had of late Years been Embezl'd to keep up a standing Army of <hi>Irish</hi> Ragamuffins; as if <hi>England</hi> were now in its Turn to have been conquer'd by <hi>Ireland,</hi> as formerly <hi>Ireland</hi> had been conquer'd by <hi>England.</hi> From which fears when his present Majesty had delivered the Nation, it was but reason that his Army should be pay'd out of the Publick Stock for their happy Toyl and labour. For the Publick Revenue of all Kingdoms and States was ever Originally intended for the Preservation, and not the Destruction of the People.</p>
                  <p>Upon the Disbanding of the Papists, the <hi>Discusser</hi> makes a special Observation, <hi>That no Test-Acts nor any Others could barr the King from Listing them as Common Souldiers.</hi> This perhaps may be true; that is to say, that a Protestant Prince may list Papists, and a Popish Prince Protestants, to follow him in a lawful War. But when a Popish Prince in a Protestant Nation had made his chiefes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Levies of Popish Common Souldiers to over-aw his Protestant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and put his sole Confidence in them for his known and open Designs and manifest Endeavors to introduce Popery into a Protestant Kingdom, contrary to the Law, 'twas time then to think of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding such Vermin, and ridding them out of the Land. And the reason why the Protestants could not be trusted was as certain. For if the King would not trust his Protestants, nay disarm'd them, when Papists were both arm'd and Employ'd, what reason had the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants to trust the King. And this was that which among other Things created and foster'd those <hi>General and Violent Dissatisfact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions</hi> in the Nation. For Men have naturally a <hi>general</hi> and <hi>violent</hi> Antipathy against having their Throats Cut if they can help it. And therefore since the Kingdom by a Miraculous Providence had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd its Redemption, 'tis to be wonder'd the Discusser should i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60825:194"/>
'twas ever intended that the late K. should be in a Condition again to oppose either his own or the persons of any others against the Arms of the Prince or those of his own Subjects. And whereas, he says, that the King's Mortal Enemies were to be the Judges of his Crown and Dignity, the Discusser should have done well before he had made his Reflection upon so many Eminent Patriots, to have consulted <hi>Grotius, l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>Par.</hi> 8. and the Example of <hi>Pausamias</hi> King of <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>cedaemon</hi> there cited. Certainly there was no such Impossibility but that a Free and Indifferent Parliament might have been chosen to deal equally between the King and the People. For tho the King perhaps might be conscious that he could not so well rely upon the Kindness of those to whom he had always had such an inveterate Antipathy, yet he might have rely'd upon the Justice of so many Great and Worthy Personages. So that it is the Discusser himself who out-faces the Sun and tramples upon the Understandings and Senses of the whole Nation, who makes these little Rhetorical Flourishes to palliate and obscure the Truth, and to insinuate among the People, as if Wrong and Injustice had been done, where nothing was acted but what was a due debt to Self-Preservation. And with the same Brazening the Discusser out-faces the Sun, and tramples up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Senses of the Nation, to assert that a Desertion of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, after such Proposals, which were rather Assurances of his Safety, was no Desertion. He had been safer in the Affection of the People, when all his evil Counsellers had been remov'd from about him; he had been safer from the Importunities of his Priests and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites; He had been more secure from running himself into farther danger, and safer in the Enjoyment of his Royal Dignity. But he who had so Solemnly sworn to Establish Popery in <hi>England</hi> or die in the Attempt, thought himself no where safe perhapps, but where he might be procuring his future Bliss, by the Performance of his Vow.</p>
                  <p>The Discusser now advances to the King's second withdrawing, and puts the Question, <hi>what the King had done to incur a forfeiture by his first Retirement?</hi> Indeed what had he not done? If the <hi>Discusser</hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>orgot in his Discussing Heat, the <hi>Declaration</hi> presented to their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Majesties would have rubb'd up his Memory. Among the rest there was one, <hi>That he had endeavoured to Subvert and Extirpate the Protestant Religion, and the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom, by raising and keeping a Standing Army in the Kingdom in time of Peace, without Consent of Parliament, and quartering Souldiers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60825:194"/>
to Law; and by causing s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>veral of his good Subjects to be Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd at the same time when Papists were both Arm'd and Employ'd.</hi> Now to what purpose was all this, but to Subject the Kingdom to the Tyranny of the Pope? In such a case <hi>Barclay</hi> cited by <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>per.</hi> 10. gives this for his Opinion, <hi>Si Rex regnum alienet, aut alij Subjiciat, amitti ab eo Regnum.</hi> To which <hi>Grotius</hi> himself adds, <hi>Si Rex reipsa tradere regnum aut Subjicere molliatur, quin ei resisti in boc posse non dubite. Aliud est enim Imperium, aliud habendi modus; qui n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>After all this, it cannot be imagin'd that the King returned the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time <hi>with an intention to govern</hi>; unless he might govern at his own will and Pleasure as he did before. But that would not be suffer'd him; for they who had now avoided the Yoke so near putting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Necks, would never endure it should come so near their shoulders again. Therefore all the Probality in the World is on this side, That the King perceiving, that by taking the Government up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him again, he should not be able to attain those Ends which he had made the Business of his whole Reign, resolv'd to relinquish it altogether. At which time being at liberty to go or stay, his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture must of necessity be accounted Voluntary, and consequently an Absolute <hi>Abdication.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, it is impossible that the King could be frighted out of his Dominions, by the making of two or three Addresses to his then Royal Highness the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>; for it was no more than rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally he could expect would be done; more especially from the <hi>City</hi> to the Person, who next under God had deliver'd them from their Continual fears of Fire and Sword. Nor by the denying him a little Gold to <hi>Heal</hi> with; which looks like an improbable Story of the Discusser's own framing. These are Motions so inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a King to forsake his Dominions, that the Discusser seems to have Conjur'd them up meerly to degrade the Courage of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting Monarch, and to mortify his own Discussion. But after all, the Question may be fairly put, whether <hi>Withdrawing,</hi> in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of our Law, does not rather imply a Guilt, than an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of Danger, unless it be that of being call'd to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, since the Query always propounded to the Jury is, <hi>Did he fly for't?</hi> Which indeed ought to be the Legal Determination of this Dispute.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:60825:195"/>However the <hi>Discusser</hi> goes on, and tells us, <hi>We are to observe, that to abdicate an Office always supposes the Consent of him who quits.</hi> And this he affirms to be the meaning of the Word out of <hi>Salust, Tully, Livy</hi> and <hi>Grotius.</hi> But both the Supposal, and the Asseveration are false. For <hi>Consent</hi> implies, that the Question must be put, Whether the Person will Abdicate or no? Which never was put to any Abdicator in this World. Upon a forc'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation it has. But a forc'd Resignation is no Abdication. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is that <hi>Abdicare</hi> signifies to <hi>renounce, forgoe,</hi> or <hi>abandon.</hi> And the Motives to this Abdication are various, and generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing upon the Reason of the Person that Abdicates himself, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Condition of Affairs and the Circumstances he is under. And therefore tho a Magistrate may abdicate with the consent of others, yet he rarely does it out of a natural Inclination. Thus it cannot be imagined that <hi>Lentulus,</hi> one of the Conspirators with <hi>Catiline,</hi> abdicated the Pretorship, with the Consent of his own Will, for he was one of the most aspiring Men in the Universe; but because he found himself so obnoxious that he could hold it no longer: Thus <hi>Sylla</hi> abdicated the Dictatorship out of a Vain-glorious Opinion of Felicity that attended him, and to shew that he had such an awe over the <hi>Romans,</hi> that tho he were a Private Person, no body durst call him to an Account for the Cruelties he had committed. History tells us, that <hi>Dioclesian</hi> abdicated the Empire, for madness that he could not have his Will of the Christians. How does the <hi>Discusser</hi> know, but that King <hi>Iames</hi> abdicated the Government because he could not have his Will of the Protestants? <hi>Charles</hi> the V<hi>th</hi> abdicated the Empire, because he found his wonted Good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had left him. <hi>Bernard Rasfield</hi> Bishop of <hi>Munster</hi> finding himself between two Grindstones, the Persecution of the <hi>German</hi> Priests, for going about to deprive them of their Concubines, and the Pope's Excommunication, if he did it not; abdicated his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality and Bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hoprick, that he might be at quiet. Lastly, to shew that Abdication does not <hi>always</hi> imply Consent, <hi>Brutus</hi> compell'd <hi>Tarquinius Collatinus</hi> to abdicate the Consulship, only because his <hi>Praenomen</hi> was <hi>invisum Civitati.</hi> And then as for what the Discusser adds out of <hi>Grotius, That a Neglect or Omission in the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Government, is by no means to be interpreted a Renunciation of it</hi>; there's no Body censures the late King for any Omission or want of Diligence in the Administration of his Government, for he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60825:195"/>
was too diligent indeed; and that Diligence was the main Grievance which disgusted the People; his Diligence to extirpate the Protestant Religion; his Diligence to subvert the Laws and Liberties of the Ringdom; and his Diligence to introduce Popery. And this Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, 'tis to be fear'd, was one of the main Causes of his Abdica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Had he omitted more, he would have had less reason to have abdicated. And therefore it is a Vanity to infer that there can be no Pretence for an <hi>Abdication</hi>; because the Word, as he says, <hi>always,</hi> that is very rarely, or never, supposes the <hi>Consent</hi> of <hi>him that quits.</hi> For that it is not in the Nature of Man to abdicate Empires, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, Wealth and Honours, but there must be some compul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ive Reason within that moves them to it. When Princes find the Times and Constitutions of the Kingdom will not bear their Government; when Emperors grow stiff and stark with Age, and begin to feel the Lashes of ill-Fortune; when Ambitious Aspirers perceive they must take other Measures to compass their Designs, then they swallow a self-denying Ordinance, and think it convenient to retire from the Cares of the World, or out of Harms way.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Discusser</hi> says, <hi>We have but two Instances with us which look like an Abdication since the Conquest,</hi> which are in the Reigns of <hi>Edward</hi> II. and <hi>Richard</hi> II. <hi>both which were unjustly depos'd by their Subjects.</hi> 'Tis true, they were so far from looking like Abdications, that they were no Abdications at all. For both those Princes being under a strict Confinement, it was impossible for them to <hi>abdicate,</hi> unless they could have made their Escapes. Therefore they were forc'd Resignations, and consequently formal Deposals. Nor had the Queen or <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Lancaster</hi> any cause to declare the Throne Vacant, as having already taken care to fill it themselves: And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those Princes would have resign'd or no, it would have signified little to them that were by Claim in Possession. But the <hi>Discusser</hi> has overslipp'd one Instance of a Perfect <hi>Abdication</hi> since the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, which the King would have certainly felt to his Cost, had not the Pope and the <hi>Poictovins</hi> been his true Friends: and the Case was much the same as at this Time. For the Lords and Barons of the Realm in the Reign of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> having often desired the King to restore them their Ancient Rights and Liberties, and finding nothing but Delusions, resolve no longer to be abus'd but betake themselves to Arms. The King then lying at <hi>Windsor,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60825:196"/>
himself too weak for the Lords, thought it no good way to proceed by Force but rather by Fraud, and therefore sends to the Lords, that if they would come to <hi>Windsor</hi> he would grant their Demands. Thither the Lords repairing, tho in a Military Manner (sor they durst not trust the King's Word) he saluted them all kindly, and promis'd to give them Satisfaction in all they demanded: And to that Purpose in a Meadow between <hi>Stains</hi> and <hi>Windsor,</hi> call'd <hi>Running-Mead,</hi> he freely consented to confirm their former Charters; and was content that some Grave Personages should be made choice of to see it confirm'd. But the next Day, when it was to be done, he withdraws himself privately to <hi>South-Hampton,</hi> and thence to the Isle of <hi>Wight:</hi> Where it was concluded that he should send to the Pope, acquaint him with the Mutiny of his Lords, and require his Holinesses help. In the mean time the King lay sculking up and down for three Months together in Corners, that no Body knew where to find him; or which was worse, as some write, roving and practising Pyracy upon the Neighbouring Seas.</p>
                  <p>Whether the Lords and Barons did in Words declare this to be a Vacancy of the Throne, is not material to enquire. Perhaps they were not so curious in those Days: But what they did in Deeds, amounted to the same as if they had done it in Words. For percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving themselves thus eluded, they swore upon the Holy Altar to be reveng'd. And what Revenge that was likely to have been is easy to conjecture, by their swearing Allegiance afterwards to <hi>Lewis</hi> the French King's Son, and bearing Fealty to him till the Death of the King. Whence it may be inferr'd, That if a Prince in Hostility with his Subjects deserts his Kingdom, upon any Account, They who are next to the Government are not to hesitate as King <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Barons did, in expectation of the King's Return, but immediately to take care of the Common Safety, lest they should bring the same Ruin upon the Kingdom, as those Barons did by their Delay.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, If the <hi>Discusser</hi> will not be convinc'd by what has hitherto been said, Let him examine the King's own words, and try whether he can pick out any better Construction out of them then that which I shall make.</p>
                  <p>Says the late King in his Letter to the Earl of <hi>Feversham, Things being come to that Extr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>mity, that I have been forc'd to send away the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60825:196"/>
Queen, and my Son the Prince of</hi> Wales, <hi>that they might not fall into my Enemies hands, I am oblig'd to do the same thing, and to endeavour to secure my self the best I can, &amp;c.</hi> Expres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ions of a disponding Mind, and only full of Grief for the Disappointment of the Popish Career. The King was afraid of the Queen, and his Son the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> as he calls him, and therefore deeming it convenient to send Them out of the way, believes himself oblig'd to follow them. 'Tis true, there might be some Reason perhaps for him to send Them away; but none to send away himself, not being under the same Circumstances. For let it be Paternal or Conjugal Affection, or both together; What could be a greater Desertion than this, for the sake of a Wife and a Son to leave three Kingdoms at six and sevens? He speaks of <hi>securing himself as well as he can,</hi> but mentions nothing of Danger; only leaves it to the Lord <hi>Feversham</hi> and others to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume the Causes of his Fears. But certainly the apprehension of Danger can never excuse a Sovereign Magistrate from the Desertion of his Dominions, at the same time striving and strugling under the Pangs of the Dissolution of Government. If such a Desertion of his Territories in that forlorn and languishing Condition, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the Tribulations of a Wife and a Son, be not a perfect Abdica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Territories, the Words <hi>relinquish, desert, forgo, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, abdicate,</hi> have lost their Signification. Thus <hi>Lysimachus</hi> in <hi>Plutarch, de sera vindicta Dei,</hi> after he had surrendered his Person and Dominions to the <hi>Getae,</hi> for a Draught of Drink, in the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of a parching Thirst, when he had quench'd his Thirst cryed out, <hi>O pravum Hominem!</hi> that for so small a Pleasure have lost so great a Kingdom. He would be thought very unfit to be the Master of a Ship, that should throw himself into the Sea, when his Vessel and Cargoe were almost ready to perish. And I will appeal to the Lord of <hi>Wemm</hi> himself, whether if he were to try an Abdicating Prince upon this Point, with the same Huffing and Domineering as he did Inferiour Offenders, he would take it for a good Justification to say, I had thought, or I apprehended my Person to be in Danger. Rather it becomes a Prince at such a time to exert his Courage, and contemn his own, when the publick Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity lies at stake, especially when the Remedy propounded was so easy as the Convoking of a Free Parliament. But to withdraw at such a perillous Conjuncture from the Application of his desir'd, nay
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60825:197"/>
almost implor'd <hi>Assistance</hi>; What can the <hi>Discusser</hi> think of himself to deny so plain an <hi>Abdication?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this I take to be the Opinion of the late King's Abdication, intimated by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal assembled at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> Decemb. 1688. where they are pleased to say, <hi>That they did reasonably hope that the King having sent forth his Proclamation and Writs for a free Parliament, they might have rested secure</hi> (as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the King might also have done) <hi>in that Meeting. But his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty having withdrawn himself,</hi> &amp;c. they did therefore <hi>unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously resolve to apply themselves to his Highness the</hi> Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi> &amp;c. That is to say, The King having withdrawn himself from the Cure of the Grand Distempers of the Nation, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Abdicated the Government, they resolv'd to apply themselves to a more Skilful, at least a more Willing Physician. Which had the Discusser more considerately discuss'd, when he wrote his Discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, would have sav'd him a great deal of trouble and expence.</p>
                  <p>Thus much for the Reasons which the Discusser brings to prove that the King, before his withdrawing, had sufficient Grounds to make him apprehensive of Danger, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot be call'd an <hi>Abdication.</hi> That which follows, being altogether grounded upon certain Statutes and Laws of the Land, to the knowledg of which the Discusser seems to be a great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender, is answer'd in a Word, That they who pronounc'd the Throne Vacant, understood the Latitude of their Power, and the Intent and Limits of the Laws and Statutes of this Realm to that Degree, that if nothing else, the Consideration of that might have deterr'd the Discusser from the Presumption of appearing so vainly and scandalously in the World. Nor would I be thought so impertinent to transgress the Bounds of my own Understanding as he has done. For indeed, to tell ye the Truth, if the Discusser should come to a Trial at <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> I am afraid the Lawyers will certainly inform him that he has very much either mistaken or misquoted his Authors.</p>

                  <p>I Cannot but admire at the Stiffness, not to say Obstinacy of some, in not complying with the present Government, considering the late danger of Popery, and that an Arbitrary Power was exercised amongst us by our late Rulers, in asserting their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing Power, by the Mercenary Judges declared to be Law.</p>
                  <p>You may remember in our late Conference upon this Subject, you pleaded in Defence of your selves, and others, the Obligation you lay under to the Oath of Allegiance, with your Subscription to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> contained in the 37<hi>th</hi> Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and the First Canon of the Church: but if it appear that all this is rather grounded upon Mistake, than any solid Reality, I will not question your ready Submission.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:60825:198"/>Oaths I confess are very strong Ties upon Men of Conscience, and they are to be tenderly dealt with until that Prejudice be removed; give me leave therefore with Sobriety and Meekness to enquire, Whether that Oath be still in Force, with the Obligation to it? if not, that Plea must vanish and disappear.</p>
                  <p>And here first, let me remind you of the occasion of imposing the Oath of Allegiance; it was injoyn'd to distinguish betwixt Church and Court, Loyal and Disloyal Papists, upon that horrid <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder-Treason,</hi> which hath left a Stain of Villany and Cruelty upon that Religion, never to be wiped off: Read over the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of that Oath, made by K. <hi>Iames</hi> the First in his Book of the Defence of it; And what is there in if that can stick upon any Protestant? except that Clause of denying all Foreign Jurisdiction, Prince, or Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate: And this you seem'd to hint at, when you said the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was a Foreign Prince.</p>
                  <p>Will you be pleased in answer to this, to fix your Thoughts upon that of the great Apostle St. <hi>Paul, he is excepted that put all things under him.</hi> So here, without Question, the King may divest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of all Authority and Power, and when this is done the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ceaseth, as if he were really Dead. The Preface to the New Oath is not an authoritative Abdication; but rather a Declaration of Matter of Fact, that the late King <hi>Iames</hi> hath abdicated. So that in fine the main of the Controversy lies here, Whether the late King did abdicate? For, if he did, without all Question the Obligation of all Oaths taken unto him is ceased. In confirmation of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative, I shall endeavour to make it clear that any King may, And secondly, That the late King did abdicate.</p>
                  <p>That Kings may denude themselves of their Princely Power and Sovereignty, appears from what was done by <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, Emperor of <hi>Germany,</hi> and King of <hi>Spain</hi> at the same time, who did abdicate both; and his Subjects took new Oaths of Fealty to other Princes. Some of those Times might question his Courage, but none did ever except against the Validity of it.</p>
                  <p>May it not seem something unjust to deny this Liberty to Princes, when they find themselves overcharged with the Weight of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to retire into a Privacy for the better enjoyment of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Peace and Quiet? But I presume no Man will deny this <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis.</hi> It remains to prove the <hi>Thesis,</hi> That the late King did abdicate.</p>

                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:60825:198"/>1. I will not dwell upon what was done by the Metropolitan, and other Lords of the Council, upon his first withdrawing; they came into the City, and with the Lord Mayor sent for the Lieutenant of the Tower, seize upon the Keys, dispossess the Souldiers, place a new Garrison there, and desire the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to assume the Regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; Why all this, if he had not Abdicated? Upon what other ground durst they raise Arms, seize upon his Royal Fort? Or how can they excuse themselves from formal Rebellion and breach of Oaths, if this be not granted, and is not unpresidented, That Princes shall take up their Scepters again, when they have laid them down. But to pass by this.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I would willingly be resolv'd by any Thinking Man, whose Judgment and Testimony is most authentick in this Particular; Whether I am to resolve my self into the Judgment of the whole Nation, in a full and clear Representation in Parliament, or into the private Francies or Opinion of a few Men? I remember what you once repli'd to this, That every Mans Conscience is to judg for himself in point of Practice. But do you not know when, and by whom this Principle was exploded, whilst some were prosecuted for meer Matters of Worship? And shall this be pleaded by those Men who so vigorously have acted against it, when in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it is so destructive of the Civil Peace? <hi>A Line and a Line is an Abomination.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Did ever any Government upon the Pretence of Conscience dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with Disobedience in Things necessary to its Establishment? And can any Man expect to be excus'd from taking the Oaths, which is the only Moral Security the Government can expect or require; and upon this very Pretence, which if allowed, all Kingdoms must dissolve into Anarchy and Confusion; Religion and Conscience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Common Pretentions of all Male-Contents. This may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to satisfy any sober Rational Man, that is not resolv'd to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Conclusion, be the Premises never so weak.</p>
                  <p>Some there are that presume their Subscription to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in her Book of Articles, will not permit them to yield their Obedience to these Alterations. But if this shall prove a Mistake, and our Obedience shall be conformable to our Principles, will it not rather be esteemed Peevishness than Conscience?</p>
                  <p>To discover the Mistake, let us consider when, and by whom, the Articles were composed; and refer the Practices of those Times to the

Articles, as an authentick and clear Interpretation of them, and this also will vanish like Smoak.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Articles were made, or at least confirmed, in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who was a constant asserter and maintainer of this Maxim, That it is lawful for a neighbouring Prince to relieve and defend the Subjects of another, when invaded in their Laws, Liberties, and Religion. Who was it that protected and assisted the <hi>Hugonets</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> against the Tyranny and Violence of their Princes? Was it not this Gracious and Heroick Queen? And who was it that protected the <hi>Netherlands</hi> against the Violence and Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Monarch? And was all this contrary to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed Doctrines of our Church, of which she was the Defender? Was not this defended, or at least allowed of, by the Church-Men of those Times? must it be now inconsistent with the Principles of our Times? Do they bind our Hands, so that if we are invaded we may not crave the like Protection? Let any sober scrupulous dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Person give a sober Answer and Resolution to these <hi>Queries.</hi> The <hi>Dutch Netherlands</hi> erected a new Model of Government under her Protection, after they had shaken off the <hi>Spanish</hi> Yoak.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let it be granted, what ought not to be denied, That the late King did abdicate, and that the Government did devolve upon the People, and these in a full Representative of the whole Nation, whether in Parliament, or in a Convention, (it matters not which, whilst that was a free and fair Choice) have constituted these to be our Governours; Are we not to pay and swear Obedience unto them, as well as their Predecessors? And if this were rightly weigh'd, would answer an Objection from that Declaration, in the Act of Uniformity, <hi>I abhor that Traiterous Position, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If after all this Men will fix all upon a <hi>Ius divinum,</hi> and fly to Scriptures, let them give plain positive Texts, for a general Form, with Rules universally relating unto, and obliging all Places and Men. If they cannot, let them confess that God hath left all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and People, to be ruled by that Government and those Laws, which are most suitable to the Constitution and Temperament of the People; and this I lay down for a Foundation not to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown. But to Answer: those places which are so much insisted upon, that of our Saviour's, St <hi>Paul's,</hi> and St <hi>Peter's,</hi> we need to make use of that absurd Assertion of some of the Romanists, That this was only enjoyn'd and to be performed until they had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to make a Resistance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:60825:199"/>This would stain the Glory of the Primitive Martyrs. Not a forced, but a voluntary Martyrdom deserves the Crown; however this gives a taste of the Loyalty of these Men and their Religion, to the maintaining of which the Popish Princes sacrifice all their Power and Policy.</p>
                  <p>But for a more Substantial Answer, by way of Satisfaction to these Scruples, let it be duly considered, that the Primitive Christians and we were under different and distinct Administrations; they liv'd under absolute Monarchs, their Grandeur was won by the Sword, and confirm'd by a pure Despotick Power; and therefore their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance had been unlawful, contrary to the Rule and Force of their Government: but it is quite otherwise with us. We are setled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>Gothick</hi> Model, our Princes make no Laws without our own Consent; they are obliged to the excution of Laws made by our selves with their Consent; they have no Power to dispense with the breach of them by others, nor to invade them themselves. This was own'd by the seven Bishops, declar'd by former Parliaments; so that no Man is bound to pay their Allegiance any further, Let <hi>Caesar</hi> have what is <hi>Caesar</hi>'s, and the Subjects what is theirs, their Laws, their Birth-right. In some cases Moral positive Duties are superseded by what is naturally Moral, as in the Duties of the fourth Command, so here. Tho Government in general be founded upon Nature, yet this or that Form is but positive; and if it be not consistant with the end of Government, Self-preservation, Why should not it be either altered, or fixed in those who will prosecute the right end, the Preservation of the publick Peace and Liberties of the People?</p>
                  <p>To what hath been said, let me add, <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> the late King's retiring into <hi>France</hi>; if it amount not to an Abdication, it comes near unto a Forfeiture, and no Prince or State can have less Reason to indeavour to restore him to his Crown and Dignity, than that Monarch. Whence hath he his Claim but from <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> and he from the Election of the great Men of the Kingdom? and why did they pretend to lay aside <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> whose Right it was by Succession, but meerly upon this ground, He had joyned himself to the Enemies of the Kingdom? and so they transfer the Crown unto another Family, that of the <hi>Capets.</hi> And does not all Christendom in general, and the English Nation in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, look upon that great Man of <hi>France</hi> as a Common Enemy? shall not that which may hinder Succession, justify in part a translat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60825:200"/>
of it unto another? But (blessed be God) all these are cleared in an Abdication, and that asserted by the Representative Body of the whole Nation.</p>
                  <p>And now, good Sir, be perswaded to lay aside all Prejudice, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your Sentiments to the Judgment of your Superiors, yield your Obedience and Fealty in taking the Oaths; this you see is your Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and not only so, but your Interest. It is not long since we were apprehensive of Popery, and the Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Men did set themselves in direct Opposition against it, and all the Accesses to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it; for which the Generations to come shall call them blessed. But whence come these Apprensions to be lessened? can we expect a perfect Freedom from these Fears, should he be re-admitted to his Authority? It is not possible a Popish Soveraign should keep Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise with his Heretical Subjects, as they stile us; their words and Oaths, if Roman Catholicks, bind no further then stands with the Interest of their Religion, and we know who both can, and will dispence with Oaths and Promises made to Hereticks.</p>
                  <p>Would you fetter him by Laws? these have been, like <hi>Sampsons</hi> Cords, easily broken: Would you place him under Tutors and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours?

Should we submit in hopes of another Opportunity; Would he not settle a Correspondence with Male-contents at Home, and Foreign Princes Abroad? and if he prosper in the Design, hath that Common plea, That his Promises are Void, because made by him when under Restraint? And then, What will become of all that is dear unto us, Religion, Lives, Liberties, and Estates? This is prevented by an Abdication; so that if he return, it must be by Conquest, and then he will rule by the Sword, we shall all be in the same Condition, lie under the charge of Hereticks, Rebels and Traytors; the Government chang'd from a regulated Monarchy into an absolute Tyranny, our Religion abrogated; we shall be sold as Slaves, or burnt as Hereticks. If Men love Bonds and Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Rapine and Sequestration, Racks and Tortures, Fire and Faggots, let them continue this Humor and Aversation; but if none of these be lovely, as indeed they are not, let us bless God who hath redeemed us from the Hand of our Enemies, and the Hand of all that hate us. Let us joyn issue with the Divine Providence (which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60825:200"/>
hath delivered us from all these Evils) in submitting and yielding our Obedience to our Soveraign Lord and Lady, by whose Conduct and Courage we are brought into a state of Freedom and Peace. Be not affrighted out of this by the false Rumors and Reports, spread abroad by evil-minded Men, but let us unite in our Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to our present Rulers, that thereby we may strengthen their Hearts and Hands in our common Defence.</p>
                  <p>There remains one Prejudice, but no Objection arising from the vain Fears of some Men, that the Church begins to be shaken in her Authority, whilst matters of Religion fall under a Dispute, and no Convocation consulted with. But this, if fully considered, would swell a private Letter into too great a Bulk. Let me for the present desire you to consider, there is nothing design'd in Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, but meer Matters of Ceremony, and a relaxation of some Laws, not consistent with the greatest Interest of the Nation in this present Juncture, the Union of Protestants. And out of experience, that the severity of those Laws never reclaim'd one Dissenter, but rather did drive others out of the Pale of the Church; it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of, but highly becoming the Wisdom of those worthy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots to find out a Method, whereby all Protestants of every Form may be brought into an easy Condition.

                  <p>THat your Petitioner in the Year 1678, discovered a horrid Popish Conspiracy for the Destruction of the late King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, His Present Majesty, and the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion</hi> within these Kingdoms; and prov'd it so fully, that several Parliaments, and Courts of Justice, before whom he gave his Testimony, declared their Belief of it by publick Votes, and the Condemnation of several of the Conspirators. For which Reason, and because your Petitioner would not be terrified by their Threats, nor seduced by their Promises of great Rewards (with both which Temptations they often assulted him) to desist in his Discovery; the Jesuits and Papists pursued him with an implacable Malice, and endeavoured to take away his Fame and Life, by su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borning Witnesses to accuse him of Capital Crimes: but being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated in that Villanous Attempt, they first procured King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second to withdraw that Protection and Subsistence his Majesty had, at the Request of several Parliaments, allowed to your Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner; and then instigated his Royal Highness the Duke of <hi>York</hi> to prosecute your Petitioner in an Action of <hi>Scandalum Magnatum,</hi> for speaking this notorious Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> That he <hi>the said Duke of York was reconciled to the Church of Rome</hi>; and that <hi>It is High Treason to be so reconciled</hi>: wherein a Verdict and Judgment for
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60825:201"/>
one Hundred Thousand Pounds Damages were obtained against your Petitioner, and your Petitioner was committed to the King's Bench-Prison.</p>
                  <p>After this, the same Popish Party obtained leave from King <hi>Charles</hi> the second, to prefer two several Indictments against your Petitioner, for two pretended Perjuries in his Evidence concerning the said Conspiracy, which they brought on to Tryal in the Reign of King <hi>Iames</hi> the second; and your Petitioner was upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of those very Witnesses, who had confronted him in three former Tryals, and were disbelieved; and through the Partial Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of the Chief Justice <hi>Ieffreys,</hi> in brow-beating his Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and misleading the Juries, convicted of the said Pretended Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, and received this inhumane and unparallel'd Sentence follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz. [To pay two thousand Marks to the King: To be devested of his Canonical Habit: To be brought into</hi> Westminster-Hall <hi>with a Paper upon his Head, with this Inscription,</hi> Titus Oates <hi>convicted upon full Evidence of two horrid Perjuries: To stand in and upon the Pillory two several days, for the space of an Hour: To be whip'd by the comman Hang-man, from</hi> Aldgate <hi>to</hi> Newgate <hi>on Wednesday, and to be whip'd again on the Friday following from</hi> Newgate <hi>to</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn: <hi>To stand in and upon the Pillory five times in every Year of his Life; and to remain a Prisoner during his Life.</hi>] Which Sentence being intended, as your Petitioner hath just reason to believe, to murther him, was accordingly executed with all the Circumstances of Barbarity; he having suffered some thousands of Stripes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he was put to unspeakable Tortures, and lay ten Weeks under the Surgeons Hands. Neither did their Cruelty cease here, but because your Petitioner, by God's Mercy miraculously supporting him, (and the extraordinary Skill of a Judicious Chirurgion) outlived that Bloody Usage, some of them afterwards got into your Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner's Chamber whilst he was weak in his Bed, and attempted to pull of the Plaisters apply'd to cure his Back, and threatned to destroy him: And that nothing within their Power or Malice might be wanting to compleat your Petitioner's Misery, they procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to be loaded with Irons of excessive Weight for a whole Year, without any Intermission, even when his Legs were swoln with the Gout; and to be shut up in the Dungeon, or Hole of the Prison, whereby he became impair'd in his Limbs, and contracted Convulsion Fits, and other Distempers, to the great Hazard of his Life. All which illegal Proceedings, and barbarous Inhumanities,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60825:202"/>

                  <p>I take for granted that you are fully convinced, that King <hi>Iames</hi> the Seventh, by his many Violations of the Fundamental Laws, by his endeavouring to establish a <hi>Despotick</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> and introduce <hi>Popery,</hi> (tho he himself had confirmed all the Laws that were enacted in Favour of the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi>) has thereby sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the <hi>Constitution,</hi> and (that our Miseries might have no Redress from him) has left us in a time when we needed his Protection most.

Burden of it: And it might have been supposed that even these, who had been <hi>Instrumental</hi> in <hi>Enslaving</hi> their <hi>Fellow-Brethren,</hi> and were grown Fat with Sucking the <hi>Nations Blood,</hi> would have taken another Method to Reconcile themselves, than by persuading us to purchase <hi>their</hi> Safety, at so vast an Expence as the <hi>Ruin</hi> of more than three Parts of the Nation will necessarily amount to.</p>
                  <p>If we do but a little reflect on the <hi>Motives</hi> which these Men (blinded by Self-Interest) make use of, to delude the Nation into a Security that wanted very little of proving Fatal to it, and compare them with the strong Reasons, we have to disswade us from being so imposed on, they will be found so <hi>Weak</hi> and <hi>Impertinent,</hi> that we must judg it next to <hi>Impossibility,</hi> to suffer our selves to be <hi>twice De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</hi> But if the Experience of our former Miseries, so lately hanging over our Heads, (the very Thoughts of renewing which, make all good Men to tremble) has not made us <hi>Wiser,</hi> and be not of <hi>Efficacy</hi> enough, to deter us from venturing another <hi>Shipwrack,</hi> and exposing all again to the <hi>Discretion</hi> of <hi>Roman Catholicks:</hi> It's more than probable that GOD has abandoned us, <hi>and given us up to believe strong Delusions.</hi>

                     <hi>First,</hi> Thay will endeavour to perswade us, that Kings are eximed from <hi>Punishments</hi> here on <hi>Earth,</hi> and nothing they do can be quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled by their Subjects, which indeed might with some Reason be urged among the <hi>Turks,</hi> who reserve nothing from the Power of their <hi>Sultans,</hi> and where it's Death to dispute his <hi>Commands,</hi> tho never so <hi>Arbitrary</hi> and <hi>Tyrannical:</hi> But with what Impudence can such <hi>Stuff</hi> be imposed on us, who never admit our <hi>Kings</hi> to the <hi>Government,</hi> till they swear to rule us according to <hi>Law,</hi> and no otherways? The <hi>Laws</hi> are the only Security we have for our Lives and Properties, which if our <hi>Sovereign</hi> subvert, <hi>Subjects</hi> cannot be blamed, for making use of the ordinary means to preserve them, and since that cannot be done without withdrawing Obedience from such a <hi>Magistrate</hi> as goes about to destroy them, such an Act cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be said to punish him, (because we take nothing from him to which he has a just Claim, but do only shun the occasion of making our selves miserable. The <hi>Speculative Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Passive Obedience,</hi> has done too much mischief among us, and what has befallen the <hi>King</hi> may be justly imputed to it, for the believing that without Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position he might <hi>do what he pleased,</hi> encouraged him to take such measures as have drawn all these Misfortunes on him.</p>

These Men do not consider, how small a Complement this is to a Man of the <hi>Kings Temper,</hi> from an an <hi>Absolute Prince,</hi> as he was pleased to fancy himself, to content himself with the bare Title of a <hi>King</hi>; and how insupportable the Charge must be, if from being <hi>Master of all,</hi> he must force him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to comply with a thousand <hi>Masters,</hi> and see his <hi>Throne</hi> become his <hi>Prison.</hi> But how airy is it to fancy, that any Restrictions of our Contrivance can bind the King?

                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>King</hi> is of a Religion that has in a famous Council decreed, That no Faith is to be kept with <hi>Hereticks,</hi> much less with Subjects whom he looks upon as so many <hi>Rebels,</hi> and will not miss to treat them as such, whenever they give him the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of doing it; for his greatest Admirers do not run to that height <hi>Idolatry,</hi> to imagine him so much <hi>Angel,</hi> as not to take all methods to revenge so great an Affront, and secure himself at our Cost from such a Treatment for the future; the apprehensions of which Resentments will strike such terrour in Mens minds, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will be capable to divert them from offering up All for an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, and <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery</hi> will be thought a good Bargain, if they can but save their Lives. Then we may lament our Miseries, but it will not be in our power to help them; for a <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> is not always ready to rescue us, with such vast Expence and so great hazard to his Person; and if our Madness hurry us so far, we deserve rather is pity than his resentment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> What Arguments has the King given since he left us, to persuade us he will be more faithful in observing his Words and Oaths, than hitherto he has been? Does he not in a Letter lately printed here, expresly say he has ruled so, as to give no occasion of complaint to any of his Subjects? Is not the same Letter signed by one who sacrificed both <hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> to <hi>Interest,</hi> who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60825:204"/>
King <hi>Iames</hi> the Seventh, by breathing the <hi>French Air,</hi> become less <hi>Bigot</hi>: It were a Dream to fancy it. For so long as the <hi>Vatican</hi> thunders Excommunications against all such as do not use their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most endeavours to extirpate <hi>Heresie,</hi> a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> must have no Religion at all, if they be not terrible to him.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> Argument they made use of to persuade such as are and shall be chosen Members of the <hi>Convention,</hi> That their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest to call back the King, is, That the Peace and Happiness of the Nation cannot be otherwise secured, nor Factions or Divisions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished. But what Factions do you observe, but such as they themselves do foment, on purpose to disturb our Harmony? all which would immediately die, if the Government were once setled on those who deserved it best: for then, if these Fops continued still fond of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Tyranny,</hi> they would be chastised, as Disturbers of the Publick Peace. The Argument may very justly be retorted; for if the King return, we will burst out into a flame; and <hi>England,</hi> which has already declared, will quickly be on our Top, an Enemy too Potent and too Numerous for us, tho' we were all united, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Danger to which such a Procedure will expose us, we cut off all hopes of an Union with that Nation, and thereby deprive our selves of an unspeakable Advantage, which would redound to all sorts of People, and would be the only means to support an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verish'd and sinking Nation. Neither is this the only Inconveniency, tho' it be a very great one; for if we state our selves in opposition to <hi>England,</hi> by <hi>Restoring</hi> the <hi>King</hi> whom they <hi>Rejected,</hi> it is not to be doubted but he will use his uttmost endeavour to recover that Kingdom, the loss of which is so considerable. Now, seeing it were vain to suppose that the <hi>Scots</hi> alone were able to second his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, he must needs have recourse to the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Irish,</hi> whose Religion will procure a more intire Confidence than His Majesty can repose in any others. These therefore must be received into our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som; and because <hi>Scotland</hi> is the most proper place for Invading <hi>England,</hi> it must be the Scene of all the Blood and Confusion that this melancholly Thought gives us a Prospect of. And what treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can such <hi>Sham-Protestants</hi> expect from these, who otherwise would have become their Friends and Allies? And what Figure will they pretend to make, when they set up for a separate Interest from all the <hi>Confederate Protestants</hi> in the World besides?</p>
                  <p>The happy Success the PRINCE his Enterprize has met with, has made a considerable Alteration in the Affairs of <hi>Europe</hi>; for that

great Enemy of the Protestants, and even of Christianity it self, who had propos'd nothing less to himself than an Universal <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> whom the Strictest <hi>Leagues</hi> and <hi>Contracts</hi> cannot bind, but without regard to GOD or Man, threatens all his <hi>Neighbours</hi> with utter Destruction; by the <hi>Scene</hi>'s being changed among us, is so far humbled, that from a <hi>Proud</hi> and <hi>Insulting Enemy,</hi> he is become a Supplicant for Peace; well foreseeing, that if <hi>Britain</hi> join with those other <hi>Princes,</hi> whom his Insolence, Cruelty, and Avarice, has so justly Armed against him, his Ruine is <hi>Inevitable</hi>: So that if we have not <hi>Soul</hi> enough to enjoy this great <hi>Blessing,</hi> and can easily part with the <hi>Glory</hi> of being once more the <hi>Arbiters</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> let us at least have so much <hi>Christian Love</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> for the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring <hi>Nations</hi> of our own Perswasion, as not to expose them to a necessary <hi>Participation</hi> of these <hi>Plagues,</hi> which our <hi>Common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> are preparing for us, and which will certainly <hi>Terminate</hi> in all our Destructions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> I beseech you to consider what <hi>Persons</hi> they are who would <hi>Instill</hi> this <hi>Poyson</hi> in you, and you will find them of three kinds. First, those who <hi>Postponing the Common Good</hi> of the <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> are wholly acted by <hi>Self-Interest,</hi> considering that in a <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> where <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> equally Flourish, <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Merit,</hi> not <hi>Villany,</hi> will be rewarded. Secondly, They who are ignorant of the Nature of Government, and were never at the pains to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themselves what Measures the Law of Nature and Nations have set to mens Obedience, but are angry at every thing that thwarts their wild Notions, and will admit of nothing, tho never so reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and convincing, if their dull Capacities cannot reach it. The third sort are such as have been instrumental in the inslaving their Country, and are afraid if they be called to an Account, they may be brought to suffer <hi>Condign Punishment</hi>; if such cannot succeed in their Design, they at least hope to be overlook'd in a <hi>General Confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> so they have nothing unessayed that may tend to their own safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and if <hi>Heaven</hi> fail them, they summon <hi>Hell</hi> to their Aid; not that <hi>Love</hi> to their <hi>Prince,</hi> but meer <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Interest,</hi> drives these <hi>Criminals</hi> to such Attempts; neither are they much to blame, if they are at such pains to sow Divisions among us. But no Person of <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Iudgment,</hi> nor any Good Man that is truly <hi>Protestant,</hi> and minds the good of his <hi>Country,</hi> will suffer himself to be so gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imposed on by such <hi>Firebands,</hi> who would build their Furture <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Greatness</hi> on the Ruine of <hi>Our Religion, Laws,</hi> and <hi>Country.</hi>

                  <p n="3">III. That he hath by the Council of evil Men invaded the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Constitution of the Kingdom, and changed it from a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Monarchy to an Absolute and Despotick Power.</p>

                  <head>The Opinion of two eminent Parliament-Men, justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lawfulness of taking the Oaths of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">I. FIdelity and Allegiance sworn to the King, is only a Fidelity and Obedience as it is due to him by the Law of the Lands, for were that Faith and Allegiance more than what the Law requires, we should swear our selves Slaves, and the King Absolute; whereas by the Law we are free, notwithstanding these Oaths.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:60825:206"/>II. When therefore by the Law Fidelity and Allegiance ceaseth; then our sworn Allegiance ceaseth: for if Allegiance might be due by the Oath to one Person, whilst by the Law it ceaseth to him and becomes due to another Person, the Oath then would oblige Men to transgress the Law, and become Traytors and Rebels, whereas the Oath is part of the Law, and therefore ought to be so interpreted as may consist with it.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Fidelity and Allegiance are due by the Law to King <hi>William,</hi> and not to King <hi>Iames</hi>: for the Statute of 25 of <hi>Edward</hi> 3<hi>d,</hi> which defined all Treasons against the King, and is the only Statute to that purpose; now that Statute, by the King, understands not only a King <hi>de jure,</hi> but also a King <hi>de facto,</hi> tho not <hi>de jure,</hi> against whom those Treasons Lie: whence the Lord Chief Justice <hi>Hales,</hi> in his Pleas of the Crown, <hi>p.</hi> 12. discoursing of that Statute, tells us, that a King <hi>de facto,</hi> and not <hi>de jure,</hi> is a King within that Act, and that Treason against him is Punishable, tho the Right Heir get the Crown: and that this hath been the common Sense of the Law, Sir <hi>R. S.</hi> (upon application to him about it) hath assured us. And according to another Statute, 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. <hi>ch.</hi> 1. It is declared Treason to be in Arms against a King <hi>de facto,</hi> such as <hi>Richard</hi> the 3<hi>d</hi> was, tho it was in behalf of a King <hi>de jure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So then by the Law of the Land, all things are Treason against King <hi>William,</hi> which have been Treason against former Kings, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the same Fidelity, Obedience and Allegiance, which was due to them, is due to him, and by Consequence may be Sworn to him by the Law of the Land.</p>
                  <p>Allegiance and Protection are always Mutual, and therefore when King <hi>Iames</hi> ceased to Protect us, we ceased to owe him Allegiance by the Law of the Land; and when King <hi>William</hi> began to Protect us we began our Allegiance to him.</p>
                  <p>These Considerations, are in our Opinion, sufficient to remove the Grand Scruple about the Oaths. If the dissatisfied Party accuse the Convention, for making the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> King, it is not my Duty to judge those above me, therefore I shall only say that if they have done ill, <hi>Quod fieri non debuit factum valet</hi>; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>WHEN the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (now our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious King) his Glorious Expedition, was first made known to the late King, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to have a Parliament, upon the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief that he should have been intirely Master of the Lower House, by Reason of the Regulations he had made in Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, in order to his Popish Designs. But when he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to take other Measures, (as he told the Dissenters when he sent for them in the time of his Distress) in restoring the Charters, the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> the Fellows of <hi>Magdalen</hi>-Colledg, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He dreaded nothing more than a Parliament on the old Foundations, to which the Prince in his Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had referred all; for he knew several things would have been done by such a Parliament, that he chose rather to perish than submit to.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first thing is; The Examination of the Birth of the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> (as he is call'd) the questioning of which was a Stab at his Heart, as appears by his last Letter. And the Reflections on the Bishops Petition, mentioning <hi>That</hi> as a Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness not fit to be referred then to a Parliament.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The next thing was; That Justice would certainly have been demanded against the Evil Counsellors, whom he had pardoned, and was in Honour bound to protect them, having himself forced them to be Criminals.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:60825:209"/>3. The third was; The consenting to the entire Ruin of Popery in <hi>England,</hi> by hanging many of his Priests and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits, and banishing all the rest; and pulling down all the Schools and Chappels they had erected all over <hi>England,</hi> (a sure Sign they were built upon an Immortal Prince of <hi>Wales)</hi> though this was done before by the unaccountable Zeal of the Mobile.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He foresaw such a Parliament would not only damn the Ecclesiastical Court, (that Beast with seven Heads) and the Dispensing Power, but would in all probability lessen his Revenue, and bind up the Prerogative; which his great Spirit could not bear.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Prince, he foresaw, would have demanded some Forts to be put into his Hands and the Parliament, for their Security; so said he, <hi>If I stay, I shall be but a Nominal King of</hi> England, <hi>and only be an Instrument to ruin my Religion, my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>riends, the Monarchy, and the Child also.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At first he alledged, That the Disorders the Preparations to repel the Invasion caused, would not suffer a Parliament to meet. Secondly, After the Prince was landed, that all the Countries he had under him would not be free. Thirdly, That all that had joined with him, ought not to sit: but when he saw the whole Army and Nation (the <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi> excepted) of the same mind, mere Force drove him to consent to Call a <hi>Parliament</hi>; and when he had again considered the Consequences of it, he at last resolved to throw up the Crown and Government all at once, rather than to submit to all these Hardships.</p>
                  <p>He seems to have had at the same time a fluttering hope, that (1.) We should never be able long to agree, after he had made it impossible for us to have a Legal Parliament, by burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Writs. (2.) That the <hi>Church of England</hi> Principles would, when the fear and disorder was over, form for him a potent Army in the Nation. And (3.) That the <hi>French</hi> King would lend him potent Forces, and good store of Mony; and if he recovered the Throne by force, he should be freed of all these Miseries, and have what he only wanted before, a Popish Army, to insure the Slavery of <hi>England</hi> for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:60825:209"/>Now I would desire those <hi>Protestants,</hi> who pretend, now too late, to be so zealous for him, to consider, whether what I have said would not have been expected from him by them, for their Security; and what they would have done had he called a Parliament, and refused them all these things, and have insisted, That they should have taken his Word as to the Birth of the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> have suffered him to have been educated in <hi>France,</hi> and have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the Army, the Prerogative, the Ministers, and the Revenues to have continued entirely as they were, upon a Promise, He would have used them better for the future?</p>
                  <p>If they say No; They would have had the best Security that Law or Reason could have required. Then all the hard things I have mentioned must have been granted them, and I much question, whether he would now return to the Throne on those terms.</p>
                  <p>If they say, We ought however to have treated with him, have offered him terms; I say, it would have come to a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Treaty; and the Church, the Liberties of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Government, would have been ruined that way; and when all had been done, no Bond (that he could have broken) would have held him longer than the Necessity had continued.</p>
                  <p>The only Advantage we could pretend to have by the coming over of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> with an Army, was to force the King to what he would never have yielded without that Force. Now when he had accordingly passed his Word to the Nation, in the Proclamation of the Thirtieth of <hi>November,</hi> That there should be a <hi>Free Parliament</hi>; and to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> in his Message by the three Lords, <hi>That he would consent to every thing that could reasonably be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for the Security of those that come to it</hi>; and yet without any Provocation would burn the Writs, and resolve to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his Person before these Lords cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d possibly return him any Answer (for he promised the Queen to follow her, who went away the day before him.) I say, this breach of his Word so solemnly made and given both to the Nation and the Prince, shew that he was not Master of himself, but turned about by others whither they pleased.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60825:210"/>Now suppose the Prince had suffered him to continue at <hi>White<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>al,</hi> and to call a Third Parliament, what a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>surance could he have given, that in the end of another forty days we should not have the same trick play'd us, and then in <hi>March</hi> or <hi>April</hi> have been left in the same state of Confusion we were in in <hi>December,</hi> to the certain Ruin of these three Kingdoms, and <hi>Holland</hi> into the bargain. And when all had been done, the Scruples would have been the same they are now, the Obligations of the Oath of Allegiance the same, and the sin of Deposing a Lawful Prince, who resolved to do the Nation no Right, would have been much greater and more scandalous, than barely to take him at his Word; and since he had left the Throne empty, when he needed not, to resolve he should ascend it no more.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, Suppose the Prince had been Expelled by the King, Would the King have then granted us what he would not grant us now? Would he not have Disbanded his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi> Army, and have kept the <hi>Irish</hi> Forces in Pay, and have every day encreased them? What Respect would he ever after this have shewn to the <hi>English</hi> Laws, Religion or Liberties, when he had no longer any thing to fear? The memory of what happened after the <hi>Monmouth</hi> defeat, (though effected only by <hi>Church of England</hi> Men) will certainly never be forgotten by others, whatever the Bigots of this sort of Loyalty may pretend or say.</p>
                  <p>That Expression of the Lord <hi>Churchil</hi>'s, in his Letter, [<hi>That he could no longer joyn with Self-interested Men, who had framed Designs against His Majesty's true Interest, and the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to give a pretence by Conquest to bring them to effect</hi>] ought to be seriously considered by all the Protestants of the Nation: This one Argument prevailed upon him, when he ran the hazard of his Life, Reputation and Fortunes; and now they are all on the other side, I should consider very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>iously, if I were one of them, what Answer I could make to this turned into a Question in the Day of Death and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, before ever I should Act the dire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t contrary to what he has done.</p>
                  <p>For my part I am amazed to see Men scruple the submitting to the present King: for if eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nding his Army, yielded him the Throne; and if he had, without any more Ceremony, ascended it, he had done no more than all other Princes do on the like occasions; and when the King after this was taken and brought back by force, he was no longer then bound to consider him, as one that <hi>was,</hi> but as one that <hi>had been</hi> King of <hi>England</hi>; and in that capacity he treated him with great Respect and Civility, how much soever the King complained of it, who did not enough consider what he had done to draw upon himself that usage.</p>
                  <p>But when all is said that can be said, there may possibly be some Men to whom may be applied the Saying of <hi>Ioab, Thou lovest thine Enemies, and hatest thy Friends; for thou hast de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared this day, that thou regardest neither Princes, nor Servants; for this Day I perceive, that if Absolom had lived, and all we had died this Day, then it had pleased thee well.</hi> Had the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion, the <hi>English</hi> Liberties, the Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of this Nation, been all made an <hi>Holocaust</hi> to their Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Humours, their Scruples and School-niceties, and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> perished, or returned Ruin'd or Inglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious into <hi>Holland</hi>; we should then have had the Honour of cutting up our Religion, our Laws, and our Civil Rights, with our own Swords; and we should have been the only Church under Heaven that had refused a Deliverance, and Religiously and Loyally had Destroyed it self. In truth, the Men would have purchased <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery</hi> so dear, ought to have enjoyed both to the End of the World.</p>

                  <head>The <hi>REASONS</hi> of the Suddenness of the Change in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE true Reasons of the Swiftness of this Change may easily be assigned by shewing the Temper and Designs of <hi>Iames</hi> the Second; the Temper of <hi>William</hi> the Third, our Present Soveraign; and the Nature of the English Nation, and of the Times, all concurring with Wonderful Harmony to produce this wonderful Effect. For had <hi>Iames</hi> the Second undertook any thing but the subjecting <hi>England</hi> to Popery, and the Exercise of Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power to that end, his vast Revenue, his great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and the Reputation he had gained at Home and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad by the defeat of the <hi>Monmouth</hi>-Invasion, would have gone near to have effected it: and after all this, if he had in the beginning of <hi>October</hi> frankly granted all the Ten Proposals made by the Bishops, and suffered a Parliament to have met, and given up a considerable Number of his Ministers to Justice, and suffered the pretended Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> his Birth to be freely debated and determin'd in Parliament; It would in all probability have prevented or defeated the then intended In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion. But whilst he thought to save the Pretended Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, the Dispensing and Suspending Power, and the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Commission, to carry on his former Design with, when he had baffl'd the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>; the Nation saw through the Project, and he lost all.</p>
                  <p>Had a Prince of less Secresy, Prudence, Courage and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest than the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> undertaken this business, it might probably have miscarri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d: but as his Cause was better, so his Reputation, Conduct, and Patience infinitely exceeded theirs; he would not stir till he saw the <hi>French</hi> Forces set down before <hi>Philipsbourgh,</hi> and then he was sure <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> were
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60825:211"/>
irrevocably ingaged in a War, and consequently he should have no other opposition than what the <hi>Irish</hi> and <hi>English Roman</hi> Catholicks could make against him. For no <hi>English</hi> Protestant would fight his Country into Vassalage and Slavery to Popish Priests, and <hi>Italian</hi> Women, when a Parliament sooner or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter must at last have determin'd all the things in Controversy, except we resolved once for all to give up our Religion, Laws, Liberties, and Estates to the will of our King, and submit for ever to a <hi>French</hi> Government.</p>
                  <p>A Nation of less sense than the <hi>English</hi> might have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed upon, of less bravery and valour might have been frighted; of a more servile temper, might have neglected its Liberties, till it had been too late to have ever recovered them again: But none but a parcel of <hi>Iesuits</hi> bred in a Cloister, and unacquainted with our Temper as well as Constitution would ever have hoped to have carried two such things as Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and Abitrary Power, both at once upon so jealous a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the <hi>English</hi> is, which hates them above any other People in the World.</p>
                  <p>The cruel slaughter they had made of the poor wretches they took after the defeat at <hi>Bridg-water</hi> ought to have made them for ever despair of gaining any credit with the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> who rarely forgive, but never forget any ill treatment. Yet these little <hi>Politico's</hi> had so little sense as to build all their hopes on the Gratitude and Insensibility of these Men; as if they should for <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Conscience,</hi> arbitrarily and illegally granted, and consequently revocable at the will of the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, have sold themselves to everlasting Slavery.</p>
                  <p>They were equally mistaken in their carriage towards the Church of <hi>England party,</hi> for when some of them had pursued both Clergy and Laity with the utmost obloquy, hatred, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression and contempt to the very moment they found the <hi>Dutch</hi> storm would fall upon them. Then all at once they passed to the other extream, the Bishops are presently sent for, the Government intirely to be put into their hands, and all Places, Presses and Papers fill'd with the <hi>Encomiums</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s Loyalty and Fidelity, who but three days before were Male-contents, if not Rebels and Traytors, for opposing the Kings Dispensing Power, and the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60825:212"/>
Commission. And which was the height of folly, the same Pen which had been hired to defame and blacken the Church of <hi>England</hi> (the Author of the <hi>Publick Occurrences truly stated)</hi> was ordered to magnify its Loyalty. By which they gained nothing but the intire and absolute disobliging the whole Protestant party in the Nation, so that for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture no Body would serve or trust them.</p>
                  <p>To compleat their folly and madness they perswaded the King to throw up the Government, and retire into <hi>France,</hi> pretending we would never be able to agree amongst our selve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, but would in a short time be forced to recal him, and yield to all those things we had so violently opposed; or if not, he might yet at least force us to submit by the Succours he might gain in <hi>France,</hi> without ever considering how possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it was we might agree, and how difficult it would be to force us by a <hi>French</hi> Army, which was equally contrary to the Interest of <hi>England,</hi> and all <hi>Europe</hi> besides, and to all intents and purposes destructive of the Interest of that Prince they pretended thus to exalt and re-establish.</p>
                  <p>Had <hi>France</hi> been now in Peace, there might yet have been same colour for this; but when all <hi>Europe</hi> was under a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to unite against him for its own preservation, then to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> to desert his Throne, and fly thither for succour, upon hopes of recovering his Kingdoms again by the assistance of the <hi>French</hi> (the mortal and heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Enemies of the <hi>English</hi>) this was so silly a Project, that there seems to have been something of a Divine Infatuation in it.</p>
                  <p>However certainly no rational Man will think that all the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> would sit still and suffer the <hi>French</hi> King to conquer <hi>Britain,</hi> under pretence of restoring <hi>Iames</hi> the Second to that Throne which he had abandon'd, because he could not bring the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (their Allie) and all his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Subjects to his own Terms.</p>
                  <p>And yet if none of them should interpose but the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> alone, the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleets being united would render the landing a <hi>French</hi> Army so difficult and uncertain, that it would be next door to madness to trust one to their Navy, which is so much inferior to either of the others singly taken.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:60825:212"/>So that all things considered, either <hi>Iames</hi> the Second ought to have stayed at home and have made as good terms as he could with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and his own Subjects: Or if he would have abandon'd his Kingdoms, he ought to have despaired of any restitution, and have betaken himself to a private Life as <hi>Christina</hi> Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> did.</p>
                  <p>But we have now certain Intelligence that <hi>Iames</hi> the Second Landed the 12<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>March</hi> at <hi>Kingsale</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> so that now it cannot be doubted but that he hopes to recover <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> by the help of the <hi>Irish</hi>; as well as the <hi>French.</hi> His succeeding in this Design laying us at the Mercy of an <hi>Irish-French Roman</hi> Catholick Army; whose Civility and Kindness to our Nation we may learn from our Country-men, who after having lost all but their Lives, have been forced to flee over to us for Shelter and Protection. I shall not add any other consideration to perswade my Country-men to defend their King, Queen, and the whole Protestant Succession, their Lives, Liberties, Priviledges and Religion, because this alone is sufficient.</p>

                  <p>WE have received your Majesties Letters, dated from St. <hi>Germans</hi> the sixth of <hi>February</hi> last, by the Earl of <hi>Carlingford,</hi> your Envoy in our Court: By them we have understood the Condition your Majesty is reduced to; and that you being deserted after the landing of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> by your Army, and even by your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick Servants, and by those you most confided in, and almost by all your Subjects, you have been forced by a sudden Flight to provide for your own safety, and to seek Shelter and Protection in <hi>France:</hi> Lastly, that you desire Assistance from us for the recovering your Kingdoms. We do assure your Majesty, that as soon as we heard of this severe turn of Affairs, we were moved at it, not only with the common sense of Humanity, but with much deeper Impressions sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the sincere Affection which we have always born to you. And we were heartily sorry that at last that was come to pass, which (though we hoped for better things) yet our own sad thoughts had suggested to us would ensue. If your Majesty had rather given Credit to the Friendly Remonstran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that were made you, by our late Envoy, the Count de <hi>Kaunitz,</hi> in our Name, than the deceitful Insinuations of the French, whose chief aim was, by fomenting continual Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60825:214"/>
between you and your People, to gain ther by an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to insult the more securely over the rest of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom. And if your Majesty had put a stop, by your Force and Authority, to their many Infractions of the Peace, of which by the Treaty at <hi>Nimegen</hi> you are made the Guarantee, and to that end entred into Consultations with us, and such others as have the like just Sentiments in this matter; We are verily perswaded that by this means you should have in a great measure quieted the Minds of your People, which were so much exasperated through their aversion to our Religion, and the publick Peace had been preserved as well in your Kingdoms as here in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. But now we refer it even to your Majesty, to judg what condition we can be in to afford you any Assistance, we being not only engaged in a War with the <hi>Turks,</hi> but finding our selves at the same time unjustly and barbarously Attacked by the <hi>French,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to, and against the Faith of Treaties, they then reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves secure of <hi>England.</hi> And this ought not to be concealed; that the greatest Injuries which have been done to our Religion have flowed from no other than the <hi>French</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; who not only esteem it lawful for them, to make Presidious Leagues with the sworn Enemies of the Holy Cross, tending to the destruction both of us and of the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian World, in order to the checking our Endeavours which were undertaken for the Glory of God, and to stop those Successes which it hath pleased Almighty God to give us hitherto; but further have heaped one Treachery upon another, even within the Empire it self. The Cities of the Empire which were surrendered upon Articles, signed by the <hi>Dolphin</hi> himself, have been exhausted by excessive Impositions; and after their being exhausted have been Plund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, and after Plundering have been burned and razed. The Palaces of Princes, which in all times, and even in the most destructive Wars, have been preserved, are now burnt down to the Ground. The Churches are robbed, and such as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themselves to them, are in a most Barbarous manner, carried away as Slaves. In short, it is become a Diversion to them to commit all manner of insolences and Cruelties in many places, but chiefly in Catholick Countries, exceeding the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60825:214"/>
Cruelties of the <hi>Turks</hi> themselves: which having imposed an absolute necessity upon us to secure our selves and the Holy Roman Empire, by the best means we can think on, and that no less against them than against the <hi>Turks</hi>; We promise our selves from your justice ready assent to this, That it ought not to be imputed to us, if we endeavour to procure, by a just War, that security to our selves which we could not hitherto obtain by so many Treaties; and that in order to the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, We take measures for our mutual Defence and Preservation, with all those who are equally concerned in the same Design with us. It remains that we beg of God that he would direct all things to his Glory, and that he would grant your Majesty true and solid Comforts under this your great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity; we embrace you with tender Affections of a Brother.</p>

                  <p>The Prince then (on <hi>December</hi> the 30<hi>th</hi>) issued out his Proclamation for the Continuance of the Sheriffs, Justices of the Peace, and other Officers and Ministers (not being Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists) to act in their respective Places till the Meeting of the Convention, or other Order to the contrary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the 2<hi>d</hi> of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> He put out a Declaration for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter collecting of the Publick Revenue.</p>
                  <p>On the 5<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Ianuary</hi> he put forth an Order for all Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Officers, with their respective Companies, to march out of the Quarters where any Elections should be (the several Garisons excepted) the day before the same be made, to the next adjoining Town, or Towns, being not appointed for any Elections; and not to return to their first Quarters, till the said respective Elections be made and fully compleated, that so the Election of Members for the intended <hi>Convention</hi> may be free, and without any colour of Force or Restraint.</p>
                  <p>On the 7<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Ianuary</hi> the Scotish Nobility and Gentry wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the Prince: what was done by them, see the 6<hi>th Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,</hi> pag. 9, 10, 11, 12.</p>
                  <p>On the 8<hi>th</hi> day his Highness put out a Declaration against Quartering of Souldiers in private Houses. He found the Treasury very empty of Cash, it being said to be but 40000 <hi>l.</hi> Whereupon he desired the City of <hi>London</hi> to advance a Sum for his present Occasion, and on the 10<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Ianuary</hi> they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to lend 100000 <hi>l.</hi> But it being raised by Subscription, it amounted to above 150000 <hi>l.</hi>

                  <p>On the 16<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> He put out a Declaration to assure the Mariners and Seamen of their Pay.</p>
                  <p>The two Houses met on the 22<hi>d</hi> of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> 1688/9; the Lords chose the Marquess of <hi>Hallifax</hi> for their Speaker; and the Commons chose <hi>Henry Powle</hi> 
                     <abbr>Esq</abbr> for theirs. After

which a Letter was read in both Houses from the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> on the occasion of their Meeting, to this Effect.</p>
                  <p>That he had endeavoured to perform what was desired from him for the Publick Peace and Safety during his Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration; and that it now lay on them to lay a Foundation of a firm Security for their Religion, Laws and Liberties. That he did not doubt but that by such a full and free Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative of the Nation, the Ends of his Declaration would be attained.</p>
                  <p>He recommended to them the dangerous Condition of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and also of the <hi>States of Holland,</hi> both which required large and speedy Succours; and told them, That since it had pleased God hitherto to bless his good Intentions with so great Success, he trusted in him, that he would compleat his own Work, by sending a Spirit of Peace and Union to influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence their Counsels, that so no Interruption may be given to a happy and lasting Settlement.</p>
                  <p>The first Thing the two Houses took care of, was, by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Consent, to make an Address to the Prince; in which they acknowledged him the Glorious Instrument, under God, in the great Deliverance of the Kingdom from Popery and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power. They acknowledged also his great Care in the Administration, and entreated him to continue it till further Application; and that he would take into his Care the State of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then the Houses ordered that <hi>Thursday, Ian.</hi> 31. be a Day of Thanksgiving in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and places adjacent, within ten Miles; and the 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> throughout the whole Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Then the Lords ordered, that no Papist, or reputed Papist, should presume to come into the <hi>Lobby, Painted Chamber, Court of Requests,</hi> or <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> during the Sitting of the Convention.</p>

and Consideration for</hi> Scotland, <hi>and therefore I did emit a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration in relation to That as well as to this Kingdom, which I intend to make good and effectual to them.
