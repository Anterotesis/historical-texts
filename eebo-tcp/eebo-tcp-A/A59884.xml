            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>I PHIL. 23, 24.</bibl>
               <q>For I am in a strait betwixt two,
having a desire to depart, and to
be with Christ, which is far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</q>
               <q>Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is
more needful for you.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>ST. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this Epistle to
<hi>Philippi</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> where he
was in Bonds for the Gospel;
but though his Body was confined
to a Prison, his Soul, his great
Divine Soul was at Liberty to visit the
Churches he had planted, to advise
and counsel and comfort them, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
their Knowledge, and to confirm
their Faith, to inflame their Zeal, and to
spur them forward to more perfect Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in all Piety and Vertue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:52770:5"/>
The <hi>Philippians</hi> seem greatly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
least the Progress of the Gospel should
be hindred by St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Imprisonment,
and least they and the whole Church
should be deprived of the Labours and
Ministry of so great an Apostle, should
this Persecution extend to Life, as they had
reason to fear it would.</p>
            <p>As for the first, St. <hi>Paul</hi> assures them,
That his Bonds were for the furtherance
of the Gospel; for his Imprisonment was
taken notice of both in the Court and
City, which made Men curious to know,
what that Doctrine was, which he
preached, and for which he suffered
Bonds, and this published the Gospel
more effectually than his Preaching could
have done, <hi>v. 12, 13, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the second, he tells them, He
was no farther concerned either about
Life or Death, but that Christ might be
<hi>magnified in his Body.</hi> If he lived, his
Life was wholly devoted to the Service of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52770:5"/>
Christ, and of his Church; if he died, it
would be for his own great Advantage.
<hi>To me to live is Christ, and to die is gain;</hi>
vers. 20, 21. and this made it a hard
choice to him, whether he should desire
to live or die: whether he should get
rid of his Bonds, and make his Escape
out of a troublesom World into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
of Ease and Rest, to reap the Fruit
of his Labours here in the eternal Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Lord, whom he had so
faithfully served; or whether he should
live to Encounter with a thousand Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
and Deaths in the Service of
Christ, and of the Souls of Men. <hi>What
I should chose I wot not: for I am in a
strait betwixt two, having a desire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
and to be with Christ, which is far
better: nevertheless, to abide in the Flesh is
more needful for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was there ever such a Dispute as this
before, That a Man, who was as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to go to Heaven, as he was to die;
who had himself been snatch'd up into the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52770:6"/>
third Heavens, and had his Mind possest
with strong and vigorous and lively Idea's
of the Glories of that place, who had seen
and heard such things as could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed;
who saw a Crown, a glorious
immarcessible Crown prepared for him; I
say, that such a Man should make any
question what he should chose, whether
immediately to take possession of this
Crown and Kingdom, or to live longer
in this World to suffer Bonds and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonments,
Hunger, and Cold, and
Stripes, and all the ill usage, which he had
so often met with, for no other reason
but still to preach the Gospel, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
the Borders of Christ's Church.
What a Contempt is this, not only of
the little Pleasures and Satisfactions, but
even of all the Miseries of Life! what
a Triumph is this over the World, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all the Frowns and Terrours of it!
what a Triumph is this over Self! such
a degree of Self-denial as the Gospel it
self does not command, which is in some
sence to deny Heaven, to deny all the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52770:6"/>
Joys of Christ's Presence for the sake of
doing good! for it is to delay, to put
off Heaven, to adjourn his own Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that he may live the longer to serve
his great Master, though with great Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
and Labours. What Love was
this to his Lord! what Love was this to
the Souls of Men! it is certainly the
most perfect imitation of the Love of
Christ, that is possible to Man; Christ so
loved us as to come down from Heaven
to live a laborious Life, and to die an
accursed Death for us; this great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
so loved his Lord, and so loved the
Souls of Men, that he made it his choice
to stay some time out of Heaven, and
to encounter all the Miseries and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
of this Life, to serve Christ and
his Church. Where is this Divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
now to be found! Let us, my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Brethren, who are entrusted also
with the Care of Souls by the <hi>great Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
and Bishop of our Souls,</hi> blush to
think how far short we fall of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample:
let this inspire us with a flaming
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52770:7"/>
Love and Zeal for the Souls of Men,
for whom Christ died, and make us at
least contented to deny our selves some
of the Ease and Security and Pleasures
of Life, to serve the Church of Christ,
which he hath purchased with his own
blood.</p>
            <p>But to keep my self within some
Bounds, I shall briefly Discourse on these
two Heads, which are very proper for
this Occasion, and very proper to my
Text. <hi>First,</hi> The great Rewards of
faithful Pastors and Ministers of Christ,
and how much it is for their advantage
to be removed out of this World. St.
<hi>Paul</hi> was very sensible of this, which made
him <hi>desire to depart, and to be with Christ,
which is far better. Secondly,</hi> How ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
the Lives of such Men are to the
Church, and what a great loss it is, when
God removes them out of it. <hi>Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
to abide in the flesh is more needful for
you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:52770:7"/>
1. Let us then consider in the first
place the great Rewards of the faithful
Ministers of Christ, and how much it is
for their advantage <hi>to depart, and to be
with Christ.</hi> Now I do not here intend a
comparison between Heaven and Earth:
Good God! what different things are
these? and what Christian doubts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Heaven be a happier Place than this
World? Heaven! whither no Troubles
or Sorrows can follow us; no persecuting
Sword, no persecuting Tongue: where
we shall be delivered from all the Wants,
Necessities, and Infirmities of the Body,
from Hunger and Cold and Nakedness,
from wracking Pains and languishing Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses;
where there is eternal Ease and
Rest and Joy, without labour, without
discontents, without quarrels; where our
Souls shall be perfected in knowledge and
in love; where we shall dwell in the
Presence of God, see him as he is, and
know him even as we are known; where
we shall dwell with Christ, adore his
Love, behold his Glory, and be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52770:8"/>
our selves into the likeness and
image of his Glory. We have but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
imperfect Conceptions of these
things now; Heaven will out-do our
highest Expectations, as much as the most
perfect state of Happiness in this World,
always falls short of what we expected;
and this is the case of all good Men, it is
a mighty happy Change they make, when
they remove from Earth to Heaven.</p>
            <p>But there are different Degrees of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in the next World, proportioned not
only to our different attainments in Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
but to those different Trusts and
Services which we have been employed in,
and have faithfully discharged here. We
read of the Reward of a Prophet, that
he who gives a Cup of cold Water to a
Prophet in the name of a Prophet, shall
have a Prophets Reward, which must sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
some peculiar Reward that shall be
bestowed on Prophets: We know so
little of the other World, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
conceive, what these different Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52770:8"/>
shall be: The Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
it by an external Glory, 12 <hi>Dan. 3.
And they that be wise shall shine as the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Firmament, and they that turn
many to righteousness, as the stars for ever
and ever.</hi> But our Saviour represents this
by a different degree of Rule and Empire,
12 <hi>Luke 42. 43, 44. And the Lord said, who
then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his
Lord shall make ruler over his houshold, to
give them their meat in due season:</hi> This is
the honourable Character of Gospel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
in this World, that they are <hi>Rulers
in God's houshold,</hi> to instruct and feed them
with the Word of Life; and their Reward
is proportioned to their Work; <hi>Blessed is
that servant, whom his Lord, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
shall find so doing. Of a truth I
say unto you, that he will make him ruler o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all that he hath.</hi> What this <hi>Rule</hi> signifies
in the other World is a Mystery to us, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
since we have fancied the other
World to be only a State of Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not of Action, where we shall have
nothing to do but to see God, and to love
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52770:9"/>
and to praise him, but no service to do for
him; but we know there are different or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Angels, who are imployed in great
Trusts and Offices, Arch-Angels, Angels,
Thrones, Dominions, Principalities and
Powers, which are names of Rule and
Government, though we know not what
their Power and Authority is nor how they
Govern; in like manner our Saviour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
his Apostles, <hi>verily I say unto you, that
ye which have followed me in the regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when the son of man shall sit on the
throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon
twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of
Israel,</hi> 19 Matth. 28. The like we may
see in the Parable of the Pounds and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents;
He who had gained ten Pounds had
Rule over ten Cities; and he who gained
five Pounds had Rule over five Cities: for
these Servants to whom the Lord gave
these Pounds and Talents to improve,
plainly signifie his Stewards, and the
Ministers of his spiritual Kingdom: for
no other Persons have in so peculiar a
manner, this honourable Character of the
Servants of Christ throughout the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52770:9"/>
And if there be Order and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
among the Angels themselves, Why
should we think that there is nothing like
this among glorified Saints? if Angels are
the Ministers of God, there is no reason
to think that Heaven is a State of meer
Rest and Contemplation, especially when
Happiness consists in Action. And if Christ
have any Ministers of his spiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in the next World, it is most reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to think, that those shall have the
greatest Authority, and be employed in the
noblest Services, who have been his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Stewards and Ministers in this World.
For the Church on Earth and in Heaven is
the same Church, though their State be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
different; and therefore they do not
lose their relation to Christ, nor their sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in his Church by removing to Heaven.
It is a sacerdotal Kingdom, our <hi>High Priest</hi>
is <hi>King,</hi> and therefore <hi>a Priest of Jesus,</hi>
how mean soever this be thought now, will
be one of the highest Characters in Heaven.
What the Happiness of this is we cannot
tell; but we know that there are no emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52770:10"/>
Titles in Heaven, but every degree of
Dignity there signifies a peculiar degree of
Happiness, and what an advantageous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
then is it for a faithful Minister of
Jesus to be removed from Earth to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For let us consider what the State of
Christ's Ministers is in this World; what
it was in St.</hi> Paul'<hi>s days he tells us,</hi> 2 Cor.
6. 4—10. In all things approving our
selves as the Ministers of God, in much
patience, in afflictions, in necessities,
in distresses, in Stripes, in imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
in tumults, in labours, in
watchings, in fasting; by pureness, by
knowledge, by long suffering, by kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
by the Holy Ghost, by love
unfeigned, by the word of truth, by
the power of God, by the Armour of
righteousness on the right hand and on
the left; by honour and dishonour, by
evil report and good report, as deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and yet true; as unknown and yet
well known; as dying and behold we
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52770:10"/>
live, as chastened and not killed; as sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful,
yet always rejoycing; as poor, yet
making many rich; as having nothing, and yet
possessing all things. <hi>Which describes a
most laborious Life, a Scene of Wants,
of Difficulties, of Sufferings; a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
exercise of passive Vertues, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
the most appearing Contradictions,
to live and struggle and contend in this
World, and to fetch their Comforts and
Supports from Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This indeed is not always the State
of the Christian Church, nor of the
Ministers of it; but yet in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
external Prosperity of the Church,
the Ministers of Religion, who discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Trust with Diligence and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
find many difficulties to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>The care of Mens Souls is itself a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Trust, and <hi>Who is sufficient for these
things?</hi> consider but the Charge St. <hi>Paul</hi>
gives to <hi>Timothy</hi> 1 Epist. 4. 11, <hi>&amp;c.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52770:11"/>
Let no man despise thy youth, but be
thou an example of the believers, in word,
in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in
faith, in purity; give attendance to read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to exhortation, to doctrine, neglect not
the gift that is in thee, which was given
thee by Prophesie, by laying on of the
hands of the Presbytery: Meditate upon
these things, give thy self wholly to them,
that thy profiting may appear to all;
take heed to thy self, and to thy doctrine;
continue in them, for in doing this thou shalt
both save thy self, and then that hear thee.</hi>
Here is work enough to employ the whole
Man, and our utmost care and diligence
and prudence; work for the Study, for
the Closet, for the Pulpit, as the same A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
exhorts and charges <hi>Timothy, to preach
the word, to be instant in season, out of season,
to reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Doctrine,</hi> 2 Tim 4. 2. But yet
though there be labour and diligence in
this, it would be a delightful work, were
our Labours always blessed with success;
could we rescue the Souls of Men
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52770:11"/>
from the Dominion of their Lusts, and
from the Power of the Devil, could
we turn them from Darkness to Light,
and from the power of Satan unto God,
but we must often expect <hi>to labour all
might and catch nothing,</hi> we must
contend with the Lusts and Vices of
Men, must bear their Folly, their Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness,
their Reproaches, and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
and injuries, be thought Trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
Pragmatical, and Busie-bodies, for
our charitable Exhortations and Reproofs,
and watchfulness over their Souls. And
when the Church is at ease and rest
from without, how often is it rent and
torn in Pieces with Schisms and Heresies?
as St. <hi>Paul</hi> fore-warned <hi>Timothy, the
time will come when they will not endure
sound Doctrine, but after their own lusts,
shall they heap to themselves Teachers,
having itching ears, and they shall turn
away their ears from the truth, and
be turned unto fables, 3, 4. ver.</hi> and
what infinite Labours and Difficulties
does this create to the Ministers of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52770:12"/>
Gospel, to heal the Breaches of the Church,
to confute Heresies, Atheism, Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and to be scorned and persecuted
for it with a bitter Rage and Zeal.
That St. <hi>Paul</hi> might well add, <hi>But watch
thou in all things, endure afflictions, do
the work of an Evangelist, make full proof
of thy ministry,</hi> 5 verse. We ought not
indeed to be discouraged by such difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as these, because our Reward will
be great in Heaven, but it will be a
happy Day, when <hi>Our warfare shall be
accomplished,</hi> when we shall <hi>cease from
our labours, and our works shall follow us:</hi>
when we can say with St. <hi>Paul, I have
fought a good fight, I finished my course,
I have kept the faith, henceforth there is
laid up for me a Crown of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Thus to die is their gain, <hi>Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless,
it is more needful</hi> for the Church,
that <hi>they should abide in the flesh:</hi> And a
great loss it is to the Church, when they
die. I need not use many words about
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52770:12"/>
this, for the case is plain. The Death
of every good Man who is very useful
to the World, in what way soever he
be useful, is a very great loss; for
Death puts an end to his doing any
more good in this World: but as to
take care of the Souls of Men, is to
do the greatest good to Mankind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Happiness of our Souls is of
the greatest concernment to us, so to lose
a faithful and a prudent Guide must be
the greatest loss.</p>
            <p>We indeed of this Church, have great
reason to bless God, that he has sent
forth so many able and painful Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
into his Harvest, that it is not the
loss of every good Man that can much
affect us at ordinary times: For there
are great numbers of wise and good
Men to perpetuate a Succession of able
and faithful Guides: but a St. <hi>Paul</hi> is at
any time, and in any Age of the Church
a great loss: Nay, Men who are much
Inferiour to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but yet fitted with
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52770:13"/>
peculiar Abilities to serve the Church at
some certain Seasons, and in some difficult
Circumstances, are a very sensible loss at
such a time, when their service is most
needful.</p>
            <p>A Man of Council and Conduct,
who is fit to sit at the Helm, and knows
how to steer in a Storm, is a great loss,
in times of Difficulty and Trouble, when
the Church is assaulted on all hands,
and it is hard to avoid one Mischief or
Inconvenience without running into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>A Man of Goodness and Temper,
who knows how to govern his own
Passions, and how to soften and manage
the Passions of other Men, is a very
sensible loss, when the Passions of Men
are broke loose, and disturb the Peace
of the Church, and even threaten the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:52770:13"/>
A Man of Learning and sound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who can distinguish between Truth
and Errour in all its most artificial and
flattering Disguises, is a great loss, when
old Errours are revived, and new ones
broached; when we must dispute over
again the very Being of a God, the truth
of the Scriptures, and Articles of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith.</p>
            <p>A Man of great Diligence and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
Courage and Resolution, to defend
the Truth, to oppose Heresies and Schisms,
to preserve the Unity of the Church, and
the Integrity of the Christian Faith, is a
very great loss, when the Church is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed
and assaulted with busie and rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Enemies.</p>
            <p>A Man of an exemplary Life, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted
Vertue, who shines like a Light in
the midst of a crooked and perverse Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
who maintains the declining Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Repuration of Religion and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52770:14"/>
true Vertue, is a mighty loss in a profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
Age, when men are grown such Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to the sincere Practice of Vertue and
Religion, that they begin to think there is
no such thing.</p>
            <p>But I can go on no farther, the very men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
of these things brings the fresh Idea
of our deceased Brother to mind, and the
afflicting Sense of that great loss, which
we suffer by his Death. It becomes us
to Reverence and Adore the Wisdom of
the divine Providence, even when we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
understand the Reasons of it. We
are certain God is never wanting in his
Care of his Church, and yet had we been
made Judges of this Case, we should have
thought it a very ill time to have spared
him.</p>
            <p>He was abundantly furnished with all
good Learning, both for Use and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
he was an accomplished Scholar,
and a well studied Divine; he knew
Books and read them, and judged of them:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52770:14"/>
He was a Scribe instructed unto the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven, who like a Housholder
could bring forth out of his treasure things
New and Old, 13 <hi>Matth.</hi> 52. He had carefully
perus'd the ancient Philosophers, Orators and
Poets, to discover what Nature taught, which
gave him a truer Knowledge and greater
Value for the Excellency and Perfection of
the Gospel-Revelation.</p>
            <p>He had true and clear Notions of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and he was Master of them; he
knew why he believed any thing, and was
neither prejudiced nor imposed on by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
Opinions; he was a hearty and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
Assertor of the Doctrine, Worship,
Government and Discipline of the Church
of <hi>England;</hi> he saw nothing material,
which could be changed for the better,
which made him jealous of Innovations, as
not knowing where they would end. He
was a Friend to all sincere Christians, pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied
their Mistakes, and bore with their
Frowardness, but did not think that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Charity required him to sacrifice
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52770:15"/>
Truth, or good Order and Government to
the pretences of Peace and Unity.</p>
            <p>He was for several Years a very diligent
and constant Preacher to a numerous Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory,
till his own Diocesan who knew
his Worth, and the weakness of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
and was desirous to preserve him
for the Service of the Church, provided
this place where we now are, for his Ease
and Health, and Retirement; where he
lived many Years a constant Preacher,
though his Labours were then divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his two Cures, which did not lessen
his Preaching, but made the Benefit of it
the more diffusive. For indeed he was an
admirable Preacher, not for Noise and
Lungs, but for well digested useful pious
Discourses, delivered with all that becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Gravity, Seriousness, and a command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Elocution, as made them sink deep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Minds of his Hearers, and made
them hear. This I speak with Assurance
and Confidence in this place, which was
so long blessed with his Labours, with
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52770:15"/>
what fineness of Thought, perspicuity and
easiness of Expression instructing and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining
Images of Things, he expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Doctrines, and inculcated the Laws
of our Saviour; how plainly he Taught,
with what Vehemence and Passion he Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted,
with what tender Sharpness he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved:
remember how he used both to
Please and Instruct, to Chide and Shame
you without making you angry, how he
has warmed and chaffed your Minds into
the most pious and serious Resolutions,
and sent you home from this place wiser
and better then you came; and if you grew
cold, and suffered your good Resolutions
to die again, consider I beseech you, what
Account you have to give.</p>
            <p>As he grew in Years, it was necessary
by degrees to ease his Labours, he could
not Preach so often, but yet continued to
Preach. And yet had he not Preached at
all, or much less then he did, he had not
ceased to be a very useful Pastor to the
Church; for he was a Man of great Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52770:16"/>
and great Prudence and Fore-sight;
fit for Government and Counsel; who
knew Men and Things; was dexterous in
his Applications, zealous without Passion
or Peevishness, steady and resolved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
violent Oppositions, and needless Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations;
who served the Church and
the Truth with little Noise, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
making many Enemies: And I am
sure at such a time as this, there is more
need of such Men, and a much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
scarcity of them, than of good Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</p>
            <p>But he was not only a good Preacher
and a prudent Guide, but a very good
Man: he Preached continually by his Life
and Example: his Conversation was Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
Entertaining, and Useful; he was a
true sincere Friend, very Courteous, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable,
Civil to all Men, but never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
Friendship where he had none: he
was ready to do all good Offices, was Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral,
Generous, and Charitable; a Man
of a true publick Spirit, who scorned to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52770:16"/>
serve himself to the Injury of others, who
hated little Arts and Tricks, mean and
servile Compliances: he was an open and
generous Enemy, if we may ever call him
an Enemy, who never wished, never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
any hurt to any Man; but my
meaning is, that when any Dispute and
Quarrel happened, as such things will
sometimes happen, he was open and
undisguised, any Man might know what
he disliked, and had no reason to fear
any thing worse from him, than what
he would tell them. In a Word, he
was a very good Christian, and that
made him good in all Relations, and
that Crowned all his other Labours;
he took care as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Lest while
he preached to others, he himself should
become a cast-away.</hi> And now he is
gone to rest, and we must all shortly
follow him; God grant that we may
all so run our Race, and finish our
Course, that when we depart this
Life we may rest in Him, as our hope
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52770:17"/>
in this our Brother doth, and may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that Crown of Righteousness, which
God the Righteous Judge, will at that
Day bestow on all his faithful Servants,
and on all those who love his Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
