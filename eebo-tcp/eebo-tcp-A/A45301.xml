            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O ſoon as (to my great griefe and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment) I received notice from you of the ſtrange rumour generally ſcattered abroad, of a thouſand horſe or more, that ſhould be provided by the Clergy, and eſpecially by the Biſhops of this Kingdome, for ſome dangerous, but ſecret exploit; I acquainted ſome eminent perſons of that profeſsion with the newes: Who at the firſt ſeemed to entertaine it with a ſmiling kind of neglect, as the fained device of a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible to finde beliefe: but when I told them, it was not onely ſeriouſly divulged, but alſo credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by many, who ſeemed not in-judicious, they began to be ſtrucken with much horrour, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement; and to lament the condition of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the times; and to impute the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66259:3"/>
of this crime, to the malice of ſome ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected perſons, who meant, by this meanes, to ſtir up the envy, and unjuſt hatred of good people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their perſons, and calling. Good Lord, ſaid they, were wee not loaden enough before with the weight of more then our own enormities, but we muſt be cruſhed with the heavier preſſures of imaginary miſchiefes? Alas, what have we done thus to irritate, and enrage the world againſt us? What can it bee that makes us guilty of this fury? How many of us are there, that have not yet been taxed with any crime but our Rochet? yet wee ſuffer no leſſe, then if it were an offence to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. After they had a little breathed out their ſorrow, they recollected themſelves, and began to thinke what they might doe to give the world ſome kinde of ſatisfaction, in this odious aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that is caſt upon them: at laſt they reſolved that however they doubted not but time would fully manifeſt their integrity, yet, that in the mean while it was not fit that their ſilence ſhould make them acceſſary to their owne cauſeleſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy; and therefore they earneſtly deſired me to take, and give notice to your worthy ſelfe, and all other ingenuous perſons, of their ſerious and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66259:3"/>
Proteſtation, before God and the world, of their cleare and perfect innocence in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe. They doe therefore call the God of heaven to witneſſe, that they are ſo far from having any hand in any buſineſſe of this kinde, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard or received the leaſt intimation of any attempt, word, purpoſe, or thought tending this way; neither can yet imagine what the meaning of any ſuch combination, or enterpriſe might be: as thoſe who have deſired, in all their attendance on theſe publick ſervices, to approve their fidelity, to God, their King, and Country. In the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence wherof, they bade me to challenge all thoſe ſecret whiſperers, who have thus gone about to poyſon their good names in the opinion of all loyall and true-hearted Subjects, to notifie and bring forth ſpeedily the grounds of thoſe accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and to fix them upon ſuch perſons, as they dare charge for guilty; that the truth of theſe cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations may ſo appeare to all the world, as that either themſelves may receive ſhame, or the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, judgement.</p>
            <p>And withall they doe moſt humbly beſeech the moſt honourable Lords, and Commons of this preſent Parliament, that they will be pleaſed,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66259:4"/>
with all poſsible ſpeed, to ſearch this matter to the bottom; &amp; to follow this foule ſlander home to the firſt riſe; that if any of them be found, in the leaſt meaſure, guilty of this crime, pretended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt King, or State, hee may forthwith ſuffer condigne puniſhment to the utmoſt; wherein they profeſs that their hands ſhalbe the firſt upon him, as the unworthy and perfidious violater of their ſacred Order: And, if this report ſhall bee found (as they are confident) utterly groundleſſe, and meerly ſlanderous, they beſeech that higheſt Court of Juſtice, for Gods ſake, and for the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſake, that they will bee tenderly ſenſible of this abominable injury, that is herein done to their holy profeſsion; and take ſome ſpeedy courſe for the publicke vindicating of their innocence to all the world.</p>
            <p>And, laſtly, they doe earneſtly beſeech, and in the name of God, adjure, all Chriſtian people, to beware, how they give light credit to thoſe ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous ſuggeſtions, that are, in theſe deplored times, moſt untruly raiſed, and caſt abroad by uncharitable, and malevolent men, againſt thoſe, whom God hath ſet over them; and who deſire, in all good conſcience, to bee approved to God,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66259:4"/>
and men; and that they will forbeare to hurt their owne ſoules in wronging the innocent.</p>
