            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Four for a Penny:</hi> OR, Poor Robin's CHARACTER OF A PAWN-BROKER.</head>
            <p>WE here preſent you, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, with a parcel of <hi>Beaſts of prey,</hi> worſe than ever <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick</hi> bred; and more <hi>Unclean</hi> than any that entered into <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark: yet <hi>Cloven-footed,</hi> in imitation of their <hi>Syre;</hi> and all ſo <hi>Superlative</hi> in their Kinds, that each may diſpute for Precedency: Onely for Method ſake, we ſhall begin with the moſt Slye and Dangerous,</p>
            <p>An <hi>UNCONSCIONABLE</hi> Pawn broker (for there are Conſcionable Dealers in that Way, that are a Relief and Comfort to the Poor; and thoſe are not concern'd in this Character:) an <hi>Unconſcionable</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:95646:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Pawn-broker, I ſay, is <hi>Pluto</hi>'s Factor, Old <hi>Nick</hi>'s <hi>Warehouſe-keeper,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh Jew</hi> that lives and grows fat on Fraud and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, as Toads on Filth and Venome; whoſe Practice out-vies <hi>Uſury,</hi> as much as <hi>Inceſt</hi> ſimple Fornication; and to call him a <hi>Tradeſman,</hi> muſt be by the ſame Figure that Pickpockets ſtile their Legerdemain an <hi>Art and Myſtery.</hi> His <hi>Shop,</hi> like Hell-gates, is always open, where he ſits at the Receipt of Cuſtom, like <hi>Cacus</hi> in his Den, ready to devour All that is brought him; and having gotten your <hi>Spoils,</hi> hangs them up in <hi>Rank and File,</hi> as ſo many <hi>Trophies</hi> of Victory. Hither all ſorts of Garments reſort in Pilgrimage, whilſt he playing the <hi>Pimp,</hi> lodges the Tabby<hi>-petticoat</hi> and Ruſſet<hi>-breeches</hi> together in the <hi>ſame Bed</hi> of Lavender.</p>
            <p>He is the Treaſurer of the Thieves <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,</hi> the Common <hi>FENDER</hi> of all <hi>Bulkers</hi> and <hi>Shop-lifts</hi> in the Town. To this purpoſe he keeps a private Warehouſe, and Ships away the Ill-gotten Goods by wholeſale; dreading nothing ſo much, as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95646:3"/>
that a <hi>Convict</hi> ſhould honeſtly Confeſs how he diſpos'd the Moveables. He is a kind of Diſeaſe quite contrary to the <hi>Gout;</hi> for as that haunts the Rich, ſo this mainly torments the Poor, and ſcarce leaves them ſo much as a Primitive Figg-leaf to cover their Nakedneſs. Mrs. <hi>Joan,</hi> when ſhe is minded to ſee her Sweet-heart, and Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar <hi>Blew-bottle</hi> going to a Chriſtening, muſter up the Pence o'th' Saturday-night to redeem their beſt Riggings out of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; but on Munday-morning infallibly bring them back (like Thieves that had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made an Eſcape) to the old <hi>Limbus:</hi> and this ſo often, till at laſt they know the way, and can go to <hi>Pawn alone</hi> by themſelves. Thus they are forc'd to purchaſe the ſame Clothes <hi>Seven</hi> times over; and for want of a Cheſt to keep them in at home, it coſts Thrice as much as they are worth for their lodging in his cuſtody. When they come in, like other Priſoners, they firſt pay Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, the <hi>Twopences</hi> for Entrance-money; after this, <hi>Sixpence</hi> a month for every 20 <hi>s.</hi> lent, (which yet indeed is but 19 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.)</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:95646:3"/>
that is (according to their Reckoning of thirteen months to the year) Six ſhillings and ſix pence Intereſt for One pound for a year; which makes Thirty three pounds, ſix ſhillings, and eight pence in the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, <hi>viz</hi> One third part of the Principal, and juſt 27 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> more than the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute allows; beſides Twelve pence for a <hi>Bill of Sale,</hi> if the matter be conſiderable. So that ſince they never lend half the value on any thing that is brought them, if a Pawn-broker lay out 100 <hi>l.</hi> he firſt makes neer 40 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> advantage certain, as aforeſaid: And then conſidering how many Thieves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (their chief Cuſtomers that bring the lumping bargains) never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Redeem, and how many Poor are not able, eſpecially ſince as ſoon as the year and day expire, they preſently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their Pawns, or pretend to do ſo, we may reaſonably conclude, that theſe <hi>Horſe-leeches</hi> make <hi>Cent. per Cent.</hi> at leaſt of their Mony in a year: And all this by a Courſe tending onely to the encouragement of Thieves, and ruine of thoſe that are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, but indigent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:95646:4"/>
Near of Kin to theſe Caterpillers, is the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcionable Tally-man,</hi> but a little more adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and dealing ſo much in Wood, that 'tis ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his Deſerts may intitle him to die on a Leaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Tree.</hi> He is one that <hi>Eateth up the Poor</hi> (to uſe a ſacred Phraſe) <hi>even as Bread,</hi> and yet under a charitable pretence of ſerving and <hi>accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> them: For he lets them have Ten ſhillings worth of ſorry Commodities (or ſcarce ſo much) on Security given to pay him Twenty ſhillings by Twelve pence a week. Then his Wandering <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtophilus,</hi> with the bundle of Rattles, whom we may call <hi>The Devil's Rent-gatherer,</hi> haunts them more diligently than a revengeful Ghoſt does a Murderer, or a tormenting Conſcience a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: And if they happen to fail the firſt or ſecond week, ſnaps them or their Security, and makes them forthwith pay the utmoſt farthing; allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, now their former Agreement was void. We have nothing to do with thoſe that deal according to Conſcience.</p>
            <p>There is yet another Pack of the <hi>Charitable Vermine,</hi> that make it their Buſineſs to lend Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney by the week. This crafty <hi>Extortioner</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly keeps a blinde <hi>Ale-houſe;</hi> and you muſt firſt, beſides a world of Complements, ſpend two or three ſhillings at ſeveral times, before he be at leiſure, or Money comes in, or that you can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to like your Security: at leaſt you get but 18 <hi>s.</hi> for every 20 <hi>s.</hi> but muſt give Bond (and him 12 <hi>d.</hi> for making it) to repay full 20 <hi>s.</hi> at 2 <hi>s.</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:95646:4"/>
               <hi>per</hi> week; who in caſe of failure, takes the firſt advantage to be as kinde to you as the laſt Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. And ſo by theſe Subtleties, and continual Returns, they likewiſe make much more than double of their Money in a years time, as by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Calculation may appear.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the <hi>Nimrods,</hi> the private <hi>Hunters</hi> in this vaſt <hi>Forest of Chimneys,</hi> that draw the Poor into their <hi>Nets,</hi> and pick them to the very Bone. But the <hi>Bandogs</hi> that they make uſe of, are the <hi>Bum-bailey,</hi> and his <hi>Setting-Cur:</hi> The firſt, a kind of <hi>Excreſcence</hi> of the Law, like our Nails, made onely to ſcratch and <hi>claw;</hi> a ſort of Birdlime, where he lays hold he hangs; a Raven that pecks not out mens <hi>Eyes,</hi> as others do, but all his ſpite is at their <hi>Shoulders;</hi> and you had better have the Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mare ride you, than this Incubus. He is one of <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calion</hi>'s By-blows, begotten of a <hi>Stone,</hi> and has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken an Oath never to pity <hi>Widow nor Orphan.</hi> His firſt buſineſs is to bait you for Money for his (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded) <hi>Civility;</hi> next, to call for Drink as faſt as men for Buckets of water in a Conflagration: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, becoming grave and ſerious, he adviſes you in revenge to <hi>arreſt</hi> the Plaintiff, and offers to do it, with or without cauſe; 'tis all one to him, if he perceive you have money. His <hi>Follower</hi> is an Hanger that he wears by his ſide; a falſe Die of the ſame Bale, but not the ſame Cut: for it runs ſomewhat higher, inflames the Reckoning, and ſo does more miſchief. He's a Tumbler that drives in the Coneys; but is yet but a Bungler, and knows
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95646:5"/>
not how to <hi>cut up</hi> a man without tearing, unleſs by a Pattern. This is the Hook that hangs under wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to choak the Fiſh, and his Officer the Quill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, which <hi>pops</hi> down as ſoon as ever the Bait is ſwallowed. Though differing in degree, they are both much of a Complexion, onely the Teeth of this <hi>latter</hi> are more ſharp, and he more hungry, becauſe he does but ſnap, and hath not his full <hi>half-ſhare of the Booty.</hi> A main part of his Office is to ſwear and bluſter at their trembling Priſoners, and cry, <hi>Confound us, why do we wait? let's Shop him:</hi> whilſt the other meekly replies, <hi>Jack, be patient; 'tis a civil Gentleman, and I know will conſider us:</hi> which Species of Wheedling in Terms of their Art, is called <hi>Sweeten and Pinch.</hi> The Eyes of theſe Wolves are as quick in their Head, as a <hi>Cut-purſes</hi> in a Throng; and as nimble are they at their Buſineſs, as an <hi>Hang-man</hi> at an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. They'll court a <hi>broken Pate</hi> to heal it with a Plaister of <hi>Green-wax,</hi> and ſuck more ſilver out of a Wound than a Surgeon. Yet as theſe Eels are generally bred out of the Mud of a Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>krupt, ſo they commonly die with their <hi>Guts</hi> ript up, or are decently run through the <hi>Lungs;</hi> and as they liv'd hated, die unpitied. We ſpeak here of thoſe onely that abuſe the Intentions of the Law, and act Oppreſſion under the colour of ſerving common Juſtice.</p>
