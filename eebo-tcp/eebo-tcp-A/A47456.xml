            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Is this the bringing of the King to his <hi>Parliament?</hi> Is this the bringing an end to the <hi>Treaty</hi> in the publike Faith of the world? Let me ſee a legal <hi>Authority</hi> warranted by the Word of God, the Scriptures, or warranted by the <hi>Constitutions</hi> of the Kingdom, and I will anſwer.</p>

I am ſworn to keep the Peace by that duty I ow to <hi>God</hi> and my <hi>Country,</hi> and I will do it to the laſt breath of my body, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhall do well to ſatisfie firſt <hi>God,</hi> and then the <hi>Country,</hi> by what <hi>Authority</hi> you do it, if you do it by a uſurped <hi>Authority,</hi> that will not laſt long. There is a God in Heaven that will call you, and all that give you Power, to account: Satisfie me in that, and I will
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57284:12"/>
anſwer, otherwiſe I betray my Truſt, and the <hi>Liberties</hi> of the People, and therefore think of that, and then I ſhall be willing. For I do avow, That it is as great a ſin to withſtand lawful <hi>Authority,</hi> as it is to ſubmit to a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical, or any other ways unlawful <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and therefore ſatisfie God, and me, and all the world in that, and you ſhall receive my Anſwer: I am not afraid of the Bill.</p>

                        <p>I did at the laſt Court in the behalf of the Commons of England, exhibit and give into this Court a Charge of high Treaſon, and other high Crimes, againſt the Priſoner at the Bar, whereof I do accuſe him in the name of the People of England, and the Charge was read unto him, and his Anſwer required. My Lord, He was not then pleaſed to give an Anſwer, but inſtead of anſwering, did there diſpute the Authority of this high Court. My humble Motion to this high Court, in behalf of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57284:14"/>
Kingdom of England, is, That the Priſoner may be directed to make a poſitive Anſwer, either by way of Confeſſion, or Negation; which if he ſhall refuſe to do, That the matter of Charge may be taken <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> and the Court may proceed according to juſtice.</p>

                        <speaker>Lord Preſident.</speaker>
                        <p>Sir, You may remember at the laſt Court you were told the occaſion of your being brought hither, and you heard a Charge againſt you, containing a Charge of high Treaſon, and other high Crimes, againſt this Realm of England; you heard likewiſe, that it was prayed in the behalf of the People, that you ſhould give an Anſwer to that Charge, that thereupon ſuch proceedings might be had as ſhould be agreeable to juſtice; you were then pleaſed to make ſome ſcruples concerning the Authority of this Court, and knew not by what Authority you were brought hither; you did divers times pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound your Queſtions, and were as often an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That it was by authority of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of England aſſembled in Parliament,</hi> that did think fit to call you to account for thoſe high and capital Miſdemeanours where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you were then charged. Since that the Court hath taken into Conſideration what you then ſaid, they are fully ſatisfied with their own authority, and they hold it fit you ſhould
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57284:14"/>
ſtand ſatisfied with it too; and they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, that you do give a poſitive and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Anſwer to this Charge that is exhibited againſt you, they do expect you ſhould either confeſs or deny it; if you deny, it is offered in the behalf of the Kingdom to be made good againſt you; their authority they do avow to the whole world, that the whole Kingdom are to reſt ſatisfied in, and you are to reſt ſatisfied with it, and therefore you are to loſe no more time, but to give a poſitive Anſwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>

                        <p>When I was here laſt, 'tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true, I made that Queſtion, and truly if it were only my own particular caſe, I would have ſatisfied my ſelf with the Proteſtation I made the laſt time I was here againſt the lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of this Court, and that a King cannot be tryed by any Superiour Juriſdiction on Earth; but it is not my caſe alone, it is the Freedom and the Liberty of the People of England, and do you pretend what you will, I ſtand more for their Liberties. For if Power without Law may make Laws, may alter the fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, I do not know what Subject he is in England, that can be ſure of his life, or any thing that he calls his own; therefore when that I came here, I did expect particular Reaſons, to know by what Law,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57284:15"/>
what Authority you did proceed againſt me here, and therefore I am a little to ſeek what to ſay to you in this particular, becauſe the Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative is to be proved, the Negative often is very hard to do: but ſince I cannot perſwade you to do it, I ſhall tell you my Reaſons as ſhort as I can.</p>
                        <p>My Reaſons why in Conſcience, and the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I owe to God firſt, and my People next, for the preſervation of their Lives, Liberties and Eſtates; I conceive I cannot anſwer this, till I be ſatisfied of the legality of it.</p>

                        <p>Sir, I muſt interrupt you, which I would not do, but that what you do is not agreeable to the proceedings of any Court of Juſtice, you are about to enter into Argument, and diſpute concerning the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this Court, before whom you appear as a Priſoner, and are charged as an high Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; if you take upon you to diſpute the Authority of the Court, we may not do it, nor will any Court give way unto it, you are to ſubmit unto it, you are to give in a punctual and direct Anſwer, whether you will anſwer your Charge or no, and what your Anſwer is.</p>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57284:15"/>
Reaſon, though I am no Lawyer profeſs'd, but I know as much Law as any Gentleman in England; and therefore (under favour) I do plead for the Liberties of the People of England more then you do, and therefore if I ſhould impoſe a belief upon any man without Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons given for it, it were unreaſonable; but I muſt tell you, That that Reaſon that I have as thus informed, I cannot yield unto it.</p>

Sir, the Vote of the Commons of England aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in Parliament, it is the Reaſon of the Kingdom, and they are theſe that have given to that Law, according to which you ſhould have ruled and raigned: Sir, you are not to diſpute our Authority, you are told it again by the Court.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57284:18"/>
was wrought upon the <hi>Theatre</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> That a King of England, truſted to keep the Law, That had taken an Oath ſo to do, That had Tribute paid him for that end, ſhould be guilty of a wicked deſign, ſubvert and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy our Laws, and introduce an <hi>Arbitrary, and Tyrannical Government,</hi> in the defence of the <hi>Parliament and their Authority,</hi> ſet up his <hi>Standard</hi> for War againſt his <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>People</hi>; and I did humbly pray, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the <hi>People of England,</hi> that he might ſpeedily be required to make an Anſwer to the Charge.</p>
                        <p>But, my Lord, inſtead of making any anſwer, he did then diſpute the Authority of this High Court; Your Lordſhip was pleaſed to give him a further day to conſider and to put in his Anſwer, which day being yeſterday, I did humbly move, that he might be required to give a direct and poſitive Anſwer, either by denying, or confeſſion of it; but (my Lord) he was then pleaſed for to demur to the Juriſdiction of the Court, which the Court did then over-rule, and command him to give a direct and poſitive Anſwer.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57284:19"/>
behalf of the Kingdom againſt you. Sir, you may well remember, and if you do not, the Court cannot forget what delatory dealings the Court hath found at your hands, you were pleaſed to propound ſome Queſtions, you have had your Reſolution upon them. You were told over and over again, That the Court did affirm their own Juriſdiction, That it was not for you, nor any other man, to diſpute the <hi>Juriſdiction of the Supream and higheſt Authority of England,</hi> from which there is no Appeal, and touching which there muſt be no diſpute; yet you did perſiſt in ſuch carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, as you gave no manner of obedience, nor did you acknowledge any Authority in them, nor the <hi>high Court, that conſtituted this Court of Juſtice</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Sir, I muſt let you know from the Court, That they are very ſenſible of theſe delays of yours, and that they: ought not, being thus Authorized by the <hi>ſupream Court of England,</hi> to be thus trifled withal, and that they might in Juſtice, if they pleaſed, and according to the Rules of Juſtice, take advantage of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, and proceed to pronounce judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you; yet nevertheleſs they are pleaſed to give direction, and on their behalfs I do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire you, That you make a poſitive Anſwer unto this Charge that is againſt you Sir, in plain
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57284:19"/>
terms, for Juſtice knows no reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; you are to give your poſitive and finall Anſwer in plain Engliſh, whether you be guilty or not guilty of theſe Treaſons laid to your Charge.</p>

Sir, if you Anſwer to your Charge, which the Court gives you leave now to do, though they might have taken the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of your contempt, yet if you be able to Anſwer to your Charge, when you have once Anſwered, you ſhall be heard at large, make the beſt Defence you can. But Sir, I muſt let you know from the Court, as their commands, that you are not to be permitted to iſſue out into any other diſcourſes, till ſuch time as you have given a poſitive Anſwer concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                           <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to which <hi>Charge</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to Anſwer, he hath been ſo far from obeying the commands of the <hi>Court</hi> by ſubmitting to their Juſtice, as he began to take upon him to offer reaſoning and debate unto the Authority of the <hi>Court,</hi> and of the higheſt <hi>Court</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted them to Try and judge him; but being over-ruled in that, and required to make his Anſwer, he was ſtill pleaſed to continue contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macious, and to refuſe to ſubmit or Anſwer: Hereupon the <hi>Court</hi>
                           <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they may not be

wanting to themſelves, to the truſt repoſed in them, nor that any mans wilfulneſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Juſtice, they have thought fit to take the matter into their conſideration; They have conſidered of the contumacy, and of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, which in Law doth ariſe upon that contumacy; They have likewiſe conſidered of the notoriety of the Fact charg'd upon this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, and upon the whole matter they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and have agreed upon a Sentence to be now pronounced againſt this Priſoner: but in reſpect he doth deſire to be heard, before the Sentence be read, and pronounc'd, the <hi>Court</hi> hath reſolved that they will hear him; yet Sir, thus much I muſt tell you before-hand, which you have been minded of at other <hi>Courts,</hi> That if that you have to ſay be to offer any debate concerning Juriſdiction, you are not to be heard in it, you have offered it formerly, and you have indeed ſtruck at the root, that is the power and <hi>Supreme Authority of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of England,</hi> which this <hi>Court</hi> will not admit a debate of, and which indeed is an irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional thing in them to do, being a <hi>Court</hi> that acts upon <hi>Authority</hi> derived from them, that they ſhould preſume to judge upon their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, from whom there's no Appeal. But Sir, if you have any thing to ſay in defence of your ſelf concerning the matter charged, the <hi>Court</hi> hath
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57284:23"/>
given me in command to let you know they will hear you.</p>

no more to delay then they are to deny Juſtice, they are good words in the old <hi>Charter</hi> of <hi>England, Nulli negabimus, nulli vendemus, nulli deferremus Juſtitiam:</hi> There muſt be no delay, but the truth is Sir, and ſo every man here obſerves it, That you have much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed them in your contempt and default, for which they might long ſince have proceeded to judgment againſt you, and notwithſtanding what you have offered, they are reſolved to proceed to puniſhment, and to Judgment, and that is their unanimous reſolution.</p>

                        <p>Sir, I know it is in vain for me to diſpute, I am no <hi>Sceptick</hi> for to deny the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer that you have, I know that you have Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer enough; Sir, I confeſs, I think it would have been for the Kingdoms Peace, if you would have taken the pains for to have ſhewn the Lawfulneſs of your Power, for this delay that I have deſired, I confeſs it is a delay, but it is a delay very important for the Peace of the Kingdom, for it is not my Perſon that I look on alone, it is the Kingdoms well-fare, and the Kingdoms Peace, it is an old Sentence, <hi>That we ſhould think on long before we have reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of great matters ſuddenly</hi>; Therefore Sir, I do ſay again, That I do put at your doors all the inconveniency of an haſty <hi>Sentence,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I have been here now I think this week,

this day eight days was the day I came here firſt, but a little delay of a day or two further may give Peace, whereas an <hi>hasty Judgement</hi> may bring on that trouble and perpetual incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency to the Kingdom, That the child that is unborn may repent it; and therefore again, out of the Duty I ow to God, and to my Country, I do deſire that I may be heard by the Lords and Commons in the <hi>Painted Chamber,</hi> or any other Chamber that you will appoint me.</p>

                        <p>Sir, you ſpake very well of a precious thing that you call Peace, and it had been much to be wiſhed that God had put it into your heart, that you had as effectually and really endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured and ſtudied the Peace of the Kingdom, as now in words you ſeem to pretend; but as you were told the other day, <hi>Actions must expound Intentions,</hi> yet Actions have been clean contrary; and truly Sir, it doth appear plainly enough to them, That you have gone upon very erronious principles, the Kingdom hath felt it to their ſmart, and it will be no eaſe to you to think of it, for Sir, you have held your ſelf, and let fall ſuch Language, as if you had been no ways Subject to the Law, or that the Law had not been your Superiour.

                           <hi>That the Law is your Superiour,</hi> That you ought to have ruled according to the Law, you ought to have done ſo: Sir, I know very well your pretence hath been that you have done ſo, but Sir, the difference hath been who ſhall be the <hi>Expoſitors of this Law,</hi> Sir, whether you and your Party out of Courts of Juſtice ſhall take upon them to expound Law, or the <hi>Courts of Juſtice,</hi> who are the Expounders; nay, the Soveraign and <hi>the High Court of Juſtice,</hi> the PARLIAMENT of England, that are not only <hi>the higheſt Expounders,</hi> but <hi>the ſole makers of the Law.</hi> Sir, for you to ſet your ſelf with your ſingle judgment, and thoſe that adhere unto you, to ſet your ſelf againſt <hi>the higheſt Court of Juſtice, that is not Law.</hi> Sir, as the Law is your Superior, ſo truly Sir, there is ſomething that is Superior to the Law, and that is indeed the <hi>Parent or Author</hi> of the Law, and that is <hi>the People of England,</hi> For Sir, as they are thoſe that at the firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries have done) did chooſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves this <hi>Form of Gouernment,</hi> even for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſake, that Juſtice might be adminiſtred, that Peace might be preſerved; ſo Sir, they gave Laws to their Governors, according to which they ſhould Govern; and if thoſe Laws ſhould have proved inconvenient, or prejudiciall to the Publique, they had a power in them,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57284:28"/>
and reſerved to themſelves to alter as they ſhall ſee cauſe.

Now Sir, if ſo be the King will go contrary to that End, or any other Governor will go contrary to the end of his Government; Sir, he muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that he is but an Officer in truſt, and he ought to diſcharge that Truſt, and they are to take order for the animadverſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch an offending Governor.</p>
                        <p>This is not Law of yeſterday Sir, (ſince the time of the diviſion betwixt you and your Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,) but it is Law of old; And we know very well the <hi>Authors</hi> and the <hi>Authorities</hi> that do tell us what the Law was in that point upon the Election of Kings, upon the <hi>Oath</hi> that they took unto their People; and if they did not obſerve it, there were thoſe things called Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments; The <hi>Parliaments</hi> were they that were to adjudge (the very words of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) the plaints and wrongs done of the King and the Queen, or their Children, ſuch wrongs especially when the People could have no where elſe any remedy.</hi> Sir, that hath been the People of <hi>Englands</hi> caſe, they could not have their remedy elſewhere but in <hi>Parliament.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Sir, <hi>Parliaments</hi> were ordained for that purpoſe to redreſs the grievances of the People, that was their main end; and truly Sir, if ſo
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57284:29"/>
be that the Kings of England had been rightly mindfull of themſelves, they were never more in <hi>Majesty and State</hi> then in the <hi>Parliament</hi>: but how forgetful ſome have been, <hi>Stories</hi> have told us; We have a miſerable, a lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, a ſad experience of it. Sir by the old Laws of England, I ſpeak theſe things the rather to you, becauſe you were pleaſed to let fall the other day, you thought you had as much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg in the Law, as moſt Gentlemen in England, it is very well Sir. And truly Sir, it is very fit for the Gentlemen of England to underſtand that Law under which they muſt live, and by which they muſt be governed. And then Sir, the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſays, <hi>They that know their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters will and do it not,</hi> what follows? The Law is your Maſter, the Acts of <hi>Parliament.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Parliaments</hi> were to be kept anciently we find in our old <hi>Author</hi> twice in the year, <hi>That the ſubject upon any occaſion might have a ready remedy and redreſs for his Grievance.</hi> Afterwards by ſeveral Acts of <hi>Parliament</hi> in the days of your Predeceſſor <hi>Edward the third,</hi> they muſt have been once a year. Sir what the intermiſſion of PARLIAMENTS hath been in your time it is very well known, and the ſad Conſequences of it, and what in the interim inſtead of theſe PARLIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTS, hath been by you by an high
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57284:29"/>
and <hi>Arbitrary</hi> hand introduced upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that likewiſe hath been too well known and felt. But when God by his Providence had ſo far brought it about, that you could no longer decline the calling of a <hi>Parliament,</hi> Sir, yet it will appear what your ends were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Ancient and your <hi>Native</hi> Kingdom of <hi>SCOTLAND</hi>: The <hi>Parliament of England</hi> not ſerving your ends againſt them, you were pleaſed to diſſolve it. Another great neceſſity occaſioned the calling of this <hi>Parliament,</hi> and what your Deſigns and Plots and endeavours all along have been for the cruſhing and confounding of this <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> hath been very notorious to the whole Kingdom; And truly Sir, in that you did ſtrike at all; That had been a ſure way to have brought about that that this Charge laies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, <hi>Your Intention to Subvert the F<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NDAMENTAL LAWES of the Land.</hi> For the great Bulwark of the <hi>Liberties of the People,</hi> is the PARLIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT of <hi>England</hi>
                           <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to Subvert and Root up that, which your aim hath been to do, certainly at one blow you had confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the liberties and the property of <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Truly Sir, it makes me call to minde, I cannot forbear to expreſs it, for Sir, we muſt deal plainly with you, according to the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57284:30"/>
merits of your cauſe, ſo is our Commiſſion, it makes me call to mind (theſe proceedings of yours) That we read of a great <hi>Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi> by the way let us call him <hi>a great Roman Tyrant, Caligula, That wiſht that the People of</hi> Rome <hi>had had but one neck, that at one blow he might cut it off</hi>: and your proceedings hath been ſomewhat like to this; for the body of the People of England hath been (and where elſe) repreſented but in the Parliament, and could you have but confounded that, you had at one blow cut off the neck of <hi>England</hi>: But God hath reſerved better things for us, and hath pleaſed for to Confound your deſigns, and to break your Forces, and to bring your Perſon into Cuſtody that you might be reſponſible to Juſtice.</p>
                        <p>Sir, we know very well, That it is a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on your ſide very much preſt, <hi>by what Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident we ſhall proceed</hi>? Truly Sir, for <hi>Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> I ſhall not upon theſe occaſions inſtitute any long diſcourſe, but it is no new thing to cite <hi>Preſidents</hi> almoſt of all <hi>Nations,</hi> where the People (when power hath been in their hands) have been made bold to call their Kings to account, and where the change of <hi>Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> hath been upon occaſion of the <hi>Tyranny and Miſ-Government</hi> of thoſe that have been placed over them; I will not ſpend time to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57284:30"/>
mention <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> or the Empire, or other Countries, volumes may be written of it; But truly Sir, that of the Kingdom of <hi>Aragon,</hi> I ſhall think ſome of us have thought upon it, when they have the Juſtice of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> that is a man <hi>tanquam in medio poſitus,</hi> betwixt the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the people of the Country, that if wrong be done by the King he that is the King of <hi>Aragon,</hi> the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice hath power to reform the wrong, and he is acknowledged to be the Kings Superiour, and is the grand preſerver of their priviledges, and hath proſecuted Kings upon their miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages.</p>
                        <p>Sir; What the Tribunes of <hi>Rome</hi> were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, and what the <hi>Ephori</hi> were to the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonian State</hi> we know, that is the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of England to the <hi>Engliſh State</hi>; and though <hi>Rome</hi> ſeemed to loſe it's <hi>Liberty</hi> when once the Emperors were; yet you ſhall find ſome famous Acts of Juſtice even done by the <hi>Senate of Rome,</hi> that great <hi>Tyrant</hi> of his time <hi>Nero,</hi> condemned and judged by the <hi>Senate.</hi> But truly Sir, to you I ſhould not mention theſe Forreign examples and ſtories. If you look but over Tweed, we find enough in your <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> If we look to your firſt King <hi>Ferguſius</hi> that your ſtories make
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57284:31"/>
mention of, he was an elective King, he dyed, and left two Sons both in their minority, the Kingdom made choyce of their Unkle his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to govern in the <hi>minority</hi>; afterwards the elder brother giving ſmall hopes to the people that he would rule or govern well, ſeeking to ſupplant that good Unkle of his that governed then juſtly, they ſet the elder aſide, and took to the younger. Sir, if I ſhould come to what your ſtories make mention of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you know very well you are the 109. King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for to mention ſo many Kings as that Kingdom, according to their power and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, have made bold to deal withal, ſome to baniſh, and ſome to impriſon, and ſome to put to death, it would be too long; and as one of your own Authors ſays, it would be too long to recite the manifold examples that your own ſtories make mention of; <hi>Reges</hi> (ſay they) we do create, we created Kings at firſt; <hi>Leges, &amp;c.</hi> We impoſed Laws upon them; and as they are choſen by the ſuffrages of the people at the firſt, ſo, upon juſt occaſion, by the ſame ſuffrages they may be taken down again: and we will be bold to ſay, that no Kingdom hath yeelded more plentiful experience then that your Native Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> hath done concerning the depoſition and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their offending and tranſgreſſing Kings, &amp;c.</p>

                           <hi>William</hi> called the Conqueror, you ſhall find one half of them to come meerly from the <hi>State,</hi> and not meerly upon the point of <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi>; it were eaſie to be inſtanced to you, the time muſt not be loſt that way. And truly Sir, what a grave and learned Judge in his time and well known to you, and is ſince printed for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, <hi>That although there was ſuch a thing as a diſcent many times, yet the Kings of</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>ever held the greateſt aſſurance of their Titles when it was declared by Parliament</hi>: And Sir, your <hi>Oath,</hi> the manner of your <hi>Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> doth ſhew plainly, That the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> although it's true by the Law the next Perſon in bloud is deſigned; yet if there were juſt cauſe to refuſe him, the people of <hi>England</hi> might do it. For there is a <hi>Contract,</hi> and Bargain made between the King and his People, and your <hi>Oath</hi> is taken, and certainly Sir, the Bond is reciprocal, for as you are the liege Lord, ſo they liege ſubjects, and we know very well that hath been ſo much ſpoken of, <hi>Ligantia eſt duplex,</hi> This we know now, the one tye, the one Bond, is the bond of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is due from the Soveraign, the other is the Bond of Subjection that is due from the Subject, Sir if this Bond be once broken, fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well <hi>Soveraignty, Subjectio trahit,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Theſe things may not be denyed Sir, I ſpeak

it the rather, and I pray God it may work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your heart, that you may be ſenſible of your miſcarriages. For whether you have been as by your Office you ought to be, <hi>a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of England,</hi> or <hi>the deſtroyer of England,</hi> let all <hi>England</hi> judge, or all the world that hath look'd upon it. Sir, though you have it by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance</hi> in the way that is ſpoken of, yet it muſt not be denyed that your Office was an Office of Truſt, and indeed, an Office of the higheſt Truſt lodged in any ſingle perſon; For as you were the grand <hi>Adminiſtrator of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> and others were as your <hi>Deligates</hi> to ſee it done throughout your Realms, If your great Office were to do Juſtice and preſerve your People from wrong, and inſtead of doing that you will be the <hi>great wrong doer your ſelf</hi>; If inſtead of being a <hi>Conſervator of the Peace,</hi> you will be <hi>the Grand disturbe of the Peace,</hi> ſurely this is contrary to your Office, contrary to your Truſt.

                        <p>Truly Sir, I ſhall not particularize the many

miſcarriages of your Reign whatſoever, they are famouſly known; it had been happy for the Kingdom, and happy for you too, if it had not been ſo much known, and ſo much felt, as the ſtory of your miſcarriages muſt needs be, and hath been already.</p>
                        <p>Sir, That that we are now upon by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the <hi>higheſt Court</hi> hath been and is to try and judg you for theſe great offences of yours.

                        <p>There is a <hi>third thing</hi> too if thoſe had not been, and that is <hi>Murther,</hi> which is layd to your charge. All the bloody <hi>Murthers</hi> that have been committed ſince this time that the

My Lord, you ſhould do well to beſtow your time now in meditating upon and imploring of the Free-mercy of God in Chriſt for your Eternall Salvation, and look upon that ever-ſtreaming <hi>Fountain</hi> of his precious Bloud, that purgeth us from all our ſins, even the ſins of the deepeſt dye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Bloud of Jeſus Chriſt waſhes away all our ſins, and that Bloud of Chriſt is poured forth upon all ſuch as by a lively Faith lay hold upon him. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, to the end, that whoſoever believed in him ſhould not periſh,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57284:46"/>
but have everlaſting Life</hi>; That is now, my Lord, the Rock on which you muſt chiefly reſt, and labor to fix your ſelf in the Free-mercy of God through Chriſt Jeſus, whoſe mercies are from everlaſting to everlaſting, unto all ſuch as with <hi>the Eye of Faith behold him</hi>: Behold Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus <hi>the Author</hi> and <hi>Finiſher of your Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> who hath ſatisfied the Juſtice of God by <hi>that Al-ſufficiency of his Sacrifice,</hi> which once for all <hi>he offered upon the Croſs for the ſins of the whole World,</hi> ſo that the ſting of Death is taken away from all believers, and he hath ſanctified it as a paſſage <hi>to everlaſting</hi> bleſſedneſs: It is true, <hi>the Waters of Iordan run ſomewhat rough and ſurly, betwixt the Wilderneſs and our paſſage into</hi> Canaan; but let us reſt upon the Ark (my Lord) <hi>the Ark Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> that will carry us through and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all thoſe waves <hi>to that Rock of Ages,</hi> which no flood nor waves can reach unto, and to him who is yeſterday, to day, and the ſame for ever, againſt whom <hi>the Powers and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, the Gates of Hell, ſhall never be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to prevail</hi>; Lift up and faſten your eyes now upon Chriſt Crucified, and <hi>labor to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Ieſus ſtanding at the right hand of his Father,</hi> (as the <hi>Protomartyr Stephen) ready to receive your Soul,</hi> when it ſhall be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>from this Frail and Mortal body</hi>: Alas,

no man would deſire Life, if he knew before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand what it were to live, it is nothing but ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, vexation and trouble, grief and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that waits upon every condition, whether publique or private; in every ſtation and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling there are ſeveral miſeries and troubles that are inſeparable from them; Therefore what a bleſſed thing it is to have a ſpeedy and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table paſſage out of this raging ſea, <hi>into the Port of everlasting Happineſs</hi>: We muſt paſs through a Sea, but it is the Sea of Chriſt Blood in which never Soul ſuffered ſhipwrack, in which we muſt be blown with winds and Tempeſts, but they are <hi>the Gales of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon us,</hi> which blow away all contrary winds of diffidence in his Mercy.</p>

                     <p>I <hi>think it is truly not very neceſſary for me to speak much, there are many Gentlemen and Souldiers there that ſees me, but my voyce is ſo weak, ſo low, that they cannot hear me, neither truly was I ever at any time ſo much in love with speaking, or with any thing I had to expreſs, that I took delight in it; yet this being the laſt time that I am to do ſo, by a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence of Almighty God, who hath brought me to this end juſtly for my ſins. I ſhall to you Sir, Mr. Sheriff, declare thus much, as to the matter that I am now to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for, which is,</hi> as being a Traytor to the Kingdom of England: <hi>Truly Sir, it was a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57284:48"/>
Country that I equally loved with my own, I made no difference, I never intended either the generality of it's prejudice, or any particular mans in it; What I did was by the Command of the Parliament of the Country where I was born, whoſe Commands I could not diſobey, without running into the ſame hazard there, of that condition that I am now in: The ends, Sir, of that Engagement is publique, they are in Print, and ſo I ſhall not need to ſpecifie them.</hi>

                     <p>(But to that which I was ſaying Sir.) <hi>It pleaſed God ſo to diſpoſe that Army under my Command, as it was ruined; and I, as their General, clothed with a Commiſſion, ſtand here, now ready to dye; I ſhall not trouble you with repeating of my Plea, what I ſaid in my own Defence at the Court of</hi> JUSTICE, <hi>my ſelf being ſatisfied with the Commands
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57284:48"/>
that are laid upon me, and they ſatisfied with the juſtneſs of their procedure, according to the Laws of this Land. God is juſt, and howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I ſhall not ſay any thing as to the matter of the Sentence, but that I do willingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to his Divine Providence, and acknowledg that very many ways I deſerve even a wordly puniſhment, as well as hereafter, for we are all ſinful, Sir, and I a great one; yet for my comfort I know there is a God heaven that is exceeding merciful; I know my Redeemer ſits at his right hand, and am confident</hi> (clapping his hand to his breſt) <hi>is mediating for me at this inſtant, I am hopeful through his Free-Grace and al-ſufficient merits, to be, pardoned of my ſins, and to be received into his mercy, upon that I rely, trusting to nothing but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Free-Grace of God through Jeſus Chriſt, I have not been tainted with my Religion I thank God for it, ſince my Infancy it hath been ſuch as hath been profeſt in the Land, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed, and now 'tis not this Religion, or that Religion, nor this or that fancy of men that is to be built upon, tis but one that's right, one that's ſure, and that comes from God.

                        <hi>(had I thought my Speech would have been thus taken) I would have dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57284:49"/>
it into ſome better method then now I can, and ſhall deſire theſe Gentlemen that does write it, that they will not wrong me in it, and that it may not in this manner be publiſhed to my diſadvantage, for truly I did not intend to have spoken thus when I came here.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>There is, Sirs, terrible Asperſions has been laid upon my ſelf; truly ſuch as, I thank God, I am very free from; as if my actions and intentions had not been ſuch as they were pretended for; but that notwithſtanding what I pretended it was for the King, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs intended then to ſerve him in it. I was bred with him for many years, I was his Domeſtique ſervant, and there was nothing declar'd by the Parliament, that was not really intended by me; and truly in it I ventured my Life one way, and now I looſe it another way: and that was one of the ends, as to the King; I ſpeak only of that, becauſe the rest has many particulars, and to clear my ſelf from ſo horrid an Aſperſion as is laid upon me: neither was there any other deſign known to me by the incoming of that Army, then what is really in the Declaration publiſhed. His Perſon, I do profeſs, I had reaſon to love, as he was my King, and as he had been my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: it has pleaſed God now to dispoſe of him, ſo as it cannot be thought flattery to have ſaid
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57284:49"/>
this, or any end in me for the ſaying of it, but to free my ſelf from that Calumny which lay upon me: I cannot gain by it; yet truth is that which we ſhall gain by for ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>There hath been much ſpoken, Sir, of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation into this Kingdom: it's mentioned in that Declaration, and truly to that I did, and do remit my ſelf: and I have been very much laboured for diſcoveries of theſe Inviters. 'Tis no time to diſſemble. How willing I was to have ſerved this Nation in any thing that was in my power, is known to very many honeſt Pious and Religious men; and how ready I would have been to have done what I could to have ſerved them, if it had pleaſed them to have preſerved my Life, in whoſe hands there was a power: They have not thought it fit, and ſo I am become unuſeful in that which willingly I would have done. As I ſaid at firſt, Sir, ſo I ſay now concerning that point; I wiſh the Kingdoms happineſs, I wiſh its peace; and truly Sir, I wiſh that this bloud of mine may be the laſt that is drawn: and howſoever I may perhaps have ſome reluctancie with my my ſelf as to the matter of my ſuffering, for my Fact, yet I freely forgive all; Sir, I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry no rancor along with me to my grave: His will be done that has created both heaven and earth, and me a poor miſerable ſinful creature
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57284:50"/>
now ſpeaking before him. For me to speak, Sir, to you of State-buſineſs, and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Kingdom, or my opinion in that, or for any thing in that nature, Truly it is to no end, it contributes nothing: My own incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation hath been to Peace, from the begining; and it is known to many, that I never was an ill inſtrument betwixt the King and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; I never acted to the prejudice of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; I bore no Arms, I medled not with it; I was not wanting by my Prayers to God Almighty for the happineſs of the King; and truly I ſhall pray ſtill, that God may ſo direct him as that may be done which ſhall tend to his Glory, and the peace and happineſs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>

The firſt thing which I must profeſs, is, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57284:54"/>
my Religion, and my breading, which hath been in a good Family that hath ever been faithful to the true Proteſtant Religion, in the which I have been bred, in the which I have lived, and in the which by Gods grace and mercy I ſhall dye. I have not lived ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that education I had in that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily where I was born and bred: I hope God will forgive me my ſins, ſince I conceive that it is very much his pleaſure to bring me to this place for the ſins that I have committed. The cauſe that hath brought me hither, I beleeve by many hath been much miſtaken: They have conceived that I have had ill deſigns to the State, and to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: Truly I look upon it as a Judgment, and a just Judgment of God; not but I have offended ſo much the State, and the Kingdom, and the Parliament, as that I have had an extream vanity in ſerving them very extra-ordinarily. For thoſe actions that I have done, I think it is known they have been ever very faithful to the Publique, and very particularly to Parliaments. My af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections have been ever expreſt truly and clearly to them. The dispoſitions of affairs now have put things in another paſture then they were when I was engaged with the Parliament. I have never gone off from
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57284:55"/>
thoſe principles that ever</hi> I <hi>have profeſſed: I have lived in them, and by Gods grace will dye in them. There may be alterations and changes that may carry them further then I thought reaſonable, and truly there I left them: but there hath been nothing that I have ſaid, or done, or profeſſed, either by Covenant, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, which hath not been very conſtant, and very clear upon the principles that I ever have gone upon, which was to ſerve the King, the Parliament, Religion (I ſhould have ſaid in the firſt place) the Common-wealth, and to ſeek the Peace of the Kingdom: That made me think it no improper time, being preſt-out by accidents and circumſtances, to ſeek the Peace of the Kingdom, which I thought was proper, ſince there was ſomething then in agitation, but nothing agreed on for ſending Propoſitions to the King; that was the furtheſt aym that I had, and truly beyond that I had no intention, none at all. And God be praiſed, although my blood comes to be ſhed here, there was I think ſcarcely a drop of blood ſhed in that action that I was engaged in. For the preſent affairs, as they are,</hi> I <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell how to judg of them: and truly they are in ſuch a condition, as (I conceive) no body can make a judgment of them: and therefore I muſt make uſe of my Prayers, rather then of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57284:55"/>
my opinion, which are, that God would bleſs this Kingdom, this Nation, this State; that he would ſettle it in a way agreeable to what this Kingdom hath been happily governed under; by a King, by the Lords, by the Commons: a Government that (I conceive) it hath flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much under, and I pray God the change of it bring not rather a prejudice, a diſorder, and a confuſion, then the contrary. I look upon the Poſterity of the King, and truly my Conſcience directs me to it, to deſire, that if God be pleaſed that theſe people may look upon them with that affection that they ow, that they may be called in again, &amp; they may be, not through blood, nor through diſorder, admited again into that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and to that glory, that God in their birth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to them. I ſhall pray with all my Soul for the happineſs of this State, of this</hi> Nation, <hi>that the blood which is here ſpilt, may be even the laſt which may fall among us: and truly I ſhould lay down my life with as much cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as ever perſon did, if</hi> I <hi>conceived that there would no more blood follow us: for a</hi> State <hi>or Affairs that are built upon blood, is a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for the moſt part that doth not prosper.</hi>

My Lord, you know where your fulneſs lies, where your riches lie, where is your onely rock to anchor on. You know there is fulneſs in Chriſt: If the Lord comes not in with fulneſs of comfort to you, yet reſolve to wait upon him while you live, and to truſt in him when you dye, and then ſay, I will dye here, I will periſh at thy feet, I will be found dead at the feet of Jeſus Chriſt.

My Lord, there is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough there, and fix your heart there, and fix your eyes there, that eye of Faith, and that eye of hope, exerciſe theſe graces now, there wil be no exerciſe herafter.

                        <hi>Mr</hi> Bolton, <hi>God hath given me long time in this world, he hath carried me through many great accidents of Fortune; he hath at laſt brought me down into a condition, where I find my ſelf brought to an end, for a diſaffection to this State, to this Parliament, that (as I ſaid before) I did believe no body in the world more unlikely to have expected to ſuffer for that Cauſe: I look upon it as a great Judgment of God for my ſins. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sir, ſince that the death is violent, I am the leſs troubled with it, becauſe of thoſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent deaths that I have ſeen before, principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my Saviour that hath ſhewed us the way, how and in what manner he hath done it, and for what cauſe, I am the more comforted, I am the more rejoyced. It is not long ſince the King my Maſter paſſed in the ſame manner, and truly I hope that his purpoſes and intentions were ſuch, as a man may not be aſhamed, not only to follow him, in the way that was taken with him, but likewiſe not aſhamed of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, if God had given him life. I have often diſputed with him concerning many things of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57284:58"/>
this kind, and I conceive his ſufferings, and his better knowledg, and better underſtanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (if God had ſpared him life) might have made him a Prince very happy towards himſelf, and very happy towards this Kingdom. I have ſeen and known, that thoſe bleſſed Souls in Heaven have paſſed thither by the gate of ſorrow, and many by the gate of violence: and ſince it is Gods pleaſure to dispoſe me this way. I ſubmit my ſoul to him, with all comfort, and with all hope, that he hath made this my end, and this my concluſion, that though I be low in death, yet nevertheleſs this lowneſs ſhall raiſe me to the higheſt glory for ever.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Truly, I have not ſaid much in publique to the People, concerning the particular actions that, I conceive, I have done by my counſels in this Kingdom, I conceive they are well known, it were ſomething of vanity (me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks) to take notice of them here, I'le rather dye with them, with the comfort of them, in my own boſom; and that I never intended in this action, or any action that ever I did in my life, either malice, or blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, or prejudice to any creature that lives. For that which concerns my Religion, I made my profeſſion before of it, how I was bred, and in what manner I was bred, in a Family that was looked upon to be no little notorious, in
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57284:59"/>
oppoſition to ſome liberties, that they concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved then to be taken; and truly, there was ſome mark upon me, as if I had ſome taint of it, even throughout my whole ways, that I have taken; every body knows what my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections have been, to many that have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to many that have been in troubles in this Kingdom, I endeavored to relieve them, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to oblige them, I thought I was tied ſo by my Conſcience, I thought it by my Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and truly very much by my Breeding; God hath now brought me to the laſt inſtant of my time, all that I can ſay, and all that I can adhere unto, is this, That as I am a great ſinner, ſo I have a great Saviour, that as he hath given me here a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, to come publiquely in a ſhew of ſhame in the way of this ſuffering (truly I underſtand it not to be ſo,) I underſtand it to be a glory, a glory when I conſider who hath gone before me, and a glory when I conſider I had no end in it, but what I conceive to be the ſervice of God, the King, and the Kingdom, and therefore my Heart is not charged much with any thing in that particular, ſince I conceive God will accept of the intention, whatſoever the action ſeem to be: I am going to dye, and the Lord receive my Soul; I have no reliance but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt, for my ſelf I do acknowledg that I
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57284:59"/>
am the unworthiest of ſinners; my life hath been a vanity, and a continued ſin, and God may juſtly bring me to this end for the ſins I have committed againſt him, and were there nothing elſe but the iniquities that I have committed in the way of my life, I look upon this as a great Juſtice of God to bring me to this ſuffering, and to bring me to this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thoſe hands that have been moſt active in it, if any ſuch there hath been, I pray God forgive them, I pray God that there may not be many ſuch Trophees of their Victories, but that this may be, as I ſaid before, the last ſhew that this People ſhall ſee of the blood of perſons of Condition, of perſons of Honour: I might ſay ſomething of the way of our Tryal, which certainly hath been as extraordinary as any thing I think hath ever been ſeen in this Kingdom; but becauſe that I would not ſeem as if I made ſome complaint, I will not ſo much as mention it, becauſe no body ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I repine at their actions, that I repine at my fortune: It is the Will of God, it is the Hand of God under whom I fall, I take it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely from him, I ſubmit my ſelf to him, I ſhall deſire to roul my ſelf into the Arms of my bleſſed Saviour, and when I come to this place,</hi> (pointing to the Block) <hi>when I bow down my ſelf there, I hope God will raiſe me

up; and when I bid farewel, as I muſt now to Hope and to Faith, that Love will abide,</hi> I <hi>know nothing to accompany the Soul out of this World but Love, and</hi> I <hi>hope that Love will bring me to the Fountain of Glory in Heaven, through the Arms, Mediation, and the Mercy of my Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, in whom I believe, O LORD help my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.</hi>

                     <p>But, my Lord, when you are clothed with the Righteouſneſs of another, you will appear glorious, though now ſinful in your ſelf; The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I deſire not to be found in my own Righteouſneſs,</hi> and when you are clothed with another, the Lord will own you, and I ſhall ſay but thus much, Doubt not that ever God will deny Salvation to ſinners, that come to him, when the end of all his death and ſufferings was the Salvation of ſinners, when as, I ſay, the whole end, and the whole deſign, and the great Work that God had to do in the World, by the death of Chriſt, wherein he laid out all his Counſels, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wiſdom, and Mercy, and Goodneſs, beyond which there was a <hi>Non ultra</hi> in Gods thoughts, when this was the great deſign, &amp; great end, the Salvation of ſiners, that poor Souls ſhould come over to him and live; certainly when ſinners come, he will not reject, he will not refuſe. And my Lord, do but think of this, the greateſt work that ever was done in the World, was the Blood of Chriſt that was ſhed, never any thing like it; and this Blood of Chriſt that was ſhed, was ſhed for them that come, if not for them, for none, it was in vain elſe: You ſee the Devils they are out of capacity of good by it, the Angels they have no need of it, wicked men will not come, &amp; there are but a few that
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57284:61"/>
come over, and ſhould he deny them, there were no end nor fruit of the blood and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Lord Jeſus; and had your Lordſhip been with Chriſt in that bloody Agony, when he was in that bloody ſweat, ſweating drops of blood, if you had asked him, Lord what art thou now a doing? Art thou not now recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling an angry God and me together? Art thou not pacifying the wrath of God? Art thou not interpoſing thy ſelf between the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God and my Soul? Would he not have ſaid, Yea? and ſurely then he will not deny it now. My Lord, his paſſions are over, his compaſſions ſtill remain, and the larger and greater, becauſe he is gone up into a higher place, that he may throw down more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of his mercy and grace upon you; and my Lord, think of that infinite love, that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of riches in Chriſt: I am loſt, I am emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I have nothing, I am poor, I am ſinful: be it ſo, as bad as God will make me, and as vile as I poſſibly can conceive my ſelf, I am willing to be; but when I have ſaid all, the more I advance that riches, and honour that grace of God. And why ſhould I doubt, when by this he puts me into a capacity, into a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for him to ſhew me mercy, that by this I may the better advance the riches of his grace, and ſay, grace, grace to the Lord to all eternity,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57284:61"/>
that God ſhould own ſuch a creature, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves nothing; and the leſs I deſerve, the more conſpicuous is his grace: and this is certain, the riches of his grace he throweth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, that the glory of his grace might be given to himſelf; if we can give him but the glory of his grace, we ſhall never doubt to partake of the riches of it, and that fulneſs, my Lord, that fulneſs be your comfort, that fulneſs of Mercy, that fulneſs of Love, that fulneſs of Righteouſneſs and Power be now your riches, and your only ſtay, and the Lord interpoſe himſelf between God and you; as your faith hath endeavored to interpoſe him between God and your ſoul, ſo I doubt not but there he ſtands, my Lord, to plead for you, and when you are not able to do any thing your ſelf, yet lie down at the feet of him that is a merciful Saviour, and knows what you would deſire, and wait upon him while you live, truſt in him when you dye, there is riches enough, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy enough, if he open not, yet dye at his door, ſay, there I'l dye, there is mercy enough.</p>

                        <hi>Truly, I like my beginning ſo well, that I will make my concluſion with it, that is, That God Almighty would confer of his infinite and ineſtimable grace and mercy to thoſe that are the Cauſers of my coming hither, I pray God give them as much mercy as their own hearts can wiſh; and truly, for my part, I will not accuſe any one of them of malice, truly I will not, nay, I will not think there was any malice in them; what other ends there is, I know not, nor I will not examine, but let it be what it will, from my very ſoul I forgive them every one: And ſo the Lord of Heaven bleſs you all, God Almighty be infinite in goodneſs and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to you, and direct you in thoſe ways of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his commands to his Majeſty, that this Kingdom may be a happy and glorious Nation again, and that your King may be a happy King

                     <p>Then turning about, and looking for the Executioner (who was gone off the Scaffold) ſaid, Which is the Gentleman? which is the man? Anſwer was made, He is a coming: He then ſaid, Stay, I muſt pull of my Dublet firſt, and my Waſtcoat: Then the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner being come upon the Scaffold, the Lord <hi>Capel</hi> ſaid, O friend, prethee come hither: Then the Executioner kneeling down, the L, <hi>Capel</hi> ſaid, I forgive thee from my Soul, and not only forgive thee, but I ſhall pray to God to give thee all grace for a better life: There is Five pounds for thee; and truly for my clothes and thoſe things, if there be any thing due to you for it, you ſhall be very fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced; but I deſire my body may not be ſtripped here, and no body to take notice of my body but my own ſervants: Look you friend, this I ſhall deſire of you, that when I lie down, that you would give me time for a particular ſhort prayer.</p>

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57284:68"/>
(pointing fore-right,) and anſwer being made, Yes; he ſtood ſtill a little while, and then ſaid, God Almighty bleſs all this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, God Almighty ſtench this blood, God Almighty ſtench, ſtench, ſtench this iſſue of blood; this will not do the buſineſs, God Almighty find out another way to do it. And then turning to one of his Servants, ſaid, <hi>Baldwin,</hi> I cannot ſee any thing that belongs to my wife, but I muſt deſire thee to beſeech her to reſt wholly upon Jeſus Chriſt, and be contented and fully ſatisfied: And then ſpeaking to his Servant, he ſaid, God keep you; and Gentlemen, let me now do a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs quickly, privately, and pray let me have your prayers at the moment of death, that God would receive my ſoul.</p>

And then turning to the Executioner, he ſaid, Honeſt man, I have forgiven thee, therefore ſtrike boldly, from my ſoul I do it. Then a Gentleman ſpeaking to him, he ſaid, Nay, prethee be contented, be quiet good Mr — be quiet. Then turning

to the Executioner, he ſaid, Well, you are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy when I am ready, are you not? And ſtretching out his hands, he ſaid, Then pray ſtand off Gentlemen. Then going to the front of the Scaffold, he ſaid to the People, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, though I doubt not of it, yet I think it convenient to ask it of you, That you would all joyn in Prayers with me, That <hi>God</hi> would mercifully receive my ſoul, and that for his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone mercies in Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>God</hi> Almighty keep you all.</p>

And then after he had ſaid a ſhort prayer, he lifted up his right hand, and the Executioner at one blow ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his Head from his Body, which was taken up by his Servants, and put (with his body) into a Coffin, as the former.</p>
