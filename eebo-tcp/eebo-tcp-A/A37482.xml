            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis <hi>Abſtract</hi> is partly collected
from the beſt Authors I could

Statutes of <hi>England,</hi> Antiquaries,
Modern Writers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have endeavoured to avoid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity,
and to omit no Remarkables,
as far as my deſigned Brevity would
admit; intending rather a <hi>Compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
than a Voluminous Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>What lay ſcatered in divers Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes,
are reduced (in a method whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
new) under their proper Heads,
briefly, yet (I hope) not obſcurely.
I have intermixt many new things,
which fell within my own obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p>I do not pretend to give a full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of all things worthy to be
known, in this <hi>great City,</hi> or of its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous

               <p>OUr Famous <hi>Antiquaries</hi> generally agree that
the <hi>Britains,</hi> whoſe Poſterity now inhabit
the Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> and are called <hi>Welſh,</hi>

                  </gap>e the Founders of the Renowned City of <hi>LON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DON:</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:32497:8"/>
They were in old times known by the Name
of <hi>Aborigines,</hi> becauſe they firſt inhabited the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
               <p>Some derive the name <hi>London</hi> (which is the greateſt
probablity) from the <hi>Britiſh</hi> word <hi>Llhong,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
a Ship, and <hi>Dinan,</hi> a Town, that is, a Town of
Ships, this City being in all Ages, ſince its foundation,
very renowned for Shipping and Navigation. (2.)
Others from <hi>Llhwindian,</hi> becauſe (as <hi>Caeſar</hi> in his
Commentaries, and <hi>Strabo</hi> mention) the Ancient
<hi>Britains</hi> called their fortified Woods <hi>Llhwn,</hi> which
is equivalent to a fenced Town, and that, where
<hi>S. Pauls</hi> Church now ſtands, there was in old times
a Wood, where a Temple was built for <hi>Diana,</hi> it
being the cuſtom of thoſe <hi>Pagan</hi> Times to build
their Fanes or Temples to <hi>Diana</hi> in <hi>Woods</hi> or <hi>Groves,</hi>
and ſo it ſignifies <hi>Dianas</hi> Town. (3.) Some derive it
from <hi>Llhandian,</hi> the <hi>Britains</hi> ſtill calling <hi>Llan</hi> a
Church, and ſo may ſignifie <hi>Dianas</hi>-Church or
Temple, for there have been frequently digged up
Oxens Heads and Bones, which have been offered
as Victims or Sacrifices there, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Camera Dianae.</hi>
So that this word came in tract of time to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<hi>London. Caeſar</hi> (<hi>Comment. lib.</hi> 5.) calls
it <hi>Civitas Trinobantum, viz.</hi> The City of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobants</hi>
(ſome would have it tranſlated the ſtate of
<hi>Trinobants</hi>) for <hi>Troſa Nova,</hi> or <hi>Troy Novant, New Troy;</hi>
Which appellation was in old times by many aſcribed
to <hi>London;</hi> as <hi>Geoffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> the <hi>Welſh</hi>
Hiſtorian affirms.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid by the ſame Author, that King <hi>Lud</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
this City, and much augmented it with fair
buildings, calling it <hi>Caire Lud,</hi> that is, <hi>Lud's</hi> Town,
and from him <hi>Ludgate</hi> takes its Name.</p>
               <p>This City was built 2789 years ago, that is 1108
years before the birth of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (and, by the exacteſt
computation) in the time of <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet,
and 350 years before the building of <hi>Rome.</hi> Of all
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32497:8"/>
Hiſtorians <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> who firſt called it <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinum;</hi>
ſays, that it was in his time (which is about
1655 years ago) <hi>Copia Negotiatorum &amp; Commeatu
valde celebre;</hi> that is, very famous for multitude of
Merchants and Traffick, (or Commerce.) <hi>Herodian</hi>
in the Life of the Emperour <hi>Severus,</hi> ſays it was <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbs
magna &amp; opulenta,</hi> that is, a Great and Rich City.
<hi>Marcelinus</hi> ſays, That in his time (which is 1200 and
odd years ago) it was <hi>Vetuſtum oppidum,</hi> an ancient
Town. <hi>Fitz-Stephens</hi> tells us, That <hi>haec Civitas <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbe
Roma, ſecundum Chronicorum fidem, ſatis Antiquior
eſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Viz.</hi> This City, according to the credit of <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologers,</hi>
is far more ancient then <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the flouriſhing Eſtate of <hi>London,</hi> it was called
<hi>Auguſta,</hi> a Name denoting Dignity and Majeſty; for
the Great <hi>Octavian,</hi> Succeſſor to <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> took to
himſelf the Name of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> as a Title moſt Sacred
and Honourable. This <hi>Marcellinus</hi> witneſſes, in his
27 and 28 Books, calling it <hi>Auguſta,</hi> and that in old
times it was called <hi>London.</hi> It was very famous by
that Appellation under the Emperour <hi>Valentinian.</hi>
And in <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time there was a Mint appointed
there, and Money ſtamp'd with this Impreſſion, <hi>P.
Lon. S.</hi> that is, <hi>Pecunia Londino Signata,</hi> Money
ſtamp'd in <hi>London:</hi> And the Overſeer or Maſter of

that is, Provoſt of the Treaſures of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta</hi>

               <p>AS it was ſaid of the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>e
parva origine,</hi> from a ſmall beginning they
grew to a vaſt greatneſs, ſo we may truly ſay of this
Famous City (the <hi>Metropolis of our Monarchy</hi>) which
even in <hi>Neroes</hi> days was Renowned for Concourſe
of Merchants, and proviſion of all things, (as <hi>Speed</hi>
informs us,) and muſt Conſequently be Great and
Populous. That it has received an acceſſion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
in the Reſpective Ages, is certain; and in our
Memory, we have ſeen it to multiply exceedingly in
beautiful <hi>Structures</hi> and <hi>number</hi> of Inhabitants. So
that it is at preſent of vaſt extent, being from <hi>Lime-Houſe</hi>
to the end of <hi>Tuttle-ſteet,</hi> from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>West,</hi>
above 7500 <hi>Geometrical</hi> paces, that is, above ſeven
Miles and ahalf; And from the further end of <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-street</hi>
in <hi>Southwark,</hi> to the end of St. <hi>Leonard-Shore-Ditch</hi>
is 2500 paces, that is two Miles and a

               <p>The Principal <hi>Streets, Lanes,</hi> and <hi>Alleys,</hi> in this
great City, are above 500 in number, and yet ſome
of them above half a meaſured Mile in length. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the dreadful Conflagration in 1666, there
were computed within the Walls above 15000
Houſes, which is but one fifth of the whole City, as
appears by the Weekly Bills of Mortality, ſo that the
Total of Houſes may be 75000, which are mightily
increaſed ſince the Rebuilding of the City, enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it ſelf every way, eſpecially, about St. <hi>James</hi>'s and
<hi>Sohoe</hi>-Fields, where it has received ſuch Additions
of beautiful Buildings, as by themſelves would make

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:32497:10"/>
Edifices, uniform and Regular buildings, and other
publick Structures, does not only excel its former
State, but (all things conſidered) may outvie the
moſt Magnificent Cities of the Univerſe, as ſhall
be Demonſtrated more particularly.</p>
               <p>As to the number of Inhabitants when <hi>London</hi>
was by more than a fourth part leſs than it is now, there
were computed to be eaten 67500 <hi>Beefs</hi> yearly
there, ten times as many <hi>Sheep,</hi> that is 675000, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
abundance of <hi>Calves, Lamb, Swine,</hi> all ſorts of

of the City almoſt in the form of a <hi>Bow</hi> on the

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Stow</hi> in his Survey tells us, That the City being

had lain waſte 47 years,</p>

at the common charge of the City. <hi>Anno</hi>
1282. <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt giving Licence to enlarge the
<hi>Black Fryars</hi> Church, and to break down a part of
the Wall between <hi>Ludgate</hi> and the River <hi>Thames,</hi> he
gave certain Cuſtoms to the Mayor and Citizens to
build a Wall from <hi>Ludgate</hi> Weſt, to <hi>Fleet</hi>-Bridge,
and ſo behind the Houſes by the <hi>Fleet</hi>-Water (now
the <hi>New-Channel</hi>) to the River. In the year 1310.
<hi>Edward</hi> the Second commanded the Citizens to finiſh
the Wall already begun, and the Tower at the end of
it, within the Water of the River <hi>Thames</hi> near <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Fryars.
Anno</hi> 1322. being the ſecond of <hi>Edward</hi> the

granted by King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second in the tenth year
of his Reign, That a <hi>Toll</hi> ſhould be taken of the

places fixed there; and other Companys repaired the
reſt of the Wall to the <hi>Postern</hi> of <hi>Cripple-gate. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops-gate</hi>
was new built by the Merchants <hi>Almains</hi>

                  <p>THE Number of <hi>Pariſh-Churches,</hi> beſides
<hi>Chapels,</hi> within the Weekly Bills of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
is 132, (twice more than any City in <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom</hi>
can ſhew;) The <hi>Cathedral</hi> of which, is
dedicated to the Apoſtle St. <hi>PA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L,</hi> and the onely
Cathedral of that Name in <hi>Europe.</hi> It was founded
by <hi>Aethelbert</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> Anno 610. (under
whom <hi>Segbert</hi> a <hi>Saxon</hi> Reigned in this Tract of
Ground) in a place where ſtood a Temple of
<hi>Diana,</hi> and afterwards did endow it with Lands and
Privileges; ſo did afterwards <hi>Athelſtan, Edgar</hi> and
<hi>Eward</hi> the <hi>Confeſſor.</hi> It was much enlarged by
<hi>Erkenwald,</hi> the Fourth <hi>Saxon</hi> Biſhop thereof: And
being almoſt deſtroyed by Fire <hi>Anno</hi> 1078. <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritius,</hi>
another of its Biſhops, began the Foundation
of this magnificent Pile, and went on about 20 years,
but the Quire and Tower were not finiſhed till <hi>Anno</hi>
1221. As to other Caſualties, we refer you to the
Chapter that treats of <hi>Fires.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to its <hi>Dimenſions,</hi> the length of it, according
to <hi>Stow,</hi> was 240 Taylors Yards, or 720 Foot; the
<hi>Breadth,</hi> 130 Foot; the Heighth of the Steeple, 520
Foot; whereof the Stone Work was 260, and the
Spire 260 Foot.</p>
                  <p>The Length of it, according to others, was 690
Foot, that is, 20 Foot more than St. <hi>Peters</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi>
It ſtood upon ſo much Ground, as contained above
three Acres and an half. Upon the Spire of Timber
was a <hi>Bowl</hi> of Copper Gilt 9 Foot and 1 Inch in
compaſs, whereon ſtood the Croſs 15 Foot and an
half high, and very near 6 Foot acroſs, made of Oak,
covered with Lead, and another Cover of Copper
over the Lead. Above all, ſtood the Eagle, or Cock
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:32497:21"/>
of Copper Gilt 4 Foot long, and the Breadth of the
Wings 3 Foot and an half.</p>
                  <p>It was built in Form of a Croſs, and in the midſt
of the Croſs, upon mighty high Arches, was the
Tower built. It was a very magnificent Structure
for Beauty, Dimenſions and Proportion, as <hi>William</hi>
of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> ſays, adding, That it ought to be
numbred among the <hi>Number</hi> of the moſt excellent
Edifices, the large Arched Vault, and the Church
above it, being of ſuch a capacity, that (ſaith he) it
may ſeem ſufficient enough to receive any Number
of People.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Caemitery,</hi> or Church-yard, was of a very
great Dimenſion, for it reached North, as far as St.
<hi>Nicholas Market-place;</hi> Weſt, almoſt as far as <hi>Lud-gate;</hi>
South, near to <hi>Baynards</hi> Caſtle. I my ſelf
this laſt year, <hi>viz. January</hi> 1680. ſaw in the place
where the New <hi>Conduit</hi> is a building, where they
digged to lay the Foundation, ſeveral Coffins and
Bones, ſo that it extended farther by far on that ſide,
and probably on all ſides, than it does now. As to
its Benefactors, and its being conſumed by the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Conflagration in 1666. more ſhall be ſpoken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their proper Heads.</p>
                  <p>As to its <hi>Situation,</hi> it was built on the higheſt
part of the City, and ſo more conſpicuous, perhaps,
than any Cathedral in the World. His preſent <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
in the year 1673. having with great coſt pulled
down the Burnt Walls, removed the Rubbiſh, and
cleared the Foundation, has laid another Foundation,
which is conſiderably advanced; and for Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
Splendor, Solidity, Figure, and Curious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture,
will, probably, excel any to be ſeen
elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this ſtately <hi>Cathedral,</hi> there were deſtroyed
in the dreadful Fire of 1666, Eighty ſeven <hi>Pariſh
Churches,</hi> and ſix Conſecrated <hi>Chapels,</hi> a great many
of which are ſince Re-built (far more ſtately and,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:32497:21"/>
magnificent than ever they were before) of ſolid
Stone, with very curious Workmanſhip, beautified
with excellent various Towers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Fronts of true
<hi>Roman</hi> Architecture.</p>
                  <p>Of the <hi>Churches</hi> in City and Suburbs we will give
a brief Account, beginning with <hi>Weſtminſter Abby,</hi>
and ſo on with the reſt Alphabetically.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Weſtminſter Abby</hi> was founded by <hi>Sebert</hi> King of
the <hi>East Saxons,</hi> out of the Ruines of a Temple of
<hi>Apollo</hi> which ſtood there, and fell by an Earthquake
in the time of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi>
about the year of our Lord 605, and had its Name
from its Situation, as being Weſt from <hi>London,</hi> and
its Minſter. It was dedicated to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
in the furious Wars of the <hi>Danes,</hi> but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edified
by Biſhop <hi>Dunſtan,</hi> by the favor of King
<hi>Edgar,</hi> who gave it ſome few Monks.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards King <hi>Edward</hi> (called the <hi>Confeſſor</hi>)
built it anew, and richly endowed it; but about 160
years after, King <hi>Henry</hi> III. Rebuilt it from the
Ground, with that rare Architecture now ſeen. It
was the work of 50 years complete. The King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
laid the firſt Stone, and covered the Roof with
Lead in the year 1220. The Abbots much inlarged
it afterwards to the Weſtward. And King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
VII. <hi>Anno</hi> 1502. beſtowed 14000 Pounds in
Building that admirable Chapel (which <hi>Leland</hi> calls
the Wonder of the World;) for if we reſpect the
admirable and artificial Work without and within,
Beauty, and Elegancy, it can ſcarce be parallel'd in
the World: And it is the judgment of the moſt
Exquiſite Architects, that it comprehends whatſoever
is rare and delicate in that Noble Art. Here is to
be ſeen his own Tomb and Monument made of
ſolid and maſſie Braſs.</p>
                  <p>The Form of the old Building, as an old Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript
ſhews, was, That the principal Plot or Ground-work
of the Building, is ſupported with moſt lofty
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:32497:22"/>
Arches, caſt round with a Four-ſquare Work and
ſemblable Joints. But the Compaſs of the whole,
with a double Arch of Stone on both ſides, is enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with Joined Work firmly knit and united together
every way. The Croſs of the Church, which was to
compaſs the Mid-quire of thoſe that chaunted unto
the Lord, and with a twofold ſupportance that it had
on either ſide to uphold and bear the lofty top of
the Tower in the midſt, ſimply ariſeth at firſt with a
low and ſtrong Arch; then mounteth it higher, with
many winding ſtairs, artificially aſcending with a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of ſteps; but afterwards, with a ſingle wall, it
reacheth up to the Roof of Timber, well and ſurely
covered with Lead.</p>
                  <p>But the new Work of King <hi>Henry</hi> III. far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
that for rare Workmanſhip, being ſupported
with ſeveral Rows of Marble Pillars in very curious
Order, and the Roof covered with ſheets of Lead.</p>
                  <p>When the Monks were driven from this Church,
it had (1) A Dean and Prebendaries. (2) After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
one Biſhop (viz. T. <hi>Thurlby</hi>) who having
waſted the Church Patrimony, was removed. (3)
Queen <hi>Mary</hi> ſet the Monks and their Abbot in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion:
But (4) They were by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
and the Parliament caſt out, and it was converted to a
Collegiate Church, and a Dean placed therein with
12 Prebendaries, and as many old Soldiers paſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
Petty Canons, and others of the Quire, to the
number of 30. And ten Officers belonging to the
Collegiate Dyet, a Schoolmaſter, and an Uſher.
Forty Scholars, who are in their due time preferred
to the Univerſities, they are called the Queens (or
Kings) Scholars. Twelve Almſmen, with plentiful
Maintenance for all. Twelve poor Scholars, beſides
Stewards, Receivers, Regiſters, Collectors, and other
Officers; the Principal whereof is the High Steward
of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> who is uſually one of the Prime No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.
The Dean is intruſted with the Cuſtody of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:32497:22"/>
the <hi>Regalia</hi> at the Coronation, honoured with a
place of neceſſary ſervice at all Coronations, and a
Commiſſion of Peace within the City and Liberties
of <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> The Dean and Chapter inveſted
with all manner of Juriſdiction Eccleſiaſtical and
Civil, not only in the City and Liberties of <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
but within the Precincts of <hi>St. Martins le grand,</hi>
within the Walls of <hi>London,</hi> and in ſome Towns of
<hi>Eſſex,</hi> exempted in the one from the Juriſdiction of
the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and in the other from that of
the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> There is a fair publick
Library free for all Strangers to ſtudy both morning
and afternoon always in Term-time. <hi>William the
Conqueror,</hi> and all our Kings and Queens ſince, have
been Crowned in this Church.</p>
                  <p>The Monument of King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. in the New
Chapel, was made and finiſhed in the year 1519. by
one <hi>Peter</hi> a <hi>Florentine,</hi> for which he received of the
Kings Executors 1000 <hi>l.</hi> The King, with <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>

                  <p>Having done with <hi>Westminſter-Abby,</hi> we ſhall
give a Brief account of the other Churches <hi>Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betically,</hi>
as they were before the Fire: And of ſuch as
are Re-built, (which are now far more Durable and
Stately than before) the Reader may expect an
Account hereafter.</p>
                  <p>I. St. <hi>Albans</hi> Church in <hi>Woodſtreet,</hi> is of great
Antiquity, being Dedicated to St. <hi>Albans</hi> the firſt
<hi>Martyr</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> Another mark of Antiquity
was to be ſeen in the manner of the turning the
Arches in the Windows, and heads of the Pillars.
There were alſo <hi>Roman</hi> Bricks found inlay'd here
and there among the Stones of the Building; it was,
<hi>Anno</hi> 1632. (being wonderfully decay'd,) pull'd down
in order to be Re-built. In it were diverſe Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which for brevity ſake are omitted.</p>
                  <p>II. On the North ſide of the Eaſt end of <hi>Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-ſtreet,</hi>
is the Pariſh-Church called <hi>All-hallows
Barkin,</hi> a very fair Church, ſtanding in a large
Church-Yard; on the North ſide whereof, was
built a fair Chappel by King <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt,
whoſe heart ('tis ſaid) was buryed there, under the
high Altar. This Chappel was Augmented by
King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt. And a fraternity ſetled there
by King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth. King <hi>Richard</hi> the
third new Built it, and founded therein a Colledge
of Prieſts; which was ſuppreſſed in the Year 1548.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:32497:25"/>
in the Second of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, and the Ground
made a Garden-Plat, till the time of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth;</hi>
and then Built upon, and made a Store-Houſe
for Merchants Goods. The Church was Beautified
and Repaired in the Year 1613.</p>
                  <p>III. On the Eaſt-ſide of <hi>Bread-ſtreet,</hi> at the corner
of <hi>Watling-ſtreet,</hi> is the Church of <hi>All-hallows
Bread-ſtreet,</hi> wherein were divers Monuments. This
Church had a fair Spired-Steeple of Stone, which in
the Year 1559. <hi>September</hi> the Fifth, about Noon, by
a great Tempeſt of Lightning, and a great Clap of
Thunder, was ſtruck about Nine or Ten Foot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
the Top, out of which fell a ſtone that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw
a Man, and ſlew a Dog; but the Spire was
taken down to ſave the Charge of Repair. This
Church was Repaired and Beautified at the Pariſh
Charge <hi>Anno</hi> 1625.</p>
                  <p>IV. <hi>Great All-hallows</hi> in <hi>Thames-ſtreet,</hi> was a
fair Church, with a large Cloyſter on the South ſide,
in which were Sundry Monuments, but now Rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated.
It was Repaired and richly Beautified at the
Pariſh Charge, <hi>Anno</hi> 1627. and 1629. In the year
1632. all the Iles to the Chancel were raiſed a Foot
and a half, and the Pews a Foot above that, for
conveniency of Hearing, which coſt ſix hundred
Pound. There was a Monument of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths,</hi>
with theſe Verſes:

                  </p>
                  <p>The Foundation of this Church was lay'd the
twenty third of <hi>June</hi> 1628. It is ſaid in <hi>Stow</hi>'s <hi>Survey,</hi>
pag. 839. <hi>Edit.</hi> 1633. <hi>That digging under the
South Row of Pillars, they found the Scull of a
Man, the thickneſs of which, was three quarters
of an Inch and better, meaſured by many, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by all</hi> (as well they might) <hi>that ſaw it.</hi> The
Structure was built of the beſt Free-ſtone that could
be got, and finiſhed <hi>anno</hi> 1630. There were many
bountiful Benefactors and Contributers to it; And
a curious Table (one of the faireſt in the City,) ſet
up as a Monument of our Renowned Queen <hi>ELI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZABETH,</hi>
but the giver would be concealed.</p>
                  <p>XLIII. Southweſt from <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> in <hi>Cheap-Ward,</hi>

which addition, (viz. <hi>Jewry</hi>) was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of old time Many <hi>Jews</hi> Inhabited thereabouts.
It had diverſe Monuments. Mr. <hi>Stow</hi> tells us, That
Seventy years before his firſt Edition of his <hi>Survey,</hi>
which was 1598, that is now 163 years ago, he ſaw
the <hi>Shank-bone</hi> of a Man (as it was taken,) twenty
five inches long by the Rule, and remained before
the Fire, faſtned to a poſt of timber noted more for
the thickneſs, hardneſs, and ſtrength thereof, then
the length, for when it was hanged on the Stone Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
it fretted (with moving) the ſaid Pillar, and was
not it ſelf fretted, nor did it grow lighter by remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dry; but how found or diſcovered we cannot
learn. Alſo a <hi>Tooth</hi> of a very great bigneſs (he ſays
of a mans Fiſt) hanged up for a ſhow in a Chain of
Iron upon a Stone Pillar; but conveyed from thence
long ſince: the credit of this reſts upon him. This
Church was repaired and richly beautified at the
Charge of the Pariſhioners, <hi>Anno</hi> 1618. Amongſt
other Monuments, we muſt not omit that of our
celebrated and moſt Illuſtrious Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in

                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1271, a great part of the Church fell down;

ordained by a Common Councel, that the <hi>Bow</hi>-Bell

the Parſon and Wardens two Tenements with the
Appurtenances, ſince made into one, in <hi>Hoſier-lane.</hi>

the North, to make a Burying place of, containing
from the courſe of <hi>Walbrook</hi> towards the Weſt, 45

                  <p>XCI. In <hi>Broad-ſtreet-Ward</hi> is the Pariſh-Church
vulgarly called St. <hi>Peter-Poor,</hi> peradventure ſo called,
becauſe the Pariſh was Poor formerly, (but now they
are otherwiſe,) or to difference it from others of that
Name; here are ſundry Monuments, and ſeveral Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors
to the Poor of the Pariſh. The Lady <hi>Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>

which, except four hundred which Sir <hi>William Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>

This Ground he bought of the <hi>Grocers</hi> for two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

On the Eaſt-ſide of <hi>Duck-lane</hi> near <hi>Smithfield,</hi> one
<hi>Rahere,</hi> a pleaſant wittied Gentleman, Founded the
Priory of <hi>St. Bartholomew,</hi> about the Year
1102. He placed Canons there, and became
himſelf their firſt Prior, and ſo continued while
he lived, and was Buried there in a Fair Monument,
Renewed by Prior <hi>Bolton,</hi> who was the laſt <hi>Prior</hi>
in that Houſe; this <hi>Priory</hi> was New built <hi>Anno</hi>
1410. King <hi>Henry</hi> II. Granted it the priviledge of
a <hi>Fair</hi> to be kept Yearly at <hi>Bartholomew</hi>-tide.
When it was ſurrended in the Thirtieth of <hi>H.</hi> VIII.
it was valued at ſix hundred fifty three pound fifteen
ſhillings <hi>per annum.</hi> Six Bells in a Tune belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:32497:42"/>
to it, were Sold to the Pariſh of <hi>St. Sepulchres.</hi>
And then the Church being pulled down to the
Quire, the Quire was by the Kings order, annexed,
for the inlarging of the old Pariſh-Church adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and ſo was uſed till the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi>
who gave the Remnant of the <hi>Priory</hi>-Church to the
<hi>Friers</hi> Preachers, or <hi>Black-Friers,</hi> and was uſed as
their Conventual-Church, until the firſt of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Then thoſe <hi>Fryers</hi> were put out, and all
the ſaid Church, with the old Pariſh-Church, was
wholly as it ſtood in the laſt Year of <hi>Edward</hi> the
VI. given by Parliament to remain for ever a Pariſh-Church,
to the Inhabitants within the <hi>Cloſe,</hi> called
<hi>Great St. Bartholomews.</hi> Since which time much
coſt hath been ſpent in Repairs upon it.</p>
                  <p>III. The <hi>Hoſpital</hi> of <hi>St. Bartholomew</hi> (now the
Pariſh-Church called <hi>St. Bartholomew the leſs,</hi>) was
Founded by the above mentioned <hi>Rahere.</hi> This
was confirmed by <hi>Edward</hi> III. in his Twenty ſixth
Year; this <hi>Hoſpital</hi> was valued at the Suppreſſion
<hi>Anno</hi> 1539. in the Thirty firſt of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. at
thirty five pound ſix ſhillings and ſeven pence Year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
It Remaineth now the Pariſh-Church to the
Inhabitants in the Precinct of the <hi>Hoſpital.</hi> In the
later end of <hi>July Anno</hi> 1552. This <hi>Hoſpital</hi> was
Repaired, New Endowed and Furniſhed at the
charge of the Citizens.</p>
                  <p>IV. The Pariſh-Church of <hi>St. Bridget</hi> or <hi>Bride,</hi> in
<hi>Farringdon-Ward-without,</hi> of old time was a ſmall
Thing, but increaſed ſince with a large Body and
ſide-Iles towards the Weſt, at the charge of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Vennor</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Warden of the <hi>Fleet,</hi> about the Year
1480. All which he cauſed to be brought about
in the Stone, in the Figure of a Vine, with Grapes
and Leaves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The partition betwixt the old work
and the New, ſome time prepared as a Screen, to be
ſet up in the Hall of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Somerſet</hi>'s-Houſe
in the <hi>Strand,</hi> was bought for eight ſcore pound,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:32497:43"/>
and ſet up in the Year 1557. This Church was
Repaired and Richly and Curiouſly Beautified at the
Charge of the Pariſhioners 1630, 1631, 1632.
The Battlements were New built, the middle Roof,
and a very Fair Gallery on the North ſide of this
Church anſwerable to that on the South, erected <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi>
1607.</p>
                  <p>V. As to <hi>Bridewel</hi> Precinct we refer you to the
Section of <hi>Hoſpitals,</hi> with reſpect to that Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
It was Enlarged and Beautified at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
coſt and Charge of the Governors and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the Precinct, <hi>Anno</hi> 1620. Sir <hi>Thomas
Middleton</hi> being Preſident, and Mr. <hi>Thomas Johnſon</hi>
Treaſurer. There was above twenty four Foot in
Length added to it. It is a Beautiful Chappel;
that commends the care of its Governors. We
muſt not omit to inſert, that cloſe by the Pulpit,
hangs the Picture of King <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. that
truly Religious and moſt Vertuous Proteſtant Prince,
with the following Lines:

There was a Popiſh Brotherhood Founded

Chappel of Eaſe to <hi>Stepney</hi>-Pariſh, and the Parſon

and in good Repair. There are ſome few handſom
Monuments in it.</p>
                  <p>XII. The Pariſh-Church of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> in upper
<hi>Shadwel,</hi> was alſo lately made a Pariſh-Church; the
Pariſh being too Numerous for the Church of <hi>Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</hi>
It is a handſom Church with a large Church-Yard,
and the Pariſh very Populous.</p>
                  <p>XIII. In the Pariſh-Church of <hi>Rotherhith</hi> (vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly

capacious, yet too too narrow for the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
it being the moſt populous Pariſh in <hi>England,</hi>
as appears by our Bills of Mortality, and of a great
Extent. There are divers Monuments in it; and
ſome of great Antiquity. Now we ſhall ſpeak of the
Churches in the City and Liberties of <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>

                  <p>I. The Pariſh-Church of St. <hi>Clements Danes</hi>
near <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> is ſo called, becauſe one <hi>Harold,</hi> a
<hi>Daniſh</hi> King, and other <hi>Danes,</hi> were buried there. It
was in the Liberties of the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaſter.</hi>
This was a fair Church, and likely; ere long, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
its former beauty. Here were ſeveral curious
Monuments. And 'tis a populous Pariſh, full of
handſom Buildings.</p>
                  <p>II. St. <hi>Pauls Covent-Garden</hi> is a very handſom
and a delicate Church, of no great Antiquity, yet a
populous Pariſh.</p>
                  <p>III. St. <hi>Martins in the Fields</hi> is a ſpacious
Church, and the Pariſh wonderful populous. In it
are divers fair Monuments, and of ſeveral Perſons of
Honor, which are too tedious to be recited, only for
the pithineſs, I ſhall inſert one Diſtich upon <hi>Charles
Blount,</hi> an Infant, 2d Son to the Earl of <hi>Newport.</hi>

<hi>Gaunt</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> which for beauty and
ſtatelineſs none in the Kingdom could then compare
with, as from Antiquity we learn; it came to the

Kings hands, and was Re-built, and made an Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
of St. <hi>John Baptist,</hi> by King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. about
the year 1509. for which he purchaſed Lands, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

for a Work-houſe for poor and idle Perſons, and
towards furniſhing the Hoſpital of St. <hi>Thomas South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark.</hi>
The Chapel of this Hoſpital ſerveth now for
a Pariſh-Church to the places adjoining, called St.
<hi>Mary Savoy;</hi> in it are divers Monuments. The
Benefactors to it, are Regiſtred in a Book kept
there, which are too many to be inſerted in our

                  <p>V. The Pariſh-Church of St. <hi>Margarets Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi>
is a ſumptuous and ſtately Church, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built
by King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, for the Eaſe and
Commodity of the Monks of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> becauſe
before that time the Pariſh-Church ſtood within the

King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. upon this occaſion,
which being ſo Remarkable, we ſhall recount from

Sermon he made a fruitful and godly Exhortation to
the Rich, to be merciful to the Poor; and alſo to
move ſuch as were in Authority, to act by ſome cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
way and means to relieve them. Whereupon
the King's Majeſty, (being a Prince of Towardneſs

Duke of <hi>Sommerſet,</hi> as alſo by his virtuous School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters)
was ſo careful of the good Government of
the Realm. and chiefly to do and prefer ſuch things
as moſt eſpecially touched the Honour of Almighty
God. And underſtanding that a great number of
poor People did ſwarm in the Realm, and chiefly in
the City of <hi>London,</hi> and that no good order was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for them, did ſuddenly (and of himſelf) ſend to
the ſaid <hi>Biſhop,</hi> as ſoon as his Sermon was ended,
willing him not to depart, until he had ſpoken with
him. And this that I now write (ſaith Mr. <hi>Sto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was the very Report of the ſaid Biſhop <hi>Ridley,</hi> who
(according to the King's Command) gave his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance.
And as ſoon as the King's Majeſty was at

giving him hearty Thanks for his Sermon and good

much commended him for his Exhortation, for
the Relief of the Poor.</p>
                  <p>But my Lord (<hi>quoth he</hi>) you willed ſuch as are
in Authority to be careful thereof, and to deviſe
ſome good Order for their Relief; wherein I think
you mean Me, for I am in Highest Place, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
am the first that must make Anſwer to God
for my Negligence if I ſhould not be careful there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
knowing it to be the expreſs Commandment of
Almighty God, to have compaſſion of his poor and
needy Members, for whom we must make an Account
unto Him. And truely, my Lord, I am (before all
things elſe) most willing to travel that way, and I
doubt nothing of your long and approved Wiſdom
and Learning, but that you having ſuch good Zeal
as wiſheth help unto them, have alſo had ſome
conference with others, what ways are beſt to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
therein, and therefore I pray you to ſay your
mind.</p>
                  <p>Which Speech being ſo truely Virtuous and
Noble in ſo young a Prince, deſerves an everlaſting
<hi>Record.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Biſhop thinking leaſt of that matter, and
being amazed to hear the Wiſdom and earneſt Zeal
of the <hi>King,</hi> was (as he ſaid himſelf) ſo aſtoniſhed,
That he could not tell what to ſay. But after ſome
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:32497:53"/>
pauſe, ſaid, That he thought (at this preſent) for
ſome entrance to be had, it were good to practiſe
with the City of <hi>London,</hi> becauſe the Number of
the Poor there are very great, and the Citizens alſo
very many and wiſe; and he doubted not, but they
were alſo both pitiful and merciful; as the <hi>Mayor,</hi>
and his Brethren, and other the Worſhipful of the
ſaid City: And that if it would pleaſe the <hi>Kings
Majeſty</hi> to direct His Gracious Letters unto the
<hi>Mayor</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> willing him to call unto him ſuch
Aſſiſtants as he ſhould think meet, to conſult of this
matter; for ſome Order to be taken therein, he
doubted not but good would follow thereon; and he
himſelf promiſed the King to be one himſelf that
ſhould earneſtly travel therein.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>King</hi> (forthwith) not only Granted his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but made the Biſhop tarry until the ſame was
written, and his Hand and Signet ſet thereto; and
commanded the Biſhop not only to deliver the ſaid
Letter himſelf, but alſo to ſignifie unto the <hi>Mayor,</hi>
that it was the <hi>Kings</hi> eſpecial Requeſt and expreſs
<hi>Commandment,</hi> that the <hi>Mayor</hi> ſhould therein tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel;
and ſo ſoon as he might conveniently, give him
knowledge how far he had proceeded therein. The
Biſhop was ſo joyous at the having this Letter, that
now he had occaſion to travel in ſo good a matter,
wherein he was marvellous zealous, that nothing could
have more pleaſed and delighted him: wherefore the
ſame Night he came to the <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> of <hi>London,</hi>
who was then Sir <hi>Richard Dobbs</hi> Kt. and delivered
the King's Letter, and ſhewed his Meſſage with
effect.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> not only joyfully received this
Letter, but with all ſpeed agreed to ſet the matter
forward, for he alſo favoured it very much. And the
next day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being Monday, he deſired the Biſhop of
<hi>London</hi> to dine with him, and againſt that time the
<hi>Mayor</hi> promiſed to ſend for ſuch men as he thought
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:32497:54"/>
meeteſt to talk of this matter, and ſo he did. He
ſent firſt for two <hi>Aldermen,</hi> and ſix <hi>Commoners,</hi> and
afterwards more were appointed, to the number of
24. In the end, after ſundry Meetings, (for by the
means and good diligence of the Biſhop it was well
followed) they agreed upon a Book that they had
deviſed, wherein firſt they conſidered on Nine ſpecial

                  <p>For the (3) Degree, they provided <hi>Bridewell,</hi>
where the Vagabond and idle Strumpet is chaſtiſed,
and compelled to labour, to the overthrow of the
vicious life of Idleneſs.</p>
                  <p>They provided alſo for the honeſt decayed
<hi>Houſholder,</hi> that he ſhould be relieved at home at
his Houſe, and in the Pariſh where he dwelt, by a
Weekly Relief and Penſion.</p>
                  <p>And in like manner they provided for the <hi>Lazer,</hi>
(or Leprous Perſon) to keep him out of the City
from Clapping of Diſhes, and Ringing of Bells, to
the great trouble of the Citizens, and alſo to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Infection of many, that they ſhould be reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at home at their Houſes, by ſeveral Penſions.</p>
                  <p>Now after this good Order taken, (to the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Honour of this Noble City) and the Citizens
willing to further the ſame, the Report thereof was
made to the King; And His Majeſty, for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
thereof, was not only willing to grant ſuch
as ſhould be Overſeers and Governors of the ſaid
Houſes, a <hi>Corporation,</hi> and Authority for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of them: but alſo required, that he might
be accounted as the <hi>Chief Founder</hi> and <hi>Patron</hi>
thereof.</p>
                  <p>And for the furtherance of the ſaid Work, and
continual maintenance of the ſame, He, of his meer
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:32497:55"/>
Mercy and Goodneſs granted, that whereas (before)
certain Lands were given to the maintaining of the
Houſe of the <hi>Savoy,</hi> founded by King <hi>Henry</hi> VII.
for the Lodging of Pilgrims and Strangers, and that
the ſame was now made but a Lodging for Loyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
Vagabonds and Strumpets, that lay all day in
the Fields, and at night were harboured there, the
which was rather the maintenance of Beggary, than
any Relief to the Poor: gave the ſame Lands, being
firſt ſurrendred by the <hi>Maſter</hi> and <hi>Fellows</hi> there,
(which Lands were of the yearly value of 600 <hi>l.</hi>)
unto the City of <hi>London,</hi> for the maintenance of the
<hi>Foundation</hi> aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>And for a further Relief, a Petition being made to
the King's Majeſty, for a Licence to take in <hi>Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,</hi>
or otherwiſe without Licence, Lands to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
yearly value, and a ſpace left in the Patent for
His MAJESTY, to put in what Sum He pleaſed:
He looked on the void place, called for Pen and
Ink, and with His own <hi>Royal Hand</hi> wrote this Sum,
4000 <hi>Marks by the year,</hi> (which is 2666 <hi>l.</hi> 13 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi>
and with the former 600 <hi>l.</hi> makes in all 3266 <hi>l.</hi>
13 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi>) and then ſaid, in the hearing of his
Council, <hi>Lord, I yield thee moſt hearty thanks,
that thou haſt given me life thus long, to finiſh this
work to the Glory of thy Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After which <hi>Foundation</hi> eſtabliſhed, he lived not
above two days; whoſe life would have been wiſhed
equal to the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> if it had pleaſed <hi>God</hi> ſo to
have prolonged it. He dyed at <hi>Greenwich</hi> the 6th
of <hi>July,</hi> Anno 1553. He was in Body beautiful, of a
ſweet Aſpect, and ſpecially in his Eyes, which ſeemed
to have a ſtarry livelineſs and luſtre in them. For his
pregnancy of Wit and Knowledge in all kinds of
Learning, <hi>Cardan</hi> (who coming into <hi>England,</hi> had
often conference with him) reporteth of him, that
he was extraordinary skilful in <hi>Languages,</hi> and in the
<hi>Politicks;</hi> well ſeen in <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> and in <hi>Divinity;</hi>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:32497:55"/>
and generally indeed, <hi>a very Miracle</hi> of Art and
Nature.</p>
                  <p>He would anſwer Ambaſſadors ſometimes upon
the ſudden, either in <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Latin.</hi> He knew
the ſtate of <hi>Foreign Princes</hi> perfectly, and his own
more. He could call all <hi>Gentlemen of Account</hi>
through his Kingdom, by their <hi>Names.</hi> And all this,
when he had ſcarce yet attained to the Age of Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Years, and dyed before Sixteen. That from
hence we may gather, <hi>It is a ſign of no long Life,
when the Faculties of the Mind are ripe ſo
early.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Pious and Religious Life was Remarkable, as
may be ſeen in the whole <hi>ſeries</hi> of it; and his Death
was no leſs, for the hour before he dyed, he was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
to pray thus by himſelf:</p>
                  <p>O Lord God, deliver me out of this miſerable and
wretched life. O Lord, thou knoweſt how happy it
were for me to be with thee; yet for thy Choſen's
ſake, if it be thy Will, ſend me life and health, that
I may truly ſerve thee. O Lord God, ſave thy cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
People in <hi>England,</hi> and defend this Realm from
PAPISTRY, and maintain thy true Religion,
that I and my People may praiſe thy Holy Name for
thy Son Jeſus Chriſt's ſake.</p>
                  <p>So turning his Face, and ſeeing ſome by him, he
ſaid, <hi>I thought you had not been ſo nigh.</hi> Yes, ſaid
Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> we heard you ſpeak to your ſelf. Then,
ſaid the King, <hi>I was praying to God; I am faint,
Lord have mercy upon me, and receive my Spirit:</hi>
And, in ſo ſaying, his bleſſed Spirit departed, to take
poſſeſſion of an heavenly <hi>Crown,</hi> when he had enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an earthly Crown, ſix years, five months, and nine
days.</p>
                  <p>He was buried the 9th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the
Seventh's Chappel at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> near the Body of
the ſaid King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh his Grandfather.</p>
                  <p>This ſmall Digreſſion, I hope, will not be unaccep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:32497:56"/>
to all true Chriſtians, being in memorial of
that Peerleſs, and Never-enough Bewailed Prince;
but he was too good for the World, and reſts now in
endleſs Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1552, began the Repairing of the
<hi>Gray-Fryers</hi> Houſe, for the poor <hi>Fatherleſs Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
and in the month of <hi>November</hi> the Children
were taken in to the ſame, to the Number of almoſt
400.</p>
                  <p>On <hi>Chriſtmas-day</hi> in the Afternoon, while the
<hi>Lord Mayor</hi> and <hi>Aldermen</hi> Rode to <hi>Pauls,</hi> the
Children of <hi>Chriſts-Hoſpital,</hi> from St. <hi>Lawrence-lane</hi>
end in <hi>Cheapſide</hi> towards <hi>Pauls,</hi> all in one Livery
of Ruſſet-Cotton, Three hundred and forty in
Number; and at <hi>Eaſter</hi> next they were in Blue at
the <hi>Spittle,</hi> and ſo they have continued ever ſince,
but they were this Year at St. <hi>Sepulchres.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This indeed was a work of extraordinary Piety,
and, in my judgment, it is a very Comely Sight to ſee
the Poor Boys, when they Sup all together, with
what Decency, Order and Neatneſs they are ſerv'd and
Governed, by the reſpective Perſons in that Office;
how plentifully they are provided with good Dyet,
Waſhing, Lodging, and Learning, to fit them for bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
which the City takes care to ſettle them in, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

<hi>July</hi> 1676, in ſo Stately and Beautiful a manner,

of Poor Lunaticks, or ſuch as were Phrenetick,

There was alſo an <hi>Hoſpital</hi> of St. <hi>Mary Spittle,</hi>

                  <p>WE will begin with the <hi>Royal Palaces,</hi> as
<hi>White-Hall,</hi> where the Court is kept
when the King is in the City. In antient times <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-Palace</hi>
was the habitation of the Kings of
<hi>England,</hi> from the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor,
which was by caſual Fire burnt down in the time of
<hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. This was a very large and ſtately
Palace, and for the building in that Age incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
In the Remains of which, the High Court of
Parliament Sits, but more of that hereafter.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. tranſlated his Seat to a Houſe
not far of, built by <hi>Cardinal Wolſey,</hi> and is called
<hi>White-Hall.</hi> This Place formerly belonged to <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
de Burgh,</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> by whom it was given
to the <hi>Gray-Friers,</hi> and of them bought by <hi>Walter
Gray,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> and called <hi>York-place;</hi>
but <hi>Anno.</hi> 1529, the King took it from <hi>Wolſey</hi> and
the <hi>Archbiſhop,</hi> and named it <hi>White-Hall:</hi> this
King built there a Sumptuous Gallery, and a very
Beautiful Gate-Houſe, thwart the <hi>High-ſtreet</hi> to
St. <hi>James</hi>'s-<hi>Park.</hi> In this Gallery the Princes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with
their Nobility uſed to ſtand or ſit, to behold all
Triumphant or Military Exerciſes.</p>
                  <p>To Deſcribe all particularities relating to this
<hi>Royall-Seat,</hi> would be too tedious. Take a few
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:32497:64"/>
ſhort Remarks. There is a moſt Magnificent and
Stately <hi>Banquetting-Houſe,</hi> built by King <hi>James.</hi>
And the Delicate <hi>Privy-Garden</hi> was lately enlarged
towards the South, with a Pond of an Oval form,
ſupplied with Water from <hi>Hide-Park,</hi> where you
may ſee the Water ſhot, or forced up to a great
height from the ſurface of the Pond, and by its wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-fall
delights the Eye, and the Ear, with its
pretty murmur.</p>
                  <p>Although this Palace of <hi>White Hall</hi> makes not
ſo Glorious a ſhew on the out-ſide, as ſome other
ſtately Edifices, yet there is not in Chriſtendom a
Court more convenient, and meet for Royal Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation,
nor more Richly Furniſht. But for the

                  <p>1. <hi>Its Government,</hi> &amp;c. The Dean of the Kings
Chappel is uſually ſome Grave and Learned Prelate,
choſen by the King, who only is his Superiour, his
Chappel being exempt from all <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
being called <hi>Capella Dominica,</hi> the <hi>Demean
Chappel,</hi> in no Dioceſs, but is a Regal Peculiar,
Exempt and Reſerved to the Viſitation and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Government of the King, who is Supream Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
and as it were Prime Biſhop over all the
Churches and Biſhops of <hi>England.</hi> By the Dean
are choſen all other Officers of the Chappel, <hi>viz.</hi>
A Sub-Dean or <hi>Praecentor Capellae;</hi> Thirty two
Gentlemen of the Chappel, whereof twelve are
Prieſts, the other twenty, commonly called Clerks,
of the Chappel, are to perform, with the ſaid Prieſts,
the Office of Praying, Singing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> One of theſe

being well skill'd in <hi>Muſick,</hi> is choſen Maſter of
the Children, whereof are twelve in Ordinary, to
inſtruct them in the Rules and Art of <hi>Muſick,</hi> for
the ſervice of the Chappel; three others are choſen
to be <hi>Organists,</hi> to whom is joyned, upon Solemn
Days, a Conſort of the King's Muſick, to make the
Muſick more full and compleat. There are four
Officers called <hi>Vergers,</hi> becauſe they carry Silver
Rods in their hands, <hi>viz.</hi> a Sergeant, two Yeomen,
and a Groom of the Chappel. Common Prayers
are Read there three times a day. The King has
his private Oratory, where ſome of his Chaplains
in Ordinary perform the Office every day of the
Week. Upon twelve high and Principal <hi>Feſtivals</hi> in
the Year, the King (after the Service is over,) at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with the Principal Nobility, offers a Sum of
Gold to God, <hi>in ſignum ſpecialis Domini,</hi> that by
his Grace he is King, and holds all of Him, which
belongs to the Dean to be diſtributed amongſt the
Poor. This Gold offered is called the <hi>Bizantine,</hi>
which anciently was a Piece of Gold Coyned by
the Emperours of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in <hi>Latin, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zantium;</hi>
That which was uſed by King <hi>James,</hi>
was a piece of Gold, having on the one ſide, the
Pourtrait of the King kneeling before an Altar,
with four Crowns before Him, and this <hi>Motto</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed,
<hi>Quid retribuam Domino, pro omnibus
quae retribuit mihi?</hi> On the other ſide was a
Lamb lying by a Lyon, with this <hi>Motto,</hi> viz. <hi>Cor
Contutum &amp; humiliatum non deſpiciet Deus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King hath (beſides His Extraordinary, which
are many) Fourty Eight Chaplains in Ordinary,
who are Eminent Doctors in Divinity, whereof Four
every Month wait at Court to Preach. The Lord
<hi>High Almoner</hi> is uſually the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi>
who diſpoſeth of the Kings Alms, and for that uſe
receiveth (beſides other Moneys allowed by the
King) all <hi>Deodands,</hi> and <hi>bona felonum de ſe,</hi> to be

that way diſpoſed. Under the Lord High <hi>Almoner,</hi>
there is a <hi>Sub-Almoner,</hi> two <hi>Yeomen,</hi> and two Grooms
of the <hi>Almonry.</hi> Then there is the Clerk of the
<hi>Cloſet,</hi> uſually ſome Reverend Divine, much eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

It hath for a long time been a Pattern of <hi>Hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
and <hi>Charity,</hi> to the Nobility and Gentry of
<hi>Eugland.</hi> All Noblemen or Gentlemen, Subjects
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:32497:74"/>
or Strangers, were freely Entertained at the plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Tables of His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Officers. Divers Diſhes

by Two <hi>Grooms,</hi> and Two <hi>Yeomen,</hi> of the

give the <hi>King</hi>'s Diſh, to whatſoever Poor Man he
pleaſes; that is, the firſt Diſh at Dinner which is ſet
upon the <hi>King's</hi> Table, or in ſtead thereof four pence
a day, (which anciently was equivalent to four ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings

pence in money, a Two-penny <hi>Loaf,</hi> and a Gallon of

equally to be divided among them every morning at
ſeven of the Clock at the Court-gate. The <hi>Sub-Almoner</hi>
is to ſcatter New-coined Two-pences in the
Towns and Places where the King paſſes through in

there are many poor <hi>Penſioners,</hi> either becauſe ſo old

                  <p>The magnificent and abundant plenty of the
King's Tables, hath cauſed amazement in Foreigners.
In the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. there were daily in
his Court 86 <hi>Tables</hi> well furniſhed each Meal,
whereof the King's Tables had 28 Diſhes, the
Queens 24, 4 other Tables 16 Diſhes each, 3 other

500 Diſhes each Meal, with Bread, Beer, Wine, and

<hi>Sheep,</hi> 1200 <hi>Veals,</hi> 300 <hi>Porkers,</hi> 400 <hi>Sturks,</hi> or

together with the <hi>Fiſh,</hi> and <hi>Fowl, Veniſon, Fruit,
Spice</hi> proportionably. This prodigious plenty in the
King's Court, cauſed Foreigners to put a higher value
upon the <hi>King,</hi> and was much for the Honor of the
Kingdom. The King's Servants being Men of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
by His Majeſties ſpecial Order went to <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-Hall</hi>
in Term-time, to invite Gentlemen, to

Thurſday,</hi> the King, or his Lord <hi>Almoner,</hi> was wont to

III. Although it might ſeem more proper to treat
of <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> under the Head or Chapter of
Publick Halls or Courts, yet being a Place ſo Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
above any other in this Renowned City, and
formerly a <hi>Royal Palace,</hi> we ſhall leave our Remarks
upon it with the Reader in this place, and give a brief
Account, (1) of its <hi>Foundation</hi> and <hi>Antiquity;</hi>
(2) of the <hi>Courts</hi> held there, eſpecially the High
Court of <hi>Parliament,</hi> which, we hope, will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable.</p>
                  <p>1. Many Eminent Authors do affirm, That
this Great Hall was built by <hi>William Rufus,</hi> about
the year of our Lord 1097. amongſt whom, <hi>Roger</hi>
of <hi>Windover,</hi> and <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> write, that King
<hi>William</hi> being returned out of <hi>Normandy</hi> into
<hi>England,</hi> kept his Feaſt of <hi>Whitſontide</hi> very Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in the New-Hall, which he had
lately built. This <hi>Hall,</hi> for all Dimenſions, is not
to be equalled by any Hall in <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> It is
(ſay ſome) 270 Foot in length, and 74 broad. It is
reported that the <hi>King</hi> ſhould ſay to one that
thought the Hall too big, <hi>That it was not big enough

                  <p>This Palace was Repaired <hi>Anno</hi> 1163. by <hi>Thomas
Becket</hi> Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> with exceeding great
celerity and ſpeed, being before ready to have fallen
down. It hath been the principal Seat and Palace of
all the Kings of <hi>England</hi> ſince the Conqueſt, where
they kept Coronation, and other Solemn Feaſts, till
the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. In this Palace (by
a marvelous Inundation or Overflowing of the River
of <hi>Thames</hi> in the year 1236, which drowned many
Cattle and Men, Women and Children) Men did
Row with <hi>Wherries</hi> in the midſt of the <hi>Hall.</hi> The
like (or rather more dreadful Inundation) hapned
in the year 1242. the <hi>Thames</hi> overflowing the Banks
about <hi>Lambeth.</hi>

In the year 1299, 27 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. this Palace was
burnt by a vehement Fire, kindled in the leſſer <hi>Hall</hi>

The <hi>Lords</hi> are to bear their own Charges, becauſe
they Repreſent only themſelves. The <hi>Commons</hi>
uſually had their Reaſonable expences. In the

Four <hi>s.</hi> a day for Dubbed <hi>Knights,</hi> and Two <hi>s.</hi>
for all others, which in thoſe days, as appears by the
Prices of all things, was a conſiderable Sum, above
Twenty times more than it is now. So that ſome

that they might not be obliged to ſend <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes</hi>

                     <p>It is the Practice of each Houſe to debate all
publick Affairs, relating to the general or particular
Welfare, of the Kingdom or Subject. And every
<hi>Parliament</hi> may get a <hi>Bill</hi> drawn, and give it to
the <hi>Speaker,</hi> or <hi>Clerk</hi> of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
in convenient time. Whatſoever is propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

unanimouſly <hi>rejected,</hi> or elſe allowed to be Debated,
and then it is Committed to a certain Number of
the Houſe, preſently Nominated, and called a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee.</hi>
After it hath been Amended, and twice
Read two ſeveral Days in the Houſe, it is <hi>Ingroſſed,</hi>
that is, Written Fair in a Parchment, and Read the
Third time another day, and then (if in the <hi>Lords

the <hi>Speaker</hi> demands if they will have it put

                     <p>If a Bill be rejected, it cannot be any more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
during that Seſſion. All Bills ſent by the
Commons to the Lords Houſe, are uſually attended
(to ſhew their reſpect) with ſeveral of their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and as they come up to the Lords Bar, the
Member that's to preſent the Bill maketh three
profound Reverences, and delivers it to the Lord
<hi>Chancellor,</hi> who comes down to the Bar to receive it.</p>
                     <p>A Bill ſent by the Lords to the Commons is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
by ſome of the Maſters of <hi>Chancery,</hi> or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
whoſe ſeat is on the <hi>Wool-ſacks</hi> (and by none

bow thrice, and deliver it to him, after one of them
hath read the Title, and deſired it might be taken
into Conſideration. If it paſs that Houſe, then is
Written on it, <hi>Les Communes ont aſſentez.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When any Member of the Houſe of Commons
ſpeaks to a Bill, he ſtands up uncovered, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects

Delivers be confuted by another, yet he is not allowed

                     <p>Alſo if a Bill be debating in the Houſe, no man
may ſpeak to it in one day, above once. If any
one ſpeak words of offence which the Houſe takes
cognizance of as ſuch, he is called to the Bar, and
ſometimes ſent to the <hi>Tower.</hi> The <hi>Speaker</hi> is not
allowed to perſuade or diſſuade in paſſing of a Bill,
but only to make a ſhort and plain Narrative, nor
to Vote, except the Houſe be equally Divided. In

                     <p>In the <hi>Houſe of Lords</hi> they give their <hi>Suffrages</hi>

[<hi>Content,</hi> or <hi>Not content.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> they Vote by <hi>Yea's,</hi>
and <hi>No's,</hi> and if it be doubtful which is the greater
Number, then the <hi>Yea's</hi> are to go forth, and the
<hi>No's</hi> ſit ſtill, <hi>becauſe theſe are content with their

though it be of the whole Houſe, (as it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times)
the <hi>Yea's</hi> go on one ſide, and the <hi>No's</hi> on the
other, whereby they may be diſcerned.</p>
                     <p>If a Bill paſs in one Houſe, and being ſent to the
other Houſe, they of the other Houſe Demur upon
it, then a Conference is demanded in the <hi>Painted
Chamber,</hi> where certain deputed Members of each
Houſe Meet, the Lords ſitting covered at a Table,
and the Commons ſtanding bare: the buſineſs is
then debated; If they agree not, it is <hi>Nulled;</hi> if they

Bill) pronounceth the Royal aſſent. If it be a <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>
Bill, the Anſwer is (<hi>Le Roy le veut,</hi>) and then
that Bill becomes a Law. If a <hi>Private</hi> Bill,
the Anſwer is (<hi>Soit fait comms el eſt deſire.</hi>) If
it be a Pubblick Bill which the King likes not, then
the Anſwer is, (<hi>Le Roy s'aviſera</hi>) which is taken for
an abſolute Denial, in a more Civil way, and that
Bill wholly nulled. So that nothing but what the
King confirms by his <hi>Royal Aſſent,</hi> hath the force of

                  <p>THe <hi>Royal Exchange</hi> in <hi>Cornhil</hi>-Ward, was E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
in the Year 1566, juſt one hundred
Years before it was Burnt, in this manner.</p>
                  <p>Certain Houſes upon <hi>Cornhil,</hi> containing Eighty
Houſholds, were purchaſed by the City of <hi>London</hi>
for above 3532 <hi>l.</hi> which they ſold for 478 <hi>l.</hi> to ſuch
as would take them down and carry them away.
Then the Ground or Plot was made plain at the
Charges of the City, and Poſſeſſion thereof was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to Sir <hi>Thomas Greſham</hi> Knight, a Noble Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
and Agent to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> by certain
Aldermen in the name of the whole, for to Build
an Exchange thereon for Merchants to Aſſemble.
On the 7<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> he laid the firſt Stone in the
Foundation, being accompanied with ſome Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
where every one of them laid a piece of <hi>Gold,</hi>
which the Work-men took up; The Work was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
with ſuch Expedition, that in <hi>November,</hi>
1567, it was finiſhed, and afterwards in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
and by the ſpecial Command of the <hi>Queen,</hi>
it was Proclaimed by a Herald, and with ſound of
Trumpet named, <hi>The ROYAL EXCHANGE.</hi> It
was Built moſt of Brick, and yet was the moſt
ſplendid <hi>Burſe</hi> (all things conſidered) that was then
in <hi>Europe.</hi> The <hi>Burſe</hi> for Merchants was kept be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in <hi>Lumbard-ſtreet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the great and diſmal Conflagration, <hi>Anno</hi> 1666.
the <hi>Royal Exchange</hi> was conſumed; But it is ſince
Rebuilt in a far more ſtately and Magnificent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
of excellent <hi>Portland</hi> Stone, almoſt as dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as Marble, with ſuch curious and admirable
Architecture, eſpecially for a <hi>Front,</hi> a <hi>Turret,</hi> and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:32497:99"/>
for <hi>Arch-work,</hi> that it ſurpaſſeth all other <hi>Burſes</hi>
in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Form is Quadrangular, with a large Paved
Court where the Merchants Meet, it is <hi>Quadratum
Oblongum,</hi> an Oblong ſquare, and on each ſide are
ſtately Galleries or <hi>Portico</hi>'s Checquered with a
ſmooth and delicate Stone-Pavement, the Arches
ſupported with ſtrong Stone <hi>Pillars,</hi> where in caſe
of Rain or extream Heat, the greateſt part may be
ſheltered. The whole Fabrick coſt above 50000 <hi>l.</hi>
whereof one half was disburſed by the Chamber of
<hi>London,</hi> and the other by the Company of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers:</hi>
And to reimburſe them, there are to be let
190 Shops above-ſtairs, at 20 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> and
30 <hi>l.</hi> Fine, beſides the ſeveral Shops below on the
ſeveral ſides, and the huge Vaulted <hi>Cellars</hi> under
ground, ſo that it muſt needs be the richeſt piece
of Ground in the World. For,</p>
                  <p>The Exact Dimenſions of the Ground whereon
this Goodly Fabrick is Erected, is but 171 Foot
from <hi>North</hi> to <hi>South,</hi> and 203 Foot from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to
<hi>Weſt,</hi> and little more than three quarters of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre
of Ground, yet producing above 4000 <hi>l.</hi> Year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Rent.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>New Exchange</hi> on the <hi>Strand</hi> was called
<hi>Durham-Houſe,</hi> Built by <hi>Thomas Hatfield</hi> Biſhop
of <hi>Durham,</hi> who being made Biſhop of that See,
<hi>Anno</hi> 1549. continued ſo 36 Years. It was a very
Capacious Edifice, on the <hi>North</hi> ſide ſtood a row
of Thatcht low Stables, which the Right Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> then Lord High <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> purchaſed and pulled down, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
in the room thereof, at his own Charge, a
very goodly and beautiful Building, with Cellars
underneath, and a Walk fairly Paved above it, with
Rows of Shops, and the like above ſtairs.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Stone was laid the 10<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1608,
and it was finiſhed in <hi>November</hi> following. The
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:32497:100"/>
Shops above and under were curiouſly adorn'd, and
in <hi>April</hi> following the Earl Invited King <hi>James,</hi> the
<hi>Queen,</hi> the <hi>Prince,</hi> the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> to come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who came attended with many of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,

                  <p>In a few words it may be ſaid of this City (in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion

Elſing</hi> Mercer, <hi>anno</hi> 1329. 3 <hi>E.</hi> 3. began in the

hundred blind men, to which he gave two Houſes of
a conſiderable value. But 'twas <hi>anno</hi> 1332. made a
Priory for Canons Regular, and in the ſame place
there was at laſt a Colledge erected by <hi>Thomas
White</hi> Doctor in Divinity, for the uſe of the Clergy
of <hi>London,</hi> and the Liberties thereof, and a part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to be for 20 poor People, 10. Men, and 10
Women. To perform all this, (beſides ſeveral Sums
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:32497:104"/>
of money, and conſiderable yearly Revenues given by
the ſaid Doctor <hi>White,</hi> to pious and charitable Uſes
in divers places) he gave 3000 <hi>l.</hi> to purchaſe and
build this Colledge; and for the maintenance of thoſe
Poor, he ſetled 120 <hi>l.</hi> a year for ever, and 40 <hi>l.</hi> a
year for four plentiful Dinners for the Clergy that
ſhall meet there, who are to have four <hi>Latin</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
one at the beginning of every quarter.</p>
                     <p>In this Colledge is a fair ſpacious <hi>Library</hi> built
by <hi>John Sympſon</hi> Rector of St. <hi>Olaves Hart-ſtreet,
London,</hi> and one of the ſaid Doctor <hi>White</hi>'s Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
who fitted it with Wainſcot, Stalls, Desks, Seats,
and other neceſſary and uſeful Ornaments, befitting
the place, at his own charge. This Library is well
furniſhed with choice Books of all ſorts, but chiefly
ſuch as are uſeful for Divines, and that by the bounty
of ſeveral Benefactors. This Colledge felt the Rage
of the great Fire, <hi>anno</hi> 1666. but it is very handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repaired; and the damage of the Library, which
was very great, made up, It receives increaſe every
year, by the Legacies or Gifts of worthy Perſons, and
the Piety of good Authors, who commonly beſtow
one Book of what they publiſh, eſpecially of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
that are Voluminouſly handled, upon this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
where they are Chain'd up, and kept very well;
which is a very good work, much tending to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of Learning. Here any Student may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
at ſeaſonable hours, morning and afternoon, and
may ſtudy ſix hours in a day without interruption, and
may enter himſelf a Member, if he pleaſes, paying
Half a Crown to the Library-Keeper, and Twelve-pence
to the Perſon that ſweeps and keeps it clean.
To conclude, it is extraordinary uſeful, eſpecially for
the poorer ſort of Students, who cannot purchaſe a
neceſſary ſtore of Books for their own uſe. And I
could heartily wiſh, that ſome of our learned men
who are of brave, publick, and generous minds, would
examine wherein it is deficient, and ſet on foot ſome

and Deſtructive abuſe, to ſuffer unskilful Perſons,
that know not the Nature of Diſeaſes, nor are able

Symptoms, to infer a Rational Concluſion, or make
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:32497:105"/>
a true diſcovery of Cauſes, or give probable Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticks
of the event, to take up this profeſſion,
becauſe they neither underſtand the Nature of Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
nor the proper and fit mixture of Compounds,
and conſequently cannot apply ſutable Medicaments
to the languiſhing Patient, but where (by meer
chance) they Cure one, they deſtroy hundreds, ſuch
being as great Murtherers of the Body, as ſome Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious,
Graceleſs, Heretical, and unskilful Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
to Preach the Sacred Myſteries of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,

Diſciples, and conſequently to deſtroy their
Souls; which is hinted not to caſt any diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon thoſe Honorable Functions, but only
ſuch as abuſe them, and are not fitly qualified to
practice them. And it could be wiſhed that there
were a Reformation of the abuſes in each, their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
having a direct tendency to deſtroy both Body

                     <p>Indeed the Law of <hi>England</hi> has provided, that if
one who is no Phyſitian or Chirurgeon, or is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
allowed to practice, ſhall undertake a Cure,
and the Patient die under his hand, it ſhall be <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony</hi>
in the Perſon preſuming ſo to do. And the
Law of God is as expreſly againſt the other, who
muſt give a ſtrict account to the Phyſitian of Souls,
for infecting, inſtead of Spiritually healing (as far
as inſtruments may do) his Flock. But this by

                     <p>Eccleſiaſtical Criminal Cauſes are Tried by way

firſt, When ſome one takes upon him to prove the
Crime. The ſecond, When the <hi>Church-Wardens</hi>
Preſent, and are not bound to prove, becauſe it is
preſumed they do it without Malice, and that the
Crime is Notorious. Thirdly, By Inquiſition, when by
reaſon of Common Fame, inquiry is made by the

Eſquires by the King, when they are Created;
which is now done by the Earl-Marſhal, who hath
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:32497:111"/>
a ſpecial Commiſſion for every particular Creation,
which anciently was performed by the King himſelf.
For the Creating and Crowning <hi>Garter</hi> King at
Arms, there are provided a Sword and Book,
whereon to take a Solemn Oath; then a Gilt Crown,
a Collar of SS's, a Bowl of Wine, which Bowl is the
Fee of the New Created King, alſo a Coat of Arms
of Velvet, richly Embroidered.</p>
                     <p>He is thus Created. Firſt he kneels down before
the Earl-Marſhal, and laying his hand on the Book
and Sword, another King at Arms reads the Oath;
which being taken, and the Book and Sword, the
Letters Patents of his Office are read, during which
the Earl-Marſhal pours the Wine on his head, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him the Name of <hi>Garter,</hi> then puts on him
the Coat of Arms and Collar of SS's, and the Crown
on his head.</p>
                     <p>His Oath is, To obey the Supream Head of the

of the Order, that he may Record it, and to give
Notice to the King and the Knights of the Order,
of the Death of any of that Society: To have an
exact knowledge of all the Nobility, to inſtruct
Heralds and Purſuivants in doubts concerning Arms,
and to eſchew and avoid all perſons of ill reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
to be more ready to excuſe then to blame any
Noble perſon, unleſs called by Authority to Witneſs
againſt them, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>This Officer hath a Double Sallary, that is, twice
as much as the other two Kings; he hath Fees at

Ceremonies.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Herald</hi> at Arms is Created with the like Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,

as a King at Arms is by two Kings at Arms.</p>
                     <p>They take a Solemn Oath to be true to the King,
to be ſerviceable to Gentlemen, to keep Secrets of
Knights, Eſquires, Ladies, and Gentlewomen, to
aſſiſt diſtreſſed Gentlemen and Gentlewomen, Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
and Virgins, to avoid Taverns, Dicing, and
Whore-Houſes, &amp;c. The Purſuivants at Arms are
Created likewiſe by Letters Patents, a Book, a Bowl
of Wine, and a Coat of Arms of <hi>Damask,</hi> and to
be brought in as the Heralds before the <hi>Earl-Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal</hi>
or his Deputy; to Swear Solemnly to be true
to the King, to be ſerviceable to all Chriſtians, to be
Secret and Sober, more ready to commend than to

                     <p>This College felt the fury of the great Fire, but is
ſince very beautifully re-built by the Members, and
the bountiful contribution of Honourable Perſons.
Here are always Officers waiting to ſatisfie Comers,
touching Deſcents, Pedigrees, Coats of Arms, &amp;c.
Theſe Officers are the King's Sworn Servants, of

1. The <hi>Sergeants Inns</hi> are ſo called, becauſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Judges and Serjeants at Law keep their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and Lodge there in Term-time. In theſe Inns
(or Colleges) the Students of the Common-Law
(when they are arrived to the higheſt Degree) have
Lodging and Dyet. They are called <hi>Servientes ad le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem,</hi>
Sergeants at Law. Theſe are bred two or three
years in the Univerſity, and there chiefly verſed in
<hi>Logick</hi> and <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> which are expedient for a
Lawyer, as alſo in the Theory of the <hi>Civil-Law,</hi>
and ſome knowledge in the <hi>French</hi> Tongue as well
as <hi>Latine,</hi> then the Student is admitted to be one of
the Four Inns of Court, where he is firſt called a

choſen an <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tter Barriſter;</hi> and having then ſpent
twelve years more, and performed his Exerciſes (of

ſometime after a <hi>Reader.</hi> During the Reading,
which heretofore was three Weeks and three Days,
as afore-mentioned, the Reader keeps a Conſtant
and ſumptuous Feaſting, Inviting the Chief Nobles,
Judges, Biſhops, Great Officers of the Kingdom,
and ſometimes the King himſelf, that it coſts them
ſometimes 800 <hi>l.</hi> or 1000 <hi>l.</hi> Afterwards he wears
a long Robe different from other Barriſters, and is
then in a capacity to be made a Sergeant at Law,
when his Majeſty ſhall be pleaſed to call him, which
is in this Manner.</p>
                     <p>When the Number of <hi>Sergeants</hi> is ſmall, the Lord
Chief <hi>Justice</hi> of the Common <hi>Pleas,</hi> by the advice
and conſent of the other <hi>Judges,</hi> makes choice of
ſix or eight more or leſs, of the moſt grave and
learned of the <hi>Inns of Court,</hi> and preſents their
Names to the Lord <hi>Chancellor,</hi> or Lord <hi>Keeper,</hi>
who ſends by the Kings Writ to each of them, to

Cloath-Liveries, to <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> and there in
publick take a Solemn Oath, and are Cloathed with
certain Robes and Coifs, without which they may be
ſeen no more in publick: After this, they Feaſt the
great Perſons of the Nation, in a very Magnificent
and Princely manner; give Gold Rings to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the <hi>Royal Family,</hi> the <hi>Archbiſhops, Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi>
and <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> to the value of 40 <hi>s.</hi> each Ring,
and to <hi>Earls</hi> and <hi>Biſhops</hi> Rings of 20 <hi>s.</hi> To other
Great Officers, to <hi>Barons, &amp;c.</hi> Rings of leſs value.</p>
                     <p>Out of theſe are choſen all the <hi>Judges</hi> of the <hi>King's</hi>
Bench and <hi>Common-Pleas;</hi> Wherefore all thoſe
Judges do always wear the white Linnen <hi>Coif,</hi> which
is the principal Badge of a <hi>Sergeant,</hi> and which he
has had the priviledge to wear at all times, even in
the King's preſence, and whilſt he ſpake to the King,
though antiently no Subject may be ſo much as cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped

are wanting, the <hi>King</hi> by advice of the Council
makes choice of one of thoſe <hi>Sergeants</hi> at Law to
ſupply his place, and by Letters Patents Sealed by
the Lord <hi>Chancellor,</hi> who Conſtitutes him (ſitting
in the middle of the reſt of the Judges) by a ſet
Speech, Declaring to the <hi>Serjeant</hi> that upon this
occaſion he is called to do Juſtice with Expedition
and Impartiality to His Majeſties Subjects, cauſing
the Letters Patents to be read, and then Departs;
after which the Lord <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> places the ſaid

given in our Neighbour Nations, but at preſent it
is uſual to give ſome ſome Sergeants 10 <hi>l.</hi> and ſome
20 <hi>l.</hi> and to a Barriſter half as much at the pleading
of any Conſiderable Cauſe; ſo that ſome Lawyers
gain 3000 or 4000 <hi>l.</hi> yearly in Fees, and purchaſe
great Eſtates in a few years, and are ſometimes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced

                     <p>When there was a call of Serjeants at Law, it was

to the great trouble of the New <hi>Sergeants,</hi> as well

                     <p>The two <hi>Temples</hi> near <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the dwelling of the <hi>Knights Templers,</hi> who foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the II. Theſe <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plers</hi>
took beginning about the Year 1118. Their
firſt profeſſion was for ſafeguard of <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to viſit the <hi>Sepulchre</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and increaſed
mightily. They bare Croſſes of red Cloth on their
uppermoſt Garments, to be known from others, they
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:32497:114"/>
were called <hi>Templers,</hi> or <hi>Knights</hi> of the <hi>Temple,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their firſt Manſion was near the <hi>Temple</hi> in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
granted to them by King <hi>Baldwin.</hi> Many
Noblemen afterwards in all parts of Chriſtendom
became Brethren of this Order, and built themſelves
Dwellings in every great Town, but this at <hi>London</hi>
was their chief Dwelling in <hi>England. Matthew Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
Reports, that they were firſt ſo Poor, that they had
but one Horſe to Serve two of them; but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
very Rich and Pompous afterwards, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
the Nobility, and Foreign Ambaſſadors,
and the Prince Himſelf frequently; their Seal for the
reaſon aforeſaid, was two Men riding upon one Horſe.
Many Parliaments and Great Councels have been
there kept, as appears in our Hiſtorys. In the Year
1308. all the <hi>Templers</hi> in <hi>England</hi> and all <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
were apprehended, and committed to divers
Priſons, for Hereſie and other Articles, by means of
<hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> who procured them to be
Condemned by a General Councel, whoſe Lands
were given by a Councel at <hi>Vienna, Anno</hi> 1324, to
the Knights <hi>Hoſpitallers,</hi> called the Order of St. <hi>John
of Jeruſalem,</hi> who took the Iſland of <hi>Rhodes</hi> from
the <hi>Turk,</hi> and bravely maintained it, till the time of
<hi>Solyman</hi> the Magnificent; who after a moſt ſharp
and tedious Siege of ſix Months, took it, when they
had Valorouſly kept it about 200 Years, and made
a diſmal ſlaughter in <hi>Solymans</hi> great Army conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of about 200000 Men, and 300 Gallies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe
Knights have ſince Inhabited <hi>Malta,</hi> another Iſland
in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, given them by the King
of <hi>Spain.</hi> In the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the III. this
<hi>Temple</hi> was purchaſed by the Students of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law, which is above 300 Years ago: they are
called the <hi>Inner</hi> and <hi>Middle Temple,</hi> in Relation to
<hi>Eſſex-Houſe,</hi> which was part of the Knights <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plers,</hi>
and called the <hi>Outer-Temple,</hi> becauſe Sealed

about it, but after a fair and Judicial Tryal
in open Court, the Controverſie was decided in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the <hi>City,</hi> and the <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> was adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be Conſervator of the <hi>Thames.</hi> There were

                     <p>And whereas there was a Company of Fiſhermen
called <hi>Tinckermen,</hi> that with unlawful Nets and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
devices, made an infinite deſtruction of the
young Brood, or Fry of Fiſh, to feed their Hogs;
by the ſingular care and coſt of the <hi>Lord Mayor,</hi>
and vigilance of the <hi>Citizens,</hi> they were many years

the ſaid County being ſworn to inquire of all Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
committed in any part of the River whatſoever,
within the ſaid County; The <hi>Common Sergeant</hi> of
the City (the <hi>Recorder</hi> being then abſent upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
occaſions) Delivered them a Charge to
this effect, That for as much as there had not been
any Seſſion of Conſervancy in many years paſſed
kept by any <hi>Lord Mayor of London</hi> in that place,
it was probable and evident they could not be well
informed, neither of the <hi>Lord Mayor</hi>'s Juriſdiction

there, and to inflict due puniſhments upon the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendors;

and Authority by this <hi>Act</hi> to Inquire of all Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences

                     <p>V. He proceeds to aſſert the Cities Right, to
the Conſervation of the <hi>Thames,</hi> and the Waters of
<hi>Medway,</hi> by <hi>way of Inquiſition,</hi> whereof there were
two, the one taken at <hi>Raynam</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the other at
<hi>Graveſend</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> before Sir <hi>William Cambridge</hi>
Grocer. then Lord <hi>Mayor</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> 9 <hi>Henry</hi> V.
where it was preſented, that whereas by the antient
Ordinances of <hi>London,</hi> the Meſhes of Nets ſhould
be two Inches in the fore part, and one Inch in the
hinder part, and it being found that the Offences
according to the ſaid <hi>Inquiſitions,</hi> are <hi>Contra li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertates

that the Nets ſhould be burnt, according to the
antient Cuſtom in that behalf provided.</p>
                     <p>VI. He goes on after to prove that this Right
belongs to the City by <hi>Decrees.</hi> In 8 <hi>Henry</hi> IV. the
<hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Aldermen</hi> did exhibit their humble Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
to the <hi>King</hi>'s Councel, reciting, that (time
out of mind) they had the Conſervation and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> of all Trincks,
Nets, and other Engines whatſoever, in the River of
<hi>Thames</hi> and <hi>Medway</hi> placed, and have uſed to make

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:32497:124"/>
of the matter in <hi>Camera Stellata,</hi> they were
found Guilty, and Conſtrained to ſubmit themſelves
to the Lord <hi>Mayor,</hi> and ordered to bring always
their Nets unto him, before they ſhould uſe them,
and that the <hi>Kiddles</hi> then taken ſhould be at the
diſpoſition of the Lord <hi>Mayor:</hi> ſo the Offenders
made their ſubmiſſion accordingly.</p>
                     <p>VII. He proceeds; This Right appertains to the
City of <hi>London,</hi> by <hi>Letters Patents,</hi> which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by a Grant made by <hi>Edward</hi> IV. to the Earl of
<hi>Pembroke,</hi> for ſetting up a <hi>Wear</hi> in the River of
<hi>Thames:</hi> which Grant was Revoked, and Cancelled
at the Requeſt of the Lord <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Aldermen,</hi>
upon ſhewing their <hi>Right,</hi> therefore alleaged it was
contrary to their antient Liberties. At which time
the Cities Title to the Conſervancy of the <hi>Thames</hi>
and <hi>Medway</hi> was at large ſet forth, and recited to
have been ſhewn to the Lord <hi>Chancellor,</hi> and to
the ſaid Earl and his Counſel, which accordingly was
alſo read.</p>
                     <p>VIII. He reinforceth the Right of the City by
<hi>Proclamations,</hi> whereof one was made by <hi>H.</hi> VIII.
in the 34 of His Reign, wherein it is affirmed, that
the Lord <hi>Mayor</hi> and his Predeceſſors, have had by
divers Grants of the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and by
<hi>Acts of Parliaments</hi> enjoyed always the Conſervacy
of the <hi>Thames</hi> without Impediments or Interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
By which <hi>Proclamation</hi> it was Commanded
that none ſhould reſiſt, deny, or impugne the Lord
<hi>Mayor</hi> or his <hi>Deputy</hi> in doing or executing any
thing that might conduce to the Conſervacy of the
River, and of the Fiſh and Fry within the ſame.</p>

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:32497:125"/>
upon the <hi>Thames,</hi> it then fell into Debate, to whom
the Conſervacy of the <hi>Thames</hi> did belong, which
cauſe was referred by Queen <hi>ELIZABETH</hi>'s Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of State, 1597, to the <hi>Attorney-General,</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitor,</hi>
who joyntly Certified amongſt other things,
that the Conſervancy and care of the ſaid River,
did, and ought, to belong to the City of <hi>London.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>X. By <hi>quo Warranto</hi> it was proved that the
Conſervacy of the <hi>Thames,</hi> belongs to the City: for
3 <hi>Jac.</hi> a <hi>quo Warranto</hi> was brought againſt the City
in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> to know by what Title She claimed
the Conſervacy of the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> and the
Waters of <hi>Medway;</hi> whereupon the City made Her
Title Good thereunto, by antient preſcription, and
otherwiſe: ſo Judgment was given in Her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
                     <p>XI. He goes on afterwards to confirm the Right
of the City, by <hi>Proof of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage,</hi> in regard the Lord
<hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Aldermen</hi> have time out of mind made
Ordinances, concerning the Good Government of
the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> as well for the Seaſons and
Manner of Fiſhing beneath <hi>London-bridge</hi> Eaſtward,
upon pain of certain Penalties, as appears from time
to time, from the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> III. and ſo down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                     <p>The Lord <hi>Mayor</hi> hath removed Kiddles, Wears,
Trinks, and other unlawful Engines, and reformed
the diſorders of ſuch as have offended beſides in the
River of <hi>Thames,</hi> and inflicted puniſhment upon
Offenders accordingly.</p>
                     <p>The Right of the City appears alſo by the <hi>Writs,</hi>
and <hi>Preceps</hi> under the <hi>Teſte</hi> of the Lord <hi>Mayor,</hi> to
the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> of <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Eſſex,</hi> for the Returning
of Juries before him, to inquire of Offences done in
the River. The ſame Right of the City appears alſo
by <hi>Commiſſions,</hi> whereof divers have been directed
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:32497:125"/>
to the Lord <hi>Mayor,</hi> to put in Execution the, <hi>Acts of

or done in the ſaid Waters, and to puniſh the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaquents
accordingly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laſtly,</hi> He makes good the Right and Title of

thereunto, as appears in thoſe various Conteſts She
had with the Lord <hi>Admiral</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> wherein af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
divers Debates and Diſputes, She ſtill came off
well, and made Her Title good. Which moved
King <hi>Jamts</hi> in the third Year of His Reign, to put
a Final Determination to the Buſineſs, by the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

ſaith, That <hi>ad omnem Controverſiam in hac parte

all Controverſies, as well of the preſent times, as

                     <p>I. This Office of <hi>Conſervator</hi> of ſo Noble a River,

of the ſtream, on the Banks on both ſides.</p>
                     <p>II. To preſerve the Fiſh and Fry within the ſame,
that no Fiſhermen uſe unlawful Nets or Engines, or

                     <p>III. To hinder the erection of any Weares, Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles,

Piles, or Stake., which may in any ſort hinder the
Stream, or Navigation; and to pull them up, if al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

                     <p>But for the ſtrength and ſafety of the River
againſt the Invaſion of an Enemy, by Block-Houſes,
Forts, Baſtions, or Caſtles, and the ſecuring of the
Merchant and Navigation to and fro, that Charge
belongs to the <hi>Soveraign Prince.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The former Charge, Care, and Circumſpection
belongs properly to the City of <hi>London,</hi> which is
Seated in a fit place to be watchful over her, for

Moyſture</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and its beſt Friend;
which was hinted by the Lord <hi>Mayor</hi> to King

<hi>Court</hi> with all the Records of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and the
<hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> to another place, with
further expreſſions of that kind. The Lord <hi>Mayor</hi>
calmly heard all, and at laſt Anſwered, <hi>Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
hath Power to do what You Pleaſe, and Your
City of</hi> London <hi>will obey accordingly; but She hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
Deſires, that when Your Majeſty ſhall remove

               <head type="sub">Of the Government of London.</head>
               <p>IN this Chapter we ſhall briefly Treat of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
of this Renowned City, in Three Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>Eccleſiastical</hi> Government.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Temporal</hi> or <hi>Civil</hi> Government.</p>
               <p>3. The <hi>Military Government.</hi>

                  <head>SECT. 1.</head>
                  <head type="sub">Of the Eccleſiaſtical Government.</head>
                  <p>THe Government of <hi>London,</hi> conſidering how
great and populous it is, is very admirable, and
might take up a volume in the Deſcription thereof.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Government</hi> is by a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and
I have read that in the <hi>Britains</hi> time it was an
<hi>Archbiſhops See,</hi> (of which ſee page 57. before)
but removed in the <hi>Saxons</hi> time to <hi>Canterbury</hi> for
the ſake of <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk, who firſt preached the
Goſpel to the Heathen <hi>Saxons,</hi> and lies buried there.
To the Cathedral of <hi>London</hi> belongs a <hi>Dean,</hi> a
<hi>Chapter,</hi> a <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> and 30 <hi>Prebendaries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the ſeveral Pariſhes there are placed many
learned and eminent Divines, a Rector or Vicar for
every Pariſh, who are reputed the moſt excellent
Preachers in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> inſomuch that divers
Foreigners have come hither, on purpoſe to learn
their way.</p>
                  <p>There is in every Pariſh a <hi>Vicarage,</hi> or <hi>Parſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-Houſe</hi>
for theſe Divines and their Families, with
good allowances for their Maintenance, of which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and the Union of Pariſhes, take the following ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

By an Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> made in the 19 <hi>Car.</hi> 2.
<hi>Cap.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 31. It was Enacted that the Pariſhes
to be Rebuilded within the City of <hi>London,</hi> in lieu
of thoſe which were demolliſhed by the late Dreadful
Fire, ſhould not exceed the number of 39. But in
the 22 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 11. <hi>Sect.</hi> 62. It was Enacted
that for as much as upon an exact Survey taken of
the Number of Houſes to be Rebuilded, and of
the Extent of the reſpective Pariſhes neceſſary to be
continued within the ſaid City, it doth appear that
the Pariſhes to be ſetled and continued, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh-Churches
to be rebuilded within the ſaid City
of <hi>London,</hi> in lieu of thoſe demolliſhed or conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by the ſaid late Fire, cannot conveniently by
Union, or otherwiſe, be reduced to a leſs Number
than fifty one; It was therefore further Enacted,
that the Number of Pariſhes to be ſetled, and of
Pariſh-Churches to be rebuilded within the ſaid City
of <hi>London,</hi> ſhould be Fifty One, the aforeſaid Act, or
any thing therein contained to the contrary, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
                  <p>There was alſo <hi>Anno,</hi> 22. and 23. <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 15.
An Act of Parliament for the better Settlement of
the Maintenance of the Parſons, Vicars, and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
of the ſaid Pariſhes, to prevent Controverſies
of Law that might ariſe about the alteration of Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
in the Rebuilding of the City; It was therefore
reduced to a certainty of Tythes, or a ſum of Money
in lieu of Tythes, as in the following Table may be
ſeen.</p>
                  <p>☞ Note that the firſt Seventeen Pariſhes after
mentioned, are to remain and continue as heretofore
they were: and that the reſpective Pariſh Churches
to each of the ſaid Pariſhes belonging, were to be
Rebuilded for the uſe of the ſaid Pariſhes.</p>

☞ Note likewiſe that the reſt that are joined in
Order, are the united Pariſhes, and that the firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
mentioned in each line, is the Pariſh-Church
of the Pariſhes ſo united, and that the ſum annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to each is the annual payment to be made to
the Parſon, Vicar, or Curate of the ſame, in lieu of
Tythes.</p>

                  <p>This Brief account we hope is not impertinent,
and being purſuant to our promiſe, <hi>page</hi> 27. and
for common information, we could not well omit it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Pariſh-Churches are for the moſt part Built
(or a Building) in a very ſtately and beautiful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
far excelling their former Conditior.</p>
                  <p>So much for the <hi>Etcleſiaſtical Government.</hi> I
will only add, That for the ſincere and pure Worſhip
of God, and Profeſſion of the Reformed Religion,
there is no City or place in the World can compare
with <hi>London.</hi> There being, beſides the Learned
Divines of the Eſtabliſhed Church of <hi>England,</hi> a
great Number of very Pious, Learned and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Miniſters of the Goſpel, who are called <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,</hi>
(and I wiſh ſome peeviſh perſons would
forbear Nicknames) becauſe they diſapprove ſome
things, with reſpect to Diſcipline, and ſome Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But it is my hearty
wiſh, that ſince they all agree in the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
of Religion, that there may be no claſhing or
diſunion in point of Brotherly Love and Charity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, for ſo God <hi>Commands,</hi> and the <hi>times</hi>
call for it, the <hi>common Enemy</hi> (like the <hi>Kite</hi> in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſop</hi>)
hovering for an opportunity to Devour us all:
To prevent which (next the Divine Providence)
there cannot be uſed a more certain <hi>Medium,</hi> then
for all Proteſtants to Joyn (with heart and hand) toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
againſt their combining and united Foes, of whoſe
temper they have had inſtruction enough, by Plots,
Maſſacres, Fires, and other Barbarous Actions, of
which all Proteſtants (but ſuch as are <hi>Maſqueraded</hi>)
are conv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nced by demonſtrations, as clear as any
<hi>Geometry</hi> can afford a <hi>Mathematician.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But (though I am no profeſſed <hi>Divine</hi> yet) I
have admired, why men will be ſo angry with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:32497:132"/>
for not agreeing with them in ſome Point or
Opinion in Religion, not Fundamental; that is, not
abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation: yea ſo <hi>Barbarous</hi>
and Inhumane are ſome grown, as to reproach,
diſgrace, yea, perſecute each other, becauſe one
will not be perſuaded to ſee with the others Eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Which is certainly a moſt irrational and Unchriſtian,
(if not <hi>Antichriſtian</hi>) practiſe, and I cannot but
ſuſpect ſuch a perſons Religion to be no other then
humour and fancy, acted by pride and ſpight, to
ſuch as perhaps cannot in Conſcience agree with
them.</p>
                  <p>A thing may be clear to one man, that would
fain impoſe it, but it may be doubtful to him on
whom it is impoſed, which no man can help; Muſt
he therefore be perſecuted? If the point be clear in
Scripture, what needs any new Article of Faith to
impoſe it? If only deduc'd, what one thinks clearly
deduced, another, as learned and able as he, may
think not to be ſo.</p>
                  <p>Mens underſtandings are as <hi>various</hi> as their <hi>ſpeech</hi>
or <hi>faces,</hi> and is it juſt for one man to quarrel with
another, becauſe different from him in either of
theſe, or to put him upon a Rack in order to
ſtretch him to his own Dimenſions, if not ſo tall as
he? certainly that man is <hi>defective</hi> in charity that
thinks all Diſſenters are either maliciouſly or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
blind. No man can be forced to believe; he
may be compelled to ſay this or that, but not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
it. His brains may be ſooner knockt out then
made clear, and able to ſee or perform an action
morally beyond his power. A man may as eaſily
make a man ſtark blind to read Greek, or diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
Colours, as an unbeliver to believe, for that is
God's Gift. Arguments are good inducements,
but force has no countenance in the Goſpel, much
leſs a Command, <hi>John</hi> 20. 31.—5. 39. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.
15. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 32. Force may make one blind, but
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:32497:133"/>
never to ſee clearer; it may make a Hypocrite, but
no true Convert.</p>
                  <p>The Magiſtrate is (and ought) to puniſh <hi>evil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
but not <hi>evil believers,</hi> God reſerves that to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
And man can never have a right cognizance of
evil thoughts in another, for the greateſt Profeſſor
may be the greateſt Atheiſt. Nothing is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory
to the honour of God, than for men to
think that he wants their help to defend him: Nor
can any thing more affront him, than for any one to
intrude into his Tribunal, and uſurp his Soveraignty.
<hi>Chriſt</hi> conquered his Enemies by Preaching and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.
And he that takes up Arms to preſerve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
from Perſecution, is either a ſtark Atheiſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he believes there is no ſuch Reward, as <hi>Mat.</hi>
5. 12. or a ſtark fool (or mad-man) to reject the
opportunity of gaining it.</p>
                  <p>In a word, what to me ſeems clear, (which I
humbly ſubmit to the conſideration of others) is—
1. That none ought to be perſecuted for Religion,
whoſe Principles are conſiſtent with humane Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and behave themſelves according to the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Laws of the Land quietly, and peaceably, but are
to be won by the mild ways of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>2. That if under pretence of Religion they diſturb
the common peace, or wrong any other, or be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
and unquiet, they ought to be puniſhed by
the Magiſtrate; becauſe Religion teaches no ſuch
things, but the contrary.</p>
                  <p>3. That where we agree in Fundamentals we
ſhould have mutual Chriſtian Fellowſhip, without
wrangling about Circumſtantials, and that for this
Reaſon; which to me is <hi>inſtar <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>mnium:</hi> I would ask
the ſober Reader, whether he thinks his Brother
that agrees with him in Fundamental Articles of
Faith (which I could wiſh were rightly ſtated)
and lives ſoberly, has Communion with God
or no? If he ſays No, he has no Charity, and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:32497:133"/>
his own Religion is become as ſounding braſs, or a
tinkling Symbal, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1. If he believe that he
hath Communion with God, how dares he deny him
his Communion? is he better than God? or where is
his Warrant for ſo doing?</p>
                  <p>4. That when we have done our endeavour to
convince ſuch a diſſenting or doubting perſon in a
Chriſtian way, by Scripture, we have then clear'd

Recorder,</hi> and <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> and all who had been

thereon, each one a great Gold Chain,
and Mounted on a goodly Horſe, with rich Trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings,
on their Heads Velvet Caps, in their Hands
Battle-Axes gilt; Each <hi>Alderman</hi> and the <hi>Recorder</hi>
had four Halberdiers in white Silk, or elſe Buff-Coats,
waiting on them with gilt Halberds; and the
Lord <hi>Mayor</hi> and ſixteen tall men, apparrelled in white
Sattin Doublets, Caps and Feathers, Chains of Gold,
and other Gorgeous Attire, with long gilt Halberds
following his Lordſhip at a diſtance: But next to
him he had four Footmen in white Sattin, then two
Pages cloathed in Crimſon-Velvet, and Cloath of
Gold, riding on Gallant Horſes richly furniſht, one
of them carrying the Lord <hi>Mayors</hi> Helmet, and the
other his Pole-Ax, both richly gilt and adorn'd.</p>
                     <p>Moſt of the <hi>Citizens</hi> of any Quality or Office,
were in white Sattin, or white Silk Coats, with
Chains of Gold, and ſome with rich Jewels; what
the Number of Men in Arms was, is not recorded,
but it may be gueſſed at by what follows: They
Muſtered in <hi>Mile-end-Fields,</hi> and before Nine of
the Clock in the Morning began to March, entring
at <hi>Aldgate</hi> in excellent order down to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi>
where the King and Court ſtood to view them, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
by; thence they Marched about St. <hi>James's-Park,</hi>
ſo through <hi>Holborn</hi> up to <hi>Leaden-Hall,</hi> and
there Disbanded immediately, and yet this was not
done till five of the Clock in the Evening, which
was Eight hours continual March.</p>
                     <p>At His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Return to his Government,
there were in <hi>London</hi> and the Liberties, ſix Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>Trained-Bands,</hi> and ſix Regiments of
<hi>Auxiliaries,</hi> and one Regiment of <hi>Horſe;</hi> theſe
thirteen Regiments, about ſix Weeks before his

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:32497:169"/>
then drawn out for promoting and ſecuring his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Return. Theſe twelve Regiments of Foot
were 18000 Men compleat. Eight of theſe Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
had ſeven Companies in each, and the other
four had ſix Companies in each, in all Eighty Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies.
The Regiment of Horſe of ſix Troops, and
100 in each Troop, this conſiderable Army drawn
together before the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> was Judged to be
highly uſeful for facilitating that great Work. Some
Months after the King ſent to the City a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

the Regiments were new ſettled. There were
ſix Regiments of <hi>Train-Bands,</hi> commanded by ſix
Citizens, Knights, and their Lieutenant-Colonels
were all Knights, and there were ſix Regiments of
<hi>Auxiliaries.</hi> In all theſe twelve Regiments were
20000 Men; then were liſted two Regiments of
Horſe, each conſiſting of five Troops, in all 800
Horſe; theſe were all Drawn into <hi>Hide-Park,</hi> where
His Majeſty was pleas'd to take a view of them. But
in caſe of need, it is certain that in <hi>London,</hi> and
within the Liberty, there may in few days be raiſed
400000 Men; Beſides <hi>Southwark</hi> one Regiment of
Train'd-Bands, 1500 Men; The <hi>Hamlets</hi> of the
<hi>Tower,</hi> two Regiments, in all 3000 Men; then <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born</hi>
Regiment, and <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Regiment, 2000
each, and in caſe of neceſſity they can raiſe 20000
more; that is in all 66500 Men; and in caſe of abſolute

                     <p>In the year 1636. King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt ſending
to the Lord <hi>Mayor,</hi> to make a Scrutiny what Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Papiſts and Strangers were in the City, the
Lord <hi>Mayor,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Bromfield,</hi> took occaſion
thereby to make a cenſe (or computation) of all the
people, and there were of Men, Women, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
above 700000 that lived within the Bars of
his Juriſdiction alone; and this being ſo long ago,
<hi>viz.</hi> 45 years, 'tis judged by all probable compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
that <hi>London</hi> hath more by a third part now
than at that time. Then the City of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi>
and all the Suburbs without the Lord <hi>Mayor</hi>'s
Juriſdiction, and the contiguous Buildings that joyn
with it, as an Intire piece on all ſides, contain by
all likely conjecture at leaſt as many more; ſo that
taking all together, the Number of humane Souls
may amount to above one Million and an half; this
computation was thus delivered by Mr. <hi>Howel,</hi> 24
years ago, and it is certain that the Number is vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
encreſed ſince, as may appear by the great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Buildings even within theſe few years. At
that time Mr. <hi>Howel</hi> Judged the Circumference of
the City, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be above twelve Miles, but it is
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:32497:170"/>
certain whate'er it was then, it is much more now: ſo
that upon the whole, if the Number of Inhabitants
be no more then as above, and allowing but the
tenth part able to bear Arms, the City and Suburbs
may raiſe 150000 Fighting-men, of which a third
part is enough for a Brave Army, <hi>viz.</hi> 50000 Men,
according to the Modern manner of War.</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe <hi>Train'd-Bands</hi> and <hi>Auxilliary-men,</hi>
before-mentioned, there is the <hi>Artillery Company,</hi>
which is a Nurſery of Souldiers, and hath been ſo
threeſcore and odd years. The preſent <hi>King</hi> liſted
himſelf there, when he was Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and ſo
did the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who commanded that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
But lately His <hi>Majeſty</hi> was pleaſed to honour
that Company himſelf ſo highly, as to tell them,
when they were laſt <hi>February</hi> about a New Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that <hi>he would Himself be their Leader,</hi> which
was reſented with the Univerſal Joy of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
it being indeed an extraordinary honour, to be

                     <p>So much of Government: which I ſhall ſhut with

the malicious and lying Invectives of ſome

aſperſe him in his Honour and Reputation, upon
occaſion of the late Poll in <hi>Southwark,</hi> where he
was one of the <hi>Candidates</hi> to ſerve for that <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi>
in Parliament; but the well known Worth of
that wiſe and eminent Gentleman, is above the reach
of ſuch Detractors Tongues; for while they go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to <hi>ſully</hi> his ſpotleſs Reputation, they render it
(though againſt their minds,) ſo much the more <hi>il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious;</hi>
all ſober perſons concluding that he muſt
needs be a <hi>good man,</hi> becauſe <hi>bad men</hi> hate him:
for to be praiſed by ſuch is ever eſteem'd a kind of
reproach; and ſo the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> took it, when he
exclaim'd (in ſome heat) for being praiſed by a
ſcandalous perſon. Which is but by the by, as the
impartial ſenſe of one that has not the happineſs of
perſonally knowing that worthy perſon; Yet no ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

                     <p>
                        <q>This City is indeed, (<hi>ſaith he, p.</hi> 7.) a great and
opulent City, full of People and Trade; a City emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
for the great Charters, Priviledges, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities
with which it is inveſted; Renowned for
its many Courts, and Councels, Companies and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties;
and for the good Laws therein Inſtituted
and Ordained for the better Government of the
ſeveral Ranks and Orders of men amongſt them,
whereby they are enabled to obtain, their own Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
maintain their own Peace, and purſue all the

Execution of thoſe good Laws, ſo the honour and
eſteem which this great City moſt juſtly finds from
all men, both at home and abroad, doth principally
reſult and ariſe from hence.</q>

                     <p>
                        <q>I confeſs there is another thing that doth well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
this great City, which we call State and Grandeur,
which (though it is far below, and differs in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
of wiſe men, as much from that honour which
I have before deſcribed, as my Lord Mayors Horſe,
accoutred with his richeſt furniture and trappings,
doth from that Honourable Perſon that ſits upon him
cloathed with eminency of Power and Authority)
is found nevertheleſs moſt neceſſary to attract that
Reverence from the Vulgar and Common People to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ſo Auguſt a Government; which they (giving
Judgment of things more by outward appearance,
then by intrinſick worth, and real value) would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
hardly give to the greateſt Potentates.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>To this end the City hath its ſeveral Enſigns of
Authority and Power, ſitted to all degrees of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy,
and ſhewing the place they bear in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
with a becoming Greatneſs. They have their

                     <p>

                  <p>SOme of the Advantages of this great City were

Another Advantage that <hi>London</hi> hath, is its being

with all neceſſary Proviſion from the Country,
at eaſie and indifferent Rates, and the Manufactures

in theſe days: but in Proceſs of time, Men
finding it too difficult and troubleſom to carry about
them, all things thus Bargained and Truckt for, from
place to place, invented a common <hi>Standard,</hi> or Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
that ſhould countervail, and be in Value as all
other things, and be Accounted in Payments, Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
and Equivalency to all others: and this is
called <hi>Money,</hi> of <hi>Gold Silver,</hi> or other <hi>Mettals.</hi> This
Uſe of Money is as old as <hi>Abraham,</hi> but it was not
then Coyned, but only in Pieces Unſtampt; and ſince
by Authority of <hi>Princes,</hi> it was divided into great
and ſmall Pieces, and into ſeveral and Diſtinct parts
and Denominations, and Stampt or Coyned with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Characters, denoting the true Weight and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of the ſame. This was done firſt by <hi>Servius</hi> in

this Facilitates Merchandizing, and to prevent
the Inconvenience and Danger of the Carriage of

and that was:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, Exchanging,</hi> which is the giving of ſo

it to be again repay'd in another place by another

they alſo Glazed the Windows thereof, and

Foundation of the <hi>Mayors</hi> Court was laid 3. <hi>H.</hi> 6.
and of the Porch on the South-ſide of the Court;
Then were built the Lord <hi>Mayors</hi> Chamber, the

to the Communion-Table, where are two Baſons,
and every one offers ſomething to the Relief of the
Poor, and towards the Charges of the Day. After
they have all paſt, the Deputy, the Merchants,
their Wives, Children, and Servants, do all come in
Order from their Seats, and beſtow their Offerings

certainly informed, that the very charges of their

who am no intereſſed Perſon, will be reſented Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly,
and Examined, as to the Argumentative part,
according to the Solidity and Strength of the Reaſons
produced.</p>
                     <p>I have heard this Undertaking diſparaged by ſome
Cenſorious Perſons, and have examined the Reaſons,
with the quality of the Objectors, and have found it
all along oppoſed by none but the Ignorant, or ſuch
as preferred ſome particular Ends, before Publick
Utility. To my knowledge I never ſaw nor correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponded
directly nor indirectly with any of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers,
till being very deſirous to inſert this Affair
of the <hi>Penny-Post</hi> in this Book for Publick Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
I made an Addreſs to one of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
concern'd, who Courteouſly ſupply'd me with
ſome particular Informations which I wanted, and for
which I am beholding to him. This I ſpeak, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the Objectors that I do voluntarily, and not by
any inducement of theirs mention this Affair, which,
in my opinion, is ſo far from being a prejudice, that
the City, as well as the whole Nation, is beholding to
them for their Ingenious Contrivance, and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
and Generoſity in minding the Publick Good
ſo much as they have done; for 'tis certain that they
have been at very great Expence to hold it up, under
the Diſcouragements that ſome Perſons have thrown
upon them, and the neceſſary Charge to ſupport it is
yet very conſiderable. But to be more particular:</p>
                     <p>1. I will give ſome Hints of what this Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
is in Point of Practice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="351" facs="tcp:32497:199"/>
2. Its general and particular Uſefulneſs.</p>
                     <p>3. I will conſider an Objection or two.</p>
                     <p>1. What I can ſay of this Undertaking in Point
of Practice, is briefly what follows, only I would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
a few words as my opinion, and the opinion of
impartial Perſons of my acquaintance, as to the thing
in general.</p>
                     <p>This uſeful Invention is little more than a year old,
being begun in <hi>April</hi> 1680. The chief Undertaker
that introduc'd it into Practice, is one Mr. <hi>William
Dockwra</hi> Merchant, a Native and Citizen of <hi>London,</hi>
formerly one of His Majeſties <hi>Sub-Searchers</hi> in the
Cuſtom-Houſe of <hi>London,</hi> as in the Liſt of thoſe
Officers appears. A Perſon, whoſe approved Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
for Induſtry and Fidelity was well known to all
for above ten years in that Office: And to whom
the Publick is obliged, he having, with his Partners,
ſpent much time, and a great Sum of money, to bring
this Undertaking on foot, wherein they encounter'd
with no ſmall Difficulties, not only by <hi>Affronts</hi> and
<hi>Indignities</hi> from the <hi>Vulgar</hi> ſort, who ſeldom weigh
any Publick or Generous Deſigns, but at the <hi>Beam</hi>
of Little, Selfiſh, By-Ends, but alſo by more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Attaques; for there have been Attempts made,
by ſome Perſons, to perſuade his Royal Highneſs the
Duke of <hi>York,</hi> that it intrench'd upon the <hi>General
Poſt-Office,</hi> and damnifi'd it; whereupon many
Actions were brought, and a chargeable Suit of Law
follow'd: But, queſtionleſs, the Duke is better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
now; for it is moſt certain, that this does much
further the Revenue of the <hi>Grand Poſt-Office,</hi> and
is an univerſal Benefit to all the Inhabitants of theſe
Parts: ſo that whoever goes about to deprive the
City of ſo uſeful a thing, deſerves no thanks from the
Duke, nor any Body elſe, but to be Noted as an <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to Publick and Ingenious Inventions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is with all Humility ſubmitted to the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:32497:200"/>
of all worthy Citizens that happen to peruſe this
ſmall Tract, that it becomes not the Honour of the
City to ſuffer any of its <hi>Ingenious Natives,</hi> eſpecially
Perſons who have lived and do live in good <hi>Faſhion</hi>
and <hi>Repute,</hi> to ſink under the carrying on of an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
ſo advantageous not only to the Publick,
but alſo to private Perſons, ſince their induſtrious
Service to their Generation deſerves encouragement
from their Fellow-Citizens, and all others, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(1.) To diſcountenance petty Perſons that would,
for the profit of running of Errands, rob the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
(if they could) of this more than ordinary
convenience for ſafe, cheap, and neceſſary Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches.</p>
                     <p>(2.) To reject any INTRUDER that may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to ſet up another <hi>Penny-Post;</hi> becauſe, if the
thing be hereafter profitable, all the Reaſon and
Equity in the world will plead for the Inventers, <hi>viz.</hi>
that they ought to reap the Benefit. And it is a
Note of Conſideration, That Mr. <hi>Dockwra</hi> has a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Family of eight young Children; who being
forſaken by ſome others ſoon after it began, and left
to ſhift for himſelf, carried on this Undertaking ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for above half a year at his own proper charge
and hazard, againſt all the Difficulties, Oppoſitions
and Diſcouragements that attended it, though now
he hath ſeveral Citizens in partnerſhip with him. But
I am truly informed, that the Income does not yet
amount to three fourths of the neceſſary Charge to
ſupport it; therefore I am perſuaded that this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
City will employ the <hi>Inventers,</hi> rather than
an <hi>Invader,</hi> if ever any ſuch ſhould be; And that 'tis
much below ſuch a Prince as his Royal Highneſs is, to
deſire the Ruine of ſuch a Family.</p>
                     <p>I am the more large upon this Particular, becauſe
it would be a general Diſcouragement to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers
of uſeful and profitable Inventions, if others
ſhould be encouraged to reap the Crop of what they
with ſo much charge and labor have ſown.</p>

at equal diſtances, for the better maintenance of
mutual Correſpondence.</p>
                     <p>There are about 4 or 500 Receiving-houſes to take
in Letters, where the Meſſengers call every hour, and
convey them as directed; as alſo Poſt-Letters, the

being carefully convey'd by them to the
General Poſt-Office in <hi>Lombard ſtreet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are a great Number of Clerks and poor
Citizens daily employed, as Meſſengers, to Collect,
Sort, Enter, Stamp and Deliver all Letters, every
Perſon entertained giving Fifty pounds ſecurity, by
Bond, for his Fidelity; and is to be ſubject to the
Rules and Orders, from time to time, given by the
Undertakers, who oblige themſelves to make good
any thing deliver'd to their Meſſengers under the
value of Ten pounds, if Sealed up, and the Contents
Endorſed; And theſe Meſſengers have their Wages

                     <p>By theſe are convey'd Letters and Parcels, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding

                     <p>They now do uſe <hi>Stamps</hi> to mark the hour of the
Day on all Letters when ſent out from their Office to
be deliver'd, by which all Perſons are to expect their
Letters within one hour, (little more or leſs, from
the time marked thereon, excepting ſuch Letters as
are to be convey'd to the Out-Towns, and Remoteſt
parts, which will be longer) by which the cauſe of
delay of Letters may be eaſily diſcern'd, <hi>viz.</hi> whether
it be really in the Office, or their own Servants, (or

                     <p>The Marks they make uſe of for this purpoſe, are
theſe:

                     <p>All Perſons are deſired not to leave any Town-Letters
after Six of the Clock in the Winter, and
Seven in the Summer on Saturday Nights, becauſe the
many poor Men employ'd, may have a little time to

                     <p>Upon three days at <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> two days in <hi>Eaſter</hi>

To the moſt Remote places Letters go four or
five times of the day, to other places ſix or eight
times of the day. To Inns of Court, and places of
buſineſs in Town, eſpecially in Term or Parliament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
10 or 12 times of the day. For better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of People where the Receiving-houſes are,
there are great Numbers of Printed Tickets diſperſed
from time to time amongſt the Neighborhood, and
Advertiſements in the Publick Intelligences, which
all concern'd may take Notice of, ſo that any body
may be by the Neighborhood immediately inform'd
where a Receiving-houſe is. Carriers and Stage-Coach
Letters are to have Two-pence incloſed to
each Carrier or Coachman, becauſe they often reject
them for want of money; Hundreds of ſuch being
return'd, which any Inquirer may have again upon
notice, for they lie Alphabetically diſpoſed of in the
chief Office for that end.</p>
                     <p>On all Poſt-Nights due Care is taken to call for,
and convey to the General Poſt-houſe in <hi>Lombard-ſtreet</hi>
all Poſt-Letters, whether Foreign or Inland, left
in any of the <hi>Penny-Post</hi> Receiving-houſes, at or
before Nine of the Clock at Night. And I could
wiſh, for Encouragement of the Undertakers, that
all Perſons would ſo far contribute to the continuance
of this uſeful Deſign, as to ſend their Poſt-Letters
by this Conveyance to the Poſt-Office in <hi>Lombard-ſtreet,</hi>
which they do not Convey by themſelves, or
Servants.</p>
                     <p>If any Poſt-Letters be left without Money that
ſhould pay before-hand, they will be Returned to the
Office, therefore ſuch as ſend Money, are to indorſe
the Poſtage-money upon their Letters.</p>
                     <p>Such as incloſe Money in Town-Letters, are to
Indorſe the true Sum on the Outſide, and to tye faſt
and ſeal up, under a plain Impreſſion, all Parcels,
which may be one way to prevent Diſputes, in caſe
any thing be loſt. The Undertakers will not anſwer

                     <head>2. Some brief Hints of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs of this
Office.</head>
                     <p>1. In and near this great and famous <hi>Empori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
is the uſual Reſidence of our Kings, the High
Court of Parliament, the fixed Seats of all the Courts
of Judicature, and in it is managed a vaſt Trade, as
was ſhew'd in the <hi>Chapter</hi> that Treats of it; now a
cheap, frequent, and ſafe way of Correſpondence, is
very advantageous for all that are concerned in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
or Buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>The principal Trade of <hi>London</hi> depends upon
Navigation, and therefore the City and Suburbs are
ſituate along the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> extending in

                        </gap>ces,
that is ſeven Miles and an half; and from the end of
<hi>Blackman-ſtreet,</hi> to the end of <hi>St. Leonard Shore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditch,</hi>
2500 Paces in Breadth, that is two Miles; and
the whole Circumference (as by Demonſtration can
be made apparent) is above 20 Miles, taking in all
the Contiguous Suburbs and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> ſo that it
is the longeſt, if not the greateſt and moſt populous
City in <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> This extraordinary Length,
though it adds to its Splendor and Beauty, yet it
renders ſpeedy Communication and Intercourſe in
Buſineſs very uneaſie, and much more troubleſom,
than in ſuch great Cities as <hi>Paris,</hi> which is almoſt of
an orbicular Form. Now to keep up a neceſſary
Correſpondence, the way formerly uſed, was to hire
<hi>Porters</hi> at Exceſſive Rates to go on Errands, and to
ſend Servants or Apprentices, who, in the mean while,
loſt that time that ſhould be ſpent to learn their
Trades, and benefit their Maſters, and would often
loyter, and get vicious habits, and evil company, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        <pb n="357" facs="tcp:32497:202"/>
(when they need not) to their own and Maſters
hurt; or elſe ſuch as could not ſpare the Porter ſo
much money, nor kept Servants, (as ſome poor Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers

by the <hi>Penny-Post</hi> with great Safety and Celerity,
for which the Contrivers really deſerve the Thanks of
all who reap benefit by it; and I may be bold to ſay,
that all the Inhabitants in general, and their Fellow-Citizens
in particular, are already very ſenſible of the

with their Cuſtomers, or ſuch as deal with them;
Clients may conſult with Lawyers; Patients with
Doctors; Poor Priſoners with Creditors, or Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors;
and all Bills diſperſed for Publication of any

more, for <hi>One Penny.</hi>

                     <p>1. From ſome ſort of <hi>Porters,</hi> viz. that it hinders

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> (1.) 'Tis certain that this is a miſtake, for
their Livelihood never depended upon going on Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands,
their Buſineſs being other laborious Work, and
carrying of Burdens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But ſome of the Free-Porters
are now in the ſervice of the Undertaking.</p>
                     <p>(2.) Moſt Buſineſs diſpatcht by this Undertaking,
was formerly either not done at all, or performed by
other hands, to ſave Charges, (Porters Rates being ſo
dear) and Perſons themſelves, or their Servants, went
on their own Errands.</p>

(3.) If the Porters, who are an inconſiderable

by it, yet vaſt Numbers of poor People, and
others, are exceedingly eaſed and beenfited thereby,
which deſerve as much, or more pity, than Porters:
And a general and uſeful Undertaking, ſhould not
in Equity or Prudence be diſcountenanced, for the
peculiar advantage of ſome few, any more than all
the Pipes or Water-Conduits of the City ſhould be
deſtroyed, meerly for the Accommodation of Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard-Bearers;

to monopolize to themſelves the Delivery of Letters,
it being by Law free for any Perſon to uſe what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance
they think good for their Letters, within or
without the Freedom. And Coach-men, Car-men,
Watermen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may as well be put out of their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
as the Undertakers diſturb'd in this Concern,
becauſe then the Porters may have more Burdens to
carry. Neither is any prohibited or reſtrained by
this Undertaking, but they may ſtill employ a Porter
if they pleaſe, ſo that this Objection is cauſleſs, and

&amp;c.</hi> Which in Engliſh is to this ſence: The <hi>Dane</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
grown more fierce by the ſucceſs of his Affairs,
reſolved to make his Approaches to <hi>London,</hi> where he
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:32497:230"/>
underſtood that <hi>Ethelred</hi> had retired; having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
prepared all things neceſſary for his Expedition, he
proceeds to beleaguer the City, and begirt it round; by
this perillous Attempt either to terrifie the Enemy, or
try their Strength and Courage: On the other ſide, the
Citizens, although ſomewhat fearing the effect of ſo
great a Storm, yet conſidering that upon their caſe
depended the General Fate of their Countrey, and that
this was the Principal City, defended themſelves brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
ſome ſally out, and others annoy the Beſiegers from
the Walls, every one in all places ſtriving to excel
others in Bravery of Courage, and Gallantry of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
At laſt, though the <hi>Danes</hi> gave many ſtout and
ſharp Aſſaults, yet the Valiant <hi>Londoners</hi> in Defence
of their King, notwithſtanding the peril of ſuch an
Enterprize, gather into a Body, and ſet open the Gates,
and ran upon the Enemy with great Fury and Courage.
But the <hi>Dane,</hi> whilſt he encourages his men, and was
ſtriving to compleat the Victory, which he thought he
was almoſt in poſſeſſion of, is incompaſſed and beſet on
all ſides, and his men ſlain in great numbers, yet he
breaks out through his Enemies Weapons, and with the
reſidue of his before huge, but now Routed Army,
(marching night and day) arrives at <hi>Bath</hi> in two days
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> So far he. This happened almoſt ſixty years?
before the Conqueſt, in the days of <hi>Ethelred,</hi> King
<hi>Sweyne</hi> being then King of <hi>Denmark.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After the death of this <hi>Sweyne,</hi> his Son <hi>Canutus,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
King of <hi>England,</hi> beſieged <hi>London</hi> both by
Land and Water, but after much dangerous labour,
judging it impregnable by the obſtinate Valour of the
Defendants, he departed, but returned with greater
Forces the ſame year, and beſieged the City again; but
the Citizens behaved themſelves ſo gallantly, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
ſo many of his Souldiers, that he was forced to
betake himſelf to a ſhameful flight.</p>
                     <p>In the diſſention between King <hi>Edward</hi> the Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor,
and his Father-in-law Earl <hi>Godwyn,</hi> (which was
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:32497:230"/>
the mightieſt Subject within this Realm) the Earl with
great Army came to <hi>London,</hi> yet was by the Citizens
reſiſted, till by means of the Nobility they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled.</p>
                     <p>Seventy years after the Conqueſt, <hi>Maud</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
made War upon King <hi>Stephen</hi> for the Right of
the Crown, and had taken his Perſon Priſoner, but by
the Strength of the <hi>Londoners</hi> and <hi>Kentiſh-men,</hi> ſhe
was routed at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and her Brother <hi>Robert</hi> Earl
of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> was taken, in exchange for whom King
<hi>Stephen</hi> was delivered.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1383, (but <hi>Polidore Virgil</hi> ſays <hi>Anno</hi>
1581.) about 4 <hi>R.</hi> II. and 298 years ago, there fell out
an Accident which created much diſturbance in the
Kingdom, and particularly in <hi>London,</hi> occaſioned (as
I find Recorded in ſeveral Chronicles) through the
Rudeneſs of a <hi>Poll-money Collector,</hi> who coming into
the houſe of one <hi>John Tyler</hi> at <hi>Deptford</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of his Wife Poll-money for her Husband, her
Self, their Servants, and Daughter; the Woman al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
that the Daughter was not of Age to pay:
The rude Fellow ſaid he would try that, and by force
immodeſtly turns up her Coats, (having in ſeveral
places, as was reported, uſed the ſame trial) the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
makes an Out-cry, and Neighbours run in; her
Husband being at work hard by, and hearing the noiſe,
comes in with his Lathing-Staff in his hand (for he
was a <hi>Tyler</hi>) with which (after he had reaſoned a
while with the Collector, who gave him provoking
Language, and ſtrook at him) he knock'd his Brains
out; and making his Appeal to the People, who were
apt to receive any occaſion of Tumult, he ſo incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
them, with the help of a Factious Clergy-man,
one <hi>John Ball,</hi> that the Commons from divers parts
drew together; and whether beginning in <hi>Kent</hi> or
<hi>Eſſex,</hi> they drew into their Faction the Commons of
<hi>Suſſex, Hertfordſhire, Cambridgeſhire, Suffolk, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi>
and other <hi>Shires,</hi> and apprehending all Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:32497:231"/>
made them ſwear to be true to K. <hi>Richard,</hi> and
never to receive any King that ſhould be called <hi>John,</hi>
which they did, for the Envy they bore to <hi>John</hi> Duke
of <hi>Lancaſter.</hi> Thus their Number ſtill increaſed, that
by that time they were come ſo far as <hi>Black-Heath,</hi>
they were eſteemed to be One hundred thouſand.
They took upon them to cut off the Heads of all
that profeſſed the Law, Juſtices of the Peace, the
Countrey Jarors, and any perſon that they thought
to be learned; eſpecially if they found any to have
Pen and Ink, they pull'd off his Hood, and with one
voice cry'd, <hi>Hale him out, and cut off his Head;</hi> and
it was immediately done.</p>
                     <p>They reſolved to burn all <hi>Court-Rolls</hi> and <hi>Records,</hi>
with all old <hi>Monuments.</hi> Their Chaplain, <hi>John Ball,</hi>
a wicked Prieſt, adviſed them to deſtroy all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and Clergy, ſo that there ſhould be no Biſhop
in <hi>England</hi> but one Archbiſhop, which ſhould be
himſelf; and that there ſhould not be above two Religious
perſons in one houſe, but that their Poſſeſſions
ſhould be divided among the Laity, for which Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
they held him as a Prophet. The King was at
this time at <hi>Windſor,</hi> but removed, in all haſte to the
<hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> to whom repaired the Archbiſhop
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> Chancellor, the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> the
Prior of <hi>St. John</hi> Treaſurer, the Earls of <hi>Buckingham,
Kent, Arundel, Warwick, Suffolk, Oxford,</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury,</hi>
and others of the Nobility and Gentlemen, to
the number of 600. The Commons of <hi>Eſſex</hi> came
on the other part of the River <hi>Thames.</hi> From <hi>Black-Heath</hi>
the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Rebels came to <hi>Southwark,</hi> and
broke open the Priſons of the <hi>Marſhalſea,</hi> and the
<hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> with other Priſons, and let out the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.
The <hi>Eſſex</hi> Rebels ſpoiled the Archbiſhop's
houſe at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and burnt all the Goods, with the
Books, Regiſters, and Remembrances of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,
with ſeveral other Outrages. Then they came
to <hi>London</hi> over the Bridge, and ſent for one <hi>Richard
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:32497:231"/>
Lyon</hi> a grave Citizen, who had been <hi>Tyler</hi>'s Maſter,
and ſtruck off his Head, carrying it upon a Pole in
Triumph before them. The next day they came to
the <hi>Savoy,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi>'s Houſe, which they
ſet on Fire, burning all the rich Furniture, breaking
in pieces Plate and Jewels, to an extraordinary value,
and then throwing them into the <hi>Thames,</hi> ſaying,
<hi>They were men of Juſtice, and would not, like Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
enrich themſelves with any mans Goods.</hi> And
when one of their Fellows was ſeen to convey a fair
piece of Plate into his boſom, they took him, and
threw him and that into the Fire. Thirty two of
them were got into the Dukes Wine-Cellar, where
they ſtay'd Drinking ſo long that they were not able
to come out in time, but were ſhut in with Wood
and Stones that immur'd up the Door; they were
heard to cry ſeven days after, and then periſhed.</p>
                     <p>From the <hi>Savoy</hi> they went to the <hi>Temple,</hi> where
they burnt the Lawyers Lodgings, with their Books
and Writings and all they could lay hands on. They
broke up the <hi>Fleet</hi> Priſon, and let the Priſoners go
where they would. The like they did at <hi>Newgate;</hi>
and made a moſt dreadful havock up and down.
The houſe of <hi>St. Johns</hi> by <hi>Smithfield</hi> they ſet on fire,
ſo that it burnt ſeven days together.</p>
                     <p>After this they came to the <hi>Tower,</hi> where the King
was then lodged: And though he had, at that time,
600 armed Men, and 600 Archers about him, yet he
durſt not but ſuffer them to enter, where they abuſed
the King's Mother in a rude manner, offering to kiſs
her, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that ſhe fell into a Swoon. And finding in
the place <hi>Simon Theobald</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>
and Lord Chancellor, and Sir <hi>Robert Hale</hi> Prior of
<hi>St. John</hi> and Lord Treaſurer, and one <hi>Richard</hi> a <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melite</hi>
Monk the King's Confeſſor, theſe they led to
<hi>Tower-hill,</hi> and there moſt cruelly cut off their heads,
as they ſerved divers others.</p>
                     <p>Indeed <hi>Polidore Virgil</hi> writes, That the Rebels
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:32497:232"/>
were not at all in the <hi>Tower,</hi> but that the King ſent
theſe three men to appeaſe them, hoping that they
would not offer to abuſe ſuch eminent Clergy-men:
For (ſaith he) <hi>Si vulgus it a concitatus turrem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnaſſet,
non eos utique tres duntaxat, uti credere
par est, ſed &amp; Regem &amp; relquos ommes, quos impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis
ad ſupplicium petebat, interfeciſſet;</hi> that is, If
the enraged Common People had taken the <hi>Tower</hi>
by force, they would, in all probability, deſtroy not
only thoſe three, but the King alſo, and all the reſt,
whom firſt of all they demanded to be deliver'd to
them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>or puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>They drew Thirteen <hi>Flemings</hi> out of <hi>Auſtin-Fryers,</hi>
and Beheaded them in the Streets. Seventeen
more out of another Church. And Thirty two out
of the <hi>Vintry,</hi> and ſeveral out of their own, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
whom they Beheaded; yet after all theſe bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
and bloody Outrages, the King proclaimed
Pardon to all ſuch as would lay down Arms, and go
quietly home; which the <hi>Eſſex</hi> men did, but the
<hi>Kentiſh</hi> men continued ſtill with their Captain <hi>Wat-Tyler</hi>
of <hi>Maidſtone,</hi> a crafty Fellow, of an acute wit,
but very graceleſs; Polidore Virgil ſays, He was
<hi>Manibus promptus, ac Conſiliis praeceps,</hi> of a ready
hand, and haſty or precipitate in counſel. To this
Ringleader of Miſchief, the King ſent Sir <hi>John
Newton,</hi> to underſtand what his meaning was; <hi>Wat
Tyler</hi> was offended, becauſe he came on Horſe-back,
telling him, <hi>It became him to alight from his Horſe
in his preſence,</hi> and therewith drew out his Dagger to
ſtrike him. The King perceiving this Noble Knight
to be in danger, to qualifie the ſeverity of <hi>Wat</hi> for
a time, commanded Sir <hi>John</hi> to alight, which did not
pacifie, but made <hi>Wat</hi> the more inſolent, and would
have the King's Sword, which Sir <hi>John</hi> carried, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
again to aſſault him. But the Lord Mayor of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
William Walworth,</hi> with other Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
being juſt come, affirm'd it to be an unheard-of
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:32497:232"/>
Indignity, and a moſt intolerable Diſgrace, if the
King ſhould ſuffer ſo Noble a Knight to be baſely
murdered in his preſence. Upon which the King
commanded the Lord Mayor to arreſt him, who did
it to purpoſe; for being a man of an invincible
Courage, and a brave Mind, he regarded not the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
that probably would follow, his attacking that
Darling, and Leader of a Rude, Numerous, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
Rabble, but prefer'd his Duty to his King and
Countrey, and the Generoſity of reſcuing an abuſed
Gentleman, even before life. I inſert this, as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
due to this brave and memorable Action, which
deſerves never to be forgotten.</p>
                     <p>The Mayor immediately rides up to <hi>Wat,</hi> and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts
him with ſuch a ſalutation of his Mace on his
head, that he tumbles him down, and then he was by
ſome of the King's Servants (ſome ſay, by <hi>John Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendiſh</hi>
                        <abbr>Eſq</abbr>) run through in ſeveral places, many
perſons encompaſſing him, ſo as that he could not be
ſeen by his <hi>Plebeian</hi> Army, and then caus'd his dead
Body to be drawn into <hi>St. Bartholomews Hoſpital.</hi>
But the Commons perceiving it, they cry'd, <hi>Their
Captain was ſlain,</hi> and animated each other to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge:
Upon which the King, though not above 15
years of age, was ſo Couragious as to ride up to them,
telling them, <hi>That now their</hi> Leader <hi>was dead, he
would be their</hi> Leader himſelf; <hi>and if they would
follow him into the Fields, they ſhould have whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they deſired.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the mean time the Lord Mayor, <hi>Walworth,</hi> with
one Servant, Rides ſpeedily into the City, and raiſed
One thouſand armed Men, where meeting Sir <hi>Robert
Knolls,</hi> a Citizen, by accident, got him to be their
Leader, who coming into the Field where the Rebels
were, ſo daunted them, that throwing down their
weapons, they cry'd for mercy: ſo that it was a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
thing to ſee how ſuddenly Fear overtook Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
and how quickly terms of the moſt ſervile
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:32497:233"/>
Submiſſion, ſucceeded their inſolent Brags, <hi>viz. That
they had the King's life in their power,</hi> &amp;c. and
what elſe they would do.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide 'twas as ſtrange, to ſee how
quickly Boldneſs ſurprized Fear in thoſe about the
King; for a little before, they trembled at the ſight
of the Rebels, but now they are mad to be at them,
which the King would not ſuffer, but commanded
the <hi>Charter</hi> they had demanded to be ſcaled, and
delivered to them, becauſe theſe Commotions might
have the ſpeedier End, for the Commons in other
places, were not yet quiet, and the King thought it
more prudent rather to pacifie, than provoke them.
The Rabble being diſperſed, the King called for the
Mayor, and Knighted him in the Field, as alſo five
Aldermen his Brethren, <hi>viz. Nicholas Brember, John
Philpot, Robert Lawnd, John Standiſh, Nicholas Twy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
and <hi>Adam Francis.</hi> Some affirm, that the <hi>Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
was added to the City Arms for this Reaſon, but
Antiquaries make out, that this Coat, with the Sword
of <hi>St. Paul</hi> (not a Dagger) belonged to the City
long before this hapned.</p>
                     <p>The Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> after this, ſate in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon Offenders, where many were found Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and were Executed; amongſt others, <hi>Jack Straw,
John Kirby, Alane Tredder,</hi> and <hi>John Sterling,</hi> who
gloried that he ſlew the Archbiſhop. Sir <hi>Robert
Treſilian,</hi> the Chief Juſtice, was appointed to ſit in
Judgment againſt the Offenders, before whom above
1500 were found Guilty, and in ſeveral places put to
Death, amongſt whom was <hi>John Ball</hi> the Prieſt, their
Incendiary. And thus ended that dangerous Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</p>
                     <p>About the Year 1450. 29 <hi>H.</hi> 6. there was another
Inſurrection in <hi>Kent,</hi> headed by one <hi>Jack Cade,</hi> who
ſtiled himſelf <hi>John Mortimer,</hi> Captain <hi>Mend-all.</hi> He
marches with a ſmall, but well-order'd Number to
<hi>Black-Heath,</hi> where he lay about a Month, exerciſing
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:32497:233"/>
his Men, and in the mean time preſents ſeveral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
to the King and Parliament of various Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
and Oppreſſions, but they were judged too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent,
and therefore rejected. The Privy Council
ſollicit the King to ſuppreſs this Rebellion by force
of Arms, who thereupon draws his Army to <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi>
and appointed divers Lords to aſſail the Rebels;
but the Lords could get no Followers to fight againſt
them, who ſought only for reformation of Abuſes,
and for puniſhment of ſuch Traytors as the Lord
<hi>Say,</hi> the King's Chamberlain was. Whereupon the
Lord <hi>Say</hi> was committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> the King
and Queen retire to <hi>London,</hi> from thence, within two
days, the King (being now 15000 ſtrong) marches
in perſon towards Captain <hi>Mend-all,</hi> who, politick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
withdraws his Forces to <hi>Sevenoke-wood:</hi> Upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
whereof, the King retireth again to <hi>London,</hi> but
the Queen, longing for diſpatch, ſends the two <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords,</hi>
Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> and <hi>William,</hi> with many <hi>Hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpurs</hi>
in the Court, to follow the Rebels, who were
ſoon cooled; for they found Captain <hi>Mend-all</hi> in
good order ready to receive them, and in the firſt
Encounter ſlew Sir <hi>Humphrey,</hi> and afterwards his
Brother, with many others, and put all the reſt to
flight.</p>
                     <p>The King's Forces being at <hi>Black-Heath,</hi> could
neither by Threats not Intreaties be gotten to reſcue
them, but rather wiſhed the Queen and her Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
in the <hi>Staffords</hi> Caſe, or that the Duke of <hi>York</hi>
were in <hi>England</hi> to aid his Couſin <hi>Mortimer,</hi> (now

                     <p>Then was the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and the
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:32497:234"/>
Dake of <hi>Buckingham</hi> ſent to expoſtulate with the
Rebels about their Demands; to whom <hi>Jack Cade</hi>
gave very good language, but ſaid directly, <hi>That he
would yield to no Ceſſation of Arms, unleſs the King
in perſon would hear the Grievances of his Subjects,
and paſs his Princely Word for the Reformation of
their Wrongs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Reſolution of his being made known to the
King, who had no aſſurance of his own Soldiers,
made him march preſently to <hi>Killingworth</hi> Caſtle
in <hi>Warwickshire,</hi> which he fortified. <hi>Cade</hi> marches
to <hi>Southwark,</hi> commanding his men to commit no
Outrage, and not to wrong any perſon, which they
obey'd.</p>
                     <p>The next morning he marches to <hi>London-bridge,</hi>
and ſo into the City by <hi>London-ſtone,</hi> where he ſtruck
his Sword, ſaying, <hi>Now is</hi> Mortimer <hi>Lord of</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.
He then commands all <hi>Lombards, Merchant-Strangers,
Genoeſes, Venetians, Florentines,</hi> and others,
to ſend him 12 Harneſſes complete, 24 Brigandines,
12 Battle-Axes, 12 Glaves, ſix Horſes completely fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with Saddles and Bridles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 1000
Marks ready money, or he would cut off the Heads
of as many of them as he could catch: All which
was immediately ſent him.</p>
                     <p>The next day he cauſes the Lord <hi>Say</hi>'s Head to be
cut off in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> as alſo his Son-in-laws, Sir <hi>James
Cromer,</hi> High-Sheriff of <hi>Kent,</hi> uext day he cauſes
ſome of his Fellows to be Executed for ſome Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
againſt his Proclamation, fined Perſons at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and beheaded others. But the Citizens finding
his Inſolency to increaſe intolerably, with a ſelect
Party encounter them on the Bridge, through whom
<hi>Cade</hi> ſorced his paſſage, and fired ſeveral Houſes. In
this Bickering ſeveral perſons were ſlain, and in a
little time the Citizens, by the aid of freſh Supplies,
recover'd the Bridge again, and drove the Rebels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
a place, then called the <hi>Stoop</hi> in <hi>Southwark
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:32497:234"/>
Cade</hi> ſet all Priſoners in the Priſons there at Liberty,
as well Felons as Debtors. But the generality of
the Rebels grew weary, ſo that upon notice of the
King's Proclamation, and aſſurance of Pardon, they
dropt away to their ſeveral Habitations. <hi>Cade</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
attempting to raiſe New Troubles, was (becauſe
he reſiſted when he was to be apprehended) kill'd
by one Mr. <hi>Alexander Eden,</hi> a <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Gentleman,
his Body was brought to <hi>London,</hi> where he was quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,

were Executed.</p>
                     <p>The Story of <hi>Evil-May-Day,</hi> Anno 1517, 9 <hi>H.</hi> 8.
is ſo remarkable, that old men, formerly, were wont
to reckon their Age from that day. The occaſion
was briefly thus. Several Artificers of Foreign Parts
repaired to <hi>London,</hi> which diſguſted the multitude,
who complaiued, That their Selling of Wares, and
Exerciſing of Handicrafts, impoveriſhed the Kings
own Subjects, and were born out of <hi>England,</hi> and that
they had offered many great Inſolencies and Wrongs
to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> particularly one <hi>Williamſon,</hi> a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter
of <hi>London,</hi> bought two Pidgeons in <hi>Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,</hi>
and as he was about to pay for them, a <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
ſnatcht them out of his hand, ſaying, <hi>They
were no meat for a Carpenter.</hi> This begat a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,
and by the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador's means, who
aggravated the matter, the Carpenter was impriſon'd,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe, and ſuch like Inſolencies, provoked one
<hi>John Lincoln</hi> to draw them up in Form of a <hi>Bill,</hi> and
perſuaded Dr. <hi>Beale</hi> on <hi>Eaſter</hi> Tueſday, at the <hi>Spittle</hi>
to read it openly in the Pulpit, which occaſion'd
theſe Foreigners to be very ſeverely handled, and
oftentimes knockt down in the ſtreets.</p>
                     <p>At laſt, one Evening, many Prentices and others
aſſembling, rifled ſome Strangers houſes, and much
miſchief was like to be done, but by the care of the
Lord Mayor and Aldermen, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> many of ehe Rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:32497:235"/>
were committed to Priſon, whereof <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and
twelve others, were hanged; 400 more in their Shirts
bound with Ropes, and Halters about their Necks,
were carried to <hi>VVeſtminſter,</hi> but crying <hi>Mercy,
Mercy,</hi> were all pardoned by the King, which Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
got him much Love.</p>
                     <p>To deſcribe all the particular tumultuous Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Apprentices, and others, would ſwell this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual

and therefore, at preſent, they are omitted.</p>
                     <p>In the Year 1629. 5 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. about the month of

drew together many of the Gentlemen to reſcue the

provoked at this, ſhot Bullets, and very furiouſly
attaqued the <hi>Trained-Bands,</hi> killed five outright, and

were ſo reinforced, that in the end the Gentlemen
were ſubdued, and one <hi>Aſhhurſt</hi> and <hi>Stamford,</hi> two
Captains, with ſome others, were taken and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
The King was much offended at the Uproar,
and immediately ſent for the Lord Chief-Juſtice, by
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:32497:235"/>
whoſe advice a ſpecial Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner</hi>
was iſſued out, and about a Fortnight after the
Malefactors were Arraigned at the <hi>Guildhall</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and <hi>Aſhhurſt</hi> and <hi>Stamford</hi> being found guilty
of Murder, were Condemned and Executed at <hi>Tyburn.</hi>
Much more may be ſaid of theſe Tumults, but for
neceſſary Reaſons it is reſerved to another place.</p>
                     <p>In the Relation of <hi>FIRES</hi> we ſhall only give a
brief account of the moſt remarkable.</p>
                     <p>In the time of King <hi>H.</hi> 1. All the Buildings from
<hi>Cheapſide</hi> to <hi>Aldgate,</hi> which was a large Tract, was
conſumed by a dreadful Fire. Some of the Fires on
<hi>London-Bridge</hi> we have already mentioned.—In the
Year 1212, on the 10<hi>th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> at night, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
a great Fire in <hi>Southwark,</hi> a great Multitude
of People going over the Bridge to ſee it, or help
to quench it; on a ſudden by blowing of the South
Wind, the North part of the Bridge was ſet on fire,
upon which the People on the Bridge would have
returned, but could not; and it hapned that while
they lingred too long, the South end of the Bridge
took ſire alſo, ſo that the People thronging between
the two Fires, expected nothing but preſent Death.
Then there came to aid them ſeveral Ships and Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Furniture in them, before eight a Clock next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the Fire remained glowing and burning for

Acres within the Walls of the City, and 63 Acres 3
Roods without the Walls; There were burnt 13200
Houſes, 87 Pariſh-Churches, ſix Chappels, moſt of
the principal publick Edifices, as the great <hi>Cathedral,</hi>
the great <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> the <hi>Royal-Exchange,</hi> the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom-Houſe,</hi>

night, when Traders were retired to their Country-Houſes,
and none but Maid-ſervants or Apprentices
to look after their Houſes.</p>
                     <p>3. The Dead time of the <hi>Year,</hi> being then the
long Vacation, when Tradeſmen were generally in
the Country to fetch in their Debts.</p>
                     <p>4. The Cloſeneſs of the Buildings there facilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the progreſs of the Fire, and hindred the playing
of Engines.</p>
                     <p>5. The Houſes were generally Wooden, or built
of old Timber.</p>
                     <p>6. A very dry preceding Summer made the Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
very apt to take Fire.</p>

compleated what was Judged to be the work of an
Age.</p>
                     <p>This was begun, Sir <hi>Richard Ford</hi> being Lord-<hi>Mayor,</hi>
1671—raiſed higher Sir <hi>Geo. Waterman</hi>
Knight, Sir <hi>Robert Hanſen</hi> Knight, Sir <hi>Will. Hooker</hi>
Knight, Sir <hi>Robert Viner</hi> Knight, Sir <hi>Joſeph Sheldon</hi>
Knight, Lord <hi>Mayors;</hi> finiſhed, Sir <hi>Thomas Davies</hi>
Knight, Lord <hi>Mayor,</hi> in the Year of our Lord, 1677.</p>
                     <p>So much for Fires, only amongſt many that may
be mentioned, I cannot forget a lamentable accident
that happen'd to a Family to which I was nearly
related, one Mr. <hi>De Laune,</hi> that liv'd in <hi>Lothbury,</hi>
a Merchant, who above twenty years ago, with his
Wife (who was then ready to lie in) the Daughter of
Sir <hi>Thomas Allen</hi> of <hi>Finchly,</hi> and all their Family,
were burnt in their Houſe there, and no account but
conjectures can be given how the fire came.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt year of the Reign of K. <hi>H.</hi> 7. in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn,</hi>
towards the end of <hi>September</hi> (that is about
196 years ago) there began and reigned in the City
and other parts of the Kingdom, a <hi>Dieaſe</hi> then new,
which of the accidents and manner thereof, they call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Sweating-ſickneſs.</hi> This Diſeaſe had a ſwift
Courſe both in the <hi>ſick body,</hi> and in the time and
period of the laſting thereof: For they that were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with it, upon twenty-four hours eſcaping, were
thought almoſt aſſured. And as to the time of the
Malice and Reign of the Diſeaſe ere it ceaſed; It
began about the 21<hi>ſt</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> and clear'd up
before the end of <hi>October.</hi> It was a Peſtilent Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
not ſeated in the Veins or Humours, for there
followed no Carbuncle, no purple or livid ſpots, or
the like, the Maſs of Blood, or of the Body, being not
tainted; only a malignant Vapour flew to the Heart,
and ſeizsd the Vital Spirits; which ſtirred Nature to
ſend it forth by an Extream ſweat. And it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by experience, that this Diſeaſe was rather a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
of Nature, then obſtinate to Remedies, if it
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:32497:243"/>
were in time looked into. For if the Patient were
kept in an equal temper, both for Clothes, Fire,
and Drink, moderately warm, with temperate Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials,
whereby Natures work were neither irritated
by <hi>heat,</hi> nor turned back by <hi>cold,</hi> he commonly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.
But infinite perſons dyed ſuddenly of it,
before the manner of Cure and Attendance was
known. It was conceived to be not an <hi>Epedemick</hi>
Diſeaſe, but to proceed from a Malignity in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of the Air, gathered by the prediſpoſitions
of Seaſons: and the ſpeedy ceſſation declared as much.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Remedy</hi> of this Diſeaſe (which hapned again
in the 9<hi>th</hi> of K. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Anno</hi> 1517. and of which vaſt
numbers died, remarkable by this Circumſtance,
that <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> were taken with it in any Country,
but no others, and therefore termed by Foreigners
<hi>Sudor Anglicus,</hi> that is, the <hi>Engliſh-ſweat</hi>) is given
by <hi>Polidor Virgil,</hi> p. 561. Thus; <hi>Quibus Rebus ita
uſu venit, &amp;c.</hi> by which means it grew to a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom,
that after a vaſt deſtruction of men (by this
Diſtemper) this kind of help was found effectual.
If any perſon was taken with this Sweat by day, he
muſt go to Bed with his Cloaths on; If by night,
and the party be in bed, then he muſt reſt and not
ſtir for 24 hours compleat, in the mean time, he
muſt be ſo covered as not to provoke Sweat, but
let it proceed of its own accord, he muſt neither eat
nor drink any thing but what will juſt ſerve to keep
him alive,—he muſt not ſo much as put forth hand
or foot to be cooled, for that's death unavoidable—
If the Patient obſerves this, he is certainly cured, elſe
loſt; and this Diſeaſe (ſaith he) invaded only <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
(or <hi>Engliſh-men</hi>) which men at that time made
<hi>portentous</hi> conſtructions of.</p>
                     <p>This Mortal Diſtemper was ſucceeded by a rage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Plague,</hi> which ſwept away many, ſo that the
King was forced to remove his Court from one place
to another. By that <hi>Sweating-ſickneſs</hi> in <hi>H.</hi> 8's time,
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:32497:244"/>
infinite multitudes of People dyed in ſeveral places
of <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>London,</hi> ſparing neither rich
nor poor, for even in the King's Court the Lord <hi>Gray</hi>
of <hi>Wilton,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Clinton,</hi> and many Knights,
Gentlemen and Officers, died of it. The like <hi>Sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ſickneſs</hi>
hapned in the 20<hi>th</hi> year of his Reign,
which began in <hi>London,</hi> and afterwards ſpread it ſelf
into all parts of the Kingdom, ſo that the Term and
the Aſſizes were adjourned.</p>
                     <p>In the 20 <hi>E.</hi> 3. (as <hi>Baker</hi> ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 131.) there died
in <hi>London</hi> of a <hi>Plague</hi> 57374 perſons. In the 4<hi>th</hi>
of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> hot burning <hi>Agues</hi> and other ſtrange
Diſeaſes, took away much People; So as between
the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> and the laſt of <hi>December,</hi> there
died 7 <hi>Aldermen</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> namely, <hi>Henry Heard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
Sir <hi>Richard Dobs,</hi> Sir <hi>Will. Laxton,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry
Hobblethorn,</hi> Sir <hi>John Champney,</hi> Sir <hi>John Ayleph,</hi>
and Sir <hi>John Greſham,</hi> of which ſome were Lord
Mayors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I find that in the 8<hi>th</hi> of Qu. <hi>Eliz.</hi>
there died in ten Months ſeven Aldermen of <hi>London,</hi>
viz. <hi>Edward Banks, Richard Chamberlain,</hi> Sir <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
Bowes,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Mallory,</hi> Sir <hi>William Hewet,</hi>
Sir <hi>Thomas White,</hi> and <hi>Richard Lambert,</hi> one of
the Sheriffs for that year.</p>
                     <p>In the 36<hi>th</hi> of Qu. <hi>Eliz.</hi> there dyed of the <hi>Plague</hi>
in <hi>London</hi> and the Suburbs 17890. beſides the Lord
<hi>Mayor</hi> and three <hi>Aldermen,</hi> and <hi>Michaelmas-Term</hi>
was holden at St. <hi>Albans.</hi> The firſt of King <hi>James,
viz.</hi> 1602 there died in <hi>London</hi> and Liberties 38244,
whereof of the <hi>Plague</hi> 30578, yet the next year,
though the City was increaſed with a great number
of Strangers, there died of all Diſeaſes but 4263.
There broke out likewiſe a great <hi>Plague</hi> in the Firſt
of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, whereof more died than
in the beginning of his Fathers Reign. Many other
<hi>Plagues</hi> have been in the City, but I ſhall conclude
this ſubject with a brief account of the great <hi>Plague</hi>
in 1665.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="469" facs="tcp:32497:244"/>
In the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> the Bill of Mortality
mentions nine that died of the <hi>Plague,</hi> and decreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the next Week to three, then increaſed to four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,
next to ſeventeen, next forty three, and then
great Perſons began to retire into the Country. In
<hi>June</hi> the Bill increaſes to 112, next 168, next 267,
next 470, then do many Tradeſmen go into the
Country: and many Miniſters take occaſion to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
themſelves from their Charge. In <hi>July</hi> the Bill
riſes to 725, then to 1089, next 1843, next to 2010,
Now moſt Pariſhes are infected, a vaſt number of
Houſes ſhut up, no Trade at all, and the number of
dying perſons ſtill encreaſing, although ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
left the City. In <hi>Aug.</hi> the Bill riſes to 2817, next
3880, next 4237, and then 6102, all which died of
the <hi>Plague,</hi> beſides other Diſeaſes.—Now there is a
diſmal ſolitude in <hi>London-ſtreets,</hi> every day looks
with the face of a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> obſerved with greater ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
than it uſed to be in the City, Shops are ſhut
up, very few walk about, ſo that graſs begins to
ſpring in ſome places. A deep ſilence every where,
no ratling of Coaches, &amp;c. no calling in Cuſtomers,
no <hi>London</hi> Crys, no noiſe but dying Croans and Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Knells, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>September</hi> the Bill riſes to 6988, the next falls
to 6544, but then riſes again to 7165, which was
the greateſt Bill. There were but four Pariſhes that
were not infected, and in them few tarried. The
next Bill falls to 5538, then to 4929, then to 4327,
then to 2665, then to 1421, then to 1031.—Firſt
Week in <hi>November</hi> it riſes to 1414, but falls to 1050,
then to 652, then to 333, and ſo leſſened more and
more to the end of the year, when we had a Bill of
97306, which died of all Diſeaſes, which was 79000
more than the year before, and the number of them
which died of the <hi>Plague</hi> was reckoned to be 68596
that year; but others ſay that there died of that fatal
Diſeaſe, in little more than a years ſpace, near 100000
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:32497:245"/>
perſons in <hi>London,</hi> and ſome adjacent places.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall proceed to remark briefly ſome few things
more, which are <hi>Miſcellaneous</hi> Collections of my
own from Divers Authors.</p>
                     <p>In the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, when the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
were digging the Foundation of a Work about
<hi>Pauls,</hi> there were found more than 100 heads of
Oxen, which confirm'd that opinion, that of old time
it had been the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> and that there
was the Sacrifice of Beaſts.</p>
                     <p>In the 3 <hi>H.</hi> 5. It is ſaid that ſeven <hi>Dolphins</hi> came
up the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> whereof four were taken.
In the Fourth of Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> before Harveſt, Wheat
was ſold for four Marks the Quarter, Malt at 44 <hi>s.</hi> the
Quarter, Peaſe at 46 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> Yet after Harveſt, Wheat
was ſold for 5 <hi>s.</hi> the Quarter, Malt for 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> Rye at
3 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> In the Country, Wheat was ſold for 4 <hi>s.</hi> the
Quarter, Malt at 4 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> and in ſome places a Buſhel
of Rye for a pound of Candles, which was 4 <hi>d.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have read that in the Third of King <hi>James</hi> a
<hi>Whale</hi> came up within eight miles of <hi>London,</hi> whoſe
body was ſeen divers times above water, and judged
to exceed the length of the largeſt Ship in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
but when ſhe taſted the freſh-water, and ſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Land, ſhe returned into the Sea.</p>
                     <p>I find recorded by divers Writers, that the 17<hi>th</hi> of
<hi>July,</hi> 1619, one <hi>Bernard Calvart</hi> of <hi>Andover,</hi> rode
from St. <hi>George</hi>'s Church in <hi>Southwark</hi> to <hi>Dover,</hi> and
from thence paſſed by Barge to <hi>Callice</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and
from thence returned back to St. <hi>George</hi>'s Church the
ſame day, ſetting out about three in the Morning,
and returned about eight in the Evening, freſh and
luſty, being 184 miles, which was very ſtrange.</p>
                     <p>In the 14<hi>th R.</hi> 2. on <hi>Chriſtmas-day,</hi> a <hi>Dolphin</hi> was
taken at <hi>London-bridge,</hi> being ten Foot long, and a
monſtrous grown Fiſh.</p>
                     <p>In the 37 <hi>H.</hi> 8. On <hi>Tueſday</hi> in <hi>Eaſter</hi> week, <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Foxely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> Pot-maker for the <hi>Mint</hi> of the <hi>Tower</hi>
                        <pb n="471" facs="tcp:32497:245"/>
of <hi>London,</hi> fell aſleep, and could not be awaked with
P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ching or Burning till the firſt Day of the next
Term, which was full Fourten Days, and when he
Awaked, was found in all points as if he had Slept
but one Night; and lived forty Years after.</p>
                     <p>In the Second of King <hi>James</hi> a ſtrange accident
happened, to the terrour of all Bloody Murderers;
A Woman called <hi>Ann Waters,</hi> inticed by a Lewd
Perſou ſhe was wont to keep Company with, conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have her Husband ſtrangled, and then Buried
him ſecretly under the Dunghil in a <hi>Cowhouſe;</hi>
whereupon, the Man being miſt by his Neighbours,
and the Wife making an extraordinary ſhew of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring,
with much counterfeit Sorrow for his Abſence,
ſhe paſt on, unſuſpected for a time: But it pleaſed
God, that one of the Inhabitants of that Street <hi>Dream't</hi>
That his Neighbour <hi>Waters</hi> was Strangled and Buried
under the Dunghil in a <hi>Cowhouſe;</hi> and upon De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
his Dream, ſearch being made by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable,
the dead Body was found as he had Dreamed,
whereupon the Wife was Apprehended, and upon
Examination confeſſing the Fact, was burned. What
hope therefore of Concealment can any Murderers
have, when they are ſubject to be Diſcovered by any
mans Dream?</p>
                     <p>In the Fifth of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> there fell Hail-ſtones
that were fifteen Inches about, I my ſelf ſaw Hail-ſtones
that fell in <hi>London</hi> in <hi>May</hi> laſt was Twelve
Month, ſome of which were Six, ſome Nine Inches
about, and others ſay, they ſaw ſome that were
more.</p>
                     <p>About the Sixth of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, one <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Walker</hi> a wealthy Citizen, dwelling at the Crown
in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> one day, when his Child cryed, did bid
him be quiet, and he would make him <hi>Heir of the
Crown;</hi> which words being ſubject to Interpretation,
he was call'd in queſtion about them, Arraigned,
Condemned, and put to Death; which was an Act
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:32497:246"/>
of great Severity, for the Man had no other mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
than that he would make his Child Heir of his
own Houſe with that Sign.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anno</hi> One thouſand five hundred ninety five, upon
<hi>Digging</hi> for a Vault to be made in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> there
was found at Seventeen Foot deep a fair Pavement,
like unto that above ground, and at the further end of
the Channel was found a Tree ſawed into five ſteps,
which was to ſtep over ſome Brook running towards
<hi>Walbrook,</hi> upon the edge of which, there lay the
bodies of two great Trees, the ends wereof were
then ſawed off, and were firm Timber; ſo that the
Ground of the City had been raiſed to that time above
Seventeen Foot.</p>
                     <p>In the Third of <hi>William</hi> the Second, <hi>anno</hi> 1090.
On St. <hi>Lukes</hi> day, Six hundred Houſes in <hi>London</hi>
were thrown down by a terrible Tempeſt, and then
it was, that the Roof of <hi>Bow-Church</hi> in <hi>Cheapſide</hi> fell
with that violence, mentioned <hi>page</hi> 46 before.</p>
                     <p>In the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, the <hi>Thames</hi> ſo fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of Water, that between the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London</hi> and
the <hi>Bridge</hi> men, waded over on Foot for the ſpace of
two days.</p>
                     <p>In the Seventh year of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, <hi>November</hi>
Eight, The Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> was like to have been

Thirty Perſons were Drowned, and the Duke with
others that eſcaped, were fain to be drawn up with
Ropes. The ſame year the <hi>Poſtern Gates</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
by Eaſt <hi>Smithfield</hi> againſt the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London</hi>
did ſink by Night more than Seven Foot into the
Earth. In his Eighteenth year, all the Lyons in the
<hi>Tower</hi> Dyed. And in this preſent year three of
the Lions in the <hi>Tower</hi> died. In the year 1623,
<hi>Octob.</hi> 26. A <hi>Popiſh Prieſt</hi> Preached in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon

Three hundred Men and Women, when about the

with ſuch violence, that it brake down the next Floor
under it: In the Fall whereof, the Preacher and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
a Hundred of his Auditors were Killed, beſides
as many more hurt.</p>
                     <p>About the Year, One thouſand two hundred eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

                     <p>In the time of <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt, for three or four
years together, there was ſo great a <hi>Dearth,</hi> that Wheat
was ſold for Eighteen Shillings ſix pence a Quarter;
and then followed ſo great a Mortality of Men, that

                     <p>In the Seventeenth Year of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, were

half penny: A fat Capon, two pence: A fat Hen,
one penny: Two Chickens, one penny: Three Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons,
one penny: Twenty four Eggs a penny. Yet
the next year there was ſuch a Famine and Mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of People, that the Living were ſcarce ſufficient
to Inter their Dead Friends.</p>
                     <p>And the next year again, there was ſo early a
Harveſt, that a Buſhel of Wheat which had been
ſold for Ten ſhillings, was now ſold for Ten pence.</p>

1609. 6 King <hi>James,</hi> A Froſt began in <hi>December</hi>
which continued till <hi>April</hi> following, with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
that not only the <hi>Thames</hi> was ſo Frozen, that
Carts Loaden were driven over it as on dry Land;
but alſo many Fowls and Birds periſhed, and alſo
much Herbage in Gardens, eſpecially <hi>Hartichoaks</hi>
and <hi>Roſemary</hi> were deſtroyed. The like violent Froſt
happened in the Seventh of <hi>Eliz.</hi> That Men perform'd
all kinds of Exerciſes upon the <hi>Thames.</hi> In her
35th. year, the River ſo fail'd that a Horſeman might
Ride over near <hi>London-Bridge.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In 5 Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> There fell ſo great a Rain in <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi>
that <hi>Weſtminſter-hall</hi> was full of Water, and
Boats were Rowed over <hi>Weſtminſter-Bridge</hi> to
<hi>Kingſtreet.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>In his Eleventh Year, there was ſo great Plenty,
That a Quarter of Wheat was ſold at <hi>London</hi> for
two Shillings: A fat Oxe, for a Noble: A fat Sheep,
for ſix pence: Five Pigeons for a penny; and other
things after that Rate. But in his 27<hi>th.</hi> Year, there
was great Scarcity, by reaſon there fell little or no
Rain, from <hi>March</hi> to <hi>July,</hi> and it was therefore
called, <hi>the dry Summer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In <hi>June</hi> Anno 1603, There was one Whipped
