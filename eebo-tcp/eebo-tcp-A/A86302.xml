            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE AUTHORS PREFACE To the Reader.</head>
            <p>IT was upon the 2. of <hi>January</hi> that Doctor <hi>Bernards</hi> Book entituled <hi>The judgment of the late Primate of Ireland,</hi> &amp;c. came to me from a friend in <hi>London,</hi> which I had no ſooner cauſed to be read over to me, but I lookt upon it as the moſt unwelcome New-years-gift that could have been ſent me from an enemy. So far I found my ſelf concerned in it, that without a manifeſt betraying of my Fame and Innocence, I was not to defer my Anſwer, notwithſtanding all the difficulties which appeared before me. I conſidered of my own unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to enter into new diſputes, having ſo little uſe of my eyes and hands for ſuch imployments; the eminence of the name which I was to deal with in reference to whom I could be lookt upon no otherwiſe then as a Graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopper compared with the ſon, of <hi>Anak;</hi> and finally the diſagreeableneſs of ſome part of the ſubject to the complexion and temper of the preſent times. But on the other ſide, that ſaying of S. <hi>Hierom, Se nolle quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam in ſuſpicione Haereſeos ſilentem eſſe,</hi> That he would have no man hold his peace when ſuſpected of Hereſie, over-ballanc'd all. And in this Book of Doctor <hi>Bernards</hi> I found my ſelf accuſed of <hi>Heterodoxie</hi> at the leaſt, if not of <hi>Hereſie,</hi> reproacht with violating my ſubſcription, and running croſs unto the publick Doctrines of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the Book of Homilies. Reproches not to be endured but by guilty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſuch as ſink under the calamity of an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <hi>ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction.</hi> So that being forced upon an anſwer, I was reſolved to make it as ſpeedy as I could before <hi>prejudice</hi> and <hi>prepoſſeſſions</hi> had made too ſtrong a head againſt me in the minds of men. I never lov'd to have ſuch work ſtick long in my fingers; and therefore notwithſtanding the extremity of the ſeaſon and the tyrannie of a Quartan Ague under which I languiſhed, I gave it ſuch a quick diſpatch that it might eaſily have been publiſht by the middle of the Term then following. But contrary to my expectation it met with ſo many rubs between the Pen and the Preſs, that the Term was paſt before it could be undertaken; And then the undertakers were not willing to make too much haſte, a <hi>dead vacation</hi> being held to be no fit time to quicken and give life to the ſale of new books, not extremely popular.</p>
            <p>But to ſay truth, what I have loſt one way by theſe delayes, I have gained in another: For by this means I have had the opportunity of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelf abuſed, and reprochfully handled in the late <hi>Hiſtory of the</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:130903:3"/>
               <hi>Life and Reign of King Charles;</hi> the Author whereof hath been enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> as a ſouldier of Fortune to undertake this <hi>Pen-combat</hi> for him, though he would rather be ſuppoſed to ſerve under the Lord <hi>Primates</hi> Colours, as the nobler General. But ſerve he under whom he will, tis all one to me, who am deſign'd to bear the blowes, not made the gentler by the Name and Reputation of the party who engaged him in it. The beſt is, that he hath not found me unprovided for my own defence, and if he chance to fall back with ſome loſs of Honour, he muſt blame himſelf. It hath been alwayes my deſire not to die in debt, and therefore I have <hi>paid</hi> this <hi>Creditor</hi> with an anſwer alſo. For though I know well that neglected calumnies are of leaſt continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, <hi>Convicia ſpreta exoleſcunt,</hi> as it is in <hi>Tacitus:</hi> yet this is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of ſuch common fames as paſs upon the breath of rumor, and are taken up on hear-ſay onely, or from ſhort-liv'd Pamphlets; not of ſuch calumnies as are enrolled upon Record, or paſſe into the body of a publick Hiſtory. If contumelies of this nature were to go unanſwered, the party wronged muſt live defamed, and die remedileſſe; a ſcorn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the preſent times, and a perpetual ignominy to the ages following. To prevent which, I have taken the beſt courſe I could to right my ſelf againſt all opponents, to let both Doctor <hi>Bernard,</hi> and this freſh <hi>Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer</hi> underſtand the hazard which they ſo wilfully run into by provoking an unwilling <hi>Adverſary,</hi> who was reſolv'd never to have looked back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe Diſputes, which formerly had too much exerciſed both his Pen and Patience. But being what is paſt cannot be recalled, we muſt all ſubmit our ſelves and our performances to the Readers judgment, who I deſire may be impartial and unbiaſſed on either ſide, that ſo the truth onely may obtain the victory, and let the people ſhout and ſay with them in <q>Eſdras, Magna eſt veritas &amp; praevalet,</q> that is to ſay, <q>Great is truth and mighty above all things,</q>

            </p>
            <p>And firſt the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> tells us this, that <hi>when he gave himſelfe to the reading of the</hi> Fathers, <hi>he took no heed unto any thing that concerned this</hi> Argument, <hi>as little dreaming that any ſuch</hi> Controverſie <hi>would have ariſen amongſt us,</hi> p. 74.

The Lord <hi>Primate</hi> tells us of Saint <hi>Augustin,</hi> pag. 75. <hi>That purpoſely ſelecting thoſe things which appertained unto us Chriſtians, he doth wholly pretermit that Precept in the recital of the Commandments of the Decalogue.</hi> To which Teſtimony (though this alone may ſeem ſufficient to confirme the point) I ſhall adde ſome more.

               </gap>, becauſe of their hard-heartedneſs and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity. And as for the Lords day which ſucceeded in the place thereof, the Fathers generally think no otherwiſe of it, then as an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Inſtitution, not founded upon any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, either of Chriſt or his Apoſtles, but built perhaps upon ſome <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> practice, which gave the Church authority to change the day, and to tranſlate it from the <hi>Seventh</hi> on which God reſted, to the <hi>Firſt day</hi> of the week, the day of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>And though the Lord <hi>Primate,</hi> to gain unto the <hi>Lords day</hi> the Reputation of having ſomewhat in it of Divine Inſtitution, aſcribes the alteration of the day to our Lord and Saviour, <hi>page</hi> 76. yet neither the Author whom he cites, nor the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by him cited will evince the point. And firſt, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor will not do it; the Homily <hi>De Semente,</hi> out of which the following proof is taken, being ſuppoſed by the Learned not to have been writ by <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> but put into his Works as his, by ſome that had a mind to entitle him to it; as generally all the Works of the Ancient Fathers have many ſuppoſititious wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings intermingled with them. Secondly, the Authority or Words cited will not do it neither, though at firſt ſight they ſeem to come home to make proof thereof. The words are theſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is to ſay, the Lord tranſlated the Sabbath from the ſeventh
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:130903:6"/>
day of the week, to the Lords day, or firſt day of the week. Which words are to be underſtood, not as if done by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, but on his occaſion; the Reſurrection of our Lord upon that day, being the principal motive, which did induce his Church to make choice thereof for a day of Worſhip. For otherwiſe the falſe <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> whoſoever he was, muſt croſs and contradict the true, who having told us, that it was <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> at the firſt, that the <hi>Sabbath</hi> ſhould be obſerved (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as his own words are) in memory of the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the worlds Creation; aſcribes the inſtitution of the Lords day to the voluntary uſage of the Church of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Commandment from our Saviour, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>We celebrate,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Lords day, as a memorial of the beginning of a new Creation,</hi> which is plain enough.</p>
            <p>In the next place it is acknowledged by the Lord <hi>Primate, That generally the word</hi> Sabbatum, <hi>in the writings of the Fathers, doth denote our Saturday,</hi> p. 74. Which notwithſtanding, either becauſe it was affirmed by the Hiſtorian, <hi>Hiſtory of the Sabbath,</hi> Part 2. Chap. 2. Num. 12. that the word <hi>Sabbatum</hi> was not uſed to ſignifie the Lords day by any approved Writer, for the ſpace of a thouſand years and upward; or not to leave the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batarian</hi> Brethren at ſo great a loſs in that particular, he would fain find out one (though but one of a thouſand) who hath uſed it to <hi>denote our Chriſtian Feſtivities alſo.</hi> Where not that the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> doth not ſay (as indeed he could not) that the word <hi>Sabbatum</hi> was uſed to ſignifie the <hi>Lords day,</hi> but onely to ſignifie the other Feſtivals of the Church, the Chriſtian Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivities, as he calls them, in which how much he is miſtaken we ſhall ſee anon. That one here meant and mentioned is <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius Apollinaris</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Auvergne</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who deſcribing the moderation of the Table of <hi>Theoderick</hi> King of the <hi>Goths</hi> upon the <hi>Eves,</hi> and the exceſs on the <hi>Holy-day</hi> following; he<note place="margin">Lib. 1.

                  </gap>ae ſuperſedendum eſt, qui nec latentes poteſt latere perſonas,</hi> that is to ſay, that his exceſs, or Sabbatarian luxury required
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:130903:7"/>
not to be ſpoken of, becauſe it could not be concealed from thoſe who lived moſt retiredly. If either the Lord <hi>Primate,</hi> or <hi>Sirmondus</hi> the <hi>Jeſuite</hi> could infer from hence, that the word <hi>Sabbatum</hi> was uſed by <hi>Apollinaris,</hi> to ſignifie, or denote our Chriſtian <hi>Feſtivities,</hi> much leſs the Sunday, or Lords day, I ſhall miſs my mark. They ſay, it is a ſign of ill luck for a man to <hi>ſtumble at the threſhold,</hi> and never was ſuch a ſtumble made by a man of learning, in the firſt beginning of a work: for clearly <hi>Sabbatarius luxus,</hi> relates not to the Lords day, nor the other Feſtivals, but is there uſed proverbially, to ſignifie that exceſs and riot which that King uſed at his Table on the dayes aforeſaid. The proverb borrowed from the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and the riotous feaſtings on the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> Its true, the Jews did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly faſt till noon upon their <hi>Sabbath,</hi> till the devotions of the morning were complete and ended; on which account they tax the Diſciples of our Saviour, for eating a few ears of Corn on the Sabbath day, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 2. but then it is as true withal, that they ſpent all the reſt of the day in their riotous feaſtings, not onely with plenty of good cheer, but exceſs of wine. In which regard, whereas all other marketing was unlawful on the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath dayes,</hi> there never was reſtraint of ſelling Wine: the <hi>Jews</hi> believing that therein they brake no Commandment, <hi>Hebraei fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciunt aliquid ſpeciale in vino,</hi> viz. <hi>quòd cùm in Sabbato ſuo à caeteris venditionibus &amp; emptionibus ceſſent, ſolum vinum ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt, credentes ſe non ſolvere Sabbatum,</hi> as <hi>Tostatus</hi> hath it.<note place="margin">Toſtatus in Exod. 12.</note> And for the reſt of their exceſſes Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> telleth us, that they kept the Sabbath onely, <hi>ad luxuriam &amp; ebrietatem,</hi>

               <hi>Diem Saturni otio &amp; victui decernere,</hi> devote the Saturday, or <hi>Sabbath,</hi> unto Eaſe and Luxury.

He founds the Inſtitution of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> on <hi>Geneſis 2.</hi> An <hi>Antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation</hi> or <hi>Prolepſis</hi> in that place of <hi>Gen.</hi> maintained explicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and many of the moſt learned of the <hi>Jewiſh Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins,</hi> as alſo by <hi>Toſtatus</hi> and his followers amongſt the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; implicitly by thoſe, who maintained that the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was not inſtituted in the firſt beginning. The like <hi>Anticipations</hi> frequent in the holy Scripture, and justified by many of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, and not a few learned men of the later times. The <hi>Sabbath</hi> not a part of the <hi>Law of Nature.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>BUt now before we can proceed to ſuch other paſſages, which the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> hath excepted againſt in <hi>Hiſtory of the Sabbath,</hi> either by name, or on the <hi>by,</hi> it will be neceſſary that we know his own Judgement and Opinion in the ground of this Controverſie; as well concerning the <hi>morality</hi> of the fourth Commandment, as the true ground and inſtitution of the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> And to find that we muſt conſult his Letter to Mr. <hi>Ley,</hi> in which he telleth us, <hi>That for his own part, he never yet</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:130903:8"/>
doubted, <hi>but took it for granted; that as the ſetting of ſome whole day apart for Gods ſolemn worſhip was</hi> juris Divini naturalis, <hi>ſo that this ſolemn day</hi> (he means the <hi>Sabbath) ſhould be one in ſeven, was</hi> juris Divini poſitivi, <hi>recorded in the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> p. 113. And in theſe words we have two ſeveral propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, <hi>That the ſetting apart of ſome whole day to Gods ſolemn worſhip, is</hi> juris Divini naturalis: and ſecondly, <hi>that the Sabbath,</hi> which he meaneth by this <hi>ſolemn day, was</hi> juris Divini poſitivi, <hi>recorded in the fourth Commandment;</hi> both which ſhall be examined in their ſeveral turns. And firſt I would fain know of Doctor <hi>Bernard,</hi> or any other of the Lord <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates</hi> Chaplains (ſince he cannot anſwer for himſelfe) where we ſhall find, that the ſetting apart of <hi>ſome whole day</hi> for <hi>Gods ſolemn worſhip,</hi> was <hi>juris Divini naturalis.</hi> That ſome time was to be ſet apart for the worſhip of God, is agreed by all, and reckoned by moſt knowing men, not intereſſed in any party, to be the <hi>moral</hi> part of the fourth Commandment; but that this time ſhould be <hi>ſome whole day,</hi> is neither imprinted in mans heart by the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> nor ever required of the <hi>Iews,</hi> nor obſerved by the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Or granting that ſome ſuch <hi>whole day</hi> was to be ſet apart for <hi>Gods ſolemn worſhip;</hi> I would fain know in the firſt place when the ſaid <hi>whole day</hi> was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and how long to continue; whether it were a <hi>whole</hi> natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>day,</hi> or a whole artificial <hi>day,</hi> as they uſe to phraſe it. And if it were a <hi>whole</hi> natural <hi>day,</hi> then whether to extend from mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night to midnight, after the reckoning of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> or from Sun-ſetting to Sun-ſetting, from <hi>Even</hi> to <hi>Even,</hi> according to the account of the <hi>Iewes:</hi> or if a <hi>whole</hi> artificial day, then whether a day of twelve hours onely, after the reckoning of the <hi>Iewes;</hi> or from Sun-riſing to Sun-ſetting (be they more or leſs) according to the ſeveral Climates under which men lived. Which points, unleſs they be well ſtated, the conſcience will have nothing in this caſe to rely upon. In the next place conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> ſpeaks indefinitely of <hi>ſome whole day,</hi> without determining when and how often the ſaid <hi>whole day</hi> was to be obſerved, I would fain know whether ſuch a <hi>whole day</hi> was to be <hi>ſet apart</hi> once or twice in the week; or whether it would ſuffice to the fulfilling of the <hi>moral</hi> part of the fourth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:130903:9"/>
Commandment, if it were onely once a month, or once a year, or once in ſeven year, or once in the courſe of a mans whole life. For being it is ſaid indefinitly, that the <hi>ſetting apart</hi> of <hi>ſome whole day</hi> to Gods ſolemn worſhip, is <hi>juris Divini naturalis,</hi> ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed in the Heart of man by the <hi>Law of Nature;</hi> it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably inferred, that the <hi>ſetting apart</hi> of <hi>one whole day</hi> at what time ſoever a man pleaſeth, may very ſufficiently comply with the intention of that Law, and conſequently diſcharge the man ſo doing, from all further obſervance: which how far it will ſatisfie the conſciences of men, or be accounted acceptable in the ſight of God, I ſhall leave to others to determine.</p>
            <p>But admitting that this <hi>whole day,</hi> which the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> ſpeaks of, was to have as frequent a return as the <hi>Iewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath;</hi> I would then know when ſuch a <hi>whole day</hi> was either ordinarily kept, or required to be kept by the <hi>Iewes</hi> or <hi>Gentiles.</hi> That no ſuch <hi>whole day</hi> was ever ordinarily kept by the <hi>Iewes,</hi> appears by their riotous feaſtings on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day, which before we ſpake of; by which it is moſt evident, that the one half of that day was either ſpent in Luxury and Riot, or in Reſt and Idleneſs; and that the leaſt part of the other moyety was ſpent in holy Meditation, and much leſs in the <hi>ſolemn worſhip of God:</hi> which in the firſt ſettlement of that Nation in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> was performed onely in the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the <hi>Holy Temple,</hi> at which but few of the people, and thoſe which dwelt near the place of worſhip, could give any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance. We meet indeed with a Commandment, that the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was to be continued <hi>from Even to Even,</hi> Levit. 23. 32. that is to ſay, from Friday evening at Sun-ſet, until the like time of <hi>Sun-ſet</hi> on the <hi>Sabbath day.</hi> Which Precept being firſt given by God, with reference to the day of <hi>Atonement</hi> or <hi>Expiation</hi> (and commonly applyed by the <hi>Iewes</hi> to the weekly Sabbaths) requires no otherkeeping of the day for that ſpace of time, more then <hi>the afflicting of their ſouls</hi> by a ſolemn faſt, then onely reſt from labour, &amp; all ſervile works. And this appears plainly by the firſt words of the ſaid 32. verſe, where it is ſaid, <hi>That it ſhould be unto them a Sabbath of rest,</hi> compared with verſ. 30, 31. where forbearing all or any manner of work is the chief thing required to the obſervation of that day. And yet that reſt from
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:130903:9"/>
labour, and ceſſation from all manner of work frequently inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted alſo, either with reference to the ſolemn keeping of the day it ſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 5. or the preſervation of the creature, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 15. &amp; 14. 5. But that the <hi>whole day</hi> extending from <hi>Even</hi> to <hi>Even,</hi> ſhould be either ſpent in <hi>afflicting their ſouls,</hi> as it is meant onely of the day of <hi>Atonement</hi> or <hi>Expiation,</hi> which was obſerved but once a year; or in the acts of <hi>ſolemn</hi> and <hi>religious worſhip,</hi> if it be underſtood of the weekly <hi>Sabbath</hi> (to which the <hi>Iews</hi> commonly applied it alſo, as before was ſaid) as I no where find, So have I no reaſon to believe it without better grounds. Certain I am, that ſo much of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day, after this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as intervened between the Sun-ſetting on the Friday, and the Sun-riſing on the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> was partly ſpent in reſt from labour, and making neceſſary preparations for the day enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and part thereof in neceſſary repoſe and ſleep, for the refreſhing of their bodies, and ſupport of nature; and how the reſt of that day was ſpent, we have ſeen before.</p>
            <p>There is another place in Scripture much preſt upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of the people, by the rigid <hi>Sabbatarians</hi> of theſe times, to ſtave them off from any lawful recreation on their new made <hi>Sabbath;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 13, 14. where God ſpeaks thus unto that people: <hi>If thou turn away thy foot from the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath from doing thy pleaſure on my holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable, and ſhalt honour him, not doing thine own wayes, nor finding thine own pleaſure, nor ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thine own words; then ſhalt thou delight thy ſelf in the Lord.</hi> But if we look better on this Text, and compare it with <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. of the ſame Chapter, where we find mention of a <hi>faſt,</hi> and of the <hi>afflicting of their Souls</hi> on the day of that <hi>faſt,</hi> we may ſee eaſily that the Text ſo much inſiſted on by our <hi>Sabbatarians,</hi> relates onely to the <hi>day of Atonement;</hi> which being a day of publick humiliation, and of confeſſing their ſins to the Lord their God, required a ſtricter withholding of themſelves from their lawful pleaſures, then any of the weekly <hi>Sabbaths.</hi> So as admitting that this <hi>whole day</hi> was by God required to be ſpent in ſome religious Acts of ſolemn worſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (though never kept ſo by the <hi>Iewes</hi>) yet was it but <hi>one whole day</hi> in a year, and that injoyn'd alſo by a <hi>poſitive</hi> Law; which if it be ſufficient
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:130903:10"/>
to diſcharge the obligation laid upon us by the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> the obſervation of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> formerly, of the <hi>Lords day</hi> now, may be thought ſuperfluous. And if no ſuch <hi>whole day</hi> were kept, or required to be kept by the <hi>Iewes,</hi> Gods peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, there is ſmall hope to find it amongſt the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> who did too much attend their profit, and indulge their pleaſures, to ſpend whole dayes upon the ſervice of their gods. I ſpeak here of that which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did in ordinary and common courſe, as a thing conſtantly required of them, and obſerved by them; and not of any extraordinary and occaſional action, ſuch as the <hi>three dayes faſt</hi> which was kept in <hi>Nineve</hi> by the Kings command, upon that fearful Proclamation which was made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it by the Prophet <hi>Ionah.</hi> As for the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> I dare with confidence affirm, that the ſpending of the whole Lords day in the acts of worſhip, was never required of them, or of any of them, by any Imperial Edict, or National Law, or Conſtitution of the Church, till the year 1615. at what time it was enjoyned by the <hi>Articles</hi> of the Church of <hi>Ireland;</hi> as ſhall be proved at large hereafter, when that paſſage in thoſe <hi>Articles</hi> comes to be examined.</p>
            <p>The Lord Primates firſt Propoſition being thus blown off, we next proceed to the examination of the ſecond, that is to ſay, <hi>That the ſolemn day of worſhip ſhould be one in ſeven, was</hi> juris Divini poſitivi, <hi>recorded in the fourth Commandment.</hi> A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which will find few Friends, and many Adverſaries, eſpecially as it comes attended with the explication which he makes upon it: For firſt it croſſeth with <hi>Toſtatus</hi> (a man of as great induſtry, and as much variety of learning as any of the age he lived in) and not with him onely, but with <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> the great Dictator of the Schools, and generally with all the <hi>School-men;</hi> of which thus Dr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> in his Tract <hi>De Sabbato,</hi> Sect. 3. <q>It is, as <hi>Abulenſis</hi> hath it, a Dictate of the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> that ſome ſet time be put apart for Gods holy worſhip: but it is <hi>Ceremonial</hi> and <hi>Legal,</hi> that this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſhould be reſtrained either to one day of <hi>ſeven,</hi> or the <hi>ſeventh day</hi> preciſely from the <hi>worlds creation.</hi> A time of <hi>reſt</hi> is therefore <hi>moral;</hi> but the <hi>ſet time</hi> thereof is <hi>ceremonial:</hi> which is confeſſed by thoſe who have ſtood moſt on this <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:130903:10"/>
and urged it even to a probable ſuſpicion of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſme. Aquinas</hi> alſo ſo reſolves it; and (which is ſeldome ſeen in other caſes) the <hi>School-men</hi> (of what Sect ſoever) ſay the ſame: whereby (ſaith he) we may perceive in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the <hi>Fathers</hi> have ſometimes pronounced it to be a <hi>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,</hi> and a <hi>ſhadow,</hi> and a <hi>figure</hi> onely.</q> 
            </p>
            <p>In the next place it croſſeth with the <hi>Sabbatarians</hi> of theſe later times, who generally make the ſanctifying of <hi>one day</hi> in <hi>ſeven,</hi> to be the <hi>moral</hi> part of the fourth <hi>Commandment;</hi> the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting of that day to the laſt day of the week, or the ſeventh day on which God reſted, to be the <hi>ceremonial</hi> part of it: and it concerns them ſo to do in point of intereſt, for otherwiſe they could find no ground for the <hi>morality</hi> of the Lords day Sabbath, and founding that <hi>morality</hi> on the fourth <hi>Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and preſsing it upon the conſciences of the people with ſuch art and induſtry. So that we have three parts at leaſt of this one Commandment, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>moral</hi> part, conſiſting in the ſetting apart of <hi>one whole day</hi> (but no matter when) for <hi>Gods ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn worſhip;</hi> the <hi>Poſitive</hi> part conſiſting (as the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> ſaith) in ſanctifying <hi>one day</hi> in <hi>ſeven;</hi> and then the <hi>ceremonial</hi> part in limiting that day to the ſeventh day preciſely of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the world, on which God reſted from his labours. And ſtrange it were if the <hi>judicial</hi> Law ſhould not put in alſo for a ſhare, and make up the fourth; the man that <hi>gathered ſticks</hi> on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day, being tried according to this Law, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned accordingly. But here before we ſhall proceed to the <hi>Explication,</hi> by which the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> makes his opinion more agreeable to the <hi>Sabbatarians</hi> then at firſt it ſeemed, I muſt ask ſome of the Lord <hi>Primates</hi> followers, where I ſhall find the <hi>Institution</hi> of that <hi>poſitive Law,</hi> which before we heard of, by whom it was ordained, and on whom impoſed; for <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Laws</hi> muſt be declared and enjoyned in terms expreſs, or elſe they are neither <hi>Laws</hi> nor <hi>Poſitive.</hi> If they ſhall ſay that we may find the Inſtitution of it in the ſecond of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> then muſt it be the ſanctifying of that very ſeventh day on which God reſted from his labours, and not the ſetting apart, or ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying of one day in ſeven, as the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> would fain have it. And, ſecondly, if the ſetting a part or ſanctifying of one
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:130903:11"/>
day in ſeven, as it is <hi>juris Divini poſitive,</hi> be that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the fourth Commandment, as the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> ſayes it is, then muſt it alſo be the ſame very ſeventh day on which God reſted, as before; there being no other day but that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be <hi>kept holy</hi> in that Commandment, or mentioned to be <hi>bleſſed and ſanctified</hi> by the Lord our God. And on the other ſide, if ſanctifying the ſeventh day preciſely on which God reſted from his labours, either as mentioned in the fourth Commandment, or inſtituted in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. be onely <hi>juris ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nialis,</hi> but a matter of <hi>Ceremony,</hi> as the <hi>Sabbatarians</hi> would fain have it: then as they leave no room at all for the Lord <hi>Primates poſitive Law,</hi> in either Scripture; ſo do they furniſh the Church with a better Argument againſt themſelves, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Antiquity and uſe of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> then hath yet been thought of. But leaving them to free themſelves from theſe perplexities at their better leiſure, we muſt next ſee what ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction will be offered to the <hi>Sabbatarians;</hi> who make the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying of <hi>one day</hi> in <hi>ſeven</hi> to be the <hi>moral,</hi> not the <hi>poſitive</hi> part of the fourth Commandment: And herein we ſhall find the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> very ready to give them all poſſible content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And therefore he aſcribes ſo much <hi>morality</hi> to his <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law,</hi> as to make it immutable, and unchangeable by <hi>Men</hi> or <hi>Angels,</hi> which is one of the chiefe priviledges of the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law;</hi> and then he fixeth the firſt Inſtitution of it on <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. which makes it equal in a manner to the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> if not part thereof.</p>
            <p>And firſt, ſaith he, <hi>I mean here ſuch a</hi> jus Divinum poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum, <hi>as</hi> Baptiſm <hi>and the</hi> Lords Supper <hi>are eſtabliſhed by; which lieth not in the power of any</hi> Man <hi>or</hi> Angel <hi>to change or alter,</hi> pag. 105. This makes it ſomewhat of kin to a <hi>moral</hi> precept, of which the School-men have afforded us this general Aphoriſm, <hi>Praecepta legis naturalis eſſe indispenſabilia,</hi> that is to ſay, that the precept of the Moral Law, or the Law of Natures, are not to be diſpenſt withal upon any occaſion or neceſſity whatſoever it be, and much leſs to be changed and abrogated at the will of man: which explanation (not to diſpute the mutability, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability of a poſitive Law) will find as many Adverſaries as the propoſition; as that which croſſeth with the Doctrine of

            <p>The ſecond way whereby the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> doth ſtrengthen and ſupport his <hi>poſitive</hi> Law, and makes it to come more near to the <hi>Sabbatarians</hi> of theſe later times, is by his fixing the firſt <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of it on the ſecond of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> which makes it equal in a manner to the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> if not part thereof. For that the inſtitution of it in the firſt beginning, is the very ſame with making it a part or branch of the Law of Nature, may be inferred firſt from theſe words of <hi>Toſtatus</hi> in <hi>Gen. 2.

               </q>And that the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> doth <hi>fetch the original of the Sabbath from the beginning of the World,</hi> is evident from a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in his Letter to Dr. <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> p. 78. In which, ſaith he, (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing his ſpeech unto that Doctor) The <hi>Text of</hi> Gen. 2. 3.

neither, I am ſure of that: For other men as eminent in all parts of Learning, and as great Maſters of Reaſon as Doctor <hi>Ryvet</hi> ever was, have affirmed the contrary; conceiving fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that thoſe words in the ſecond of <hi>Geneſis</hi> are ſpoken in the way of a <hi>Prolepſis</hi> or <hi>Anticipation:</hi> Gods <hi>ſanctifying the day of his Reſt,</hi> being mentioned in that time and place, not becauſe the Sabbath was then inſtituted, but becauſe it was the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſetting apart that day by the fourth Commandment to be a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> or a day of holy repoſe and reſt to the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Of this opinion was <hi>Toſtatus</hi> in his Comment on <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. countenanced by <hi>Ioſephus</hi> Antiq. <hi>l. 1. c.</hi> 2. by <hi>Solomon Iarchi,</hi> one of the principal of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> and many other learned men of the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Nation, as appears by <hi>Mercer</hi> a learned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Writer, and one well verſt in all the learning of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> in his Comment on <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. who addes <hi>de proprio,</hi> that from Gods reſting on that day, <hi>Poſtea praeceptum de Sabbato natum eſt,</hi> the <hi>Commandment</hi> for <hi>ſanctifying</hi> the <hi>ſeventh</hi> day was afterwards given.

Of this opinion was <hi>Pererius</hi> a learned and induſtrious man of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> party, in his Comment on the ſecond of <hi>Geneſis</hi> And of this opinion was <hi>Gomarus,</hi> that great undertaker againſt the <hi>Arminians,</hi> in his Tract <hi>De origine &amp; inſtitution: Sabbati,</hi> with many other eminent men of both Religions, too many to be named in this place and time: whoſe opinions in this point can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwiſe be made good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and juſtifiable, but by maintaining an <hi>Anticipation</hi> in this Text of <hi>Moſes;</hi> though few of them ſpeak their minds ſo fully and explicitely in it as Dr. <hi>Prideaux,</hi> no way inferiour to the beſt of thoſe who opine the contrary. <hi>For what weak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> proofs are they</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which before were urged?</hi>

and <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> men of renown for Piety and Learning in the primitive times, and by many other learned men in the times ſucceeding, though otherwiſe of different perſwaſions in the things of God. But <hi>Ryvet</hi> and the Lord <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> held the ſame opinion, both of them grounding the firſt inſtitution of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> on a <hi>Poſitive Law. Legem de Sabbato poſitivam non naturalem agnoſcimus,</hi> are the words of <hi>Ryvet,</hi> p. 173. which is the ſame with the Lord <hi>Primates jus Divinum poſitivum,</hi> though in different terms. And therefore it can be no marvel if <hi>Ryvets</hi> Arguments be cried up for vindicating that paſſage in the ſecond of <hi>Geneſis</hi> in ſo full a manner, that the Lord <hi>Primate can ſee no reaſon in the earth, why any man ſhould make doubt thereof.</hi> And yet there may be good reaſon for it, though he ſee it not.</p>
            <p>Now that the <hi>ſeventh day Sabbath</hi> was not a part, or branch of the Law of Nature, which is obſerved to be a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, following upon the fixing of the firſt inſtitution of it in the ſecond of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> will evidently appear by the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent teſtimonies of learned men, both of the elder and laſt times.

               <p>The ſanctifying of the Sabbath in the firſt beginning, imports a Commandment given to <hi>Adam</hi> for the keeping of it. No ſuch Commandment given to <hi>Adam</hi> in his own perſonal capacity, nor as the common root of mankind. The Patriarchs before the flood did not keep the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> The <hi>Sabbath</hi> not obſerved by the Patriarchs of the line of <hi>Sem,</hi> nor by the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt.</hi> That the Commandment of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar onely to the Jewes, proved by the teſtimony of the Fathers, and the <hi>Jewes</hi> themſelves. That the <hi>ſeventh day</hi> of every week was not kept <hi>holy</hi> by the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> affirmed by ſome of their own beſt Authors, and ſome late Divines. The <hi>Jewes</hi> derided by the <hi>Gentiles</hi> for their ſeventh day <hi>Sabbath.</hi> The Lord <hi>Primates</hi> Antitheſis, <hi>viz.</hi> that the ſeventh day was more honoured by the <hi>Gentiles</hi> then the other ſix, not proved by any ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, either <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latine.</hi> The three <hi>Greek</hi> Poets whom he cites, do not ſerve his turn; and how they came to know that the Creation of the World was finiſhed in ſeven dayes, which is all they ſay. The paſſage of <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Tract <hi>Ad Nationes,</hi> as little to his purpoſe as the three <hi>Greek</hi> Poets. The meaning of that Author in his <hi>Apologeticum</hi> cap. 16. not rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the Lord <hi>Primate;</hi> whoſe Arguments from <hi>Tibul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, Lucian,</hi> and <hi>Lampridius</hi> conclude as little as the reſt. The obſervation of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and other <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies taken up by the later <hi>Gentiles,</hi> not upon any old Tradition, but by Imitation. The custome of the <hi>Romans</hi> in incorporating all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions into their own, and the reaſon of it.</p>

            <p>BUt there is one Concluſion more which follows on the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting</hi>

               <hi>of the</hi> Sabbath <hi>in the first beginning,</hi> and is like to afford us more work then the other did. For if it be all one to <hi>bleſs and ſanctifie the ſeventh day</hi> in the beginning of the World, as to impoſe it then on <hi>Adam</hi> to be kept and ſanctified, as ſome
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:130903:15"/>
ſay it is; it may be very well concluded, that if no ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment was then given to <hi>Adam,</hi> the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was not <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſanctified</hi> in the firſt beginning. Nor can it ſtand with Piety &amp; Reaſon that it ſhould be otherwiſe; For to ſuppoſe, that God did ſet apart, and <hi>ſanctifie the ſeventh day</hi> for a day of worſhip, and yet that no <hi>Commandment</hi> ſhould be given for the keeping of it, what is it but to call in queſtion the moſt infinite wiſedom of Almighty God, which never did any thing in vain? unleſs perhaps we may conceive with <hi>Tornelius,</hi> that the Angels<note place="margin">Annal. d. 7.</note> ſolemnized this firſt <hi>Sabbath</hi> with joyful ſhouts and acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as he gathereth from <hi>Iob</hi> 38. 4, 6. Or that the <hi>WORD,</hi> the ſecond perſon in the <hi>Syntax</hi> of the bleſſed <hi>Trinity,</hi> did take<note place="margin">De creat. homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis l. 1. ad fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</note> our humane ſhape upon him, and came down to <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſpent the whole day with him in ſpiritual exerciſes, as is affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Zanchius,</hi> with an <hi>ego non dubito,</hi> as a matter which no man need make doubt of, but he that liſted. For if any ſuch Commandment was given to <hi>Adam,</hi> it muſt be either given him in his own <hi>perſonal capacity,</hi> or as he was the common <hi>root</hi> of all <hi>mankind,</hi> which was then <hi>virtually</hi> in his loyns, as <hi>Levi</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hebr. 7. 10.</note> is ſaid by the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to have paid Tithes unto <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was then virtually in the Loyns of his Father <hi>Abraham</hi> when thoſe Tithes were paid. But no ſuch precept or command was given to <hi>Adam</hi> in his own perſonal <hi>capacity,</hi> for then the <hi>Sabbath</hi> muſt have died and been buried in the ſame grave with him; nor was it given to him as the common <hi>root</hi> of all <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi> for then all the Nations of the World had been bound to keep it: the contrary whereof we ſhall ſee anon. In the mean time let us take with us the Authority of the Ancient Writers, by ſome of which it is affirmed that no <hi>commandment</hi> was given by God to our Father <hi>Adam,</hi> but that he ſhould abſtain from eating of the fruit of the <hi>Tree</hi> which grew in the <hi>middle of the Garden;</hi> as namely by <hi>Tertullian adverſus Iudaeos.

This is enough to prove that no command for keeping of the <hi>Sabbath day</hi> was given to <hi>Adam</hi> in his own <hi>perſonal capacity,</hi> and no more then ſo; beſides the neceſſary expiring of the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> with him, had it been ſo given. And that it was not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him as the common <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi> will appear as plainly, by the not keeping of that day by any which deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from him, till it was declared unto the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the fall of <hi>Mannah,</hi> and afterwards impoſed upon them by the <hi>fourth Commandment:</hi> for if it had been kept by any, it muſt have been by thoſe of the <hi>godly Line,</hi> from whom our <hi>Saviour</hi> was to derive his <hi>Humane nature;</hi> and yet it hath been proved out of very good Authors that it was never kept by <hi>Abel, Seth, Enos, Enoch,</hi> or <hi>Methuſalem,</hi> nor finally by <hi>Noah</hi> himſelfe, though called in Scripture by the name of a <hi>Preacher of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs;</hi> the proofs whereof may be found at large in the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Sabbath,</hi> Part 1.

And if we find no ſuch obſervance in the Houſe of <hi>Sem,</hi> who were more careful of their wayes, and walked agreeably to the declared will and pleaſure of Almighty God, it were in vain to look for it in the Houſe of <hi>Iaphet,</hi> or in that of the accurſed <hi>Cain,</hi> the founders of the <hi>Europaean</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Nations, or amongſt any others which deſcended from the Sons of <hi>Sem,</hi> who paſs together with the reſt by the name of <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were not bound to obſerve the Sabbath, is proved by divers of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and many of the greateſt Clerks among the <hi>Iewes,</hi> whom affirm expreſly that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Sabbath was given to none but thoſe of the <hi>Houſe of Iſrael.</hi> Of this mind was St. <hi>Auſtin Epiſt. 119.

            <p>And that the Sabbath was not kept by the Gentiles (as well as not impoſed upon them by any Commandment) the <hi>Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> hath made good by two ſeveral <hi>Mediums;</hi> whereof the firſt is taken from the writings of the Gentiles themſelves, by which it doth appear that they gave no greater reſpect to the Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, then to any other day whatever; and that though they celebrate the ſeventh day as a feſtival day, yet was it not the ſeventh day of the <hi>weeek,</hi> but the ſeventh day onely of every

Now how theſe Poets came to know that the Creation <hi>of the World</hi> was finiſhed on the <hi>ſeventh day,</hi> is told us by <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> before mentioned, namely, that<note place="margin">Apud Euſeb.</note> the <hi>Poets</hi> had conſulted with the holy <hi>Bible,</hi> and from thence ſucked this knowledge, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as his own words are. And this may be agreeable enough to the times they lived in. For <hi>Homer</hi> who was the oldeſt of them, flouriſhed about 500. years from the death of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which hapned in or near the Reign of <hi>Solomon</hi> the Son of <hi>David,</hi> the moſt mighty Monarch of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> at what time the people managed a great trade in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and held good correſpondence with thoſe of <hi>Tyre,</hi> from both of which being Sea-faring Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the <hi>Greeks</hi> might come unto the knowledge (derived to them from the Book of <hi>Moſes</hi>) of the Worlds Creation. And as for <hi>Callimachus</hi> who was the lateſt of the three, he lived not till 700. years from the time of <hi>Homer,</hi> which hapned in the Reign of <hi>Seleucus Nicanor,</hi> the firſt King of <hi>Syria</hi> of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonian</hi> Race or Linage, when the Jewes were under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of one or other of the Princes of <hi>Greece,</hi> as Succeſſors to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great in his Eaſtern Conqueſts.</p>
            <p>Now for <hi>Tertullian,</hi> on whoſe Authority the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> doth moſt rely, we find him cited <hi>pag.</hi> 84. in two ſeveral places, each place relating to a ſeveral Tract of that learned Writer. The firſt is taken from the firſt Book and thirteenth Chapter of his Tract inſcribed <hi>Ad Nationes,</hi> publiſhed firſt amongſt the reſt of his Works, in the Edition of <hi>Rigaltius,</hi> and not long after, in a ſmall volume by it ſelfe at <hi>Geneva, Anno</hi> 1625. with <hi>Gothofred</hi> his Notes upon it; ſuppoſed by ſome to be but the rude draught of his <hi>Apologetick adverſus gentes;</hi> but whether it be ſo or not, we muſt take it as it lies before us; and the words are theſe, <hi>viz. Qui ſolem &amp; diem ejus nobis exprobratis, agnoſcite vicinitatem; non longè à Saturno &amp; Sabbatis veſtris ſumus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Where firſt it is to be obſerved, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaks not this of the ancient <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but applies himſelf to thoſe onely of the times he lived in; and therefore no fit Author either to prove the <hi>Propoſition, That the</hi> Heathens <hi>did attribute ſome</hi>

And whereas the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> layes the ſtrength of his Argument on the laſt words of his Author, <hi>viz.

            <p>Theſe paſſages of <hi>Tertullian</hi> being thus explained, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the reſt of the Lord <hi>Primates</hi> Authors will find leſs dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty. <hi>Tibullus</hi> in a verſe of his

            </argument>
            <p>WE are now come at laſt to the firſt of thoſe <hi>Charges,</hi> in which the Author of the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> is concerned by name, touching the diviſion of time into weeks, whether obſerved or not obſerved by the ancient <hi>Gentiles;</hi> in which the Lord Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate thus declares: The <hi>Gentiles</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>both</hi> Civil <hi>and</hi> Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, <hi>both</hi> ancient <hi>and of</hi> later <hi>dayes, as it were by an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal kind of</hi> Tradition, <hi>retain the diſtinction of the</hi> ſeven dayes <hi>of the week, which if Dr.</hi> Heylyn <hi>had read ſo well proved as it is by</hi> Rivetus <hi>and</hi> Salmaſius, <hi>he would not have made ſuch a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as he doth: that becauſe the Heathen (of the four great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies at leaſt) had no distinction of Weeks, therefore they could obſerve no Sabbath,</hi> p. 79. The <hi>Historian</hi> is here ſent to School to learn of <hi>Ryvet</hi> and <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> that the Gentiles both <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>barbarous,</hi> both <hi>ancient</hi> and of <hi>later</hi> dayes, as it were by an univerſal kind of <hi>Tradition,</hi> retained the diſtinction of the <hi>ſeven dayes</hi> of the <hi>week:</hi> of <hi>Ryvet</hi> he muſt learn for one, becauſe he was of the ſame opinion with the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> in the point of the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> and of <hi>Salmaſius</hi> for the other, becauſe he was of the ſame judgement with him in the point of <hi>Epiſcopacy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> But the <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> will not learn of any ſuch Maſters, but onely
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:130903:23"/>
of the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> himſelfe. But firſt it will be neceſſary to know what the Hiſtorian ſaith to the point in hand; and yet not onely what he ſaith (as if he could carry it out on his own Authority) but what he proves by witneſſes of unqueſtioned credit. The paſſage is not long, and therefore without any abbreviation, I ſhall here ſubjoyn it. <q>Whereas it is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved<note place="margin">Purch. pilgr. l. 1. c. 4.</note> by ſome, that the Gentiles by the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> had their <hi>weeks,</hi> which is ſuppoſed to be an argument that they kept the Sabbath; a week being onely of <hi>ſeven</hi> dayes, and commonly ſo called both in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine:</hi> we on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide affirm, that by this very rule, the Gentiles, many of them, if not the moſt, could obſerve no Sabbath; becauſe they did obſerve no weeks. For firſt the <hi>Chaldees</hi> and the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> had no weeks at all: but to the ſeveral dayes of each ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral month appropriated a particular name of ſome King or other; as the <hi>Peruvians</hi> do at this preſent time; <hi>Et nomina</hi>

The <hi>Grecians</hi> alſo did the like in the times of old: there being an old <hi>Attick Calendar</hi> to be ſeen in <hi>Scaliger,</hi> wherein is no diviſion of the month into weeks at all. As for the <hi>Romans,</hi> they divided their account into eights and eights, as the <hi>Jewes</hi> did by ſevens and ſevens; the one reflecting on their <hi>Nundinae,</hi> as the other did upon their Sabbath; <hi>Ogdoas</hi> Romanorum <hi>in tributione dierum ſervabatur propter Nundinas, ut hebdomas apud</hi> Judaeos <hi>propter ſabbatum.</hi> For proof of<note place="margin">Id. l. 4.</note> which there are ſome ancient <hi>Roman Calenders</hi> to be ſeen as yet, one in the aforeſaid <hi>Scaliger,</hi> the other in the <hi>Roman Antiquities</hi> of <hi>John Roſſinus;</hi> wherein the dayes are noted from <hi>A</hi> to <hi>H.</hi> as in our common <hi>Almanacks</hi> from <hi>A.</hi> to <hi>G.</hi>

And for the <hi>Romans,</hi> though they were well enough acquainted with the Planets in their later times; yet they divided not their <hi>Calendars</hi> into <hi>weeks,</hi> as now they do, till near about the time of <hi>Dionyſius Exiguus,</hi> who lived about the year of Chriſt, 520. Nor had they then received it in all probability, had they not long before admitted Chriſtianity throughout their Empire; and therewithal the knowledg of the holy Scriptures, where the account by weeks was exceeding ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Such are the Arguments, and ſuch the Authors, by which the <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> proved (or endevoured to prove) that the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the year into weeks was not known anciently amongſt the Gentiles. And againſt theſe the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> takes not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny exception, but thinks that he hath done his work, if he can find out two or three witneſſes to affirm the contrary: It might have been expected that a man ſo verſt and ſtudied in Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, would have preſt the <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> with the weight of ſuch proofs and evidences as had been digged out of the rock, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted out of the Monuments and Records of the elder times. But on the contrary, we have not ſo much as one ſingle teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny produc'd from any Latine Authors (Hiſtorians, Orators, Poets, or Philoſophers) which lived between the firſt founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Roman</hi> greatneſs, and the declining of the ſame; nor from the writings of thoſe famous men amongſt the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who made their country as renowned for Arts and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as otherwiſe it had been innobled for Arms and Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. For the firſt Author we are ſent to (who though he liv'd far off in reſpect of place, yet liv'd not very far off in regard of time) is one <hi>Helmondus</hi> or <hi>Helmandus,</hi> who wrote the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the <hi>Sclaves,</hi> or <hi>Sclavonian</hi> Nations; Nations not known or heard of by that name in <hi>Europe,</hi> till the year 600, converted to the Chriſtian Faith by <hi>Cyril</hi> and <hi>Methodius,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

the years 860. &amp; 890. So that if the diſtinction of <hi>weeks</hi> did reach <hi>etiam ad ipſos uſque Sauromatas,</hi> and was known to the <hi>Sclavonians themſelves, while they continued in their ancient Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm,</hi> as the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> ſaies it was, <hi>p.</hi> 79. I trow, this can be no ſufficient argument, that the diſtinction of <hi>weeks</hi> was anciently known amongſt the Gentiles, which was the matter to be proved. The <hi>Sclavonians</hi> having conquered <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and thoſe other Provinces which bordered on <hi>Macedon</hi> and <hi>Thrace,</hi> two hundred years at the leaſt before they received the Goſpel, might take up the diſtinction of time into <hi>weeks,</hi> from the Nations whom they had ſubdued, whileſt they were yet in the ſtate of paganiſm, and no harm done to the <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> in the preſent buſineſs: and therefore granting all that hath been ſaid by <hi>Helmoldus,</hi> though a <hi>post-natus,</hi> living about the year 1180. the <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> Propoſition ſtill holds good and unconfuted; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs this Argument be of force, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Sclavonians</hi> when they were in the ſtate of <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> betwixt the year 600. &amp; 860. uſed to aſſemble on the ſecond day of the week <note n="a" place="margin">

The inference of the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and rejected. The firſt day of the week not called the <hi>Lords day</hi> immediately after the firſt <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> as is collected from <hi>Waldenſis,</hi> nor in a long time after. The Lord <hi>Primates</hi> great miſtake in <hi>Tertullians</hi> meaning about the <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi> Each of the fifty dayes which made up the <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> eſteemed as holy by the Primitive Chriſtians, as the Lords day was.

            </argument>
            <p>THe ſecond charge which the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> layes upon the <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> relates unto the holding of the great feaſt of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> upon which day the Holy Ghoſt came down and ſate upon the heads of the Apoſtles, in the ſhape of <hi>cloven fiery tongues;</hi> and added by Saint <hi>Peters</hi> preaching no fewer then three thouſand ſoules to the Church of Chriſt. <q>It was, ſaith
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:130903:26"/>
the <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> a caſual thing that <hi>Pentecost</hi> ſhould fall that year upon the Sunday. It was a moveable feaſt, as unto the day, ſuch as did change and ſhift it ſelfe, according to the poſition of the feaſt of <hi>Paſsover:</hi> the rule being this; that that on what day ſoever the ſecond of the <hi>Paſsover</hi> did fall, upon that alſo fell the great feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt.

                  <note place="margin">Emend. temp. l. 2.</note> hath rightly noted. So that as often as the Paſsover did fall upon the Saturday or Sabbath, as this year it did; then Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt fell upon the Sunday: but when the Paſsover did chance to fall upon the Tueſday, the Pentecoſt fell that year upon the Wedneſday: <hi>&amp; ſic de caeteris.</hi> And if the Rule be true, as I think it is, <hi>that no ſufficient Argument can be drawn from a caſual fact;</hi> and that the falling of the <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> that year, upon the <hi>first day of the week,</hi> be meerly <hi>caſual;</hi> the coming of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> upon that day, will be no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment nor Authority, to ſtate the <hi>firſt day of the week</hi> in the place and honour of the <hi>Iewiſh Sabbath.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> will by no means allow of this, and therefore having framed a diſcourſe concerning the feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> and the day on which it was to be holden, he lets us ſee by a marginal Note, <hi>p.</hi> 90. againſt whom it is that he bends his forces, <hi>viz.</hi> againſt Dr. <hi>Heylyn,</hi> Part 2. c. 1. pag. 14. Let us ſee therefore what he hath to ſay againſt Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi> in this particular, and into what inconveniencies he runs himſelfe by the contradiction. In order whereunto he muſt firſt obſerve how he ſtates the queſtion, and then conſider whether his proofs and arguments will come up to it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> (ſaith he) by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> were not onely to obſerve their weekly Sabbath every ſeventh day, but alſo their <hi>feaſts of weeks</hi> once in the year: which although by the vulgar uſe of the Jewiſh Nation, it may now fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any day of the week, yet doe the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till this day, conſtantly obſerve it on the firſt day of the week, which is our <hi>Sunday;</hi> for which they produce the Letter of the Law, <hi>Leviticus</hi> 23. 15, 16. where the <hi>feaſt of the firſt fruits</hi> (otherwiſe called <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> or the <hi>feaſt of weeks</hi>) is preſcribed to be kept the <hi>morrow after the ſeventh</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:130903:26"/>
                  <hi>Sabbath:</hi> which not they onely, but alſo amongſt our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Interpreters, <hi>Iſychius</hi> and <hi>Rupertus</hi> do interpret to be the firſt day of the week.</q> 
               <bibl>
                  <hi>p.</hi> 87, 88.</bibl> This ground thus laid, and ſome proofs offered (quite beſide the point in queſtion) to ſhew that the Lords day was called by the name of <hi>Sabbath</hi> in ſome ancient Writers, he builds this ſuperſtructure on it, and makes this following <hi>Deſcant</hi> on the former <hi>Plain ſong, viz.</hi> 
               <q>But touching the old <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> it is very conſiderable, that it is no where in <hi>Moſes</hi> affixed unto any one certain day of the month, as all the reſt of the feaſts are; which is a very great preſumption that it was a moveable Feaſt, and ſo vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it might alwayes fall upon the day immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the ordinary <hi>Sabbath.</hi> And if God ſo order the matter, that in the celebration of the feaſt of weeks, the ſeventh day ſhould purpoſely be <hi>paſſed over,</hi> and that ſolemnity ſhould be kept on the <hi>first:</hi> what other thing may we imagine could be preſignified thereby, but that under the ſtate of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> the ſolemnity of the weekly ſervice ſhould be celebrated upon that day?</q> 
               <bibl>
                  <hi>p.</hi> 90.</bibl>
            </p>
            <p>Such is the ſtate of the Queſtion, and ſuch the inference which ariſeth from that ſtating of it; both which are now to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined as they lie before us. And firſt, the feaſt of <hi>firſt fruits</hi> was not otherwiſe called Pentecoſt, or the feaſt of weeks, as the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> ſayes it was. For though two loves in the name of the firſt fruits of the ſecond, or wheat Harveſt, were to be offered to the Lord on the feaſt of weeks, which being celebrated on the fiftieth day, from the ſixteenth of <hi>Niſan,</hi> had the name of <hi>Pentecoſt;</hi> yet was the name of the <hi>feaſt of firſt fruits</hi> appropriated more eſpecially to the ſecond day after the Paſsover, or the ſixteenth of <hi>Niſan,</hi> on which the people offered the firſt fruits of their Barley (which in that country was firſt ripe) and from which the Computation of the ſaid fifty dayes was to take beginning. And it was thus appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for theſe reaſons following. 1. Becauſe the ſixteenth of <hi>Niſan</hi> was the firſt day of their Harveſt, on which the people were to offer the very firſt fruits of the increaſe of the earth (which in that Country was their <hi>Barley</hi>) before which time they were not to eat either bread, or parched corn, or the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:130903:27"/>
green ears of it; this offering to be made in the Sheafe or Gripe, before the Corn was threſht out, <hi>v.</hi> 10. to the end that all the ſubſequent Harveſt, by the offering of theſe firſt fruits, might be bleſt unto them: whereas the offering of the <hi>two loves</hi> in the name of the firſt fruits of their <hi>Wheat,</hi> was not until the end of Harveſt (above ſeven weeks after) when the Wheat was hous'd and threſhed, and made into bread. And ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the name of the <hi>feaſt of firſt fruits</hi> was appropriated to the ſixteenth of <hi>Niſan,</hi> becauſe it had no other name by which it might be dignified above the reſt of the fifty, and diſtinguiſhed from them; whereas the day on which the <hi>two loves</hi> were to be offered, was eminently known by the name of the <hi>feaſt of weeks,</hi> and the feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> and ſometimes alſo called the <hi>feaſt of the Law,</hi> becauſe the Law was given that day by the hand of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place, the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> either did not underſtand the meaning of the word <hi>Sabbath,</hi> Levit. 23. 15, 16. or if he did, he would not ſeem to underſtand it, the better to carry on ſome deſign for the <hi>Sabbatarians:</hi> for by the tenour of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, it appeareth moſt evidently that in both places he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> in no other ſenſe, but as it ſignifies the weekly <hi>Sabbath</hi> of the fourth Commandment, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon concludes, that the computation of the fifty dayes begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning on the <hi>morrow after the Sabbath,</hi> and continuing till <hi>ſeven Sabbaths ſhould be complete even unto the morrow after the ſeventh Sabbath</hi> the feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> muſt of neceſſity fall upon the firſt day of the week which is now our <hi>Sunday.</hi> If ſo, the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batarian</hi> Brethren are in the right, in making the falling of the firſt Chriſtian Pentecoſt, on which the Holy Ghoſt came down, and ſat on the heads of the Apoſtles (three thouſand ſouls being that day added to the Church of Chriſt) to be an argument of ſome weight for their Lords-day Sabbath; and Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi> is in the wrong, for making the falling of that Pentecoſt upon the firſt day of the week, to be a matter of caſualty, the feaſt of Pentecoſt not being tyed to a certain day, but falling on any day of the week, as the year did vary. But by his leave, by <hi>Sabbath</hi> in verſe 15. (<hi>And you ſhall count unto you from the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row after the Sabbath</hi>) we are to underſtand the <hi>feaſt of unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened</hi>

               <hi>bread,</hi> which with all other of the Annual feaſts had the name of <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as appears plainly by many ſeveral paſſages in this very Chapter. And this is that which is obſerved by ſome of the Fathers, <gap reason="foreign">

For ſo we read it in Chap. 18. of Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> where the <hi>Phariſee</hi> boaſted of himſelf, that he <hi>fasted twice a week,</hi> verſe 12. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, ſaith the Greek original, <hi>Jejuno bis in Sabbato,</hi> ſaith the vulgar Latine. Thus alſo in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. &amp; <hi>Luke</hi> 24. we find <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma &amp; una Sabbati,</hi> as the vulgar hath it, to denote the firſt day of the week, as our Engliſh reads it. And then the meaning of the Text will be briefly this, that the feaſt of Pentecoſt (reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the computation from the <hi>morrow after the Sabbath,</hi> that is to ſay, the feaſt of unleavened bread) was to be kept preciſely on the morrow after the end of the ſeventh week, from the ſixteenth of <hi>Niſan,</hi> on what day ſoever it ſhould happen, and not on the morrow after the ſeventh weekly Sabbath, as the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> would fain have it. And therefore thirdly, if the <hi>Samaritans</hi> obſerving it until this day upon the firſt day of the week, which is our <hi>Sunday,</hi> produce the letter of the Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 15, 16. by keeping it upon that day, they tranſgreſs the Law, becauſe they take not along with them the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, and the intent of him that gave it for a Law to the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And this is juſt the caſe of <hi>Origen</hi> in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, who by following the letter of the Goſpel, made himſelf an <hi>Eunuch,</hi> contrary to the mind and meaning of Chriſt our Saviour, and therefore ſinned againſt God and his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Fourthly, and finally, if <hi>Ruportus</hi> ſpeak no otherwiſe then <hi>Iſychius</hi> doth, he muſt be reprehended by the Lord <hi>Primate,</hi> as <hi>Iſychius</hi> is for ſtraining the ſignification of <hi>altera dies Sabbati,</hi> to expreſs thereby the Lords day; though both produced in this place to no other purpoſe, then to prove that the <hi>morrow</hi>

            <p>Let us next ſee what <hi>Superſtructures</hi> have been made by the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> on the former <hi>grounds,</hi> what <hi>deſcant</hi> he hath made on the <hi>plain-ſong,</hi> which before we toucht at.

            </p>
            <p>Now though I ſhould proceed to the examination of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which ariſeth from the former premiſes, yet I ſhall firſt conſider of the proofs and teſtimonies which the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> hath produced in this particular. And the firſt Argument which he brings, is from the practice of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> of whom he
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:130903:29"/>
tells us that <hi>the</hi> Samaritans <hi>do constantly obſerve the</hi> Pentecoſt <hi>on the first day of the week, which is now our Sunday,</hi> p. 87. their practiſe in it being <hi>preferred before the vulgar uſe of the Jewiſh Nation,</hi> by whoſe account it may now fall on any day of the week, as is there affirmed. Aſſuredly the Jews who ſo tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly adhere to their <hi>Circumciſion</hi> and their <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> and ſo religiouſly obſerve the feaſt of unleavened bread, and the feaſt of <hi>Purim</hi> according to the times appointed in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, cannot be thought to violate the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> in keeping the feaſt of <hi>Pentecost</hi> on any day of the week whatſoever, as it chanced to fall. And on the other ſide, the <hi>Samaritans</hi> being lookt upon by the Jewes as Schiſmaticks, as Hereticks alſo by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and divers other Chriſtian Authors, can make no preſident in this caſe, nor ought to have their practice uſed for an Argument to conſute the practiſe of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> the more regular people, and more obſerv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> of the Law, and the punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alities or nicities of it, then the others were.</p>
            <p>Much like to this was the point in difference, between the old Hereticks, called <hi>Quartodecimani<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and the Orthodox Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, about the time of keeping <hi>Eaſter,</hi> which the <hi>Quartode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimani</hi> kept alwayes on the fourteenth day of the month, on what day ſoever it ſhould happen, on which day the Jewes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo kept their <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> the Orthodox Chriſtians keeping it on the Sunday after, in memory of the Reſurrection of our Lord and Saviour, for which the feaſt of <hi>Eaſter</hi> was firſt ordained. He that ſhall juſtifie the <hi>Samaritans</hi> againſt the <hi>Jewes</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> may as well juſtifie the <hi>Quartodecimani</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Orthodox Chriſtians in the caſe of <hi>Eaſter.</hi> And yet to juſtifie the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> it is after added, that <hi>they produce the Letter of the Law,</hi> Levit. 23. 15, 16. <hi>where the</hi> feaſt of the firſt fruits (<hi>otherwiſe called</hi> Pentecoſt, or the feaſt of Weeks) <hi>is preſcribed to be kept</hi> the morrow after the ſeventh Sabbath, which they interpret to be the firſt day of the week, <hi>p.</hi> 87, 88. As if the Jewes did not, or could not keep themſelves to the Letter of the Law, in keeping <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> at the end of fifty dayes, on what day ſoever it might fall, becauſe the <hi>Samaritans</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have the Law on their ſide in that particular. Aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> did not conſider of the abſurdities he hath
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:130903:29"/>
fallen into by thus advocating for the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and fixing the feaſt of Pentecoſt on the morrow after the ſeventh weekly Sabbath; for by this means in ſtead of a feaſt of Pentecoſt to be obſerved on the fiftieth day from the firſt account, we ſhall have a feaſt (by what name ſoever we ſhall call it) to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved on the forty ninth, forty eighth, and forty ſeventh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which though they may be called the <hi>feaſts of Weeks,</hi> or the feaſts of the Law, cannot by any means be called the feaſt of Pentecoſt. For if the ſixteenth of <hi>Niſan,</hi> or the feaſt of firſt fruits fall upon the <hi>Monday,</hi> the feaſt of <hi>Pentecost</hi> (improperly ſo called) muſt be kept upon the forty ninth; if on <hi>Tueſday,</hi> on the forty eighth day after; and ſo abating of the number till we come to <hi>Saturday;</hi> on which day, if the ſixteenth of <hi>Niſan</hi> ſhould chance to fall (as ſometimes it muſt,) the next day after the ſeventh Sabbath would be but the forty fourth day; and ſo by the Lord <hi>Primates</hi> Rule, we ſhall have a feaſt of Pentecoſt but once in ſeven years, that is to ſay, when the ſixteenth of <hi>Niſan</hi> did fall upon the firſt day of the week, which is now our <hi>Sunday;</hi> a feaſt of Weeks, or of giving of the Law on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſix. <hi>Adeo Argumenta ex abſurdo petita ineptos habent exitus,</hi> ſaid <hi>Lactantius</hi> truely.</p>
            <p>The ſecond proof is borrowed from the teſtimony of <hi>Iſychi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> an old Chriſtian Writer (who lived about the year 600.) interpreting the <hi>morrow after the ſeventh Sabbath,</hi> as the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans</hi> alſo do, to be the firſt day of the Week.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:130903:30"/>
telling us that he made no ſcruple to <hi>call the day of Chriſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection another Sabbath day.</hi> For if we look upon it well, we ſhall not find that <hi>Iſychius</hi> calls the day of the Reſurrection by the name of another Sabbath day, but onely telleth us that the Lords day, the day on which our Saviour roſe, was <hi>altera dies Sabbati,</hi> that is to ſay, the firſt day of the Week, or the morrow after the Sabbath (underſtand by <hi>Sabbath</hi> in this place, the feaſt of unleavened bread) from whence the fifty dayes, which ended in the feaſt of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> were to take beginning, as will appear by comparing theſe words with thoſe before, <hi>viz. ab altero die Sabbati memorari praecepit quinquaginta dies.</hi> If the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> can find no better comfort from the Council of <hi>Friuli,</hi> cap. 13. for calling the day of Chriſts Reſurrection by the name of <hi>another Sabbath day;</hi> he will finde but little, if not leſs, from thoſe words of Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> to which the ſaid Council of <hi>Friuli</hi> is ſuppoſed to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude. The Fathers words on which the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> doth rely, to prove that the Lords day was then called a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as both <hi>Iſychius</hi> and the ſaid Council of <hi>Friuli</hi> are preſumed<note place="margin">In Pſal. 47.</note> to do, are theſe that follow, <hi>viz. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi Dominica dies coepit praecellere, quâ Dominus reſurrexit, Sabbatum quod primum erat ſecundum haberi coepit à primo.</hi> In which paſſage he would have us think that the <hi>Lords day</hi> is called <hi>primum Sabbatum,</hi> or the <hi>firſt Sabbath;</hi> and the Saturday <hi>Sabbatum ſecundum,</hi> or the <hi>ſecond Sabbath.</hi> Whereas indeed the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Father is no more then this, that after the Lords day had grown into eſtimation, and got the better, as it were, of the <hi>Jewiſh Sabbath (ubi Dominica dies coepit praecel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lere, &amp;c.</hi>) the <hi>Sabbath</hi> of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> which was before the firſt in honour and account, began to be lookt upon in the ſecond place, the firſt being given unto the day of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.

            <p>

            <p>Nor is the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> leſs zealous to entitle the Lords day to ſome <hi>Divinity,</hi> then to gratifie the <hi>Sabbatarian Brethren,</hi> by giving it the name of the <hi>Sabbath day.</hi> For this is that which is chiefly aimed at in the inference, wherein I would very cheerfully concur in opinion with him, but that I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied in the grounds of it. For if I were ſatisfied in this, <hi>that God ſo ordered the matter, that in the celebration of the feaſt of</hi> Weeks, <hi>the</hi> ſeventh day <hi>ſhould purpoſely be paſſed over, and that ſolemnity ſhould be kept upon the first;</hi> I ſhould as eaſily grant as he, that <hi>nothing was more likely to be preſignified thereby, then that under the ſtate of the Gospel the ſolemnity of the weekly ſervice ſhould be celebrated upon that day,</hi> p. 90. But being I cannot grant the firſt for the reaſons formerly delivered, I cannot on the like, or for better reaſons, admit the ſecond. I grant that under the ſtate of the Goſpel, the ſolemnities of the weekly ſervice were celebrated on that day; and yet I can neither agree with him, nor with <hi>Thomas Waldenſis,</hi> whom he cites to that purpoſe, that the Lords day did preſently ſucceed. (<hi>Tunc intraſſe Dominicam loco ejus</hi>) in the place thereof, as <hi>Baptiſm preſently</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>ſucceeded in the place of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> For though Saint <hi>John<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Apocal.</hi> 1. call the firſt day of the week by the name of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> as moſt Chriſtian Writers think he did, yet doth it not follow thereupon that it was ſo called, <hi>ſtatim poſt miſſionem ſpiritus Sancti</hi> (as <hi>Waldenſis</hi> would have it) immediately on the comming down of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> For not onely in the eighteenth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> which was ſome yeares after the firſt <hi>Chriſtian Pentecoſt,</hi> but in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> it is given us by no other name, then that of the <hi>first day of the Week;</hi> nor did Saint <hi>John</hi> write the <hi>Revelation,</hi> in which the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:130903:31"/>
name of the Lords day is firſt given unto it, till the ninty fourth or ninty fifth year from our Saviours birth, which was ſixty years, or thereabouts, from the coming down of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> the firſt Chriſtian Pentecoſt. And though I am not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to derogate from the honour of ſo great a day, yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not agree with the Lord <hi>Primate, That it is in a manner gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally acknowledged by all, that on that day (viz.</hi> the firſt day of the week) <hi>the famous Pentecoſt in the ſecond of the Acts was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</hi> For <hi>Lorinus</hi> in his Commentary on the ſecond of the <hi>Acts,</hi> tells us of ſome who hold, that at the time of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours ſuffering, the <hi>Paſsover</hi> fell upon the <hi>Thurſday,</hi> and then the Pentecoſt muſt of neceſſity fall upon the <hi>Saturday,</hi> or Jewiſh Sabbath. But ſeeing it is ſaid to be agreed on generally <hi>in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> onely, let it paſs for once. All which conſidered, I ſhall and will adhere to my former vote, <hi>viz.</hi> that if the rule be true, as I think it is, <hi>that no ſufficient argument can be drawn from a caſual fact, and that the falling of the</hi> Pentecoſt <hi>that year, upon the firſt day of the week, be meerly caſual; the comming of the Holy Ghost upon that day will be no Argument nor Authority to ſtate the firſt day of the week in the place and honour of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Sabbath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now before I ſhut up this Diſpute about the Pentecoſt, I ſhall crave leave to put the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> in mind of a great miſtake which he hath fallen into, by putting another ſenſe on <hi>Tertullians</hi> words, about the firſt <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> as obſerved by the Chriſtians, than was intended by that Author. For telling us, p. 85. <q>That the Gentiles did not celebrate their Saturdays with that ſolemnity, wherewith themſelves did their Annual Feſtivities, or the Jews their weekly Sabbaths; he bringeth for a proof thereof a paſſage cited out of the fourteenth Chapter of <hi>Tertullian, De Idololatria;</hi> by which it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, ſaith be, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> thus ſpeaks unto the Chriſtians, who obſerved 52.

               </gap>y to refreſh their ſpirits, or indulge ſomething to the fleſh, they had more feſtivals of their own then the Gentiles had. The number of the feaſts obſerved by the Gentiles, being ſo ſhort of thoſe which were kept by the Chriſtians of his time, <hi>ut Pentecoſten non potuerint,</hi> they could not equal the feſtival of the <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> onely, much leſs the Pentecoſt and the Lords day together. And ſo it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by <hi>Pamelius</hi> in his Notes upon that place; where firſt he telleth us, that the Author in that place underſtands not onely the feaſt of Pentecoſt it ſelfe, or the laſt day of fifty, <hi>ſed etiam tempus illud integrum à die Paſchae in Pentecoſten,</hi> but the whole ſpace of time betwixt it and the <hi>Paſſeover</hi> (taking the word <hi>Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over</hi> in the largeſt ſenſe, as it comprehends alſo the feaſt of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened bread.) But what need <hi>Pamelius</hi> come in place, when it is commonly avowed by the ancient Writers, that all the fifty dayes which made up the Pentecoſt, were generally eſteemed as holy, and kept with as great reverence and ſolemnity as the Lords day was? No faſting upon the one nor upon the other; <hi>Die dominico jejunium nefas ducimus, vel de geniculis adorare;</hi>

            <p>To ſhut up this Diſpute, in which we have encountred ſo
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:130903:32"/>
many errors, the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> tells us very rightly, <hi>that on the day of the Paſſeover, Chriſt our Paſſeover was ſlain for us, that he reſted in the grave the whole Sabbath following</hi> (commonly called the feaſt of unleavened bread) <hi>the next day after that, the first fruits of the</hi> firſt (<hi>or</hi> Barley) <hi>Harveſt was offered unto God, and that from thence the count was taken of the ſeven Sabbaths, and that upon the morrow after the ſeventh Sabbath (which was our</hi> Lords day) <hi>was celebrated the feaſt of weeks, &amp;c.</hi> Upon which offering of the ſheaf of the firſt fruits of the firſt, or (<hi>Barley</hi>) Harveſt (which hapned at the time of our Saviours ſuffering on the firſt day of the Week) he gives this note, that Chriſt roſe from the dead upon that day, <hi>and became the firſt fruits of them that ſlept; many bodies of the Saints that ſlept</hi> ariſing likewiſe after him, <hi>p</hi> 91. And for this note, he receives great thanks from Dr. <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> ſignifying in a letter to him the <hi>great ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he received from him, in opening the myſtery of the</hi> feaſts of firſt fruits, <hi>to the ſingular advantage of the Lords day, in the time of the Gospel,</hi> p. 103. But herein Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> may be ſaid to be like thoſe men of whom <hi>Tully</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Qui non tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tùm ornarent aliquem ſuis laudibus, ſed honorarent alienis.</hi> For without derogating in the leaſt from the honour due to the Lord Primate, I cannot ſay that the honour of the firſt <hi>opening</hi> of this <hi>mystery</hi> doth belong to him; it being an obſervation which I had both read in Books, and heard in Sermons many years before 1640. in which (or but the year before) the Lord Primate wrote this preſent Letter to Doctor <hi>Twiſſe.</hi> But becauſe I have but few Books by me, and cannot readily call to mind in what Books I read it, I ſhall content my ſelfe at this preſent with the gloſs of <hi>Deodati</hi> on the twentieth verſe of the fifteenth Chapter of the firſt Epiſtle to thoſe of <hi>Corinth,</hi> where it is ſaid, that Chriſt was riſen again, and was become <hi>the firſt fruits of them that ſlept,</hi> premiſing onely by the way, that <hi>Diodati</hi> began thoſe <hi>Annotations</hi> in the <hi>Italian</hi> tongue, about the year 1606. to give his Country-men an inſight of the darkneſs wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they lived, which afterwards he poliſhed and perfected in ſuch manner, as they are now come into our hands.

Proofs from the best of the Greek Fathers, that the Sabbath was kept as an holy day by the Primitive Christians; The contrary not proved by theſe two testimonies which are alledged from the Council of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> and the words of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great. The Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi> prohibits not the keeping of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, but the keeping of it after the manner of the <hi>Jews,</hi> by abstaining from all kind of work. The <hi>Sabbatarians</hi> by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing a reſtraint from all manner of work on the <hi>Lords day,</hi> are by <hi>Pope Gregory</hi> the Great made the Preachers of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt.

            </argument>
            <p>THe third charge laid by name on the <hi>Historian,</hi> relates unto a paſſage cited out of the Epiſtle of <hi>Ignatius Ad Magneſianos;</hi> in which he doth not ſtand accuſed either for falſifying the words of his Author, or putting a wrong ſenſe upon them; but onely for not conſulting with an old Latine
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:130903:33"/>
copy of <hi>Ignatius</hi> which he never heard of. The <hi>Historian</hi> had then by him no fewer then four Editions of that Father, one publiſhed by <hi>Mastreus</hi> the Jeſuite, both in Greek and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine; another in both languages, publiſhed by <hi>Vedelius</hi> a <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevian,</hi> with his notes upon it; a third more ancient then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, printed at <hi>Paris,</hi> in both languages alſo, but the year I remember not; and a fourth in Latine onely, but of a very old Print, ſubjoyned unto the works of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite.</hi> Out of all which compared together, he cited that paſſage out of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Magneſians,</hi> againſt which the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> hath excepted, and is this that followeth; <q>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. Let us not keep the Sabbath in a Jewiſh manner, in ſloth and idleneſs; for it is written, that <hi>he that will not labour ſhall not eat,</hi> and in <hi>the ſweat of thy brows ſhalt thou eat thy bread.</hi> But let us keep it after a ſpiritual faſhion, not in bodily eaſe, but in the ſtudy of the Law; not eating meat dreſſed yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, or drinking luke-warm drinks, or walking out a limited ſpace, or ſetling our delights, as they did, on dancing; but in the contemplation of the works of God, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, &amp;c. And after we have ſo kept the Sabbath, let every one that loveth Chriſt, keep the <hi>Lords day</hi> feſtival, the Reſurrection day, the Queen and Empreſs of all dayes; in which our life was raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and death was overcome by our Lord and Saviour. So that we ſee he would have both dayes obſerved; the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath firſt, though not as would the <hi>Ebionites,</hi> in a Jewiſh ſort: and after that the Lords day, which he ſo much magnifieth, the better to abate that high eſteem which ſome had caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Sabbath.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Againſt this paſſage, and the inference which is raiſed upon it, the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> firſt objecteth, ſaying, that there is no ſuch thing to be found in an old Latine copy of the works of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> which is to be ſeen in the Library of <hi>Caius Colledge</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> which for many reſpects he doth prefer before any Greek Edition then extant. And in that old Latine copy, ſaith he, there is nothing to be found in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Magneſians,</hi> touching the Sabbath and the Lords day, but theſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:130903:33"/>
words onely, <hi>viz. Non amplius Sabbatizantes, ſed ſecundum Dominicam viventes, in qua &amp; vita noſtra orta est.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he doth infer that all thoſe other words alledged by Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Heylyn</hi> (Part 2. page 43.)<q> to prove that <hi>Ignatius</hi> would have both the Sabbath and the Lords day obſerved, were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards added by ſome later Grecian, who was afraid that the cuſtome of keeping both dayes obſerved in his time, ſhould appear otherwiſe to be directly oppoſite to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
               </q> 
               <bibl>p. 95, 96.</bibl> This is the eaſieſt <hi>charge</hi> that may be, and if there were nothing elſe intended, but to ſhew that the <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> was not the Maſter of ſo much good fortune, as to have ſeen the <hi>old Latine Copy</hi> in <hi>Caius Library</hi> before he undertook that work, we might here end this Section without more ado. But the main matter aim'd at in it, is to diſprove that which the <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> hath delivered, concerning the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of both dayes, as well the old <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as the new <hi>Lords day</hi> by the Primitive Chriſtians. That which the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> cites out of the third Book of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> to ſhew that the main intention of <hi>Ignatius</hi> was to oppoſe the <hi>Ebionites</hi> of his own time, is no more then what he might have found in the ſame Part and Page of the <hi>Hiſtory of the Sabbath,</hi> which himſelfe hath cited; and therefore might have here been ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, were it not uſed by him as an Argument to prove that which no body doth deny, <hi>viz. That by their imitation of the Church herein the antiquity of the obſervation of the Lords day might be further confirmed,</hi> p. 96. Nor is it to much better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that he proves the univerſality of the obſervance of the Lords day, out of another paſſage of the ſame <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his Book <hi>De laudibus Conſtantini;</hi> in which he doth but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, having no other Adverſary (that I know of) to contend with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. The Author of that Hiſtory had ſaid ſo much of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the Lords day, and the Univerſality of the obſervance of the ſame, with many other things conducing to the honour of that ſacred day; that he received thanks for it ſent to him in the name of divers Miniſters living in <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi> and <hi>Surrey</hi> (though of a different perſwaſion from him in other points about that day) whom he never ſaw. But that the Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, or old Sabbath, was not kept holy at the firſt by the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:130903:34"/>
Chriſtians, by thoſe eſpecially who lived in the Eaſtern parts of the Roman Empire; neither the <hi>antiquity</hi> nor the <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality</hi> of keeping the <hi>Lords day</hi> can evince at all.</p>
            <p>For on the contrary, that the old Sabbath was kept holy by the Primitive Chriſtians, is proved firſt by the <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> aſcribed to <hi>Clement</hi> (of good Authority in the Church, though not made by them) where it is ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. By which it evidently appears, that both dayes were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be kept <hi>holy,</hi> the one in memorial of the <hi>Creation,</hi> the other of the <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> Which <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> being not thought to be of weight enough to make good the point (though of ſo great antiquity and eſtimation, as to be mentioned and made uſe of by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> a right learned man) are ſomewhat backt by the Authority of <hi>Theophilus Antiochenus</hi> an old Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Biſhop, who lived not long time after <hi>Ignatius, Anno</hi> 174. by whom we are told of that great honour which the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day or Jewiſh Sabbath had attained unto (<hi>qui apud om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes mortales celebris est,</hi> as before we had it in our fourth Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on another occaſion) with all ſorts of people. But if this be not plain enough, as I think it is, they are ſecondly moſt ſtrongly countenanced by the Authority of the Synod held in <hi>Laodicea</hi> (a Town of <hi>Phrygia) Anno</hi> 314. where there paſſed a Canon <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, they uſed to<note place="margin">Expoſ. fidei Cath. 24.</note> celebrate the holy Sacrament, and hold their publick meetings on the <hi>Sabbath day.</hi> And ſixthly, the Homily <hi>De Semonte</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> doth affirm as much, as to the publick Aſſemblies of the Chriſtians on the <hi>Sabbath day;</hi> and ſo doth <hi>Socrates</hi> the Hiſtorian, who accounts both dayes for weekly feſtivals, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, that on them both the Congregation uſed to be aſſembled, and the whole Liturgy performed. By which account, beſides <hi>Socrates,</hi> and the Author of the Conſtitutions, againſt whom ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections have been pretended, we have the Teſtimonies of <hi>Theophilus Antiochenus, Gregory Nyſſen, Baſil, Epiphanius,</hi> and the Author of the Homily <hi>De Semente</hi> aſcribed to <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius,</hi> moſt plain and poſitive in this point, that both the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> and the <hi>Lords day</hi> were obſerved for days of publick mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by the Eaſtern Chriſtians, as was affirmed before out of the Epiſtle of <hi>Ignatius ad Magneſ.</hi> And I conceive that the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> did not, or could not think (or if he did, cannot be juſtified for ſo thinking) that men of ſuch an eminent ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as thoſe Fathers were, would falſifie that Epiſtle of <hi>Ignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> to ſerve their turns, or adde any thing to that Epiſtle which
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:130903:35"/>
they found not in it, <hi>out of a fear that the cuſtome of keeping both dayes obſerved in their times, ſhould appear otherwiſe to be directly oppoſite to the ſentence of Ignatius,</hi> p. 96. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Doctor <hi>Heylyn</hi> taking the words of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> as he found them in the ſeveral Greek Editions above mentioned, and finding them ſo well backt and countenanced by thoſe holy Fathers which ſucceeded in their ſeveral times, need not be troubled at the ſtarting out of an old Latine Manuſcript, ſo different from the Greek Editions, as it ſeems to be; nor to recede from any thing which he hath cited out of thoſe <hi>Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> becauſe the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> findes it not in his Latine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript.</p>
            <p>The paſſage of <hi>Ignatius Ad Magneſianos,</hi> cited by the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian,</hi> being juſtified by ſo many good Authors, all living and writing (except <hi>Socrates</hi> onely) in the four firſt Centuries; we muſt next ſee what the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> hath to object againſt it, or any thing therein delivered, or rather to confirm his correction of it out of the <hi>old Latine Copy</hi> in the Library of <hi>Caius Colledge.</hi> The old Latine Copy hath it thus, <hi>Non am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plius Sabbatizantes, ſed ſecundum Dominicam viventes, in qua &amp; vita nostra orta eſt.</hi> And this he thinks to be a ſufficient Argument to prove, <hi>that the Lords day was obſerved as a weekly holy day by the Chriſtians in the room of the abrogated Sabbath of the Jewes,</hi> p. 93. Though no ſuch thing can be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, either as to the weekly celebrating of the Lords day, or the abrogating of the Jewiſh Sabbath from his Authors words. But then as well to juſtifie the reading of this old La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Copy, as to refel that which the Hiſtorian had obſerved from the Greek Editions, he gives us two Authorities, and no more but two: The firſt is the Authority of the Fathers in the Council of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> touching the time whereof (whether he or the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> be in the right) we diſpute not now; By whom it was declared, <hi>quod non oportet Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos Judaizare, &amp; in Sabbat o otiari, ſed ipſos eo die operari; diem autem Dominicam praeferentes, otiari (ſi modo poſſint) ut chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anos,</hi> p. 98. But unto this it may be anſwered, that this Canon (it is the 29 in number) relates not to the meetings of the Chriſtians on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> or <hi>Saturday</hi> for Gods publick ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:130903:35"/>
but to the uſage of ſome men, who did ſeem to Judaize upon it, by giving themſelves to eaſe and idleneſs, and to reſt from labour when the ſervice of the day was ended. And that the Canon meant no more then to reprove ſuch men as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Saturday or Sabbath after the manner of the Jewes, and to take order for the conttary in the time to come, appears moſt evidently by the great care they took touching the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing of that day, and the Divine Offices to be done upon it, declared in three ſeveral Canons, the ſumme whereof we have ſeen already in this Section. So that this firſt part of that Canon aimed at no other end, but by ordaining that the people ſhould work on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> or <hi>Saturday</hi> (ſuppoſe it ſtill after the publick ſervice of the day was ended) thereby to diſtinguiſh them from the Jewes, who would not work at all upon it. And then that this diſtinction between them and the Jewes might appear more evidently, it was ordered in the later part of that Canon, that preferring the Lords day before it, they ſhould as Chriſtians reſt from labour on that day, if their occaſions would permit them: For if we mark it as we ſhould, we ſhall not find that the Fathers abſolutely preſcribed any ſuch ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from all, or any work (for which purpoſe it is chiefly ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) but onely with a <hi>ſi modo poſſint,</hi> if neither Maſters, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, or other Superiors ſhould command them otherwiſe, or that the conveniency of their own affairs, or the doing of good offices to their neighbour, did not occaſion them to diſpoſe of it, or ſome part thereof on ſome bodily labour. The Canon muſt be thus expounded, or elſe it muſt run croſs to thoſe which before were mentioned, which were ridiculous to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine in ſo grave a meeting. The next Authority is taken from <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> who telleth us that it is the Doctrine of the Preachers of Antichriſt, <hi>qui veniens diem Dominicum &amp; Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batum ab omni opere faeciet cuſtodiri,</hi> who at his coming ſhall cauſe both the <hi>Lords day</hi> and the <hi>Sabbath</hi> to be kept or cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated without doing any manner of work. A paſſage very ſtrangely cited, and ſuch as I conceive the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> will neither ſtand to, nor be ruled by upon ſecond thoughts. For if it be the Doctrine of the Preachers of Antichriſt, that no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of work is to be done upon the Saturday or Sabbath, it is
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:130903:36"/>
the Doctrine of the ſame Preachers of Antichriſt, that no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of work be done on the Lords day neither. And if it be the Doctrine of the Preachers of Antichriſt, that no manner of work ſhould be done on the Lords day, what will become of all our Engliſh <hi>Sabbatarians,</hi> and their Abetrers, who impoſe as many reſtraints of this kind upon Chriſtian people, as ever were impoſed on the Jewes by the Scribes and Phariſees? What will become of thoſe who framed the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or have ſince ſubſcribed them, or preacht, or writ accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the tenour of them; in one of which it is decreed, <hi>that the first day of the week, which is the Lords day, is wholly to be dedicated to the ſervice of God, and that therefore we are bound therein to reſt from all common and daily buſineſs?</hi> The Lord <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> did not well conſider of theſe inconveniencies, when he brought in <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> to bear witneſs for him. And in that want of conſideration, he falls on Doctor <hi>Francis White,</hi> Lord Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> a right learned man, for rendring Pope <hi>Gregories</hi> words by a ſtrange kind of miſtake in turning this word <hi>and</hi> the Copulative, into <hi>or</hi> the Diſjunctive. But poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly this may be a fault of the Printers, or a ſlip of the Pen, without any purpoſe or deſign of altering the leaſt word, or true intention of that Father. And ſecondly, whether it be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the Copulative <hi>and,</hi> or the Diſjunctive <hi>or,</hi> is not much material; for if it be the Doctrine of the Preachers of Antichriſt, to teach men to abſtain from all manner of work both on the <hi>Saturday</hi> and the <hi>Sunday;</hi> it is, no doubt, the Doctrine of the ſame preachers of Antichriſt, to teach men to abſtaine from all manner of work upon the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday, or the Sunday. So that the Lord Primate might have ſpared that exception againſt a man of his own order, and of ſo great Abilities in the Schools of Learning; but he held a contrary opinion to the <hi>Sabbatarians,</hi> and therefore was to fare no better then the Author of the <hi>History</hi> had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before him. And herein the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> ſeems to be of the ſame mind with the famous Orator, who held it very juſt and equitable, <hi>ut qui in eadem cauſa ſint in eadem item eſſent fortuna.</hi> And ſo much for that.</p>

which might render the <hi>Historian</hi> the leſs able either to traverſe the Indictment, or plead <hi>not guilty</hi> to the Bill. <q>I wonder (ſaith he in his Letter to an <hi>Honourable Perſon,</hi> pag. 110.) how Doctor <hi>Heylyn,</hi> having himſelf ſubſcribed to the Articles of Religion agreed upon in the Synod held at <hi>London, Anno</hi> 1562. can oppoſe the concluſion, which he findeth directly laid down in the <hi>Homily</hi> of the <hi>time and place of Prayer,</hi> viz. <hi>God hath given expreſs charge to all men in the fourth Commandment, that upon the Sabbath day, which is now our Sunday, they ſhall ceaſe from all weekly and week-day labour, to the intent, that like as God himſelf wrought ſix dayes, and rested the ſeventh, and bleſſed and conſecrated it to quietneſs and reſt from labour, even ſo Gods obedient peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould uſe the Sunday holily, and reſt from their common and dayly buſineſs, and alſo give themſelves wholly to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly exerciſe of Gods true Religion and ſervice.</hi>
               </q> This is the <hi>charge</hi> which the <hi>Historian</hi> ſuffers under, wherewith the Lord <hi>Primate,</hi> as it ſeems, did ſo pleaſe himſelf, that like a <hi>crambe his cocta,</hi> it is ſerved in again in his Letter unto Mr. <hi>Ley;</hi> but uſhered in with greater preparation then before it was. For whereas Mr. <hi>Ley</hi> had hammered a Diſcourſe about the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> which he communicated to the Lord <hi>Primate,</hi> to the end it might be approved by him, the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> finds ſome fault with the modeſty of the man, as if he came not home enough in his <hi>Propoſitions</hi> to the point in hand; <q>Your ſecond <hi>Propoſition</hi> (ſaith he <hi>p.</hi> 105.) is too wateriſh, <hi>viz. That this Doctrine rather then the contrary is to be held the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England; <hi>and may well be gathered out of her publick Liturgy, and the first part of the Homily concerning the place and time of prayer.</hi> Whereas you ſhould have ſaid, that this is to be held <hi>undoubtedly</hi> the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> For if there could be any reaſonable doubt made of the meaning of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in her <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,</hi> who ſhould better declare her meaning then her ſelf in her <hi>Homily?</hi> where ſhe peremptorily declareth her mind; <hi>That in the fourth Commandment God hath given expreſs charge to all men, &amp;c.</hi> as before we had it.</q>

            <p>Aſſuredly a man that reads theſe paſſages cannot chuſe

but think that the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> was a very zealous Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> but upon better conſideration we ſhall find it otherwiſe, &amp; that he only advoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth for the <hi>Sabbatarians,</hi> not onely contrary to the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but the practiſe alſo: which that we may the better ſee, I ſhall lay down plainly, and without any <hi>ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry</hi> at all, upon what grounds the Lords day ſtood in the Church of <hi>England</hi> at the time of the making of this <hi>Homily,</hi> both <hi>abſolutely</hi> in it ſelf, and <hi>relatively</hi> in reſpect of the other <hi>Holy dayes.</hi> And firſt we are to underſtand, that by the joint Declaration of the Lords Spiritual &amp; Temporal, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons aſſembled in Parliament in the 5. &amp; 6. years of King <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. the <hi>Lords day</hi> ſtands on no other ground then the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church, not as enjoyned by Chriſt, or ordained by any of his Apoſtles.

               <q>Foraſmuch as men be not at all times ſo mindful to laud and praiſe God, ſo ready to reſort to hear Gods holy word, and to come to the holy Communion, &amp;c. as their bounden duty doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; therefore to call men to remembrance of their duty, and to help their infirmities, it hath been wholſomly provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that there ſhould be ſome certain <hi>times and dayes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed</hi> wherein Chriſtians ſhould ceaſe from all <hi>kind of labour,</hi> and apply themſelves onely and wholly unto the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid <hi>holy works,</hi> properly pertaining to true Religion, &amp;c. which works, as they may well be called <hi>Gods ſervice,</hi> ſo the times eſpecially appointed for the ſame, are called <hi>holy dayes:</hi> Not for the <hi>matter</hi> or the <hi>nature</hi> either of the <hi>time</hi> or <hi>day,</hi> &amp;c. for ſo all <hi>dayes</hi> and <hi>times</hi> are of like holineſs, but for the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>condition</hi> of ſuch <hi>holy works,</hi> &amp;c. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ſuch <hi>dayes</hi> and <hi>times</hi> are ſanctified and hallowed, that is to ſay, ſeparated from all <hi>profane uſes,</hi> and dedicated not unto any Saint or Creature, but onely unto God and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. <hi>Neither is it to be thought that there is any certain time, or definite number of dayes</hi>

in every Country by the diſcretion of the <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> thereof, as they ſhall judge moſt expedient to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth of Gods glory, and edification of their people.</q>  Which Statute being repealed in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> was revived again in the firſt year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and did not ſtand in force at the time of the making of this <hi>Homily,</hi> which the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> ſo much builds on, but at ſuch time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo as he wrote his Letter to Mr. <hi>Ley,</hi> and to that <hi>Honourable Perſon</hi> whoſoever he was.</p>
            <p>But ſince he hath appeal'd to the Book of <hi>Homilies,</hi> to the Book of Homilies let him go, where he ſhall find as little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort as he found in the Statute. For in the <hi>Homily</hi> touching the <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place</hi> of <hi>prayer,</hi> out of which the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> hath ſelected this particular paſſage, it is thus <hi>doctrinally</hi> reſolved, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>As concerning the <hi>time,</hi> in which God hath appointed his people to aſſemble together ſolemnly, it doth appear by the <hi>fourth Commandment, &amp;c.</hi> And albeit this command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God doth not bind Chriſtian people ſo ſtreightly to obſerve and keep the utter Ceremonies of the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> as it did the <hi>Jewes,</hi> as touching the forbearing of work and labour in the time of great neceſſity, and as touching the preciſe keeping of the ſeventh day, after the manner of the <hi>Jews;</hi> (for we keep now the firſt day which is our Sunday, and make that our Sabbath, that is, <hi>our day of reſt,</hi> in honour of our Saviour Chriſt, who as upon that day roſe from death, conquering the ſame moſt triumphantly:) <hi>Yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whatſoever is found in the Commandment, appertaining to the Law of Nature, as a thing most godly; most iust and needful for the ſetting forth of Gods glory, ought to be retained and kept of all good chriſtian people.</hi>
               </q> So that it being thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that there is no more of the fourth Commandment to be retained by good Chriſtian people, then what is <hi>found apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the Law of Nature;</hi> &amp; that the law of nature doth not tie us to one day in 7. or more to one day of the 7. then to any other: let us next ſee by what Authority the day was changed, &amp; how it came to be tranſlated from the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to the firſt. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which it follows thus in the ſaid Homily, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and commandment of God, the godly chriſtian people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:130903:38"/>
                  <hi>to follow, immediately after the Aſcenſion of our Lord Chriſt, and began to chuſe them a ſtanding day of the week to come together in;</hi> (the very ſame with that before declared in the Act of Parliament) <hi>yet not the ſeventh day, which the Jewes kept, but the Lords day, the day of the Lords Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the day after the ſeventh day, which is the first day of the week, &amp;c.</hi> Sit hence which time Gods people hath always, in all ages, without any gainſaying, uſed to come together on the Sunday to celebrate and honour Gods bleſſed name, and carefully to keep that day in holy reſt and quietneſs, both man and woman, child, ſervant, and ſtranger.</q>  So far the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; and by the Homily it appears plainly that the keeping of the Lords day is not grounded on any commandment of Chriſt, nor any precept of the Apoſtles, but that it was <hi>choſen as a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding day of the week to come together in, by the godly chriſtian people, immediately after Chriſts Aſcenſion,</hi> and hath ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ever ſince. So then, the keeping of the Lords day being built on no other grounds (as is declared both in the Homily and the Act of Parliament) then the authority of the Church, the conſent of godly Chriſtian people; it muſt needs follow thereupon, that it is to be kept with no greater ſtrictneſs (with reference either unto worldly buſineſs, or honeſt recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) then what is required of the people by the Law of the Land, the Canons of the Church, or by the Edicts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of the King, or other ſupreme Governour under whom we live. And if we pleaſe to look into the Act of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament before remembred, we ſhall find it thus in reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>worldly buſineſs,</hi> viz. <q>It ſhall be lawful to every <hi>Huusband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Labourer, Fiſherman,</hi> and to all and every <hi>other Perſon or Perſons,</hi> of what Eſtate, Degree, or Condition he or they be, upon the <hi>Holy dayes</hi> aforeſaid (of which the Lords day is there reckoned for one) <hi>in Harveſt,</hi> or at any other times in the year, when <hi>neceſſity ſhall ſo require,</hi> to labour, ride, fiſh, or work any kind of work at their free will and pleaſure: any thing in this Act to the contrary notwithſtanding.</q> The like we alſo find, as to <hi>worldly buſineſs,</hi> in the Queens <hi>Iniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
               <note place="margin">Injunct. 20.</note> publiſhed in the firſt year of her Reign; in which the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day is not onely counted with the other <hi>holy dayes,</hi> but labour
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:130903:39"/>
labour at ſome times permitted, and which is more, enjoyned upon it: For in thoſe Injunctions it is ordered with a <hi>non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtante,</hi> 
               <q>That all <hi>Parſons, Vicars,</hi> and <hi>Curates</hi> ſhall teach and declare unto their <hi>Pariſhoners,</hi> that they may with a <hi>ſafe and quiet conſcience,</hi> after <hi>Common-prayer,</hi> in the time of <hi>Harveſt,</hi> labour upon the <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>feſtival dayes,</hi> and ſave that thing which God hath ſent; And if for any <hi>Scrupuloſity</hi> or <hi>grudge</hi> of <hi>conſcience,</hi> men ſhould ſuperſtitiouſly abſtain from wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on theſe dayes, that then they ſhould grievouſly offend and diſpleaſe God.</q> And though it may be ſaid, that the Queens Injunction, and every thing therein contained, was buried in the ſame Grave with her; yet cannot this be ſaid of the Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> which is ſtill in force, and gives as much permiſſion unto Worldly buſineſſe, as the ſaid Injunction. And as for Recreations, there was not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly permiſſion of ſuch civil paſtimes, and man-like exerciſes, by which the ſpirits of men might be refreſht, and their bodies ſtrengthned; but even of Common <hi>Enterludes, Bear-baitings, Bull-baitings,</hi> and the like, fit onely for the entertainment of the ruder or more vulgar ſort. For though the Magiſtrates of the City of <hi>London</hi> obtained from Queen <hi>Elizabeth, Anno</hi> 1580. that Playes and Enterludes ſhould no more be acted on the Sunday within the liberties of their City; and that in the year 1583. many were terrified from beholding the like rude ſports upon that day, by the falling of a <hi>Scaffold</hi> in <hi>Paris Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> whereby many were hurt, and eight killed out right: yet there was no reſtraint of either in other parts of the Realm, till King <hi>James</hi> (to give a little contentment to the Puritan party in the beginning of his Reign) prohibited the ſame by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, bearing date at <hi>Theobalds May</hi> 7. 1630. But for all other civil Recreations, they were not onely permitted as they had been formerly, but a Declaration iſſued from that King about ſixteen years after, concerning <hi>lawful ſports,</hi> from which ſome of the preciſer ſort of Juſtices had by their own authority reſtrained the people.</p>
            <p>In the next place let us behold the <hi>Sunday</hi> or <hi>Lords day</hi> comparatively with the <hi>Saints days,</hi> and other <hi>Feſtivals;</hi> and we ſhall find them built on the ſame foundation, the ſame Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:130903:39"/>
offices performed in both, and the like diligent attendance required on both. For in the Act of Parliament 5, 6. of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. before remembred, the appointing of all <hi>holy dayes</hi> and ſet times of worſhip being firſt declared to be left <hi>by the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Gods Word, unto the liberty of Chriſts Church, to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in every countrey by the diſcretion of the Rulers thereof;</hi> it is next ſignified what dayes ſhall be accounted holy dayes, and what ſhall not. For ſo it followeth in that Statute; <q>Be it enacted, &amp;c.</q> that all the dayes hereafter mentioned ſhall be kept and commanded to be kept <hi>holy dayes,</hi> and none other: that is to ſay, all <hi>Sundayes</hi> in the year, the feaſts of the <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of our Lord Jeſus Christ,</hi> of the <hi>Epiphany,</hi> of the <hi>Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation (with all the rest now kept, and there named particularly.)</hi> The like ennumeration we have alſo in the Book of <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayer,</hi> the publick <hi>Liturgy</hi> of this Church by Law eſtabliſhed, where we ſhall find it thus expreſſed, <hi>That theſe ſhall be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted holy dayes and none other;</hi> that is to ſay, all Sundayes in the year, the feaſt of the Circumciſion, the Epiphany, with all the reſt before ſpecified in the Act of Parliament. Nor doth the Church onely rank the Lords day with other holy dayes in that enumeration of them, but hath appointed the ſame Divine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices (the <hi>Letany</hi> excepted onely) to be performed upon the Saints days &amp; other feſtivals, as upon the <hi>Sundays,</hi> each of them having his proper Leſſon, Collect, Epiſtle, and Goſpel, as the Sunday hath, and ſome of them their proper Pſalms alſo; which the Sunday hath not. And as for the attendance of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it is required with as much diligence upon the Saints dayes and other Feſtivals, as upon the Lords day, by the Laws of this land. For ſo it is enacted in the Statute of the firſt of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> viz. <q>That all and every Perſon and Perſons inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting within this Realm, &amp;c. ſhall diligently and faithfully endeavour themſelves to reſort to their Pariſh Church or Chappel, &amp;c. upon every Sunday, and other dayes ordained and uſed to be kept as <hi>holy dayes,</hi> then and there to abide or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and ſoberly, during the time of <hi>common prayer, preaching,</hi> or other ſervice of God.</q>  Nor was it only enacted, that men ſhould diligently repair to their Church or Chappel, as well upon the other <hi>holy dayes</hi> as upon the <hi>Sunday,</hi> but that the ſame
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:130903:40"/>
penalty was impoſed on ſuch as without any reaſonable let did abſent themſelves, as well upon the one as upon the other. For ſo it follows in that Statute, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That every perſon ſo offending, ſhall not alone be ſubject unto the cenſures of the Church, but ſhall forfeit for every ſuch offence twelve pence, to be levied to the uſe of the poor of the ſame pariſh, by the Church-wardens of the ſame, &amp;c.</q> 
            </p>
            <p>Which grounds thus laid, the Lord Primates Argument from the Book of <hi>Homilies</hi> will be eaſily anſwered. For if the weight of his argument lie in the firſt words cited out of the <hi>Homily, that in the fourth Commandment God hath given ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs charge to all men, that upon the Sabbath day, which is now our Sunday,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore that the Sunday or Lords day may be called a <hi>Sabbath;</hi> this will prove nothing but a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or a contention about words, and not within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of the <hi>Homily</hi> neither, it being declared in the former words of the ſame Homily, <hi>that we keep now the first day, which is our</hi> Sunday, <hi>and make that our Sabbath, that is our day of reſt.</hi> So that the deſtinating of the <hi>Sunday,</hi> or firſt day of the week for the day of reſt, makes it (at the moſt) but a <hi>tanquam</hi> to the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> neither entituling it to the name nor prerogatives of it. But if the weight of the Argument lie in theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>men upon the</hi> Sunday <hi>or</hi> Lords day <hi>ſhould ceaſe from all weekly and work-day labour, &amp;c. and alſo give themſelves wholly to Heavenly exerciſes of Gods true Religion and ſervice.</hi> For the firſt part thereof, touching the forbearing of all <hi>weekly and work-day labour,</hi> is no otherwiſe to be underſtood, but of ſuch labours as are prohibited by the Laws of the Realm, or otherwiſe may prove an avocation from Gods publick ſervice, at the times appointed for the ſame. And as for the laſt words, touching mens <hi>giving of themſelves wholly to heavenly exerciſes of Gods true Religion and ſervice;</hi> they are of a far differing meaning from the Article of the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> (for which the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> chiefly ſtickleth) in which it is declared, that <hi>the first day of the week, which is the Lords day, is wholly to be dedicated to the ſervice of God.</hi> For certainly there is a great difference between the dedicating of a day wholly to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, as in the Articles of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and the giving of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:130903:40"/>
our ſelves wholly to heavenly exerciſes, as in the <hi>Homilies</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> the one implying that no part of the day is to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſpent then in the ſervice of God, no place being left either for neceſſary buſineſs, or for lawful pleaſure; the other, that in the Acts and times of publick worſhip, we ſhould give our ſelves <hi>wholly,</hi> that is, our <hi>whole ſelves,</hi> ſouls and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, to the performance of thoſe heavenly exerciſes which are then required. It had before been told us in this very <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,</hi> that nothing in the fourth Commandment was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, but what was <hi>found appertaining to the Law of Nature:</hi> but it appertaineth not to the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> either that one day in ſeven ſhould be ſet apart for Religious worſhip, or that this one day <hi>wholly</hi> be ſo imployed; <hi>vel quod per totam diem</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Exod. 20. qu. 12.</note> 
               <hi>abſtineatur ab operibus ſervilibus,</hi> as <hi>Toſtatus</hi> hath it, or that there be an abſolute ceſſation, during the whole day, from all ſervile works. By conſequence there is no more required of us by the Law of <hi>Nature</hi> in this caſe, but that at the times appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Gods publick worſhip, we wholly ſequeſter our ſelves, yea, our very thoughts, from all worldly buſineſs; fixing our ſouls and all the faculties thereof, upon that great and weighty buſineſs which we are in hand with. That does indeed apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature, Naturale eſt quod dum Deum coli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, ab aliis abstineamus,</hi> as <hi>Toſtatus</hi> hath it; and to this point we have been trained in the Schools of Piety, <hi>Orantis eſt nihil niſi coelestia cogitare,</hi> as was ſaid before. So that the meaning of the Homily in that place will be onely this, that for thoſe times which are appointed by the Church for the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Gods people, we ſhould lay by our daily buſineſs, and all worldly thoughts, and wholly give our ſelves to the heavenly exerciſes of Gods true Religion and ſervice, as in the Homily we are willed.</p>
            <p>And that this only was the meaning of the <hi>Homily</hi> in that place, may be convincingly concluded from the reaſons follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Firſt, from the improbability that the Authors of that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily ſhould propound a Doctrine ſo evidently contrary to the Declaration of the Act of Parliament in the 5, &amp; 6. of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. which was then in force; and unto which not onely the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and the Lords <hi>Temporal,</hi> but even the Lords <hi>Spiritual,</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:130903:41"/>
and the King himſelfe did moſt unanimouſly concur; or that the Queen ſhould authorize a Doctrin in the Book of Homilies (as by ratifying the 39. Articles ſhe muſt be ſuppoſed to have done) which was ſo plainly and profeſſedly contrary to her own Injunctions.</p>
            <p>Secondly, from the ſtrong <hi>Alarm</hi> which was taken gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally by the Clergy, and the moſt knowing men of the Laity alſo, at the coming out of Doctor <hi>Bounds.</hi> Book about the <hi>Sabbath, Anno</hi> 1595. In which book it is declared amongſt other things, that the Commandment of <hi>ſanctifying every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, as in the</hi> Moſaical Decalogue, <hi>is</hi> Natural, Moral, <hi>and</hi> Perpetual. <hi>That there is great reaſon why we</hi> Chriſtians <hi>ſhould take our ſelves as</hi> ſtraightly bound <hi>to rest upon the</hi> Lords day, <hi>as the</hi> Jewes <hi>were upon their</hi> Sabbath; that there ſhould be no buying of victuals upon that day; no Carriers, Pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Drovers, or other men to be ſuffered to travel; no Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars to ſtudy the Liberal Arts; no Lawyers to conſult the caſe of their Clients, or peruſe their Evidences; no Juſtices to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine Cauſes for preſervation of the peace; no Bells to ring upon that day; no ſolemn Feaſts or Wedding Dinners to be made on it; with ſo many other prohibitions and nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive precepts, that men of all ſorts and profeſſions looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as a common grievance.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, from the great care which was preſently taken by ſuch as were in Authority, to ſuppreſs thoſe Doctrines, the ſaid Book being called in by Arch-Biſhop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> both by his Letters miſſive and his viſitations, as ſoon as the danger was diſcovered, <hi>Anno</hi> 1599. and a command ſignified in the Queens name by Chief Juſtice <hi>Popham</hi> at the Aſſizes held at <hi>Bury</hi> in <hi>Suffolk, Anno</hi> 1600. that the ſaid Book ſhould no more be printed; though afterward in the more remiſs Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of King <hi>James,</hi> it came out again with many Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Anno</hi> 1606.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, and finally, from the permitting of all ſorts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations (even <hi>common Enterludes and Bear-baitings</hi>) in the ſo much celebrated Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> as alſo by the <hi>Declaration</hi> about <hi>Lawful ſports</hi> publiſhed by King <hi>James, An.</hi> 1618. and revived afterwards by King <hi>Charles, Anno</hi> 1633<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:130903:41"/>
which certainly thoſe godly and religions Princes would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have ſuffered, nor have done, had they conceived it to be contrary to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> of which they were ſuch zealous Patrons, and ſuch ſtout Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. No breaking of <hi>Subſcription</hi> here by the <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> no croſſing or oppoſing of the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the Book of <hi>Homilies,</hi> and conſequently no ſuch need of <hi>Sophiſtry</hi> to elude the Lord <hi>Primates</hi> Argument which was drawn from thence, as the ſaid <hi>Honourable Perſon N. N.</hi> muſt believe there was.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>A further Argument to prove the meaning of the Homily, as before laid down. The high eſteem which the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> hath of the ancient Fathers, as alſo of the uſages of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times; with her reſpect unto the neighbouring Reformed Churches. No reſtraint from labour on the Lords day impoſed by the Council of <hi>Laodicea. Beza's</hi> opinion of the liberty in thoſe times allowed of. Law-ſuits and Handy-crafts prohibited in great Cities on the Lords day, by the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> but Husbandry permitted in the country Villages. Proof from Saint <hi>Jerome, Chryſoſtom, Auguſtine,</hi> that after the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſervice of the day was ended, the reſt of the day was ſpent in mens ſeveral buſineſſes. Husbandry firſt reſtrained in the Weſtern Churches in the Council of <hi>Orleans,</hi> Anno 540. and by the Edict of the Emperour <hi>Leo Philoſophus</hi> in the Eaſtern parts about the year 890. Several reſtraints laid on the Lords day by the Council of <hi>Maſcon,</hi> Anno 588. Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at ſuch reſtraints, and his cenſure of ſuch as did enioyn them. The liberty allowed in the <hi>Lutheran Churches</hi> on the Lords day, as alſo in thoſe of the Palatinate, till after the year 1612. Nor in the Churches of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> till the year 1618. Not onely ſervile Works, but Fairs and Markets continued on the Lords day in thoſe Countries, till the ſame year alſo. Neceſſary labour permitted on the Lords day in the

                  <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> and honest Recreations in the <hi>French and Genevian</hi> Churches; as alſo in the Kirk of <hi>Scotland.</hi> The concluſion and application of the laſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IT hath been proved ſufficiently in the former <hi>Section,</hi> that the paſſage alledged by the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> from the Book of Homilies (and that twice for failing) is capable of no ſuch ſenſe and meaning as he puts upon it; for if it were, the Homily muſt not only contradict it ſelf, but the Authors of it muſt be thought to propound a Doctrine directly contrary to the Queens Injunctions, and the publick <hi>Liturgy</hi> of this Church, and ſeveral Acts of Parliament which were then in force. And which is more, the whole body of Gods people in this Land, by following their neceſſary buſineſs, and lawful pleaſures upon the Sunday or Lords day, when no attendance at the place and hours of Gods publick ſervice was required of them, muſt be ſuppoſed to have run on in a courſe of ſin againſt Gods Commandments, and of contempt and diſobedience to the publick Doctrine of the Church for the ſpace of 80. years and upwards, without contradiction or reſtraint; which to imagine in a Church ſo wiſely conſtituted, and in a State founded on ſo many good Lawes, cannot find place with any man of ſober judgement. But there is one Argument yet to come, of as much weight and conſequence as thoſe before, that is to ſay, that if any ſuch reſtraint from labour and honeſt recreations was by the Doctrine of this Church impoſed on the people of God; this Church muſt openly oppoſe the Doctrine of the ancient Fathers, the laudable uſages and cuſtomes of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, together with the general practiſe and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all the Proteſtant and Reformed Churches in theſe parts of the world: a matter ſo abhorrent from the principles of the firſt Reformers, and from the Canons and Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Church and the Rulers of it, that no ſurmiſes of this kind can conſiſt with reaſon.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> hath alwayes held the Fathers in an high regard, whether we look upon them in their learned and laborious writings, or as convened in General, National, and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:130903:42"/>
Provincial Councils; appealing to them in all Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and making uſe of their authority and conſent in expounding Scripture; witneſs that famous <hi>challenge</hi> made by Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> in a Sermon preached at Saint <hi>Pauls Croſs, Anno</hi> 1560. in which he publickly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that if all, or any of the learned men of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> could produce any one ſentence out of the writings of any of the ancient Fathers, or any General, or National Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, for the ſpace of the firſt 600. years in juſtification of ſome Doctrines by them maintained, and by us denied, he would relinquiſh his own Religion, and ſubſcribe to theirs. Witneſs the Canon made in a Convocation of the Prelates and C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And thereupon in ſome <hi>Directions</hi> ſent by him to the Vice-Chancellor, and other of the Heads of the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> bearing date <hi>January 18. An.</hi> 1616. it was adviſed and required, <hi>That young Students in Divinity be directed to ſtudy ſuch Books as be most agreeable in Doctrine and Diſcipline to the Church of</hi> England; <hi>and excited to beſtow their time in the</hi> Fathers <hi>and</hi> Councils, School-men, Hiſtories, <hi>and</hi> Controverſies, <hi>and not to inſist too long upon</hi> Compendiums <hi>and</hi> Abbreviators, <hi>making them the grounds of their ſtudy in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.</hi> By which we ſee that the firſt place is given to <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councils,</hi> as they whoſe writings and decrees were thought to have been <hi>moſt agreeable to the Doctrine and Diſcipline</hi> of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The like may be ſaid alſo of the uſages and cuſtomes of the <hi>Primitive</hi> times, which the firſt Reformers of this Church had a principal care of; it being aſfirmed in the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:130903:43"/>
Act of Parliament, 2. 3. of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. by which the firſt Liturgy of that Kings time was confirmed and ratified, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilers of the ſame not onely had an eye to the <hi>moſt pure, ſincere Chriſtian Religion taught in the Scriptures, but alſo a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the</hi> uſages <hi>in the Primitive Church.</hi> They had not elſe retained ſo many of the ancient Ceremonies, as bowing at the name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> kneeling at the <hi>Communion,</hi> the <hi>Croſs</hi> in <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> ſtanding up at the <hi>Creed</hi> and <hi>Goſpels,</hi> praying toward the Eaſt, &amp;c. beſides the ancient Feſtivals of the Saints and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, who have their place and <hi>distinct offices</hi> in the preſent Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy. And as for the neighbouring Proteſtant and Reformed Churches, although ſhe differ from them in her Polity, and form of government, yet did ſhe never authorize any publick Doctrine, which might have proved a ſcandal to them in the condemning of thoſe Recreations, works of labour, and other matters of that nature, which the general practice of thoſe Churches both approve and tolerate. And therefore if it can be proved, that the ſpending of the <hi>whole</hi> Lords day, or the Lords day <hi>wholly</hi> in Religious exerciſes, accompanied (as needs it muſt be) with a reſtraint from neceſſary labour, and lawful pleaſures, be contrary to the Doctrine of the ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> the <hi>uſages</hi> and cuſtomes of the Primitive times, and to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral practice of the Proteſtant and Reformed Churches; I doubt not but it will appear to all equal and indifferent men, that there is no ſuch mind and meaning in the Book of <hi>Homilies</hi> or in them that made it, as the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> hath been pleas'd to put upon it, or to gather from it.</p>
            <p>And firſt, beginning with the Fathers, Councils, and the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the Primitive Church; it is not to be found, that ever they required that the whole day ſhould be employed in Gods publick ſervice, without permiſſion of ſuch neceſſary buſineſs and honeſt recreations, as mens occaſions might require, or invite them to. It was ordained indeed by the Council of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> ſpoken of before, that Chriſtians on the Lords day ſhould give themſelves to eaſe and reſt (<hi>otiari</hi> is the word in <hi>Latine,</hi> which poſſibly may be meant alſo of a reſt from labour) but it is qualified with a <hi>ſi modo poſſint,</hi> if it may ſtand with the conveniences of their Affairs, and the condition which they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:130903:43"/>
in. And ſo the Canon is expounded by <hi>Zonaras</hi> in his gloſs<note place="margin">In Can. Con. Laod.</note> upon it. It is appointed (ſaith he) by this Canon, that none abſtain from labour on the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> which plainly was a Jewiſh cuſtome, and an <hi>Anathema</hi> laid on thoſe who offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded herein. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. But they are willing to reſt from labour on the Lords day, in honour of the Reſurrection of our Lord and Saviour. But here we muſt obſerve that the Canon addes, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in caſe they may. For by the Civil Law it is preciſely ordered, that every man ſhall reſt that day, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Hindes and Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men excepted; his reaſon is the very ſame with that before expreſſed in the Emperours Edict, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. for unto them it is permitted to work and travel on that day, becauſe perhaps if they neglect it, they may not find another day ſo fit and ſerviceable for their occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Beſides which it is to be conſidered, that many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of thoſe times were ſervants unto Heathen Maſters, or otherwiſe obnoxious to the power of thoſe under whom they lived; and therefore could not on the Lords day abſtain from any manner of work further then it might ſtand with the will and pleaſure of thoſe Superiours to whom the Lord had made them ſubject. A Chriſtian ſervant living under the command of an Heathen Maſter, might otherwiſe neglect this Maſters buſineſs one whole day in ſeven, and plead the Canon of this Council for his juſtification; which whether it would have ſaved him from correction, or the Church from ſcandal, I leave to be conſidered by all ſober and unbiaſſed men. All that the Church required of her conformable Children, during the firſt 300. years, was onely to attend the publick miniſtration, or morning-ſervice of the day, leaving them to diſpoſe of the reſt thereof at their will and pleaſure; the very toil of Husbandry not being prohibited or reſtrained for ſome ages following. For proof whereof take theſe words of <hi>Beza,</hi> a man of great credit and eſteem not onely with our Engliſh <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> but the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> himſelf. <hi>

               <q>That Chriſtians ought, ſaith he, to abſtain that day from their labour, except that part alone which was appointed for the meetings of the Congregation; was never either commanded in the Apoſtles times, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe obſerved in the Church, until ſuch time that ſo it was enjoyned by Chriſtian Emperours, to the end the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might not be diverted from meditating on holy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; nor was it then ſo ſtrictly kept as it was enjoyned.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now the firſt Chriſtian Emperour was the famous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned <hi>Constantine,</hi> who was the firſt that eſtabliſhed the Lords day (which formerly had ſtood on no other ground then the Authority of the Church, and conſent of Gods people) by Imperial Edicts; ſo by the like Imperial Edict he reſtrained ſome labours on that day, and permitted others. The Judges in that age uſed to hold their Courts of Judicature, even in the hours and times of Gods publick ſervice; by which means many were neceſſitated to abſent themſelves from the publick meetings of the Church, and neglect their duties unto God. Many of the Artificers alſo which dwelt in great Towns and populous Cities, whoſe <hi>penny</hi> was more precious with them then their <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> uſed to do the like. For remedy whereof, it was ordained by the Emperours Edict, <hi>

               <hi>ſulcis, vineae ſcrobibus mandentur,</hi> that no day is more fit then that for ſowing Corn, and for planting Vines. And then he gives this reaſon for it, <hi>Ne occaſione momenti pereat commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas coelesti proviſione conceſſa;</hi> leſt otherwiſe by neglect of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient ſeaſons, they loſe thoſe benefits which their God had beſtowed upon them. And if the toyles of Husbandry were not onely permitted upon that day, but in a manner ſeemed to be enjoyned by the former Edict, no queſtion but ſuch worldly buſineſſes as did not take men off from their attendance at the times of the miniſtration, might be better ſuffered. And ſo<note place="margin">Ad Euſtochian.</note> Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> doth inform us of <hi>Paula,</hi> a devout and religious
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:130903:44"/>
Lady, that ſhe cauſed her Maidens and other Women which belonged to her, to repair diligently to the Church on the Lords day; but ſo that after their return <hi>operi distributo insta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant, &amp; vel ſibi vel caeteris veſtimenta faciebant,</hi> they betook themſelves unto their tasks, in making garments either for themſelves or others. Nor doth the Father cenſure or reprove her for it, as certainly he would have done, had any ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine been then taught and countenanced in the Church of Chriſt, touching the ſpending of the whole day (or the Lords day wholly) in religious exerciſes. It appears alſo by S. <hi>Chryſoft.</hi> that after the Divine duties of the day were finiſhed, which held but 1 or 2 hours in the morning (<hi>unam aut duas hor as ex die in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegro,</hi> as it is in <hi>Origen</hi>) the people were required only to ſpend<note place="margin">In Num.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and were then ſuffered to purſue the works of their ſeveral callings. Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> in his Tract<note place="margin">Hom. 5. in Mat. 1.</note> 
               <hi>De rectitudine Catholicae Converſationis</hi> adviſeth us to be attent and ſilent all the time of Divine ſervice, not telling tales, nor falling into jarres and quarrels, as being to anſwer, ſuch of us as offend therein: <hi>Dum nec ipſe verbum Dei audit, nec alios au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dire permittit,</hi> as neither hearkning to the word of God our ſelves, nor permitting others. But for the reſidue of the day, he left it in the ſame eſtate in which he found it, to be diſpoſed of by Gods people, according as their ſeveral neceſſities and occaſions required of them.</p>
            <p>Thus have we ſeen as well the Doctrine as the Practiſe of the <hi>African</hi> and <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Churches: Let us now turn our ſelves towards the Weſt, and we ſhall find that ſome in <hi>France</hi> had begun to <hi>Judaize</hi> ſo far, as to impoſe many of thoſe reſtraints on the Lords day, which the <hi>Jewes</hi> had put upon their <hi>Sabbath;</hi> viz. <hi>that none ſhould travel on the Lords day with</hi> Waines <hi>or</hi> Horſes, <hi>or dreſs</hi> Meat, <hi>or make clean the</hi> Houſe, <hi>or meddle with any manner of</hi> domeſtick <hi>buſineſs.</hi> Which being taken into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration by the third Council of <hi>Orleance, Anno</hi> 540. it was there ordained, that ſince thoſe prohibitions did ſavour more of the <hi>Jew</hi> then of the <hi>Chriſtian; Die Dominico quod ante licu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, licere,</hi> that therefore whatſoever had formerly been lawful on that day, ſhould be lawful ſtill. Yet ſo, that for the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:130903:45"/>
and contentment of thoſe troubleſome Spirits, who would not otherwiſe ſubmit to the Determinations of the Council, it was thought convenient, that men ſhould reſt that day from <hi>Husbandry,</hi> and the <hi>Vintage;</hi> from ſowing, reaping, hedging, and ſuch ſervile works, <hi>quo facilius ad Eccleſiam venientes, orationis gratia vacent,</hi> that ſo they might have better leiſure to go unto the Church, and there ſay their prayers. This as it was the firſt reſtraint from <hi>Husbandry</hi> on the Lords day, which had been made by the Canons of the Church; ſo was it ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a Canon made in the Synod of <hi>Maſcon</hi> in the 24. year of <hi>Ganthram</hi> King of the <hi>Burgundians, Anno</hi> 588. and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">Conc. Matiſcon. Can. 1.</note> by another in the Council of <hi>Auxerre</hi> in <hi>France</hi> under <hi>Clotaire</hi> the ſecond, about two years after. In both of which it was decreed, <hi>Non licere die dominico boves jungere, vel alia opera exercere;</hi> that no man ſhould be ſuffered to yoke his Oxen, or do any manner of work upon the Sunday. But then we muſt obſerve withall, that theſe Councils acted onely by their own Authority, not charging thoſe reſtraints on God, or on his Commandment; it being poſitively declared by the Canon of the Council of <hi>Maſcon,</hi> that the Lord <hi>did not exact it of us that we ſhould celebrate this day in a corporal abſtinence, or reſt from labour; who onely looks that we do yield obedience to his holy will, by which contemning earthly things, he may conduct us to the Heaven of his infinite mercy.</hi> Which Declaration not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, the Doctrine of it ſelfe was ſo offenſive to Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt, that partly to encounter with ſome Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of the Eaſtern Countries, who ſtill obſerved the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sabbath, and partly to prevent the further ſpreading of theſe reſtraints in the Weſtern parts, which made men ſeem to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daize</hi> on the Lords day alſo; he pronounced ſuch as were active in promoting the practiſe and opinion of either ſide, to be the Preachers of Antichriſt, <hi>qui veniens diem Sabbati &amp; diem Dominicum ab omni opere faciet cuſtodiri,</hi> as his own words are. Leſs forward were the Eaſtern Churches, in impoſing any of theſe new reſtraints upon the people, then the Weſtern were; the toiles of Husbandry it ſelf not being prohibited in the Eaſtern parts of the Empire, til the time of <hi>Leo Philoſophus,</hi> (he began his Government, <hi>Anno</hi> 886.) who grounding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:130903:45"/>
on ſome command of the holy Ghoſt, and the Lords A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, which neither he nor any body elſe could ever finde, decreed by his Imperial Edict, <hi>ut omnes in die ſacro, &amp;c. à la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore vacent. Neque Agricolae, &amp;c.</hi> that all men whatſoever, as well the Husbandman as others, ſhould on the Lords day reſt from all manner of work. So long it was before any ſuch general reſtraints were laid upon Gods people, either in the Weſt or Eaſt. In all which time we neither find, that the <hi>ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſome whole day apart</hi> for Gods ſolemn worſhip, was lookt upon as <hi>Juris Divini naturalis,</hi> which is the Lord <hi>Primates</hi> own opinion; or that the <hi>first day of the Week, which is the Lords day, was</hi> wholly <hi>to be dedicated to the ſervice of God, and therefore that</hi> men ſhould be bound to <hi>rest therein from their common and daily buſineſs,</hi> which is the Doctrine of the Articles of the Church of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next let us look upon the Proteſtant <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches, amongſt whom, though reſtraints from labour, formerly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by many Canons, Laws, and Imperial Edicts, do remain in force, yet they indulge unto themſelves all honeſt and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful recreations, and ſpare not to travel on that day, as well as upon any other, as their neceſſities, or pleaſures give occaſion for it. If they repair unto the Church, and give their diligent attendance on Gods publick ſervice, there is no more expected of them; they may diſpoſe of all the reſt of the day in their own affairs, and follow all ſuch buſineſſes from which they are not barred by the Laws of the ſeveral Countries in which they live, without being called to an account, or cenſured for it. And as for the Reformed or <hi>Calvinian</hi> Churches, they give themſelves more liberty on that day then the <hi>Lutherans</hi> doe, few of them having any Divine offices (until now of late) in the Afternoons; as neither had the Primitive Chriſtians, till to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the later end of the fifth, or the beginning of the ſixth Century. In thoſe of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> the Gentlemen betake themſelves in the Afternoon of the Lords day to <hi>Hawking</hi> and <hi>Hunting,</hi> according as the ſeaſon of the year is fit for either, or ſpend it in taking the Air, viſiting their Friends, or whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver elſe ſhall ſeem pleaſing unto them: as doth the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in looking over his grounds, ordering his cattel, or follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:130903:46"/>
of ſuch Recreations as are moſt agreeable to his nature and education. And ſo it ſtood in the year 1612. at what time the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> daughter to King <hi>James,</hi> and wife to <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> the fifth, Prince Elector Palatine, came firſt into that Countrey; whoſe having Divine Service every afternoon in her Chappel or Cloſet, officiated by her own Chaplains, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> might give ſome hint to the Prince her Husband to cauſe the like religious offices to be performed in ſome part of the Afternoon in the City of <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> and after by degrees in other the Cities and towns of his Dominions. In the <hi>Netherlands</hi> they have not onely practice, but a Canon for it; it being thus decreed<note place="margin">Collat. doct.

Nor could I ever learn from any of my Acquaintance of that Kingdom, but that men followed their neceſſary buſineſſes, and honeſt recreations on the Lords day, till by commerce and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the <hi>Puritan,</hi> or Presbyterian party here in <hi>England,</hi> the Sabbatarian Doctrines began by little and little to get ground amongſt them.</p>
            <p>On all which premiſes I conclude, that the Authors of that Homily had neither any mind or meaning to contradict the Ancient Fathers, the uſages and cuſtomes of the Primitive times, in the general practice of the Proteſtant and Reformed Churches; and therefore that the words of the Homily are not to be underſtood in any ſuch ſenſe as he puts upon them. The Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is clear and uniform, every way conſonant to it ſelf; not to be bowed to a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Articles of the year 1615. and much leſs with the judgement and opinion of one ſingle perſon in 640. No Sophiſtry in all this, but good Topical Arguments, and ſuch as may be more eaſily contemned then anſwered. And ſo much toward the <hi>exonerating</hi> of the fourth <hi>charge,</hi> the moſt material of them all, in which the Hiſtorian ſtands accuſed for <hi>oppoſing</hi> the Doctrine of this Church in the Book of Homilies, to which he had formerly ſubſcribed.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> charged for mistaking the affairs of <hi>Ireland</hi> in two particulars, which he ingenuouſly confeſſeth. The great cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>Puritan</hi> faction in effecting their deſires in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of <hi>Dublin,</hi> Anno 1615. which they could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs here in <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> accuſed for <hi>ſhameleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> &amp;c. for the ſecond miſtake, though onely in a point of <hi>Circumſtance;</hi> the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> being called in, and thoſe of <hi>England</hi> received in the place thereof by the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,</hi> though not by <hi>Parliament.</hi> The Lord <hi>Primates</hi> nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of this buſineſs; he finds himſelf ſurprized in paſſing the <hi>Canon,</hi> and makes uſe of a ſorry ſhift to ſalve the matter. The matter of a Commandment how, and in what ſenſe made an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi> of the <hi>Faith;</hi> and made a matter of the faith in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of the Lords day by the <hi>Aſſemblie of Divines</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> The conſecration of Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops, as capable of being taken into the <hi>Creed,</hi> as the <hi>Parity of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</hi> No verdict paſſed in behalf of the <hi>Lords day Sabbath</hi> by the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The great difference between the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> and the Church of <hi>England</hi> in this buſineſs of the Lords day Sabbath. A parting daſh beſtowed by the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> on the <hi>Hiſtorian.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>THis leads me on to the fifth and laſt <hi>charge</hi> laid on the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian, meerly extrinſecal, as to the main concernments of the point in hand, though ſuch as hath better ground to ſtand on then the other four. The <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> having carried on his deſign as far as he could by the help of Books, was forced to take up two paſſages, concerning the affairs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> upon <hi>information;</hi> an <hi>information</hi> not took up upon a vulgar hear-ſay, but given to him by ſuch hands, from which he was confident he might receive it, without doubt or ſcruple. The firſt particular is this, that at ſuch time as his Majeſties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners in <hi>Ireland</hi> employed about the ſetling of that Church
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:130903:47"/>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1615. there paſſed an <hi>Article,</hi> touching the keeping of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> by which the Engliſh <hi>Sabbatarians</hi> were much confirmed in their Courſes, and hath been often ſince alledged to juſtifie both them and their proceedings, <hi>Hiſt. Sab.</hi> p. 2. l<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> c. 8. n. 9. But the Lotd <hi>Primate</hi> now aſſures us, that the ſaid <hi>Article</hi> was paſſed, and the Book of <hi>Articles publiſhed in Print divers yeares before the Commiſſioners (whom he meaneth) came thither,</hi> p. 109. And thereunto Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> addeth, that the ſaid Articles were ſubſcribed by the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> then Speaker of the Houſe of Biſhops in Convocation, by the Prolocutor of the Houſe of the Clergy in their names, and ſigned by the Lord Deputy <hi>Chicheſter</hi> in the name of King <hi>James.</hi> If ſo, (as now I believe it was) I muſt needs ſay that the <hi>Sabbatarians,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinian</hi> party in <hi>England,</hi> were wiſer in their <hi>generations then the children of light;</hi> who ſeeing that they had no hopes of thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>nine Articles of Lambeth,</hi> their Sabbath Speculations, and the reſt of their <hi>Heterodoxies</hi> (of which particularly hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) on the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they began to caſt their eyes on <hi>Ireland,</hi> which lying further off might be leſs looked after. And in that Realm they made themſelves ſo ſtrong a party, that they obtained thoſe Points in the Convocation held at <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, Anno</hi> 1615. which neither their ſeditious clamours in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> nor their Petition to King <hi>James</hi> at his firſt entrance on this Kingdom, nor their motion at the <hi>Conference in Hampton Court,</hi> nor their continual Addreſſes to the Houſes of Parliament, were able to effect in <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>out-works</hi> being thus eaſily gained, they made from thence their <hi>Batteries</hi> on the <hi>Fort</hi> it ſelf, of which they doubted not to make themſelves Maſters in ſhort time, as in fine they did. For after this, when the Sabbath Quarrels were revived, and the <hi>Arminian</hi> Controverſies in agitation, no argument was more hotly preſt by thoſe of the <hi>Puritan</hi> faction, then the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of theſe Articles, and the infallible judgement of King <hi>James,</hi> to confirm the ſame.</p>
            <p>The other particular, in which the <hi>Historian</hi> doth confeſs himſelf to have been too credulous in believing, and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in publiſhing ſuch miſtaken intelligence, is, <hi>that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:130903:48"/>
               <hi>of</hi> Ireland <hi>were called in, and that in their place the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Church of</hi> England <hi>were confirmed by Parliament in that Kingdom, Anno</hi> 1634. For this miſtake, though it be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the <hi>circumstance,</hi> not in the ſubſtance of the fact which is now before us, he ſtands accuſed by the Lord Primate of no leſs then <hi>ſhameleſneſs. Nor ſhames he to affirm</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the whole Book of the Articles of</hi> Ireland <hi>is now called in (which is a notorious untruth) and that the Articles of the Church of</hi> England <hi>were confirmed by Parliament in this Kingdom, Anno</hi> 1634. Which paſſage, with ſome others in this Letter, makes me apt to think, that it was never the Lord <hi>Primates</hi> meaning, or deſire to have it publiſhed in Print, though Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi> hath been pleaſed to adventure on it. For if it had been ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, he would have ſhewed leſs paſſion, and more civility towards a Doctor in Divinity, Chaplain in ordinary to the King, and one not altogether untravelled in the wayes of Learning; then to brand him with Sophiſtry, Shameleſſneſs, and extravagant Fancies, to tax him with notorious untruths, ſpeaking <hi>inconſiderately;</hi> and finally to ſend him back to School again to learn his <hi>Catechiſm.</hi>

            <lg>
               <l>Egregiam vero laudem &amp; ſpolia ampla tuliſtis</l>
               <l>Tuque puerque tuus.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Aſſuredly the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> and his <hi>Chaplain</hi> too have reapt great praiſe and <hi>micle meed</hi> for this notable victory, by which notwithſtanding they have gain'd nothing but the name and noiſe. For if it can be proved (as I think it may) that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of <hi>Ireland</hi> were called in, and that thoſe of <hi>England</hi> were received in their place; then, whether it were done by <hi>Parliament</hi> or <hi>Convocation,</hi> is not much material. But on the contrary, it is affirmed by the Lord <hi>Primate,</hi> 
               <q>That the Houſe of Convocation in the beginning of their Canons, <hi>for the manifeſtation of their agreement with the Church of</hi> England, <hi>in the confeſſion of the ſame Chrſtian faith, and the Doctrine of the Sacraments,</hi> as themſelves profeſs, and for no other end in the world, did receive and approve of the Articles of <hi>England:</hi> but that either the Articles of <hi>Ireland</hi> were
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:130903:48"/>
ever called in, or any Article, or Canons at all were ever here confirmed by Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> may well be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt Dr. <hi>Heylyns fancies.</hi>
               </q> This the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> hath affirmed, but takes no notice that the receiving of the Articles of <hi>England</hi> imports no leſs then the <hi>repealing</hi> of thoſe of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> of which ſince Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> hath diſcourſed more fully in his following Paper, I ſhall reſerve my Anſwer unto this Objection, till I come to him. In the mean time we are to know, that the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> having been wrought on to propoſe the Canon which he ſpeaks of about the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> did readily conſent unto it, conceiving it to be without any prejudice to the other; and thereupon he did not onely propoſe it in the Houſe of the Biſhops, but commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to the Houſe of the Clergy, where by his motion many aſſented the more readily, as Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi> hath informed us, p. 118. But afterwards, the Lord <hi>Primate,</hi> upon further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, conceiving that he had been ſurprized, and that he had paſſed more away in that Canon then he firſt intended, began to caſt about for ſome expedient to ſalve the matter, and keep the Articles of <hi>Ireland</hi> in their former credit. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it was thought fit that both the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſome other Biſhops of his party ſhould at <hi>an Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, take the ſubſcription of the party ordained to both Articles, the Articles of</hi> England <hi>not being received inſtead, but with thoſe of</hi> Ireland, <hi>p.</hi> 120, 121. A ſorry ſhift, but ſuch as was conceived to be better then none, though as good as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>But leaving this Diſpute to another place, as before was intimated we now proceed to the Examination of ſome other paſſages in the Lord <hi>Primates Letter</hi> unto his <hi>Honourable Friend,</hi> in which he firſt chargeth the <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> for ſpeaking <hi>inconſiderately,</hi> in ſaying, that before that time, <hi>viz. Anno 1615. The Lords day had never attained ſuch credit as to be thought an Article of the Faith, though of ſome mens fancies.</hi> And why was this ſo inconſiderately ſpoken? <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he that would confound the ten</hi> Commandments (<hi>whereof this muſt he accounted for one unleſs he will leave us but nine with the</hi> Articles of Faith, <hi>had need be put to learn his Catechiſme again.</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:130903:49"/>
But this I look on as a flouriſh, or a fanſie onely. For I hope the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> doth not think the <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> ſo extremely ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, as to mean there a <hi>juſtifying</hi> and <hi>ſalvifical</hi> faith; but that he takes faith there in the general notion, as it importeth a firm perſwaſion, and beliefe that thoſe things are undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true which are commended to him by the Church in which he liveth, or found in any creditable and unqueſtioned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; And in this notion of the word, the matter of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment being made a Doctrine, may be called an Article of the <hi>Faith,</hi> without any ſuch ſcorn, as to be <hi>put to learn the Catechiſm again.</hi> The Articles of <hi>England</hi> by ſuch as write of them in <hi>Latine,</hi> are called <hi>Confeſſio Eccleſiae Anglicanae (praeter</hi>
               <note place="margin">Conſil. redeun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di.</note> 
               <hi>Confeſſionem Anglicanam quam mihi ut modeſtam praedicabant, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Spalato.</hi>) In like manner and in the ſame ſenſe and ſignification as the Articles of the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches, and the <hi>Kirk</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> are called <hi>confeſſio fidei Eccleſiarum Belgicarum, Confeſſio fidei Scoticana, &amp; ſit de cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris,</hi> that is to ſay, the confeſſion of the Faith of thoſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Churches. By which name the Articles of <hi>Ireland</hi> being alſo called by a <hi>most eminent, learned and judicious perſon</hi> (as Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> ſets him out, p. 121.) and the new Doctrine of the Sabbath being made a part of that Confeſſion, it may be ſaid without any abſurdity, or being put to <hi>School again to learn the Catechiſme,</hi> that till that time, <hi>viz.</hi> 1615. the Lords day never had attained that credit, as to be thought an <hi>Article</hi> of the <hi>Faith.</hi> But to make the matter ſure, and beyond excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I muſt put Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi> in mind of a Book entituled, <hi>The Humble Advice of the Aſſembly of Divines aſſembled at</hi> Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter <hi>by the Authority of Parliament, concerning a Confeſſion of Faith.</hi> In which Confeſſion of the Faith it is ſaid expreſly, that, <q>As it is in the Law of Nature, that in general a due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of time be ſet apart for the worſhip of God; ſo in his word by a poſitive, moral, and perpetual Commandment, binding all men, in all ages, he hath particularly appointed one day in ſeven for a Sabbath to be kept holy unto him: which from the beginning of the world to the Reſurrection of Chriſt, was the laſt day of the week; and from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt, was changed into the firſt day of the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:130903:49"/>
week, which in Scripture is called the Lords day, and is to be continued to the end of the world, as the Chriſtian <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</hi>
               </q> The inſtitution and keeping of the Lords day here is made an <hi>Article of the Faith,</hi> an Article of that Confeſſion of the Faith which by the Aſſembly of Divines (whereof the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> was nominated to be one) was recommended to the two Houſes of Parliament; and yet I trow, the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> wil not ſend the whole Aſſembly to <hi>learn their Catechiſm again,</hi> unleſs it were one of the <hi>Catechiſms</hi> of their own making, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the larger, or the leſſer, 'tis no matter which.</p>
            <p>But the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> ſtayes not here, he goes on and ſaith, <q>That he that would have every thing which is put into the Articles of Religion, to be held for <hi>an Article of Faith,</hi> ſhould do well to tell us whether he hath as yet admitted the <hi>Book of the ordination of Biſhops, and the two volumes of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies</hi> into his Creed; both which he ſhall find received in the Articles of Religion agreed upon in the Synod held at <hi>London, Anno</hi> 1562.</q> But unto this it may be anſwered, that the <hi>Book of the Ordination of Biſhops, and the two Volumes of Homilies</hi> may be ſo far taken into the Hiſtorians Creed, as to believe as much of either as is required of him in the Book of Articles. For he may very warrantably and ſafely ſay, <q>that he does verily <hi>believe</hi> that the ſecond Book of Homilies doth contain a godly and wholeſome Doctrine, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note place="margin">Artic. 35. 36.</note> for thoſe times (that is to ſay, the times in which they were firſt publiſht) and that the Book of Conſecration of Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops, and ordering of Prieſts and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, doth contain all things neceſſary to ſuch Conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ordering, and that it hath nothing that of it ſelf is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious or ungodly.</q> All this the <hi>Historian</hi> doth and may <hi>believe</hi> without making it an Article of his <hi>Faith,</hi> except it be in that general notion of the word, which before we ſpake of; and in which notion of the word, the Article of the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops, &amp;c. may as well finde a place in the Confeſſion of the Faith of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as that Article of the <hi>Parity</hi> of <hi>Miniſters</hi> hath found ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance in the <hi>Confeſſions</hi> of the <hi>Belgick, Scotiſh,</hi> and other Reformed Churches.

And the <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is given us in theſe Words, <hi>viz.

And ſecondly, if any ſuch <hi>Verdict</hi> had been given, it was not given by any <hi>Jury</hi> which was legally ſummoned, or truſted by the Church to act any thing in that particular. And then the Foreman of this <hi>Jury</hi> muſt be Doctor <hi>Bound,</hi> Maſter <hi>Greenham,</hi> Maſter <hi>Perkins,</hi> Doctor <hi>Lewis Bayley,</hi> Maſter <hi>Dod,</hi> Maſter <hi>Clever,</hi> Doctor <hi>Gouge,</hi> Maſter <hi>Whateley,</hi> Doctor <hi>Sibs,</hi> Doctor <hi>Preſton,</hi> Maſter <hi>Bifield,</hi> Doctor <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Ley</hi> muſt make up the <hi>Pannel;</hi> the five <hi>Smectymnuans,</hi> and he that pulled down the Croſs in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Church-yard,

ſtanding by in a readineſs to put in for the <hi>Tales,</hi> as occaſion ſerved.

But the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> doth entitle it unto Chriſt himſelf, and to that end alledgeth a paſſage out of the Homily <hi>De Semente,</hi> aſcribed (but aſcribed falſly) unto S. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> viz. <gap reason="foreign">

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> THe difference between the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> in the point of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> we have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed already; and well it were, if he differed from the Church of <hi>England</hi> in no point elſe. But Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> gives us ſome, and the <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Jeſuites challenge</hi> hath given given us others. Firſt, the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> tells us in a Letter writ to Doctor <hi>Bernard,</hi> and by him now publiſhed, <q>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> That he ever declared his opinion to be (but it was onely in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate to ſome ſpecial Friends) that <hi>Epiſcopus &amp; Presbyter gradu tantum differunt, non ordine,</hi> and conſequently that in places where Biſhops cannot be had, the Ordination by Presbyters ſtandeth <hi>valid.</hi> And howſoever (ſaith he) I muſt needs think that the Churches, which have no Biſhops, are thereby become very defective in their Government, and that the Churches in <hi>France,</hi> who living under a Popiſh power, and cannot do what they would, are more excuſable
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:130903:52"/>
in this defect then the Low-Countreyes, that live under a a free State; yet for the teſtifying my Communion with theſe Churches (which I do love and honour as true Members of the Church univerſal) I do profeſs that with like affection I ſhould receive the bleſſed Sacrament at the hands of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Miniſters, if I were in <hi>Holland,</hi> as I ſhould do at the hands of the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters, if I were in <hi>Charentone.</hi>
               </q>  And this I muſt needs ſay, though I never ſaw it before in Print, is no news to me at all. For I have heard long ſince, and from very good hands, that the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> did ſo fully commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate his judgement in the point of <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> to Doctor <hi>Preſton</hi> then of <hi>Cambridge</hi> (a man of quick parts, and deep comprehenſions) that he uſed to ſay many times to his Friends and followers, that if the Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> did lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of their <hi>calling</hi> on no other grounds then the <hi>Primate</hi> did, the differences between them would be ſoon agreed. But on the other ſide it is the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> that a Biſhop and a Presbyter do differ <hi>Ordine</hi> in reſpect of ſome ſuper our order which the Presbyter hath not; and not <hi>Gradu</hi> onely, in reſpect of ſome ſuperiority of Degree, which every Biſhop hath above the Presbyters. And this appears plainly by the <hi>Preface</hi> of the Book entituled, <hi>The form and manner of making and conſecrating Biſhops, Prieſts, and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons;</hi> approved by the Articles of the Church, and eſtabliſhed by the Laws of the Land, in which <hi>Preface</hi> it is ſaid expreſly, <hi>that it is evident unto all men, diligently reading holy Scripture, and ancient Authors, that from the</hi> Apoſtles time, <hi>there have been theſe</hi> Orders of Miniſters <hi>in Christs Church, Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons.</hi> It follows not long after thus, <hi>viz. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the intent theſe Orders ſhould be continued, and reverently uſed and esteemed in this Church of</hi> England, <hi>it is requiſite that no man (not being at this preſent Biſhop, Priest, nor Deacon) ſhall execute any of them, except he be called tried, examined, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted according to the form hereafter following.</hi> Here then we have 3. Orders of Miniſters, <hi>Biſhops, Priests and Deacons;</hi> the Biſhop differing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as much in <hi>Order</hi> from the Prieſt, as the Prieſt differs in Order from the <hi>Deacon.</hi> But becauſe perhaps it may be ſaid, that this <hi>Preface</hi> is no part of the Book which
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:130903:52"/>
ſtands approved by the Articles of the Church, and eſtabliſht by the Laws of the Land, let us next look into the body of the Book it ſelfe; where in the form of conſecrating an <hi>Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,</hi> or <hi>Biſhop,</hi> we ſhall find a prayer in theſe words following, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>Almighty God, giver of all good things, who haſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed divers <hi>Orders</hi> of Miniſters in thy Church, merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behold this thy ſervant, now called to the work and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and repleniſh him ſo with the truth of thy Doctrine, and innocency of life, that both by word and deed, he may faithfully ſerve thee in this office, &amp;c.</q>  By which Prayer, it doth as evidently appear as it did before in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, not onely that the office of a Biſhop doth differ from the Office of the Prieſts and Deacons, but that the Biſhop is of a different Order from all other Miniſters. And this appears yet further by the different forms uſed in the ordering of the Prieſts and Deacons, and the form of conſecrating an Arch-Biſhop or Biſhop. Which certainly the Church had never di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed in ſuch ſolemnity (for <hi>frustra fit per plura quod fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri potest per pauciora</hi>) if the conſecrating of a Biſhop did not adde ſome further <hi>Order</hi> to him, which before he had not as a Prieſt or Presbyter.</p>
            <p>But becauſe poſſibly ſome may ſay that the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is either ſingular in this point, or elſe did borrow theſe forms from the popiſh <hi>Ordinals,</hi> as it is ſaid to have borrowed her publick <hi>Liturgy</hi> from the popiſh <hi>Miſſals;</hi> it will be found on the firſt ſearch, that nothing is done, or appointed to be done by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but what was regulated and preſcribed by the fourth Council of <hi>Carthage, Anno</hi> 401. or<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Carthag.</hi> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Can. 3.</note> thereabout. In which <hi>Council</hi> it is firſt ordained, that in the ordination of a Prieſt or Presbyter, the Biſhop holding his hand on his head, and bleſſing him, all the Presbyters that were preſent ſhould hold their hands by the hands of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. Whereas in the ordination of a Deacon, it ſufficeth<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> Can. 4.</note> that the Biſhop alone put his hands upon the head of him that is ordained; becauſe he is not ſanctified to prieſtly dignity, but to the ſervice of the Church. But in the conſecration of a Biſhop it is there required, that two Biſhops holding the Book of Goſpels over his head, the third (which regularly was to be
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:130903:53"/>
the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> of the Province) ſhould pronounce the words<note place="margin">Can. 2.</note> of Conſecration, all the other Biſhops which are preſent lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hands upon him as others did. I ſaid that regularly the Biſhop which pronounced the words of Conſecration, was to be the Metropolitan of the Province, in which the New Biſhop was ordained, becauſe we find it ſo ordered in the Council of <hi>Antioch, Anno</hi> 365. in which it was decreed, that<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Concil. Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och.</hi> Can. 19.</note> a Biſhop ſhould not be ordained without a Synod and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Metropolitan, that the Metropolitan by his letters ſhould call unto him all the Biſhops in the Province, if conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently they might come together; if not, that at the leaſt the greater part ſhould be preſent, or give their conſent by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. By which it ſeems, that the conſecration of a Biſhop was eſteemed a work of ſo great dignity in it ſelf, and of ſo great importance to the Church of Chriſt, that all the Biſhops of the Province were required to be preſent at it, if they could conveniently. But to return again to the fourth Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> we find therein three ſeveral and diſtinct forms of Ordination, and conſequently three ſeveral Orders of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to be ſo ordained. For otherwiſe it had been very unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to uſe one form in the making of a Presbyter, &amp; another in the conſecrating of Biſhops; the one to be performed by the Biſhop and ſome Presbyters onely, the other not to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted but with the preſence (or the conſent at leaſt) of the Metropolitan, all other Biſhops of the Province conſenting to it, and giving their aſſiſtance at that ſacred Ceremony, if not otherwiſe hindered. And though this fourth Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> was but National onely, yet was it univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived (and that too in a very ſhort time) over all the Church, and made the ſtanding Rule, by which the conſecrating of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and the ordaining of Prieſts and Deacons was to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiated. A Rule ſo punctually followed by the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that it ſeemeth to be rather of the Carthaginian then the Roman party, and more to ſavour of the Primitive, then the popiſh Ordinals. And to this Rule the Church did tie it ſelfe ſo ſtrictly concerning the conſecration of an Arch Biſhop or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, that though a Biſhop in ſome caſes might ordain a Prieſt or Presbyter, without the preſence and co-operation of other
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:130903:53"/>
Presbyters; yet was there no caſe whatſoever, in which it was lawful for one or more Prieſts or Presbyters to ordain an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. And ſo it was adjudged in the caſe of <hi>Coluthus,</hi> whoſe ordinations were therfore declared void &amp; of no effect, becauſe he was no <hi>Biſhop</hi> but a <hi>Presbyter</hi> onely, as is affirmed by <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> in <hi>Apol.</hi> 2. Which as it clearly contradicted the Lord <hi>Primates</hi> judgement in the point of the lawfulneſs of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of Presbyters by Presbyters, without the concurrence of a Biſhop; ſo doth it juſtifie the Church of <hi>England</hi> againſt him in the point of Epiſcopacy, which ſhe affirms, and he denies to be a diſtinct <hi>Order</hi> from that of the Prieſt or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>But nothing doth more fully manifeſt the Lord <hi>Primates</hi> judgement in this particular (and conſequently his diſſent therein from the Church of <hi>England</hi>) then his publiſhing the judgement and opinion of Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> in this point; which he ſo far enlarged and explicated, that Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koneth it amongſt his works. The title of the Book runs thus: <hi>The judgement of Doctor</hi> Reynolds <hi>touching the Original of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy, more largely confirmed out of Antiquity, by</hi> James <hi>Arch-Biſhop of</hi> Armagh. The Doctors judgement is as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>When Elders were ordained by the Apoſtles in every Church, through every City to feed the flock of Chriſt, whereof the Holy Ghoſt had made them overſeers: they to the intent they might the better do it, by common Counſel, and conſent, did uſe to aſſemble themſelves and meet together. In which meetings, for the more orderly handling and concluding of things pertaining to their charge, they choſe one amongſt them to be the Preſident of their Company, and Moderator of their Actions. As in the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> though it had ſundry <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors</hi> to guide it; yet amongſt thoſe ſundry, was there one chief, whom our Saviour calleth the <hi>Angel of the Church,</hi> and writeth that to him, which by him the reſt ſhould know. And this is he whom afterwards in the Primitive Church the Fathers called <hi>Biſhop.</hi>
               </q> So far the words of Dr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> then which there nothing can be ſaid more contrary to the firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, nor more derogatory to the Order and Eſtate of Biſhops.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:130903:54"/>
And if the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> did <hi>magnifie his own office</hi> no better in other things, then he did in publiſhing this piece, Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> might have ſpared that part of the character which he gives us of him for ſo doing, p. 151. For by this magnifying of his Office he made himſelf no better then the <hi>Preſident</hi> of the <hi>Presbyters</hi> within his Dioceſs (the chief Prieſt, or Arch-Prieſt we may fitly call him) though poſſibly in regard of his perſonal abilities, he might be ſuffered to enjoy that preſidency for term of life; ſuch a perpetual Preſidency as <hi>Calvin</hi> was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of when he reigned in <hi>Geneva,</hi> and ſate as Pope over all the Churches of his Platform; and was enjoyed by <hi>Beza</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years after his deceaſe, till <hi>Danaeus</hi> (thinking himſelf as good a man as the beſt) made a party againſt him, and ſet him quite beſide the Cuſhion. Since which time that Preſidency hath continued no longer in any one man, then from Seſſion to Seſſion, from one Claſſical meeting to another; <hi>&amp; loco liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis erat quod eligi coeperunt,</hi> in the words of <hi>Tacitus.</hi> Which fate would queſtionleſs befall all the Biſhops in Chriſtendom, if their Presbyters were once poſſeſſed with this fanſie, that the Biſhop was but a Creature of their own making, as is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Doctor <hi>Reynolds;</hi> or that they and their Biſhop did not differ <hi>Ordine,</hi> but <hi>Gradu</hi> onely, which the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> (to the great <hi>magnifying of his office</hi>) hath declared to be his own conſtant opinion.</p>
            <p>3. In the next place the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth maintain an <hi>Univerſal Redemption</hi> of all mankind, by the death and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of our Saviour. This firſt proved by that paſſage in the publick Catechiſm, by which the party catechized is taught <hi>to believe in God the Son, who redeemed him and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:</hi> ſecondly, by that clauſe in the <hi>Letany,</hi> viz. <hi>O God the Son Redeemer of the world have mercy upon us,</hi> &amp;c. thirdly, by the prayer of conſecrating the Elements of Bread and Wine, <hi>viz. Almighty God, our Heavenly Father, which of thy tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy didst give thine onely Son Jeſus Chriſt, to ſuffer death upon the croſs for our Redemption, who made there (by his own obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelf once offered) a full, perfect, and ſufficient ſacrifice, oblation, and ſatisfaction, for the ſins of the WHOLE WORLD,</hi> &amp;c. Nor was it without ſome ſuch meaning that ſhe ſelected
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:130903:54"/>
thoſe words of our Saviour in Saint <hi>Johns</hi> Goſpel, viz. <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his onely begotten Son, &amp;c.</hi> to be uſed in the preparation to the Communion; as ſhe reiterated ſome others, <hi>viz. O Lamb of God that takeſt away the ſins of the world,</hi> incorporated into the <hi>Gloria in Excelſis</hi> at the end thereof. But in this point the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> is of a contrary judgement to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> For as he ſeems not to like their opinion, who contract the riches of Chriſts ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into too <hi>narrow</hi> a room; as if none had any intereſs therein, but ſuch as were elected before the foundation of the world; ſo he declareth his diſlike of the other extreme (as he is pleas'd to call it) by which the benefit of this <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> is extended to the Redemption of <hi>all mankind.</hi> The one extremity (ſaith he) extends the benefit of Chriſts ſatisfaction ſo far, <hi>ut reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liationem cum Deo, &amp; peccatorum Remiſſionem ſingulis impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traverit,</hi> as to obtain a Reconciliation with God, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins for all men at his merciful hands, p. 21. Which though they are the words of the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> at the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at the <hi>Hague,</hi> Anno 1611. and are by him reckoned for untrue; yet do they naturally reſult from the Doctrine of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Redemption, which is maintained in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Not that all Mankind is ſo perfectly reconciled to Almighty God, as to be really and actually diſcharged from all their ſins, before they actually believe (which the Lord <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> makes to be the meaning and effect of that <hi>extremity,</hi> as he calls it, <hi>p.</hi> 2.) but that they are ſo far reconciled unto him, as to be capable of the Remiſſion of their ſins, in caſe they do not want that faith in their common Saviour which is required thereunto. And here I ſhould have left this point, but that I muſt firſt deſire Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi> to reconcile theſe two paſſages which I find in the Lord <hi>Primates</hi> Letter of the year 1617. in one of which he ſeems to diſlike of their opinion, <hi>who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the Riches of Chriſts ſatisfaction into</hi> too narrow <hi>a room; as if none had any kind of intereſs therein, but ſuch as were</hi> elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>before the foundation of the world,</hi> as before was ſaid. And in the other he declares, that he is <hi>well aſſured, that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our hath obtained at the hands of his Father Reconciliation, and forgiveneſs of ſins, not for the</hi> Reprobate, <hi>but</hi> Elect <hi>onely,</hi> p. 21.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:130903:55"/>
Let Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi> reconcile theſe ſo different paſſages, &amp; <hi>erit mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi magnus Apollo,</hi> in the Poets language. If the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> did ſubſcribe the Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaies he did, <hi>p.</hi> 118. I know who may be better blam'd for breaking his ſubſcription, then he whom the Lord Primate hath accuſed for it, <hi>p.</hi> 110. For in the ſecond Article of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> it is ſaid expreſly that <hi>Chriſt ſuffered, was crucified, dead, and buried,</hi> to reconcile his <hi>Father</hi> to us, <hi>and to be a</hi> ſacrifice, <hi>not onely for original guilt, but alſo for the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſins of men.</hi> In which as well the <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> as the effect and fruit thereof, which is the <hi>Reconciliation</hi> of mankind to God the Father, is delivered in general terms, without any reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction put upon them; neither the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> nor the <hi>Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation</hi> being reſtrained to this man or that man, ſome certain <hi>quidams</hi> of their own, whom they paſs commonly by the name of Gods <hi>Elect.</hi> The <hi>ſacrifice</hi> being made for <hi>the ſins of men,</hi> of men indefinitely without limitation, is not to be confined to ſome <hi>few men</hi> onely, as the general current of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Divines have been pleaſed to make it; as if Chriſt really and intentionally died for none but them.</p>
            <p>4. The Church of <hi>England</hi> doth maintain that Chriſt is <hi>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>really preſent</hi> in the Sacrament of his moſt precious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood. Which Doctrine of a <hi>Real preſence</hi> is firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the words of the <hi>Distribution,</hi> retained in the firſt Liturgy of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, and formerly preſcribed to be uſed in the ancient <hi>Miſſals,</hi> viz. <hi>The body of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt which was given for thee, preſerve thy Body and Soul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life everlasting. The blood of our Lord Jeſus Christ, &amp;c.</hi> Which words being thought by ſome preciſe and ſcrupulous perſons to incline too much towards <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> (and therefore not unfit to juſtifie a real preſence) were quite omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſecond Liturgy of that King, <hi>Anno</hi> 1552. whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ored to their former place, and followed by thoſe of the <hi>Participation,</hi> as it ſtill continueth. It is proved ſecondly by that paſſage in the publick <hi>Catechiſme,</hi> in which the Party catechized is taught to ſay, that the <hi>body and blood of Chriſt are</hi> verily <hi>and</hi> indeed <hi>taken and received of the faithful in the Lords Supper.</hi> Now if a Queſtion ſhould be made, what the Church means by <hi>verily</hi> and <hi>indeed</hi> in the former paſſage, it muſt be anſwered that ſhe means, that Chriſt is truly and really preſent in that bleſſed Sacrament, as before was ſaid; the words being rendered thus in the Latine Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <hi>viz. Corpus &amp; ſanguis Domini quae</hi> vere &amp; realiter <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibentur, &amp;c.</hi> Verily and indeed, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> hath it, the ſame with <hi>vere</hi> and <hi>realiter</hi> (that is to ſay, truly and really) as it is in the Latine. And thirdly, this appears to be the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of this Church, by the moſt Orthodox and Learned Prelates of the ſame, the words of three of which only I ſhall now produce, that out of the mouths of two or three witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the truth hereof may be eſtabliſhed. <hi>God forbid</hi> (ſaith Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop<note place="margin">

Praeſentiam credimus non minus quam vos veram, de modo</hi> praeſentiae <hi>nil temere definimus.</hi> We acknowledge (ſaith he) a preſence as <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real</hi> as you do, but we determine nothing raſhly of the manner of it. And in his Anſwer to the eighteenth Chapter of Cardinal <hi>Perrons Reply,</hi> he thus ſpeaks of <hi>Zuinglius.</hi> It is well known, ſaith
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:130903:56"/>he, 
<q>that <hi>Zuinglius</hi> to avoid <hi>Eſt</hi> (in theſe words, <hi>hoc eſt Corpus meum</hi>) in the Church of <hi>Romes</hi> ſenſe, fell to be all for <hi>ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficat,</hi> and nothing for <hi>eſt</hi> at all: And whatſoever went far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then <hi>ſignificat,</hi> he took to ſavour of the <hi>Carnal preſence.</hi>
               </q>  For which if the Cardinal miſlike him, ſo do we; a further declaration of the true ſenſe and meaning of the Church in this particular we have from Mr. <hi>Alexander Noel,</hi> Dean of Saint <hi>Pauls,</hi> and Prolocutor of the Convocation in the year 1562. when the Articles, or Confeſſion of this Church were approved and ratified; who in his Catechiſm publickly allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be taught in all the Grammar Schools of this Realm, thus reſolves the point. The Queſtion is, <hi>Coeleſtis pars, &amp; ab omni ſenſu externo longe diſjuncta, quaenam eſt?</hi> That is to ſay, what is the Heavenly or Spiritual part of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper? To which the party Catechiſed returns this Anſwer. <hi>Corpus &amp; ſanguis Chriſti quae fidelibus in Coena Dominica praeben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, ab illiſque accipiuntur, comeduntur, &amp; bibuntur, coeleſti tantum &amp; ſpirituali modo, vere tamen atque reipſa; id eſt,</hi> the Heavenly or Spiritual part is the Body and Blood of Chriſt which are given to the faithful in the Lords Supper, and are taken, eaten, and drank by them; which though it be onely in an Heavenly and Spiritual manner, yet are they both given and taken <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>really,</hi> or <hi>in very deed,</hi> by Gods faithful people By which it ſeems, that it is agreed on on both ſides (that is to ſay, the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) that there is a true and <hi>real preſence</hi> of Chriſt in the holy <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> the diſagreement being onely in the <hi>modus Praeſentiae.</hi> But on the contrary, the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> in his <hi>Anſwer to the Jeſuits chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge,</hi> hath written one whole Chapter againſt the real preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament; In which though he would ſeem to aim at the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (though by that Church not onely the reall preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament, but the corporal eating of his body is maintained and taught) yet doth he ſtrike obliquely and on the <hi>by</hi> on the Church of <hi>England.</hi> All that he doth allow concerning the real preſence is no more then this, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That in the receiving of the bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we are to diſtinguiſh between the outward and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

bodily mouth we receive really the viſible elements of Bread and Wine; in the <hi>inward,</hi> we do by faith really re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Body and Blood of our Lord, that is to ſay, we are truely and indeed made partakers of Chriſt crucified, to the ſpiritual ſtrengthning of our inward man.</q> Which is no more then any <hi>Calviniſt</hi> in the pack (which either do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, or wilfully oppoſe the Doctrines of the Church of <hi>England</hi>) will ſtick to ſay.</p>
            <p>5. The Church of <hi>England</hi> teacheth that the Prieſt hath <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to forgive ſins,</hi> as may be eaſily proved by three ſeveral Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, not very eaſie to be anſwered. The firſt is from thoſe <hi>ſolemn words,</hi> uſed in the Ordination of the Prieſt or Presbyter, that is to ſay, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghoſt, whoſe ſins ye</hi> forgive <hi>they are</hi> forgiven, <hi>and whoſe ſins ye retain they are retained.</hi> Which were a groſs prophanation of the words of our Lord and Saviour, and a meer mockery of the Prieſt, if no ſuch power were given unto him as is there affirmed. The ſecond Argument is taken from one of the Exhortations before the Communion, where we find it thus, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>And becauſe it is requiſite that no man ſhould come to the holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but with a full truſt in Gods mercy, and with a quiet conſcience: therefore if there be any of you, which by the means aforeſaid cannot quiet his own Conſcience, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth further comfort or counſel, then let him come to me or to ſome other diſcreet and learned Miniſter of Gods word, and open his grief, that he may receive ſuch ghoſtly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, advice and comfort, as his conſcience may be relieved, and that by the Miniſtry of Gods word, he may receive comfort, and the benefit of <hi>abſolution,</hi> to the quieting of his conſcience, and avoiding of all ſcruple and doubtfulneſs.</q>  The third and moſt material proof we have in the form preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed for the <hi>viſitation of the ſick;</hi> In which it is required that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſick perſon hath made a confeſſion of his <hi>faith,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt himſelfe to be in charity with all men, he ſhall then make a ſpecial <hi>confeſſion if he feel his conſcience troubled with any weighty matter.</hi> And then it followeth, that after ſuch <hi>confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the Miniſter ſhall <hi>abſolve</hi> him in this manner, <hi>viz. Our Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>who hath left</hi> power <hi>to his</hi> Church <hi>to</hi> abſolve
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:130903:57"/>
               <hi>all ſinners which truly</hi> repent <hi>and</hi> believe <hi>in him, of his great mercy forgive thee thine offences: and by his</hi> Authority <hi>commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me, I</hi> abſolve <hi>thee from all thy ſins; in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, Amen.</hi> Of the firſt of theſe three places, deduced all of them from the beſt Monuments and Records of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> takes notice in his Anſwer to the Jeſuites challenge, <hi>p.</hi> 109. where he treatech purpoſely of the <hi>Prieſts power to forgive ſins,</hi> but gives us ſuch a gloſs upon it, as utterly ſubverts as well the Doctrine of this Church in that particular, as her purpoſe in it: and of the ſecond he takes notice, <hi>p.</hi> 81. where he ſpeaks purpoſely of <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> but gives us ſuch a gloſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that alſo as he did on the other. But of the third, which is more poſitive and material then the other two, he is not pleaſed to take any notice at all, as if no ſuch Doctrine were either taught by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or no ſuch power had been ever exerciſed by the Miniſters of it.</p>
            <p>For in the canvaſſing of this point, he declares ſometimes that the Prieſt doth forgive ſins onely <hi>declarative,</hi> by the way of declaration only, when on the conſideration of the true Faith, and ſincere Repentance of the party penitent, he doth declare unto him in the name of God, that his ſins are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned: and ſometimes that the Prieſt forgives ſins only <hi>opta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivè,</hi> by the way of prayers and interceſſion; when on the like conſideration he makes his prayers unto God, that the ſins of the penitent may be pardoned. Neither of which comes up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which holdeth that the Prieſt forgiveth ſins <hi>authoritativè,</hi> by vertue of a <hi>power</hi> committed to him by our Lord and Saviour. That the ſupreme power of forgiving ſins is in God alone, againſt whoſe Divine Majeſty all ſins, of what ſort ſoever, may be truly ſaid to be committed, was never queſtioned by any which pretended to the Chriſtian faith. The power which is given to the Prieſt is but a delegated gower, ſuch as is exerciſed by Judges under Soveraign Princes (where they are not tied unto the Verdict of twelve men, as with us in <hi>England</hi>) who by the power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them in their ſeveral Circuits and Diviſions, do actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally abſolve the party which is brought before them, if on good
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:130903:57"/>
proof they find him innocent of the crimes which he ſtands ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed for, and ſo diſcharge him of his Irons. And ſuch a power as this, I ſay, is both given to, and exerciſed by the Prieſts or Presbyters in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> For if they did forgive ſins onely <hi>Declarativè,</hi> that form of <hi>Abſolution</hi> which follows the <hi>general Confeſſion</hi> in the beginning of the Common-prayer-Book, would have been ſufficient, that is to ſay, <q>Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which deſireth not the death of a ſinner, but rather that he may turn from his wickedneſs and live; and hath given pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and commandment to his Miniſters to <hi>declare</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce</hi> to his people being <hi>penitent,</hi> the <hi>abſolution</hi> and remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their ſins; and pardoneth and abſolveth all them which truly repent, and unfainedly believe his holy Goſpel.</q>  Or if he did forgive ſins onely <hi>Optativè,</hi> in the way of prayers and interceſſion, there could not be a better way of <hi>Abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> then that which is preſcribed to be uſed by the Prieſt or Biſhop, after the general confeſsion made by ſuch as are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Communion, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>Almighty God our Heavenly Father, who of his great mercy hath promiſed forgiveneſs of ſins to all them which with hearty repentance and true faith turn unto him; have mercy upon you, pardon and deliver you from all your ſins, and confirm and ſtrengthen you in all goodneſs, and bring you to everlaſting life, through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </q>  Or elſe the firſt clauſe in the form of <hi>Abſolution</hi> uſed at the <hi>viſitation of the ſick,</hi> would have ſerved the turn, that is to ſay, <hi>Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath left</hi> power <hi>to his</hi> Church <hi>to</hi> abſolve <hi>all ſinners which truely repent, and believe in him, of his great mercy forgive thee thine offences.</hi> And there could be no reaſon at all imaginable, why the next clauſe ſhould be ſuperadded to this prayer, <hi>viz. And by his Authority committed to me, I</hi> abſolve <hi>thee from all thy ſins, &amp;c.</hi> if the Prieſt did not forgive ſins <hi>Authoritativè,</hi> by ſuch a delegated and commiſſionated power as before we ſpake of.</p>
            <p>And that this is the Doctrine and intent of the Church of<note place="margin">Mont. Gag. cap. 11. p. 78.</note> 
               <hi>England,</hi> appears by the acknowledgement of two learned men of the oppoſite faction. For thus ſaith one of the great
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:130903:58"/>
ſticklers for the Church of <hi>Rome, viz.</hi> 
               <q>Hereunto is alſo perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent the Doctrine of thoſe Proteſtants, who hold, that Prieſts have power, not onely to pronounce, but to give remiſſion of ſins. Yea, it ſeemeth to be the Doctrine of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion-Book, in the viſitation of the ſick; where the Prieſt ſaith, And by his Authority committed unto me, I abſolve thee from all thy ſins.</q> Then which there could not come a clearer Teſtimony from the mouth of an Adverſary. And for the other ſide I will take Dr. <hi>Lewis Bayley</hi> (afterwards Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Bangor</hi>) a man preciſe enough as to the perpetual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the Lords day Sabbath, and <hi>Calviniſt</hi> enough in ſome other <hi>Tenets</hi> of that <hi>rigid</hi> Sect; And yet this man in his Book called the <hi>Practice of Piety,</hi> not onely doth adviſe his ſick Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent to ſend in time for ſome godly Miniſter, to whom he may unfold his griefs &amp; confeſs his ſins, that ſo he may receive the benefit of Abſolution; but tells him, <q>that then he ſhould not doubt <hi>in foro conſcientiae,</hi> but that his ſins be as verily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given on earth, as if he did hear Chriſt himſelf, <hi>in foro judicii,</hi> pronouncing them to be forgiven in Heaven.</q> And this he doth exemplifie in Doctor <hi>Reynolds,</hi> the ableſt and moſt learned man of all that ſhewed themſelves on the <hi>Puritan</hi> party, who being on his death-bed, did earneſtly deſire to receive the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of <hi>ſacerdotal Abſolution,</hi> according to the form preſcribed in the Book of Common-prayer, and humbly received it at the hands of Dr. <hi>Holland,</hi> the <hi>Kings Profeſſor</hi> in Divinity in the <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity of Oxon,</hi> for the time then being; and when he was not able to expreſs his joy &amp; thankfulneſs in the way of ſpeech, did moſt affectionatly kiſs the hand that gave it: and yet this <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> had not only a chief hand in the <hi>Millenary Petition</hi> (as they commonly called it) preſented to K. <hi>James</hi> at his firſt coming to this Crown, wherein they excepted not only againſt the uſe, but the very name of <hi>Abſolution,</hi> as being a <hi>forinſecal</hi> word which they deſired to have corrected; but managed the whole buſines of it at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court. And this he did with ſuch fidelity and zeal, that to give that party ſome contentment, it was ordered in the <hi>Conference</hi> there, that to the word <hi>Abſolution</hi> in the <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick</hi> following the <hi>general confeſſion,</hi> theſe words, <hi>Remiſſion of ſins,</hi> ſhould be added for <hi>explanation ſake,</hi> as it ſtil continueth: ſo
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:130903:58"/>
powerful an <hi>Orator</hi> is <hi>death,</hi> as to perſwade men in <hi>extremities</hi> of <hi>ſickneſs</hi> to apply thoſe <hi>remedies,</hi> which in the times of <hi>health,</hi> they neither thought <hi>lawful</hi> nor <hi>convenient</hi> to be uſed in ſuch <hi>extremities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. But to proceed; in the Article of Chriſts <hi>deſcending into Hell,</hi> the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth maintain a <hi>local deſcent,</hi> that is to ſay, That the Soul of Chriſt, at ſuch time as his body lay in the grave, did <hi>locally</hi> deſcend into the nethermoſt parts, in which the <hi>Devil and his Angels are reſerved in everlaſting chains of darkneſs, unto the judgment of the great &amp; terrible day.</hi> This proved at large by Biſhop <hi>Bilſon</hi> in his learned and labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Work, entituled, <hi>The Survey of Chriſt's ſufferings;</hi> in which he hath amaſſed together whatſoever the Fathers, <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> or any of the ancient Writers have affirmed of this <hi>Article,</hi> with all the Points and Branches which depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. And that this was the meaning of the firſt Reformers, when this <hi>Article</hi> amongſt others was firſt agreed upon in the <hi>Convocation</hi> of the year 1552. appears by that paſſage of S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which is cited by them touching <hi>Christs preaching to the Spirits which were in priſon.</hi> And though that paſſage be left out of the preſent <hi>Article,</hi> according as it paſſed in the <hi>Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the year 1562. yet cannot that be uſed as an Argument to prove that the Church hath altered her judgment in that Point, as ſome men would have it; that paſſage being left out for theſe reaſons following: For firſt, that paſſage was conceived to make the Article too inclinable to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> makes the chief end of Chriſts <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent into Hell,</hi> to be the fetching thence the ſouls of the Fathers who died before and under the Law; and ſecondly, becauſe it was conceived by ſome learned men, that the Text was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſome other conſtruction than to be uſed for an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this <hi>Deſcent.</hi> The judgment of the Church conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth ſtill the ſame as before it was, and is as plain and poſitive for a <hi>local deſcent,</hi> as ever formerly: She had not elſe left this <hi>Article</hi> in the ſame place in which She found it, or given it the ſame diſtinct Title as before it had; viz. <hi>De Deſcenſu Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti ad Inferos,</hi> in the Latine Copies of King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Sixth,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Of the going down of Chriſt into Hell,</hi> as in the Engliſh Copies of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign. Nor indeed
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:130903:59"/>
was there any reaſon why this Article ſhould have any diſtinct place or Title at all, unleſſe the maintenance of a <hi>local De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent</hi> were intended by it. For having ſpoken in the former <hi>Article</hi> of Chriſts <hi>Suffering, Crucifying, Death and Burial,</hi> it had been a very great <hi>impertinency</hi> (not to call it worſe) to make a diſtinct <hi>Article</hi> of his <hi>Deſcending into Hell,</hi> if to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into Hell</hi> did ſignifie the ſame with this being buried, as ſome men then fancied, or that there were not in it ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meaning which might deſerve a place diſtinct from his Death and Burial. The Article ſpeaking thus, viz. <hi>As Chriſt died for us, and was buried, ſo is it to be believed that he went down into Hell,</hi> is either to be underſtood of a <hi>local Deſcent,</hi> or elſe we are tied to believe nothing by it but what was <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely</hi> or <hi>implicitely</hi> comprehended in the former Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle.</p>
            <p>Now that this is the Churches meaning cannot be better manifeſted then in the words of Mr. <hi>Alexander Noel</hi> before mentioned, who being Prolocutor of the Convocation in the year 1562. when this Article was diſputed, approved, and ratified, cannot in reaſon be ſuppoſed to be ignorant of the true ſenſe and meaning of this Church in that particular. And he accordingly in his Catechiſm publickly allowed of with reference to a local Deſcent, doth declare it thus, viz. <hi>Ut Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus corpore in terrae viſcera, ita anima corpore ſeparata ad Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros deſcendit, pariterque Mortis ejus vis ad mortuos Inferoſque adeo ipſos uſque eò permanavit, ut &amp; Animae incredulorum tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſſimae ipſorum incredulitati maximè debitae condemnationis ſenſum perciperent, ipſeque Satanas Inferorum Princeps, tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nidis ſuae &amp; tenebrarum potentiam omnem afflictam, profligatam, &amp; ruina oppreſſam eſſe animad verteret.</hi> Id eſt, As Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended in his body into the bowels of the earth, ſo in his ſoul ſeparated from that body he deſcended alſo into Hell, by means whereof the power and efficacy of his death was not made known onely to the dead, but the Divels themſelves; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that both the ſouls of the unbelievers did ſenſibly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that condemnation which was moſt juſtly due to them for their incredulity, and Satan himſelf the Prince of Divels, did as plainly ſee that his tyrannie and all the powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

were oppreſt, ruined, and deſtroyed. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> alloweth not any ſuch <hi>local Deſcent</hi> as is maintained by the Church, and defended by the moſt learned Members of it, who have left us any thing in writing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Article. And yet he neither follows the opinion of <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf, nor of the generality of thoſe of the <hi>Calvini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> party, who herein differ from their Maſter; but goes a new way of a later diſcovery, in which although he had few Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, he hath found many followers. By Chriſts <hi>Deſcending into Hell,</hi> he would have nothing elſe to be underſtood, but his continuing in the <hi>ſtate of ſeparation</hi> between the body and the ſoul, his <hi>remaining under the power of Death</hi> during the time that he lay buried in the grave; which is no more in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, though it differ ſomewhat in the terms, then to ſay, that he died and was buried, and roſe not till the third day, as the <hi>Creed</hi> inſtructs us. And yet to ſet out this opinion to the beſt advantage, he hath laid out more coſt upon it, then upon all the reſt of his Anſwer to the Jeſuits Challenge, thronging together ſo many citations concerning the word <hi>Hades,</hi> out of old <hi>Greek</hi> Authors, ſo many Critical Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on their Words and Phraſes, out of Grammarians, Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaſts, and Etymologiſts, as ſerve abundantly both to amaze the ignorant, and to confound the learned. Nothing leſſe meant in all thoſe Collections, then to aſſert the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in this particular, no more then he hath done in the other Points before remembred, though all of them are either to be found in the <hi>Book of Articles,</hi> to which he had ſubſcribed, as Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> hath informed us, <hi>p.</hi> 118. or in the <hi>Book of Common Prayer</hi> which he was bound to conform himſelf unto, both in judgment and practice, as being impos'd by Act of Parliament on the Church of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. I ſhould now proceed to ſee what difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the Lord <hi>Primates</hi> own judgment in the point of <hi>Free-will,</hi> which he hath given us in his <hi>Anſwer to the Jeſuits Challenge</hi> p. 464. But becauſe that point hath ſome relation to the <hi>Nine Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> of <hi>Lambeth,</hi> I ſhall take no other notice of it, then as it
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:130903:60"/>
is comprehended in thoſe Articles; in the defence whereof the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> did appear with ſo great affection as made him very gracious in the eyes of the <hi>Calvinian Party</hi> both at Home and Abroad. But this together with the little eſteem he had of the <hi>Orders, Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is left to be the ſubject of the following <hi>Section.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Lambeth</hi> when made, and on what occaſion; Diſlik't and ſuppreſt by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and rejected by King <hi>James</hi> at the Conference at <hi>Hampton-Court;</hi> Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced and defended by the Lord <hi>Primate,</hi> who for ſo doing is much honoured by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Puritans.

His <hi>Inconformity</hi> to the Orders, Rites, and Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in ſix particulars.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>WE are informed by Doctor <hi>Bernard,</hi> that the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Primate did fully approve the</hi> Articles of Religion <hi>of the Church of England</hi> in points of Doctrine, <hi>as the ſame more enlarged in the</hi> Articles of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that he <hi>alſo did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the</hi> Diſcipline and Conſtitution <hi>of both</hi> Churches, p. 144. By which if Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> means that the <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> of <hi>England</hi> were the ſame with thoſe of the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> (though more enlarged in theirs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> than in ours of <hi>England</hi>) he is much miſtaken, there being many things contained in the Articles of the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> extremely differing from the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as ſhall be ſhewn particularly in a place more proper. But becauſe the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> is no otherwiſe concerned therein then in relation to the <hi>Nine Articles</hi> of <hi>Lambeth,</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:130903:60"/>
which are incorporated and contained in thoſe of <hi>Ireland,</hi> I ſhall confine my ſelf preciſely unto that particular. And I ſhall find enough in that to ſhew the Lord <hi>Primates</hi> further differences from the Church of <hi>England;</hi> thoſe Articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining all the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Rigours in the Points of <hi>Praedeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Grace, Free-will,</hi> &amp;c. which have produced ſo much Diſturbance in theſe parts of Chriſtendom. Thoſe <hi>Articles</hi> firſt occaſioned by ſome Differences which aroſe in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> between Doctor <hi>Whitaker</hi> the Queens Profeſſor, and Doctor <hi>Peter Baro</hi> the Lady <hi>Margarets</hi> Profeſſor in that <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity;</hi> agreed on at a private meeting in <hi>Lambeth-houſe, Anno</hi> 1595. None but the Lord Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Biſhop Elect of <hi>London,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Bangor,</hi> with ſome learned men of Doctor <hi>Whitakers</hi> own party being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at it; and being ſo made were ſent to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> rather to ſilence Doctor <hi>Baro,</hi> than to compoſe the Differences by any equal expedient. So that being made on a particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, at a private meeting, and by men not impowered to any ſuch purpoſe, they were never looked on otherwiſe, than as <hi>private Opinions,</hi> not as the <hi>Tendries</hi> of this Church. So far diſliked by Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> when ſhe firſt heard of them, that they were preſently ſuppreſt by her command, and ſo ſuppreſt, that we hear no more news of them till the Conference at <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Court,</hi> where they found no better entertainment from the hands of King <hi>James:</hi> for Doctor <hi>Reinolds</hi> having mov'd that the <hi>Nine Orthodoxal Aſſertions</hi> (as he called them) which were made at <hi>Lambeth</hi> might be added to the Articles of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> the motion was not onely oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Biſhops, but denied by the King: oppoſed by the Biſhops by reaſon of their inconſiſtency with the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> denied and rejected by the King, becauſe he held the matters therein contained to be fitter for the publick Schools than the Book of Articles. But on the contrary, the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> alwayes ſhewed himſelf in favour of thoſe Articles, thoſe <hi>Orthodoxal Aſſertions,</hi> as the Doctor called them, praetermitting no occaſion to defend and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance them, and to that end cauſed them to be inſerted into the Articles of the Church of <hi>Ireland, Anno</hi> 1615. For if
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:130903:61"/>
we may believe Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi> (as in this caſe queſtionleſs we may) it was his doing that theſe Nine Articles of <hi>Lambeth</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether wth the preciſe obſervance of the New Lords-day-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, a different explication of the Article of Chriſts Deſcent into Hell, from that allowed of by this Church, and almoſt all the other Heterodoxies of the Sect of <hi>Calvin,</hi> were interſerted and incorporated into the Articles of <hi>Ireland:</hi> we being told by Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> in the Hiſtory of his Life and Death, <hi>p.</hi> 49. that in the Convocation held at <hi>Dublin Anno 1615. he being then a Member of that Synod, was appointed to draw up thoſe Articles,</hi> which then and there were approved and ratified for the eſtabliſht Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Ireland.</hi> This did he towards the advancing of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Doctrines in his own native Countrey, and for ſo doing was much flattered and applauded by the <hi>Engliſh Calviniſts</hi> as the chief Patron of the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> the <hi>Cauſe of God,</hi> as ſome of them were pleaſed to call it. <hi>Viſsius,</hi> a Divine of the <hi>Low Countreys,</hi> publiſht a Book entituled, <hi>The Pelagian History,</hi> demonſtrating therein that the Fathers, and other ancient Writers, in their ſeveral ages, maintained ſucceſſively thoſe Opinions in the matters of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination,</hi> and the Points depending thereupon, as the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants</hi> (or <hi>Arminians,</hi> as ſome call them) did in the <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi> Churches. A Book which ſuddenly grew into great reputation with moſt knowing and unbiaſſed men, who had not been before engaged in the preſent quarrels. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to give a ſtop to it in the middle of its full carere, the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> publiſhed the Hiſtory of <hi>Goteſchalcus;</hi> Of which thus Doctor <hi>Twiſſe</hi> in his Letter to the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> of the 29. of <hi>May</hi> 1640. Where having firſt ſpoken of his <q>
                  <hi>Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Piety and Wiſdom in reference to the neceſsitous condition of thoſe times,</hi> in inſerting the Hiſtory of <hi>Pelagius</hi> in his Book <hi>De primordiis Eccleſiarum Britannicarum,</hi> ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely coming in his way; he after addeth, that his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Goteſchalcus</hi> was a <hi>piece of the like nature,</hi> and that it came out moſt ſeaſonably in reſpect of <hi>Voſsius;</hi> for the relieving of whoſe credit thereupon, there had been many meetings by ſome in <hi>London,</hi> that by the coming forth of that Piece, he was the better inabled in the purſuit of his
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:130903:61"/>
Anſwer to <hi>Corvinus,</hi> which he was in hand with, and to meet with the Dictates of <hi>N. N.</hi> who endeavoured to juſtifie ſome conceit of <hi>Voſsius,</hi> but upon very weak grounds.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Thus (ſaith he) I have obſerved with comfort the hand of God to have gone along with your <hi>Grace,</hi> for the honouring the Cauſe of his Truth, in ſo precious a Point as is the glory of his <hi>Grace.</hi> And I nothing doubt but the ſame <hi>hand of our good God</hi> will be with you ſtill, and his wiſdom will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in all things you undertake, whether of your own choice, or upon the motion of others.</q> So he; and in him we may partly ſee the minds of the reſt.</p>
            <p>But there was ſomewhat elſe which did as much indear him to that <hi>Party,</hi> as the <hi>Nine Articles</hi> of <hi>Lambeth,</hi> namely the little eſteem he had of the Orders, Rites, and Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which made him ſo agreeable to them, that they plied him with continual Letters when he was in <hi>Ireland,</hi> Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> telling us (and I dare take it on his word) <q>That he had ſeen divers <hi>Letters</hi> wrote unto him from thoſe who were aſperſed with the name of <hi>Puritans,</hi> full of reſpect and large expreſſions of their <hi>love</hi> to <hi>him, p.</hi> 160.</q> And at his comings into <hi>England</hi> he was much viſited by the Grandees and learned Men of that <hi>Faction;</hi> not that they found any reaſon to make uſe of him for deſign and counſel, but partly for the reputation w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he brought with him to the Cauſe; and partly for the benefit they received by conferring with him, who was indeed a <hi>walking Concordance,</hi> and <hi>a living Library.</hi> Nor was he leſs courted by their Followers, the Lay-Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren alſo; by whom he was careſſed, complemented, feaſted whereſoever he came, many good people being admitted to thoſe Meetings as well to feed on his Diſcourſes, as to fill their bellies. For though Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> pleaſe to tell us that the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> did approve the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions</hi> of both Churches, yet when he comes unto particulars he confutes himſelf; giving us <hi>gratis</hi> ſeveral inſtances which are but ſorry proofs of ſuch Approbation: whether we look upon the Canons of the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſeparately and in themſelves, or on the publick <hi>Liturgy</hi> alſo, which though firſt fitted for the uſe and edification of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:130903:62"/>
were afterwards impoſed by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom on the Church of <hi>Ireland.</hi> In the particulars whereof we ſhall go no further then Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> doth conduct us. Firſt then,</p>
            <p>It is appointed by one <hi>Rubrick</hi> in the <hi>Liturgy</hi> or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer Book, <hi>That all Prieſts and Deacons ſhall be bound to ſay daily the Morning and Evening Prayer either private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or openly, except they be let by preaching, studying of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or ſome other urgent cauſe:</hi> and in the reſt it is directed in what courſe and order, the ſaid Morning and Evening Prayer is to be Officiated, on what dayes the <hi>Letany</hi> is to be ſaid or ſung; as alſo upon what dayes the Communion-ſervice is to be uſed, and in what part of that ſervice the Sermon is to have its place, and what other parts of that ſervice are to follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it. Which laſt obſervance being neglected by ſome who would not tie themſelves unto any Rule by others, becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lecturers onely, they were not charged with <hi>Cure of Souls,</hi> it was required by King <hi>Charles</hi> in ſome Inſtructions which he ſent to all the Biſhops ſeverally and reſpectively in the Realm of <hi>England Anno 1628. That every Lecturer ſhould read the</hi> Divine Service, <hi>according to the Liturgy printed by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, in his Surplice and Hood before the Lecture.</hi> But on the contrary Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> tells us of the Lord <hi>Primate, That he was not ſo</hi> rigid, <hi>as to tie all men in the</hi> private, <hi>to an abſolute neceſſary uſe of it, or in the</hi> publick, <hi>that a Sermon was not to be heard, unleſſe that did precede,</hi> p. 145. He took great care (as Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> hath informed us <hi>p.</hi> 155.) for the <hi>often publick reading of the</hi> Ten Commandments <hi>and the</hi> Creed <hi>before the Congregation, according to the cuſtome of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reformed Churches,</hi> of which care there had been no need, if the publick Liturgy had been read as it ought to be, as well the <hi>Commandments</hi> as the <hi>Creed</hi> being appointed to be read publickly in the Courſe thereof. But being it is ſaid with reference to the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> I want reaſon to believe that the <hi>often publick reading</hi> of the <hi>Commandments</hi> and the <hi>Creed</hi> ſupplied the place of the <hi>Publick Liturgy</hi> on the dayes of Preaching, according to the Cuſtome of ſome of the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> which were therein imitated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:130903:62"/>Secondly, it is appointed by the Liturgy or Common-pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-Book of Both Churches what dayes ſhould be accounted holy, and obſerved as Feſtivals, each of them having their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Leſſons, Collects, Epiſtles and Goſpels, as well the Sunday or Lords day it ſelfe, or as the greater Feſtivals of <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> and <hi>Whitſuntide,</hi> or thoſe of the Aſcenſion and Nativity of our Lord and Saviour. No difference made between them (except it be the addition of ſome proper Pſalmes to ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Feſtivals) in the intent and purpoſe of the publick Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies. But whether the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> obſerved all theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Holy dayes</hi> which the Church allows of, and in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as is preſcribed by the Church, may be very well doubted. Its true, that Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> tells us, that it was the Lord <hi>Primates</hi> judgement and opinion, <q>That the <hi>Annual Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morations</hi> of the <hi>Articles</hi> of the Faith, ſuch as the <hi>Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Paſſion, Reſurrection</hi> of our Saviour, &amp;c. were ſtill to be obſerved (which Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith in his time were in uſe <hi>through the whole Catholick Church</hi> of Chriſt) and is now in other <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> as a means to keep them in the <hi>memory</hi> of the vulgar, according to the <hi>pattern</hi> of Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Old Teſtament, for the <hi>types</hi> of them, as appeared by his then <hi>conſtant preaching</hi> on thoſe Subjects, </q>
               <bibl>
                  <hi>p.</hi> 152.</bibl> But then it is as true withal, that Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> tells us nothing of the Lord <hi>Primates</hi> obſervation of the other Holy dayes, as certainly he would have done, had there been ground for it. And therefore if the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> were ſo punctual in keeping the <hi>Anniverſaries</hi> of the <hi>Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Paſſion, Reſurrection</hi> and <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> of our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and of the <hi>coming down of the Holy Ghost,</hi> as Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith he was; it may be probably conceived, that this was done rather in compliance with ſome of the forraign <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> which obſerve thoſe dayes, and thoſe dayes onely, than in obedience to the preſcripts of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the day of the <hi>Paſſion</hi> of our Saviour, commonly called <hi>Goodfriday,</hi> is by both Churches reckoned for <hi>jejuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ſtatum,</hi> a ſtanding, though but an Annual Faſt, as well as <hi>Lent,</hi> the <hi>Ember dayes,</hi> and <hi>Rogation week;</hi> and hath its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:130903:63"/>
and diſtinct office, that is to ſay, its proper Leſſons, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, Epiſtle, and Goſpel, accommodated to the day, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way inſtructive in the ſtory of our Saviours paſſion. And it is ordered by the thirteenth Canon of the year 1603. That <q>all Miniſters ſhall obſerve the Orders, Rites, and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies preſcribed in the Book of Common-prayer, as well in reading the holy Scriptures, and ſaying of Prayers, as in Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, <hi>without</hi> either <hi>diminiſhing in regard of preaching,</hi> or in any other reſpect, or adding any thing in the matter and form thereof.</q> But on the contrary Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> telleth us, that <q>the Friday before <hi>Easter (Good Friday</hi> by no means, take heed of that) appointed for the remembrance of the <hi>Paſſion</hi> of our Saviour, was by the Lord Primate at <hi>Droghedah</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> obſerved duly as a <hi>ſolemn faſt,</hi> inclining the rather to that choice (that is to ſay, of making it a <hi>ſolemn,</hi> not a <hi>ſtanding</hi> faſt) out of <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and the ſecurity from cenſure,</hi> by the then cuſtome of having Sermons beyond their ordinary limit in <hi>England;</hi> and that when the publick prayers were ended, (that is to ſay, ſo much of the publick prayers as might be no hindrance to his preaching) be preached upon that ſubject, extending himſelf in Prayer and Sermon beyond his ordinary time; which being known to be his conſtant cuſtom, ſome from <hi>Dublin,</hi> as other parts, came to partake of it,</q>  
               <bibl>
                  <hi>p.</hi> 154.</bibl>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, by the 55. Canon of the year 1603. there is a form of Prayer preſcribed to be uſed by Preachers before their Sermons, the beginning of which Canon is as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>Before all Sermons, Lectures and Homilies, Preachers and Miniſters ſhall move the people to joyn with them in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in this Form, or to this effect, as briefly as conveniently they may. Ye ſhall pray for Chriſts holy Catholick Church, &amp;c.</q>  But on the contrary Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> tells us of the Lord <hi>Primate,</hi> that he did not onely ſpin out his own Prayers to a more then ordinary length, as appeareth by the former paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; but that he was alſo much for the <hi>Miniſters improving of their gifts and abilities in prayer before Sermon and after, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own practice,</hi> p. 150. and that he required the like extemporary and unpremeditated prayers of his houſhold
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:130903:63"/>
Chaplains in his Family-prayers at ſix of the clock in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and at eight at night.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, it is appointed by the eighteenth Canon of the year 1603. <q>That as often as in the Divine Service the Lord <hi>JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS</hi> ſhall be mentioned, due and lowly reverence ſhall be done by all perſons preſent, as it hath been accuſtomed; teſtifying by theſe outward Ceremonies &amp; Geſtures, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Humility, Chriſtian Reſolution, and due acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the true and eternal Son of God, is the onely Saviour of the World, in whom alone all Mercies, Graces, and Promiſes of God to mankind, for this life, and the life to come, are fully and wholly compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</q>But on the contrary Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> tells us of the Lord <hi>Primate,</hi> p. 147. <q>That as for <hi>bowing</hi> at the name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> though he cenſured not thoſe that did, either in <hi>our</hi> or other <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches, according to the cuſtome of each (which we of <hi>England</hi> muſt needs take for a ſpecial fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour) yet he did not conceive the injunction of it could be founded upon that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 10. and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at ſome learned mens aſſertions, that it was the expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the Fathers upon it; (a touch for Doctor <hi>Andrews,</hi> the late learned and moſt renowned Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter:</hi>) and as the wiſe compoſers of the Liturgy gave no direct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction for it there;</q> ſo in <hi>Ireland</hi> he withſtood the putting of it into the Canon, <hi>Anno</hi> 1634.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, it is appointed by the ſaid eighteenth Canon of the year, 1603. <q>That no man ſhall cover his head in the Church or Chappel in the time of Divine Service (whereof I hope the Sermon did deſerve to be accounted part) except he have ſome infirmity, in which caſe let him wear a night-Cap or Coif; and in the ſeventh Canon of the year 1640. that all good and well-affected people, members of this Church, be ready to tender their acknowledgement unto the Lord (in whoſe houſe they are) by doing reverence and obeiſance at their coming in and going out of the Church, Chancel or Chappel, according to the moſt ancient cuſtome of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church in the pureſt times, and of this Church alſo for many years in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </q> What low
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:130903:64"/>
eſteem the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> had of theſe two Canons, and how little he conformed himſelf to the tenour and intent thereof, might be eaſily proved, but that I am to go no further in theſe particulars, then Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> doth conduct me. All there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall adde is this, that though theſe Canons did not bind the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> unto any obſervance when he was in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> yet at ſuch time as he was in <hi>England,</hi> and conſtantly repaired to one Church or other, he was obliged both in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law, and for the avoiding of ſcandal, to conform unto them. <hi>Cum Romae ſum jejuno Sabbato, cum hic ſum non jejuno Sabbato,</hi> was the rule and practice of Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> who was not only Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Millan,</hi> but perhaps Lord <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> of the Dioceſs of <hi>Italy</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>All this conſidered, Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> needed not to have told us of him, <hi>That he did not affect ſome arbitrary innovations, not within the compaſs of the Rule and Order of the Book; and that he did not take upon him to introduce any Rite or Ceremony upon his own opinion of</hi> Decency, <hi>till the Church had judged it ſo.</hi> p. 147. It was too manifeſt by that which hath been ſaid before, that there were no <hi>works of ſupererogation</hi> to be lookt for from him. It had been well if he had <hi>readily obſerved what was commanded in the Book</hi> (as Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> ſayes he did when he was in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and had applyed himſelf to thoſe <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cencies which the Church had judged</hi> to be fit, when he was i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

For this might very well be done, and yet the men remain as unconformable to the Rules of the Church (their kneeling at the Communion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted onely) as they were before. Matters which had not now been brought to the publick view, if Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> had not given as well the hints, as the occaſion for theſe Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.

            </argument>
            <p>ANd now we are come to Doctor <hi>Bernard,</hi> who promiſing no more then the <hi>confirmation</hi> of ſomething which the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> had written in one of his Letters, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Articles of <hi>Ireland were not called in</hi> Anno 1634. <hi>as Doctor</hi>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:130903:65"/>
Heylyn <hi>had affirmed,</hi> p. 173. muſt needs go ſomewhat out of his way, to hook in the remembrance of ſome former Quarrels which Doctor <hi>Heylyn</hi> had forgotten, and is not now willing to remember. The Author of the Book called <hi>Extraneus va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulans,</hi> whoſoever he was, declares himſelf unwilling to receive that Queſtion, <q>
                  <hi>Whether the</hi> Lord Primate <hi>had any</hi> ſharp tooth againſt the Lord Lieutenant <hi>or not,</hi> in regard the parties were both dead, and all diſpleaſures buried in the ſame grave with them, <hi>p.</hi> 292. He alſo wiſhed that the Doctor by his <hi>Panegyrick</hi> had not awakened thoſe enquiries, which were like to be ſo little advantagious to the memory of that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Prelate, p. 296. And finally conceived, that Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> would have done that reverend perſon, and himſelf ſome right, if he had ſuffered ſuch Enquiries to die with the parties moſt concerned in them, without reviving them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by his double diligence,</q> 
               <hi>p.</hi> 298. Which paſſages if Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Bernard</hi> had laid to heart, he would not ſo unſeaſonably have endevoured to revive that Quarrel, and brought Doctor <hi>Heylyn</hi> on the ſtage, provoking him by ſeveral wayes to reſume that Argument, which he had long ſince laid aſide, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon no provocation whatſoever to take up again. He hath laid the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> down again in the Bed of Peace, and will not raiſe him from it by a new diſturbance. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> tells us that it is <hi>left to the</hi> prudence <hi>of a third perſon (who hath a</hi> convenient <hi>opportunity in his Hiſtory) to clear the whole, in the Examination and Moderation of all the paſſages between Mr.</hi> l'Eſtrange <hi>and him,</hi> p. 114. That <hi>third perſon,</hi> whoſoever he is, muſt be very <hi>prudent,</hi> if he can carry the matter ſo, and with ſuch <hi>Moderation,</hi> as not to give offence to both parties, and be called to an account by each of them for his <hi>Examination.</hi> For ſo it hapneth many times, that he who voluntarily ſteps in to part a <hi>fray</hi> between two perſons, gets ſome knocks on both ſides, at the leaſt from one. And therefore it was well reſolved by one of the old Heathen Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, <hi>Se nolle inter duos Amicos Arbitrum eſſe &amp;c.</hi> that he vvould never arbitrate any buſineſs betvveen tvvo of his Friends, becauſe he vvas ſure that by his ſo doing, he muſt make one of them to become his Enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:130903:65"/>The preamble of Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> being thus paſſed over, we next proceed unto the <hi>Confirmation</hi> which he hath in hand. And therein alſo pretermitting his whole Narrative, touching the carriage of the buſineſs in the Convocation of the year 1634. we will pitch only on the examination of this point, <hi>viz.</hi> whether the ſuperinducing of the <hi>Articles of the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> were not a virtual repealing of the <hi>Articles of the Church of Ireland.</hi> And for the better proceeding in it, I think it not unneceſſary to produce that <hi>Canon,</hi> which is the ground of the Diſpute. The Title of it this, <hi>viz. Of the Agreement of the Church of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>in the profeſsion of the ſame Chriſtian faith.</hi> The Body of it this, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>For the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of our Agreement with the <hi>Church of England</hi> in the Confeſſion of the ſame Chriſtian Faith and Doctrine of the Sacraments; We <hi>do receive and approve the Book of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Religion, agreed upon by the Arch-Biſhops and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and the whole Clergy, in the whole convocation holden at London, Anno Dom. 1562. for avoiding of the diverſities of opinions, and for the eſtabliſhing of conſent touching true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> And therefore if any hereafter ſhall affirm that any of thoſe Articles are in any part ſuperſtitious or erroneous, or ſuch as he may not with a good conſcience ſubſcribe unto; Let him be excommunicated, and not abſolved, before he make a publick revocation of his error.</q> Theſe are the very words of the Canon it ſelfe, and from theſe words the <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator</hi> did conclude that the Articles of <hi>England</hi> were received in ſtead of the other; but Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> makes this conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Canon, <hi>That there was not a reception of the one</hi> in ſtead <hi>of the other, but the</hi> one with the other, <hi>p. 119. That in the Canon the Articles of</hi> England <hi>are received not</hi> in ſtead, <hi>but</hi> with <hi>thoſe of</hi> Ireland, <hi>p.</hi> 120. But which of the two is in the right will be beſt ſeen by the Arguments produced on both ſides, and by the Anſwers which are made to thoſe ſeveral Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
            <p>And firſt the <hi>Obſervator</hi> takes notice of ſome <hi>ſcandal</hi> given unto the Papiſts, and the occaſion of ſome deriſions which they had thereby, that in the Churches of three Kingdoms profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſame Religion, &amp; being under the patronage of one ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:130903:66"/>
Prince, there ſhould be three diſtinct (and in ſome points contrary) confeſsions; and that for the avoiding of this <hi>ſcandal,</hi> it was thought fit there ſhould be one Confeſſion, or one Book of Articles onely for the Churches of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> not without hope that <hi>Scotland</hi> would ſoon follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And thereupon he doth infer, that if the ſuperinducing or receiving of a new Confeſſion be not a repealing of the old, there muſt be two Confeſſions in the ſame Church differing in many points from one another. Which would have been ſo far from creating an uniformity of belief between the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and taking away thereby the matter of deriſion which was given the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> in two diſtinct (<hi>and in ſome points con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi>) Confeſſions, yet both pretending unto one and the ſame Religion; that it would rather have increaſed their ſcorn, and made a greater diſagreement in <hi>Ireland</hi> it ſelfe, then was before between the Churches of both Kingdoms. The ſecond Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is taken from theſe words of Saint <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> 8. 13. viz. <hi>Dicendo novum veteravit prius, &amp;c.</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>in that he ſaith a new Covenant, he hath made the firſt old,</hi> as our <hi>Engliſh</hi> reads it, and then it followeth, that <hi>that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vaniſh away,</hi> that is to ſay, the old being diſanulled by the new, there muſt neceſſarily follow the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of its uſe and practice. So that unleſs it may be thought, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was out in his <hi>Logick,</hi> as I think it may not, the ſuperinducing of a new Covenant muſt be the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating of the old. His third Argument is taken from the Abrogation of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sabbath by ſuperinducing of the Lords day for the day of Worſhip; By means whereof, the Sabbath was leſſened in authority and reputation by little and little, and in ſhort time vvas abſolutely laid aſide in the Church of Chriſt; the fourth Commandment, by vvhich it vvas at firſt ordained, being ſtill in force. His fourth and laſt Argument vvas, that the firſt <hi>Liturgy</hi> of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Parliament, vvith ſeveral penalties to thoſe vvho ſhould refuſe to officiate by it, or ſhould not diligently reſort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair unto it, as appears by the Statute 2, &amp; 3. <hi>Edw. 6. c.</hi> 1. vvas actually repealed by the authorizing of the ſecond <hi>Liturgy</hi> of the 5, &amp; 6. of King <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. vvhich vvas forthvvith received
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:130903:66"/>
into uſe and practice in all parts of the Kingdom, the former <hi>Liturgy</hi> being no otherwiſe ſuppreſſed and called in, then by the ſuperinducing of this, the Statute upon which it ſtood, continuing <hi>unrepealed,</hi> in full force and virtue, and many Clauſes of the ſame related to in the Statute which confirmed the ſecond. Upon which Ground it was inferred that the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> were <hi>virtually,</hi> though not <hi>formally abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated,</hi> by the <hi>ſuperinducing</hi> of the Articles of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the firſt and laſt of theſe four Arguments, Doctor <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> takes no notice at all, and returns but one Anſwer to the ſecond and third, which notwithſtanding may ſerve alſo for the firſt and laſt; juſt as an Almanack calculated for the <hi>Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> may generally ſerve for the uſe of all <hi>Great Britain.</hi> The Anſwer is, <q>That the Apoſtles ſpeech of <hi>making void the old Covenant by ſpeaking of a new,</hi> or taking in the firſt day of the Week to be the <hi>Sabbath</hi> inſtead of the laſt, when but one of the ſeven was to be kept, doth not fit the Caſe; for in theſe there was a <hi>Superinduction</hi> and reception of the one for the other; but in the Canon, the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>England</hi> are received not <hi>inſtead,</hi> but with thoſe of <hi>Ireland;</hi>
               </q> which by his leave is not ſo much an Anſwer to the <hi>Obſervators</hi> Arguments, as a plain begging of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: For if this Anſwer will hold good in <hi>Ireland,</hi> it might have held good alſo in the Land of <hi>Judaea,</hi> and the Parts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning, where both the Lords-day and the Sabbath, the old Law and the Goſpel, did for a time remain together. As for the <hi>Doctors</hi> Arguments, <q>That the <hi>Reception</hi> of the Articles of the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth no more argue an Abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Articles of <hi>Ireland,</hi> than that the <hi>Apoſtles Creed</hi> was abrogated by the reception of the <hi>Nicene</hi> and <hi>Athanaſian</hi> 
               </q>
               <bibl>p. 118.</bibl> it is eaſily anſwered. For as the <hi>Doctor</hi> well obſerves, the <hi>Nicene</hi> and <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creeds are but <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements</hi> of the other, and that in ſome particular Points onely in which the Hereticks of thoſe times had diſturbed the peace of the Church. So that thoſe <hi>Creeds</hi> are but the Explanations of the other in the Points diſputed, and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Church with reference onely to the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:130903:67"/>
of ſome Hereſies, and the Explication of ſome Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox or Catholick Doctrines, which had been oppoſed by thoſe Hereſies. More eaſily is the Argument anſwered, importing <q>That the reception into our uſe the form of the Lords Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er according to S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> ſhould by the ſame reaſon ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate that of S. <hi>Luke</hi> being the ſhorter.</q> For firſt the Lords Prayer as it ſtands in S. <hi>Lukes</hi> Goſpel was never recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the <hi>Lyturgie</hi> of the Church, and therefore could not be abrogated by the Churches making choice of the other which we find in S. <hi>Matthew.</hi> And ſecondly it was not in the power of the Church to have abrogated that Prayer as it ſtands in S. <hi>Luke,</hi> becauſe it is a part of the Goſpel of the word of God, which the Church hath no Authority to change or alter, and much leſſe to <hi>abrogate.</hi> All that the Church can be ſaid to have done in this particular, is that the Church made choice rather of the Lords Prayer as it ſtands in S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> then as it ſtands in S. <hi>Luke,</hi> when it was abſolutely in her power to make choice of either. No contrariety to be found in any one clauſe of the ſaid two <hi>Pater Noſters,</hi> nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the leaſt contradiction to be met with between thoſe three Creeds, or any one Article of the ſame, differing no otherwiſe in a manner but as the Commentary and the Text. But ſo it is not in the Caſe which is now before us, nor in the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of making one general confeſſion of all the Reformed Churches, if they were ſeverally ſubſcribed with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Articles. He that ſubſcribes unto the Articles of <hi>Ireland</hi> may without any doubt or ſcruple ſubſcribe unto the Articles or Confeſſions of all the Reformed (or <hi>Calvinian</hi>) Churches. But if he take the Articles of <hi>England</hi> alſo into that account, he muſt of neceſſity ſubſcribe to many plain and manifeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieties.</p>
            <p>Againſt this nothing hath been ſaid, but that there is no <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial difference</hi> between thoſe Articles, as was conceived by the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> p. 118. that <hi>both Confeſſions are conſistent</hi> as is affirmed by Doctor <hi>Bernards moſt eminent, learned,</hi> and <hi>judicious</hi> perſon, <hi>p.</hi> 121. and finally that there is <hi>no difference in ſubſtance, but onely in Method, number of Subjects determined, and other circumſtantials,</hi> as is declared by Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:130903:67"/>
p. 119. But if the contrary be proved, and that it ſhall appear that there is a <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> difference between thoſe Articles, that the Confeſſions of both Churches are <hi>inconſiſtent,</hi> and that they do not onely differ in the <hi>Circumstantials</hi> of <hi>Method, Number,</hi> and the like; I hope that then it will be granted that the <hi>approving</hi> and <hi>receiving</hi> of the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was <hi>virtually</hi> and in effect an Abrogating of the former Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Church of <hi>Ireland.</hi> And for the proof of this I ſhall compare ſome paſſages in the Articles of <hi>Ireland</hi> as they paſſed in <hi>Convocation Anno</hi> 1615. with the Doctrines publickly profeſſed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained expreſly and <hi>in terminis</hi> in the <hi>Book of Articles,</hi> or elſe delivered in ſome other publick Monument of Record of the <hi>Church of England</hi> to which thoſe Articles relate: Firſt then,</p>
            <p>The Articles of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> have entertained and incorporated the <hi>Nine Articles</hi> of <hi>Lambeth,</hi> containing all the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Rigours in the Points of <hi>Predeſtination, Grace, Free-will,</hi> &amp;c. which <hi>Articles,</hi> or any of them, could never find admittance in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by reaſon of their inconſiſtency with the authorized Doctrines of it, as before was ſaid: ſo that by the incorporating of thoſe Nine Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles into the Articles of <hi>Ireland,</hi> there are as many aberrations from the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Secondly, It is ſaid of Chriſt (<hi>Num.</hi> 30.) that for our ſakes he <hi>endured moſt grievous torments immediately in his Soul,</hi> and moſt painful ſufferings in his Body. The enduring of which grievous torments in his Soul, as <hi>Calvin</hi> not without ſome touch of <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> did firſt deviſe, ſo did he lay it down for the true ſenſe and meaning of the <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Chriſts deſcending into Hell.</hi> In which expreſſion as the Articles of <hi>Ireland</hi> have taken up the words of <hi>Calvin,</hi> ſo it may rationally be conceived that they take them with his meaning and conſtruction alſo; the rather in regard that there is no particular Article of <hi>Chriſts deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Hell,</hi> as in thoſe of <hi>England,</hi> and conſequently no ſuch Doctrine of a <hi>local Deſcent</hi> as the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath maintained.</p>
            <p>Thirdly it is declared (<hi>Num.</hi> 50.) <q>That the Abſtinencies
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:130903:68"/>
which are appointed by publick order of that State, for eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Fiſh, and forbearing of Fleſh at certain times and dayes appointed, are no wayes meant to be Religious Faſts, nor intended for the maintenance of any ſuperſtition in the choice of meats, but are grounded meerly upon Politick Conſiderations for proviſion of things tending to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preſervation of the Common-wealth.</q> But the Church of <hi>England</hi> not taking notice of any <hi>Politick Conſiderations,</hi> for the breeding of Cattle, increaſe of ſhipping, or the like, as the Statiſts do, (nor intending the <hi>maintenance of any Superſtition in choice of meats,</hi> as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do) retaineth both her Weekly and her Annual Faſts <hi>ex vi Catholicae conſuetudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> as Apoſtolical and Primitive Inſtitutions; and ſhe retains them alſo not as <hi>Politick,</hi> but as <hi>Religious</hi> Faſts, as appears by the Epiſtle for <hi>Aſh-wedneſday,</hi> taken out of the ſecond Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter of <hi>Joel</hi> from <hi>verſe</hi> 12. unto <hi>verſe</hi> 18. and by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel for that day, taken out of the ſixth Chapter of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> from <hi>verſe</hi> 16. unto <hi>verſe</hi> 22. And more particularly from the Prayer appointed to be uſed on the <hi>firſt Sunday</hi> in <hi>Lent, viz.</hi> 
               <q>O Lord, which for our ſakes didſt faſt fourty dayes and fourty nights, give us grace to uſe ſuch <hi>abstinence,</hi> that our fleſh being ſubdued to the Spirit, we may ever obey the Godly motions in righteouſneſs and true holineſſe to thy honour and glory, which liveſt and reigneſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> 
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, It is affirmed <hi>Num.</hi> 56. <q>That the firſt day of the week which is the Lords day, is wholly to be dedicated to the ſervice of God; and therefore we are bound to reſt therein from our common and daily buſineſſe; and to beſtow that leiſure upon Holy Exerciſes, both publick and private.</q>  How contrary this is to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in the Book of Homilies, we have ſeen already; and if it be contrary to the Book of Homilies, it muſt be alſo contrary to the Book of Articles by which thoſe Homilies are appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and recommended to the uſe of the Church. Beſides, it is declared in the ſeventh of thoſe Articles, firſt, that the Law given by <hi>Moſes</hi> as touching Ceremonies and Rites do not bind Chriſtian men, nor ought the Civil Precepts thereof to be received in any Common-wealth; and ſecondly, that no
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:130903:68"/>
Chriſtian whatſoever is free from the obedience of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments which are called Moral. So that the Ceremonial part of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> being wholly abrogated, there is no more to be obſerved in any of the ſaid Commandments then that which is naturally and plainly moral. For otherwiſe the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> muſt be <hi>contrary to the New,</hi> which is denied in the firſt clauſe of this Article; and ſecondly, this Article muſt be contradicted by the Book of Homilies, which in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of theſe Articles is approved, as before was ſaid. As Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries to which truth the Author of the Book entitled, <hi>The Faith, Doctrine, and Religion profeſſed and protected in the Realm of England, &amp;c.</hi> being a Commentary on the 39. Articles, <hi>Peruſed, and by the lawful Authority of the Church of England allowed to be publick,</hi> doth account all ſuch as have taught and publiſhed, firſt, <hi>that whereas all other things were ſo changed, that they were clean taken away, as the Prieſthood, the Sacrifice, and Sacraments, this day</hi> (that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Sabbath day) <hi>was ſo changd that it yet remaineth;</hi> and ſecondly, <hi>that the Commandment of ſanctifying every ſeventh day</hi> (as in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical Decalogue) <hi>is Natural, Moral, and Perpetual.</hi> If ſo, then no ſuch thing required of Chriſtians, as to dedicate the firſt day of the week <hi>wholly</hi> to the ſervice of God, or to reſt thereon from our common and dayly buſineſs, as it is poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determined in this Article of the Church of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Adde here, thoſe deſperate conſequences, which have been raiſed by ſome men from theſe Sabbath-Doctrines; <q>It having been preacht in ſome of the Pulpits in this Kingdom (as Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> tells us in his Preface to the Book above mentioned) that to do any ſervile work or buſineſs on the Lords day, is as great a ſin as to kill a man, or commit adultery; that to throw a Bowle, to make a Feaſt, or dreſs a VVedding Dinner on the Lords day, is as great a ſin, as for a man to take a knife and cut his childs throat; and that to ring more Bells then one on the Lords day, is as great a ſin, as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a wilful murder.</q> Moſt deſperate conſequents indeed, but ſuch as naturally do ariſe from ſuch dangerous premiſes.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, it is declared, (<hi>Num.</hi> 71.) <q>that we ought to judg thoſe Miniſters to be lawfully called and ſent, which be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:130903:69"/>
and choſen to the work of the Miniſtry, by men who have publick Authority given them in the Church.</q> This ſerves to countenance the Ordination of Miniſters beyond the Seas, ordained (if I may ſo call it) by the impoſition of the hands of two Lay-Elders for each ſingle Presbyter, without the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance or benediction of the Biſhop; and is directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Book, entituled, <hi>The form and manner of making and conſecrating Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons;</hi> according to which Book (juſtified and approved by the 36. Article of the Church of <hi>England</hi>) no Prieſt or Presbyter can be otherwiſe ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then by the laying on of the hands of the Biſhop.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, it is declared (<hi>Num.</hi> 74.) <q>That God hath given power to his Miniſters, not ſimply to forgive ſins (which prerogative he hath reſerved onely to himſelfe) but in his name to <hi>declare</hi> and <hi>pronounce</hi> unto ſuch as truly repent, and unfainedly believe his Holy Goſpel, the abſolution and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins.</q> VVhich Doctrine, how contrary it is to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> hath been ſhewed at large in the tenth <hi>Section</hi> of this Book. To which I ſhall now onely adde, that for the better encouragement of the penitent party, to make a true and ſincere confeſſion of his ſins, that ſo the Prieſt may proceed to <hi>Abſolution</hi> on the better grounds, it is ordered by the 113. Canon of the year 1603. <q>That if any man confeſs his ſecret and hidden ſins to the Miniſter, for the unburthening of his conſcience, and to receive ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual conſolation and eaſe of mind from him; the ſaid Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſhall not at any time reveale and make known to any perſon whatſoever any crime or offence ſo committed to his truſt and ſecrecy (except they be ſuch crimes, as by the Laws of this Realm his own life may be called into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion for concealing the ſame) under <hi>pain of Irregularity:</hi>
               </q> By incurring of which <hi>pain of Irregularity,</hi> he doth not onely actually forfeit all thoſe ſpiritual promotions of which he is at that time poſſeſſed, but is rendered utterly uncapable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any other for the time to come.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, it is declared (<hi>Num.</hi> 80.) <q>That the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is ſo far from being the Supreme head of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church of Chriſt, that his works and Doctrine do plainly
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:130903:69"/>
diſcover him to be <hi>that man of ſin,</hi> foretold in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, <hi>whom the Lord ſhall conſume with the ſpirit of his mouth, and aboliſh with the brightneſs of his coming.</hi>
               </q> Of which opinion the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> alſo was, as is affirmed by Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Bernard,</hi> p. 162. where he telleth, that the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> had in two learned Sermons given his judgement at large, that the <hi>Papacy</hi> was meant by <hi>Babylon</hi> in the ſeventeenth and eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> But there is no ſuch Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Antichrist</hi> in the Book of <hi>Articles,</hi> or in any other publick Monument or Record of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but the contrary rather. And this appeareth by a prayer at the end of the ſecond <hi>Homily</hi> for <hi>Whitſunday,</hi> viz. <hi>That by the mighty power of the Holy Ghoſt, the comfortable Doctrine of Chriſt may be truly preached, truly received, and truly followed in all places, to the beating down of Sin, Death, the Pope, the Devil, and all the Kingdom of Antichriſt.</hi> In which words, the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Devil,</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom of Antichrist,</hi> being reckoned as the three great enemies of the Church of Chriſt; it muſt needs be, by the Doctrine of this Church in the <hi>Book of Homilies,</hi> that the Pope and Antichriſt are as much diſtinguiſhed, as either the Devil and the Pope, or the Devil and Antichriſt, which no man of reaſon can conceive to be one and the ſame.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the tenth Article ſpeaks very favourably of the <hi>will</hi> of man in the act of Converſion, and all the other Acts of Piety which depend upon it, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>we have no power to do good works pleaſant and acceptable to God, without the grace of God by Christ</hi> preventing us, <hi>that we may have a good will, and working</hi> with us, <hi>when we have that good will;</hi> according to that memorable ſaying of Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> the greateſt Champion of Gods grace againſt the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagian</hi> Hereſies, <hi>Praevenit nos gratia Dei ut velimus, ſubſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, ne fruſtra velimus.</hi> Whereas it is declared in the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that man is meerly paſſive in the work of his own Converſion, <hi>velut inanimatum quiddam,</hi> as was ſaid by <hi>Luther,</hi> the Article affirming (<hi>Num. 32.) That no man can come unto Chriſt, unleſs the Father draw him;</hi> that is to ſay, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Father doth ſo <hi>draw him,</hi> that nothing be aſcribed to mans will, either in receiving of <hi>Grace preventing,</hi> or working
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:130903:70"/>
any thing by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Grace ſubſequent,</hi> or Grace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring; no other kind of drawing by our Heavenly Father being allowed of in this Act in the Schools of <hi>Calvin.</hi> For on this ground <hi>Calvin</hi> diſlikes that ſaying of Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> that God draws none but ſuch as are willing to come. <hi>Illud totum à</hi> Chryſoſtomo <hi>repetitum repudiari neceſſe est, Quem trahit volentem trahit.</hi> So he in the ſecond Book of his Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. Upon which Dictate of their Maſter the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts,</hi> or Contra-Remonſtrants, (whom the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> in compiling the Articles of <hi>Ireland</hi> followeth point <hi>per</hi> point) affirmed expreſly in the Conference holden at the <hi>Hague; Sicut ad Nativitatem ſuam nemo de ſuo quicquam confert, neque ad ſui excitationem à mortuis quicquam confert de ſuo: Ita eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am ad Converſionem ſuam nemo homo quicquam confert;</hi> That is to ſay, that as a man contributes nothing either towards his natural Generation, or Reſurrection from the dead; ſo doth he not contribute any thing towards his Converſion and Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, the twentieth Article of <hi>England</hi> aſcribes unto the Church a power in determining Controverſies of the faith; of which the Articles of <hi>Ireland</hi> are utterly ſilent, as if the Church were veſted with no ſuch authority, contrary to <hi>Acts</hi> 15. v. 6, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, it is declared in the 34. Article of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> 
               <q>That whoſoever through his private judgement, willingly and purpoſely, doth openly break the Traditions and Ceremonies of the Church, which be not repugnant to the word of God, and be ordained and approved by common Authority, ought to be rebuked openly (that others may fear to do the like) as he that offendeth againſt the common order of the Church, and hurteth the Authority of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, and woundeth the conſciences of the weak Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</q>But of this there is nothing ſaid in the Articles of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and thereby a wide gap laid open to all private men, either out of ſingularity, faction, or perverſeneſs of ſpirit, to oppoſe the Ceremonies of the Church, and deny conformity thereunto at their will and pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, the 36. Article of <hi>England</hi> approves the Book
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:130903:70"/>
of the Conſecration of Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops, &amp;c. of which Conſecration we find nothing in the Articles of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as if ſuch Conſecrations had ſomething in them <hi>which of it ſelfe is ſuperſtitious and ungodly,</hi> or that the calling of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops was not warranted by the word of God.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly, it is declared in the 38. Article of <hi>England,</hi> That <hi>the riches and goods of Chriſtians are not common, as touching the right, title, and poſſeſſion of the ſame, as certain</hi> Anabaptiſts <hi>do falſly boaſt.</hi> Of which the Articles of <hi>Ireland</hi> are as ſilent as in the point of Conſecration of Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops; the dangerous conſequence whereof may be felt too ſoon. I know that theſe two laſt paſſages may rather argue ſome deficiency in the Articles of <hi>Ireland,</hi> then any contrariety unto thoſe of <hi>England:</hi> But I have cauſe enough to think that many of thoſe who willingly ſubſcribe the Articles of <hi>Ireland</hi> (as being to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally <hi>Genevian</hi> both in the matter and method) will be apt to boggle at theſe two; the firſt as being contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Principles of the Presbyterians; the ſecond as being no leſs oppoſite to that <hi>levelling</hi> humour which doth affect as great a Parity in the Civil State, as the others have contended for in the Eccleſiaſtical.</p>
            <p>And thus far I have gone along with Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering all the ſeveral <hi>Charges</hi> which are laid upon me, and freeing my ſelfe from all ſuch <hi>oppoſition</hi> to the publick Doctrine of this Church as I ſtand accuſed for; A crime for which I could not eaſily acquit my ſelf, and not take notice by the way, how much the Doctrine, Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England</hi> were oppoſed by him who laid that heavy charge upon me. In the purſuit of which particulars I have not gone much further (though ſomewhat further I have gone) then I am warranted and inſtructed by Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> himſelf, and poſſibly had not gone ſo far, but that I knew how ſpeedily the examples of ſome men may be drawn into practice, their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice made exemplary, and the <hi>Obliquities</hi> of their judgement taken up as a Rule for others, if warning of the danger be not given in convenient time. <hi>Magnos errores magnorum virorum authoritate tranſmitti</hi> (as was well obſerved by <hi>Vadianus</hi>) is a thing too ordinary. It is my wiſh, that the buſineſs may reſt
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:130903:71"/>
here, though I fear it will not; the Doctors Book being ſuch a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſuch an occaſion of creating new contentions, and reviving the old, as if it had been publiſht and intended to no other end then <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to put the whole State of <hi>Greece</hi> into freſh combuſtions. Others there are, who either are concerned by name, or intereſſed in the defence of that which they have formerly written in the Churches cauſe, who may conceive themſelves obliged to the like engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; as well to do themſelves right in the eyes of the world, as to maintain the dignity of the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> calling in behalfe of the Church. And to theſe laſt I ſhall refer the further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting of the point of Epiſcopacy, as it relates to Doctor <hi>Bernards</hi> actings in it; who by furniſhing the Lord <hi>Primates</hi> naked Affirmation with ſome Armour of Proof, and citing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Forraign and Domeſtick Authors of the ſame opinion, hath made himſelf a <hi>ſecond</hi> party in the Quarrel, and conſequently ſtands bound by the Laws of Duel to abide the Combat. If in that part which I have done, I have done any thing amiſs (as I hope I have not) I ſhall crave pardon for my errors; though I may ſay with truth and modeſty enough, <hi>Si fuit errandum, cauſas habet error honeſtas,</hi> in the Poets language: if well in any thing, I ſhall expect no thanks for it from the hands of men, conſidering that when I have done the beſt I can, I am but an unprofitable ſervant in the Church of Chriſt.</p>
