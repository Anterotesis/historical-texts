            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Author of the following Poem, may
be thought to write for Fame, and the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause
of the Town, but he wholly disowns
it; for he writes only for the Publick good, the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of his Countrey, and the Manufacture of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
It is well known, that <hi>Grave Senators</hi> have
often at the <hi>Palace-Yard,</hi> refresh'd themselves with
<hi>Barley-Broth</hi> in a Morning, which has had a very
solid Influence on their Councels; It is therefore hoped
that other Persons may use it, with the like suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.
No Man can be Ignorant, how of late Years
<hi>Coffee</hi> and <hi>Tea</hi> in a Morning has prevail'd, Nay,
<hi>Cold Waters</hi> have obtain'd their Commendation,
and Wells are Sprung up from <hi>Acton,</hi> to <hi>Islington,</hi>
and cross the Water to <hi>Lambeth.</hi> These Liquors
have several Eminent Champions of all Professions.
<pb facs="tcp:99146:4"/>
But there have not been wanting Persons in all Ages,
that have shewn a true Love for their Country, and
the proper Diet of it, as <hi>Watergruel, Milk-Porridge,
Rice-Milk,</hi> and especially <hi>Furmetry,</hi> both with
Plumbs and without; to this end several Worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
have Encouraged the Eating such wholsom Dyet
in a Morning, and that the Poor may be provided,
<hi>they</hi> have desired several Matrons to stand at <hi>Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field-Bars,
Leaden-Hall-Market, Stocks-Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,</hi>
and divers other noted places in the City, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
at <hi>Fleet-Ditch;</hi> There to <hi>dispense Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry</hi>
to Labouring People, and the Poor, at Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Rates, at Three-half-Pence, and Two-Pence
a Dish, which is not Dear, the Plumbs being Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed.</p>
            <p>The Places are generally stiled <hi>Furmetrys,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caused
that Food has got the general esteem; But
that at <hi>Fleet-Ditch,</hi> I take to be one of the most Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
and therefore I have stiled it <hi>The Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metary:</hi>
And could easily have had a Certificate
of the usefulness of this <hi>Furmetary,</hi> signed by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Eminent <hi>Carmen, Gardiners, Journey-Men-Taylors,</hi>
and <hi>Basket-Women,</hi> who have
promis'd to Contribute to the maintenance of the same,
in Case the <hi>Coffee-Houses</hi> should proceed to oppose it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:99146:4"/>
I have thought this a very proper Subject for an
Heroick Poem, and endeavoured to be as smooth in my
Verse, and as inoffensive in my Characters, as was
possible. It is my Case with <hi>Lucretius,</hi> that I
write upon a Subject not Treated of by the <hi>Ancients;</hi>
But <hi>the greater Labour, the greater Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Virgil</hi> had a <hi>Homer</hi> to Imitate, but I stand upon
my own Legs, without any support from abroad, I
therefore shall have more Occasion for the Readers
favour, who from the kind acceptance of this, may
expect the description of other <hi>Furmetaries</hi> about
this City, from</p>
