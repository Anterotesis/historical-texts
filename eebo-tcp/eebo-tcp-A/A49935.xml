            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE, JOHN, EARL OF MULGRAVE, Gentleman of His Majesties Bed-Chamber, and Knight of the most Noble Order of the Garter.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHEN I hear by many Persons, not indifferent Judges, how Poets are censur'd most, even where they most intend to please; and sometimes by those to whom they address, condemn'd for Flatterers, Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, little fawning wretches, I confess of all undertakings, there is none more dreadful to me than a Dedication. So nicely cruel are our Judges, that after a Play has been gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally applauded on the Stage, the Industrious malice of some after Observers shall damn it for an Epistle, or a Preface. For this Reason, my Lord, <hi>Alexander</hi> was more to seek for a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron in my troubl'd thoughts, than for the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Ammon</hi> in the spreading Wilds, and rowling Sands. 'Tis certain too he must have been lost, had not Fortune, whom I must once, at least, acknowledge kind in my Life, presented me to your Lordship: You were pleas'd, my Lord, to read it
<pb facs="tcp:100544:3"/>
over, Act by Act, and by particular praises, proceeding from the sweetness, rather than the justice, of your temper, lifted me up from my natural Melancholy, and Diffidence, to a bold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that what so great an understanding warranted, could not fail of success. And here I were most ungrateful, if I should not satisfie the judging World of the surprize I was in. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me, my Lord, for calling it a surprize, when I was first ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd by waiting upon your Lordship: So much unexpected, and indeed, unusual affability from Persons of your Birth, and Quality; so true an Easiness, such Frankness, without affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I never saw. Your constant, but few Friends, show the firmness of your Mind, which never varies, so God-like a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that a Prince puts off His Majesty, when he parts with Resolution. In all the happy times, that I attended you, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less business, or accident, interpos'd, I have observ'd your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to be the same. You have Travell'd through all tempers, Sail'd through all humours of the Courts unconstant Sea, you have gain'd the gallant Prizes, which you sought, your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, unvaluable Friends: And I am perfectly perswaded, if you traffick but seldome abroad, 'tis for fear of splitting upon Knaves, or Fools. Nor is it Pride, but rather a Delicacie of your Soul, that makes you shun the Sordid part of the World, the lees and Dregs of it, while in the noblest Retirement you enjoy the finer Spirits, and have that just Greatness to be above the baser. How commendable therefore is such Reservation; how admirable such a Solitude! If you are singular in this, we ought to blame the wild, unthinking, dissolute Age; an Age, whose business is senseless Riot, Neronian Gambols, and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Debauchery; an Age that can produce few Persons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side your Lordship, who dare be alone. All our hot hours,
<pb facs="tcp:100544:3"/>
burn't in Night-Revells, or drown'd in Day-dead-sleep; or if we wake, 'tis a point of reeling Honour joggs us to the Field, where, if we live, or dye, we are not concern'd; for, the Soul was laid out before we went abroad, and our Bodies were after acted, by meer Animal Spirits, without Reason. When I more narrowly Contemplate your Person, methinks I see in your Lordship two of the most famous Characters, that ever Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, or Modern, Story could produce; the mighty <hi>Scipio,</hi> and the retir'd <hi>Cowley.</hi> You have certainly the Gravity, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and Judgment, as well as the Courage, of the first; all which, in your early attempts of War, gave the noblest dawn of Virtue; and will, when occasion presents, answer our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and shine forth at full. Then, for the latter, you possess all his sweetness of humour in peace, all that Halcyon Tranquillity of Mind, where your deep thoughts glide, like si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Waters, without a Wrinkle, your hours move with softest Wings, and rarely any Larum strikes to discompose you. You have the Philosophy of the first, and which, I confess, of all your qualities, I love most, the Poetry of the latter. I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more mov'd at <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Dido,</hi> than at a short Poem of your Lordships; where nothing but the shortness can be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik'd. As our Church-Men wish there were more Noble Men of their Function, so wish I, in the behalf of deprest Poetry, that there were more Poets of your Lordships Excellence, and Eminence. If Poetry be a Virtue, she is a ragged one; and never, in any Age, went barer than now. It may be objected, she never deserved less. To that I must not answer; but I am sure, when she merited most, she was alwayes dissatisfied, or she would not have forsaken the most splendid Courts in the World. <hi>Virgil,</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> Favourites of the mightiest Emperour,
<pb facs="tcp:100544:4"/>
retir'd from him, preferring a Mistress, or a white Boy, and two or three cheerful drinking Friends, in a Country Village, to all the Magnificence of <hi>Rome:</hi> Or if sometimes they were snatch'd from their cooler pleasures to an Emperial Banquet, We may see by their Verses in praise of the Country Life, 'twas against their Inclination; Witness, <hi>Horace</hi> in his <hi>Epod. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at us ille qui procul,</hi> &amp;c. part of his sixth <hi>Satyr,</hi> his Epistle to <hi>Fuscus Aristius; Virgil's Georgie, O Fortunatos nimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um bona si,</hi> &amp;c. All render'd by Mr. <hi>Cowley,</hi> so Copiously, and Naturally, as no Age gone before, or coming after, shall equal, though all Heads join'd together to out. do him. I speak not of his exactness to a Line, but of the whole. This then may be said, as to the condition of Poets in all times, few ever arriv'd to a middle Fortune, most have liv'd at the lowest, none ever mounted to the highest; neither by Birth, for none was ever born a Prince, as no Prince, to my remembrance, was ever born a Poet; nor by Industry, because they were alwayes too much transported by their own thoughts from minding the grave business of a World, not of their humour: Whereas, even Slaves, the Rubbish of the Earth have, by most prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Fortune, gain'd a Scepter, and with their vile Heads, sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly'd the glories of a Crown. Praise is the greatest encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we Camelions can pretend to, or rather the Manna that keeps Soul and Body together; we devour it as if it were An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels Food, and vainly think we grow Immortal. For my own part, I acknowledge, I never receiv'd a better satisfaction from the applause of an Audience than I have from your single Judgment. You gaze at Beauties, and wink at Blemishes; and do both so gracefully, that the first discovers the acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of your Judgment, the other the excellency of your Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb facs="tcp:100544:4"/>
And I can affirm, to your Lordship, there is nothing transports a Poet, next to Love, like commending in the right place. Therefore, my Lord, this Play must be yours; and <hi>Alexander,</hi> whom I have rais'd from the dead, comes to you with an assurance, answerable to his Character, and your Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. You cannot expect him in his Majesty of two thousand Years ago, I have only put his illustrious Ashes in an Urne, which are now offer'd, with all observance, to your Lordship. By,</p>

            <l>

            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>I pay the Bribe I first receiv'd from You:</hi>

               <hi>In vain they croud each other at the Door;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>

            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>That Courts themselves are just, for fear of shame:</hi>

               <hi>So has the mighty Merit of your Play</hi>

Yet, when some Virtue much out-grows the rest,</l>
            <l>It shoots too fast, and high, to be opprest;</l>
            <l>As his Heroic worth struck Envy dumb</l>
            <l>Who took the <hi>Dutchman,</hi> and who cut the Boom:</l>
            <l>Such praise is yours, while you the Passions move,</l>
            <l>That 'tis no longer feign'd; 'tis real Love:</l>
            <l>Where Nature Triumphs over wretched Art;</l>
            <l>We only warm the Head, but you the Heart.</l>
            <l>Alwayes you warm! and if the rising Year,</l>
            <l>As in hot Regions, bring the Sun too near,</l>
            <l>Tis but to make your Fragrant Spices blow,</l>
            <l>Which in our colder Climates will not grow.</l>
            <l>They only think you animate your Theme</l>
            <l>With too much Fire, who are themselves all Phle'me:</l>
            <l>Prizes wou'd be for Lags of slowest pace,</l>
            <l>Were Cripples made the Judges of the Race.</l>
            <l>Despise those Drones, who praise while they accuse</l>
            <l>The too much vigour of your youthful Muse:</l>
            <l>That humble Stile which they their Virtue make</l>
            <l>Is in your pow'r; you need but stoop and take.</l>
            <l>Your beauteous Images must be allow'd</l>
            <l>By all, but some vile Poets of the Crowd;</l>
            <l>But how shou'd any Sign-post-dawber know</l>
            <l>The worth of <hi>Titian,</hi> or of <hi>Angelo?</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Hard Features every Bungler can command;</l>

            <head>PROLOGUE TO ALEXANDER,</head>
            <byline>Written by Sir <hi>Char. Scroop,</hi> Baronet.</byline>
            <l>HOW hard the Fate is, of that Scribling Drudge,</l>
            <l>Who writes to all, when yet so few can judge!</l>
            <l>Wit, like Religion, once Divine was thought;</l>
            <l>And the dull Crowd believ'd, as they were taught:</l>
            <l>Now each Fanatick Fool presumes t'explain</l>
            <l>The Text, and does the sacred Writ prophane:</l>
            <l>For, while you Wits each others Fall pursue,</l>
            <l>The Fops usurp the Power belongs to you.</l>
            <l>You think y'are challeng'd in each new Play-bill,</l>
            <l>And here you come for tryal of your Skill;</l>
            <l>Where, Fencer-like, you one another hurt,</l>
            <l>While, with your Wounds, you make the Rabble sport.</l>
            <l>Others there are, that have the bruital Will</l>
            <l>To Murder a poor Play, but want the Skill.</l>
            <l>They love to fight, but seldome have the Wit</l>
            <l>To spye the Place, where they may thrust and hit;</l>
            <l>And therefore, like some Bully of the Town,</l>
            <l>Ne're stand to draw, but knock the Poet down.</l>
            <l>With these, like Hogs in Gardens it succeeds,</l>
            <l>They root up all, and know not Flowers from Weeds.</l>
            <l>As for you, Sparks, that hither come each day</l>
            <l>To Act your own, and not to mind our Play;</l>
            <l>Rehearse your usual follies to the Pit,</l>
            <l>And with loud Non-sense drown the Stages Wit:</l>
            <l>Talk of your Cloaths, your last Debauches tell,</l>
            <l>And witty Bargains to each other sell;</l>

Gloat on the silly She, who for your sake</l>
            <l>Can Vanity, and Noise, for Love mistake</l>
            <l>'Till the Cocquet, sung in the next Lampoon,</l>
            <l>Is by her jealous Friends sent out of Town.</l>
            <l>For, in this Duelling Intriguing) Age,</l>
            <l>The Love you make is like the War you wage;</l>
            <l>Y'are still prevented e're you come t'ingage.</l>
            <l>But 'tis not to such trisling Foes as you,</l>
            <l>The Mighty <hi>Alexander</hi> daigns to sue:</l>
            <l>You <hi>Persians</hi> of the Pit he does despise,</l>
            <l>But to the Men of Sence, for Aid, he flies;</l>
            <l>On their experienc'd Arms he now depends,</l>
            <l>Nor fears he odds, if they but prove his Friends:</l>
            <l>For as he once, a little handful chose,</l>
            <l>The numerous Armies of the World t'oppose,</l>
            <l>So back'd by you, who understand the Rules,</l>
            <l>He hopes to rout the Mighty Host of Fools.</l>

                  <l>He bleeds, with that last blow I brought him down;</l>

            <head>EPILOGUE to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great,</head>
            <l>WHAT e're they mean, yet ought they to be curst,</l>
            <l>Who this Censorious Age did polish first:</l>
            <l>Who the best Play, for one poor Errour blame,</l>
            <l>As Priests against our Ladies Arts declaim,</l>
            <l>And for one Patch, both Soul and Body damn.</l>
            <l>But what does more provoke the Actors rage,</l>
            <l>(For we must show the grievance of the Stage)</l>
            <l>Is, that our Women who adorn each Play</l>
            <l>Bred at our cost, become at length your Prey:</l>
            <l>While green, and sour, likes Trees we bear 'em all,</l>
            <l>But when they're mellow straight to you they fall:</l>
            <l>You watch 'em bare and squab, and let 'em rest;</l>
            <l>But with the first young down, you snatch the Nest.</l>
            <l>Pray leave these poaching tricks, if you are wise,</l>
            <l>E're we take out our Letters of Reprize.</l>
            <l>For we have vow'd to find a sort of Toys</l>
            <l>Known to black Fryars, a Tribe of choopping Boys:</l>
            <l>If once they come, they'l quickly spoil your sport;</l>
            <l>There's not one Lady will receive your Court:</l>
            <l>But for the Youth in Petticoats run wild,</l>
            <l>With oh the archest Wagg, the sweetest Child.</l>
            <l>The panting Breasts, white Hands and little Feet</l>
            <l>No more shall your pall'd thoughts with pleasure meet.</l>
            <l>The Woman in Boys Cloaths, all Boy shall be,</l>
            <l>And never raise your thoughts above the Knee.</l>
            <l>Well, if our Women knew how false you are,</l>
            <l>They wou'd stay here, and this new trouble spare:</l>
            <l>Poor Souls, they think all Gospel you relate,</l>
            <l>Charm'd with the noise of sett'ling an Estate:</l>
            <l>But when, at last, your Appetites are full,</l>
            <l>And the tir'd <hi>Cupid</hi> grows, with action, dull;</l>
            <l>You'l find some trick to cut off the Entail,</l>
            <l>And send 'em back to us, all worn and stale.</l>

Perhaps they'l find our Stage, while they have rang'd</l>
            <l>To some vile canting Conventicle, chang'd:</l>
            <l>Where, for the Sparks who once resorted there</l>
            <l>With their curl'd Wigs that scented all the Air,</l>
            <l>They'l see grave Blockheads with short greasie Hair.</l>
            <l>Green-Aprons, steeple-Hats, and Collar-Bands;</l>
            <l>Dull sniv'ling Rogues that wring, not clap, their Hands:</l>
            <l>Where, for gay Punks that drew the shining Crowd,</l>
            <l>And Misses that, in Vizard, laught aloud;</l>
            <l>They'l hear young Sisters sigh, see Matrons old</l>
            <l>To their chop't Cheeks their pick'led Kerchers hold;</l>
            <l>Whose Zeal too, might perswade, in spight to you,</l>
            <l>Our flying Angels, to augment their Crew:</l>
            <l>While <hi>Farringdon</hi> their <hi>Hero</hi> struts about 'em,</l>
            <l>And ne're a damning Critick dares to flout 'em.</l>
