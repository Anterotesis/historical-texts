            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to present you with these Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
against Mr. Justice <hi>Crawley,</hi>
which when your Lordships shall have
been pleased to heare read, I shall take
leave (according to custom) to say som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
of what I have collected from the sense of that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62068:50"/>
House concerning the crimes therein conteined.</p>
            <p>Here the charge was read conteining his extrajudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
opinions subscribed, and judgement given for Ship-money,
and afterward a Declaration in his charge at an
Assize, that Ship-money was so inherent a right in the
Crown, that it would not be in the power of a Parliament
to take it away.</p>
            <p>MY LORDS, Not only my wants but my
affections render me lesse fit for this imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
for though it has not been my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to have the Law a part of my breeding,
there is no man honours that profession more, or has a
greater reverence towards the grave Judges the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
thereof. Out of Parlament all our Courts of Justice
are governed or directed by them, and when a Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is call'd, if your Lordships were not assisted by
them, and the House of Commons by other Gentlemen
of that Robe, experience t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>torum.</hi> But as all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
are obnoxious to the malice of the professours,
and by them most easily betrayed, so (my Lords) these
Articles have told you how these brothers of the Coyf
are become <hi>fratres in malo;</hi> how these sons of the Law
have torne out the bowels of their mother: But this
Judge (whose charge you last heard) in one expression
of his excels no lesse his Fellows, then they have done
the worst of their predecessours, in this conspiracy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Common-wealth. Of the Iudgement for
Ship-money, and those extrajudiciall opinions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
the same (wherein they are jointly concern'd)
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62068:51"/>
you have already heard, how unjust and pernicious a

               </gap>ceeding that was in so publique a Cause, has been

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ficiently express'd to your Lordships: But this man,
adding despaire to our mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ells us from the Bench,
that Ship-money was a Right so inherent in the
Crown, that it would not be in the power of an Act
of Parliament to take it away. Herein (my Lords) hee
did not onely give as deepe a wound to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>sion of our propriety, before he heard
what could bee said for it, he prevented his own, so by
this declaration of his, hee indeavours to prevent the
Judgement of your Lordships too, and to confine the
power of a Parliament, the onely place where this

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> might be redrest: Sure he is more wise and
learned, then to beleeve himself in this opinion, or not
to know how ridiculous it would appeare to a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and how dangerous to himselfe, and therefore
no doubt but by saying no Parliament could abolish
this Judgement, his meaning was that this Judgement
had abolish'd Parliaments.</p>
            <p>This imposition of Ship-money springing from a
pretended necessity, was it not enough that it was
now grown annuall, but hee must in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ayle it upon the
State for ever, at once making necessity inherent to
the Crown, &amp; slavery to the Subject? Necessity, which
dissolving all Law is so much more prejudiciall to his
Majesty then to any of us, by how much the Law has
invested his Royall State with a greater power, and
ampler fortune, for so undoubted a truth it has ever bin,
that Kings as well as Subjects are involv'd in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
which necessity produces, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62068:51"/>
thought their gods also obliged by the same, <hi>Pareamus
necessitati qaam nec homines nec dii superant:</hi> This Judge
then having in his charge at the Assize declar'd the
dissolution of the Law, by this suppos'd necessity, with
what conscience could hee at the same Assize proceed
to condemne and punish men, unlesse perhaps he m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ant
the Law was still in force for our destruction, and not
for our preservation, that it should have power to kill,
but none to protect us; a thing no lesse horrid then if
the Sun should burn without lighting us, or the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I am, we may look on it as a cause of the unfained ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity

            <p>His education in the Innes of Court, his constant

a Country, into which hee meant to conduct an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.</p>
            <p>To let you see hee did not offend for company, there

that it makes him at once uncapable of your

if you leave him in a capacity of interpreting the

your votes and resolutions against Ship-money are

This (Sir) I hope you will bee pleased for your
own sakes to grant mee, who am already so miserable,
that nothing can bee added to my calamity, but to
bee made the occasion of creating a President to your
own disadvantage; besides the right I may have to
this, consider I beseech you, that the eyes of the
world are upon you, you Govern in chief, and if you
should expose your own Members to the punishment
of others, it will bee thought that you either want
Power, or leisure to chasti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Let any man despise the ill consequence of such a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident

Remonstrance to this House, taking notice of what
some of the Members had said here, as they supposed
to their disadvantage, and did little lesse then require
them of you; 'tis true, there had been some tampering
with them, but what has happened at one time, may
wisely be thought possible to fall out again at another.</p>

Sir, I presume but to point you out the danger; if
it bee not just, I know you will not do mee the wrong
to expose mee to this tryall; if it bee just, your Army
may another time require the same justice of you, in
their own behalfe, against some other Member, whom
perhaps you would be lesse willing to part with. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
has of late forced you into untrodden paths;
and in such a case as this where you have no president
of your own, you may not do amisse to look abroad
upon other States and Senates, which exercise the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Power, as you now do here.</p>
            <p>I dare confidently say you shall find none either An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
of Modern, which ever exposed any of their own
order to bee tryed for his life by the Officers of their
Armies abroad, for what hee did, while hee resided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them in the Senate.</p>
            <p>Among the <hi>Romans</hi> the practice was so contrary,
that some inferiour Officers in their Army farre from
the City, having been sentenced by their Generall, or
Commander in chief, as deserving death by their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
of Warre, have neverthelesse (because they
were Senators) appealed thither, and the cause has
received a new hearing in the Senate. Not to use more

desire you to consider likewise the nature of my of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
(not but that I should bee much ashamed to
say any thing in diminution thereof: God knows 'tis
horrid enough, for the evill it might have occasioned)
but if you look neere it, it may perhaps appear to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Civill then a Martiall crime, and so to have title

I have had nothing to doe with the other Army, or
any intention to begin the offer of violence to any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
It was only a civill pretence to that which I then
foolishly conceived to bee the right of the Subject.
I humbly refer it to your considerations, and to your
