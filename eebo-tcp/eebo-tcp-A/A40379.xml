         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

DYING SPEECH
OF
Robert Frances
OF
GRAYS-INN, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
               <date>July 24. 1685.</date>
            </head>
            <head type="sub">Delivered by his own Hand to the Ordinary, at the
Place of Execution, deſiring the ſame might be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</head>
            <p>I Am here by the Divine permiſſion and Providence of God become
a ſpectacle to God, Angels and men, for a raſh, Extravagant and
imprudent Act, wherein I do confeſs, I have not only offended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Government and Courts of Juſtice, but againſt <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi>
and even the Rules of Morality it ſelf: Nevertheleſs, (I hope) not
only the Court, but all unbiaſed Men, from the ſeveral Circumſtances
of the Fact, are ſatisfied that I had no Malicious intent of doing what
fell out, nor had any Grudge or perſonal Prejudice to him upon
any account whatſoever, more than what all Honeſt and Good Men
could not but have, that Love the King and the Government. The
ſolemn Truth of all which, I have declared not only upon the Holy
Sacrament I received from Mr. <hi>Maſter,</hi> but alſo that I never knew
nor ſaw him before that unhappy moment, ſave once at a diſtance
in the Pillory at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> and do now as a dying Man ſolemnly
avow and proteſt the ſame: And therefore I hope I may boldly ſay
I am not conſcious of any Guilt before God as to the malice: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
God in his great Wiſdom has been pleaſed to ſuffer this great
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105357:2"/>
Calamity to fall upon me: And I hope this his ſevere Chaſtiſement,
is in order to bring me to himſelf, when ſofter means had not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
done it. All them that know me (I am ſure) will do me
that Juſtice, as to believe I am far from having done it either will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
or mercenarily (as moſt untruly is reported.) And that theſe
Honourable Perſons are above the thoughts of ſuch unworthy things,
for which they have been as maliciouſly as falſly traduced upon my
ſcore; I beg their Pardon for the Scandal I have unhappily been the
occaſion of, and deſire this Acknowledgment may be by them accepted
as a Reparation ſince to diſown it at this time of my death, is all the
Satisfaction I am able to make them.</p>
            <p>As to my Religion (however I have been repreſented) there are Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that knew me at the Univerſity, and ſince that can be my Witneſſes,
how obedient and zealous a Son of the Church of <hi>England</hi> (by Law
eſtabliſhed) I have been.</p>
            <p>And theſe worthy Divines that did me the favour to viſit me in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
will give the World an account (as occaſion ſerves) of my inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
therein: And if I had been as zealous in the Service of God, as my
Prince, he would not have left me ſo much to my ſelf, as to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
me to have fallen into this unexpected Extremity.</p>
            <p>And as for my Morals, the Honourable Society of <hi>Grays-Inn</hi> will
anſwer for me, that in above theſe twelve years time, I have had the
Honour of being admitted a Member of that Society, I never had any
Quarrel or Controverſie with any Member thereof; and all Perſons
with whom I have had Converſation, I queſtion not will give a good
Character of my innocent and peaceable behaviour.</p>
            <p>I pray God Almighty Preſerve and Bleſs His Moſt Sacred Majeſty,
His Royal Conſort Queen <hi>Mary, Katherine</hi> the Queen Dowager, their
Royal Highneſſes, and all the Royal Family; and grant that there may
never want one of that Royal Line to ſway the Scepters of theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
as long as Sun and Moon endure. In the Union and Love of
his Subjects, ſtrengthen him that he may vanquiſh and overcome all
his Enemies, which I am glad to have ſeen ſo much proſpect of, and
am only ſorry I am cut off from ſeeing my ſo much deſired ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of thoſe happy days all his good Subjects will enjoy under his
Auſpicious Government. I pray God forgive me my Sins that have
made me unworthy of that Bleſſing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:105357:2"/>
Bleſſed be the Lord that I have lived ſo as not to be aſhamed to live,
or afraid to dye; though I cannot but regret my being made a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to the Faction, who I am ſatisfied are the only People that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in my ruine, for there is no man that loves his Prince, but will
lament that nothing leſs than the Blood of an inoffenſive man (ſave in
this ſingle Extravagance) can ſatisfie them for the ſudden intemperate
tranſport of Zeal and Paſſion againſt one ſo notoriouſly wicked and
Infamous; for I do proteſt before Almighty God, (before whom I
ſhall immediately appear) that when I went to the Coach-ſide, I did
not intend ſo much as to ſpeak to him, or believe I could have had
opportunity of ſo doing, much leſs of doing him any harm. Neither
is it probable I ſhould with a ſmall Bambow Cane, no bigger than a
Man's little Finger, without any Iron upon it, much leſs a Dart in it,
as it was moſt induſtriouſly ſpread abroad to prejudice me in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the World: For if I had had ſuch a wicked deſign intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
I had a little ſhort Sword by my ſide much more proper for
ſuch a purpoſe. And further, if I had believed or known that I had
done any harm to him, I had opportunity enough of eſcaping after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
which I never endeavoured. Now all theſe things being duly
weighed with their ſeveral Circumſtances, I leave my ſad Caſe to the
Conſideration of all ſober and charitable Men. However I would
not have this to be interpreted as a Reflection upon the Court, who
I doubt not are by this time ſatisfied, (and Mr. <hi>Recorder</hi> did in open
Court declare) that in their Conſciences they did not believe I mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
deſigned him the miſchief that happened, but that it was pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accidental. But in the ſtrict Conſtruction of Law I was found Guilty
of Murder.</p>
            <p>But that which moſt ſenſibly afflicts me, and is worſe to me than
death, that I cannot ſuffer alone, but that they have not only raiſed
Scandals upon me in particular Preparatory to it, but upon my poor
innocent Wife, as if my jealouſie of her had been the reaſon of my
animoſity to <hi>Dangerfield;</hi> when I am morally certain ſhe never ſaw
him in her whole life, ſave that fatal Moment; and no couple (as
hundreds can witneſs) have lived in better Correſpondence. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that, ſhe is as vertuous a Woman as lives, and born of ſo good
and Loyal a Family, that if ſhe had been ſo enclined, ſhe would have
ſcorned to have proſtituted her ſelf to ſuch a profligate Perſon: But
on the contrary (God is my witneſs) I never had any ſuch thoughts
of her, and do as verily believe as there is a God in Heaven, I never
had any reaſon, ſhe having always been the moſt indulgent, kind
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105357:3"/>
and loving Wife that ever Man had, and in my Conſcience one of
the beſt of Women; nay, I am ſo far from ſuſpecting her Vertue,
that ſhe is the only loſs I regret on Earth, and can freely part with
every thing elſe here below without repining, which in all my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
I have owned before all People, and particularly Mr. <hi>Maſter,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Ordinary,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Smithies</hi> of <hi>Cripple-gate,</hi> who can all teſtifie
thoſe Tears and endeared Expreſſions that have paſſed between us,
when any of them did me the kindneſs to viſit me in my diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>And I do from the bottom of my heart freely forgive the Witneſſes
that Swore againſt me thoſe words I never ſpoke, for as I ſhall anſwer
at the great Tribunal, I ſaid no other or more words than theſe,
<hi>How now Friend, have you had your Heat this Morning?</hi> For all the ill
they have done me, give them Repentance Good God, even for theſe
that have contributed to the ſhedding of my Blood, I pray thee ſhed thy
Bowels of Mercy.</p>
            <p>I do heartily thank thoſe Noble and Honourable Perſons, and all
other my Friends, that have ſo charitably interpoſed with His Majeſty
on my behalf (though it hath proved unſucceſsful) I pray God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
to return their kind endeavours a thouſand Fold into their
own Boſoms: Lord return it to them and theirs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my Soul,</hi> Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Amen, Amen, Amen.</p>
