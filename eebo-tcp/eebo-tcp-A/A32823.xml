            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It is long since this following Petition was presented to <hi>Tho. Andrewes</hi> Esquire, the then Lord Mayor, and to the Aldermen, and Common Counsell, but had they done but their duties, I had no need to print and publish these Books in Red Letters, and present the same to them in the middest of their jollity, and to the learned Judges of the Land, yea to the Commissioners of Oyer and Terminer, and Goale de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery, at the Sessions at Newgate, before whom I appeared, to put them in minde of their duty, and of the Law of God, which they had forgotten, and rested too much upon an arme of flesh; yea, if they had done what they were bound in conscience to doe, and had observed that most righteous Law to which they were sworne, it would have saved me a labour of going to the Counsell of State, Generall Counsell of the Army, or the Parliament. Now seeing little fruit yet appeare, for the establishing of the Lawes of God in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (for the lives of men are taken away meerely for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable Trifles) I am once more pressed in spirit to publish the same in manner and forme following, thus sounding an alarme against the workers of iniquity, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>quity; That seeing it is evident that whatsoever is good is of God, and the contrary of Abadon, and that no mans will though great is good, unlesse it be correspondent to the will of him who is greater then the greatest nor the Law of any Authority whatsoever, unlesse it be according to the Law of him who is higher then the

Highest. Therefore when great ungodly men have by their owne wils, and inhumaine Lawes for many yeares, destroyed not only the Righteous for conscience sake, but also the wicked undeservedly, this was iniquity to be punished by the Judge, though done by Judges themselves, who by their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-much Righteousnesse, and over-much Wickednesse, the people abetting them, hath brought death and Destruction upon this Land, and the hand of the Lord is stretched out still against this sinfull Nation, and unlesse they repent they shall surely perish.</p>
            <p>That the head of this Land is the sinfull City of <hi>London,</hi> who instead of bringing forth monthly good for the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Nation, doth bring forth that which tendeth to the destruction thereof; Gray haires being sprinkled here and there upon them, and they not aware, for they consider not how many are destroyed every Month by the Law of man, contrary to the Law of God, who hath declared, that if a Thief be found breaking through (the Sun being risen upon him) and be smitten that he dye, bloud shall be shed for him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. from whence it appeareth that those are guilty before the Lord, who take away the life of any man meerly for Stealing, when the Lord requireth that he should make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ull resticution out of his Estate, or if he have nothing, that he should be sold for his Theft: But contrariwise their lives are taken away meerly for Stealing, and commonly many though found notorious Theeves, yet have been discharged with little or no punishment either in Person or Purse, to the great damage of those who have lost their goods, and to the imboldening of the Malefactors, and the want of the due execution of the Law of God upon them, and not setting them in a way to make restitution to the Owners, tendeth to the utter destruction both of their Bodies and Soules.</p>
            <p>Therefore our desire is, <hi>That ye would take these things into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious consideration, and (in your wisdomes) take such a prudent and effectuall course, that in the execution of Iustice the remedy may not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

have no cause to repent, and that one Witnesse may not rise against any man for any iniquity, but that at the mouth of two or three Witnesses the matter may be established; and that ye would by no meanes make the wils of any men, or any humaine Lawes whatsoever any rules for you to walk by, further then you see them agreeable to the holy Will and Word of God, and that ye would according to your power, seek to remove the disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable badges of infamy from off your sinful City and Nation, though never so antient, familier, common, and customary, and that ye would addresse your selves to the Parliament for we obtaining of these things.</hi>

I have observed that the persons who are arraigned before your Honours, are poor labourers, and such creatures who stole things of a small value, peradventure for meer ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, yet you arraigne them for their lives, when the Law of God requireth their preservation in such a way, that they may make satisfaction, and not (if disabled) to force them into a necessity of stealing againe, but they are great sinners indeed, who rob men of their precious lives. And the worst of men are such as despise and destroy Theeves that steale, meerly to satisfie their hunger: It seems some of the Theeves you will presse, for not holding up their hands at your command, or for not answering to that interogatory <hi>Guil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y? or not Guilty?</hi> Consider I pray you, how circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall these things are: The weight of Tryals depends not hereupon (as I humbly con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eive.) For its possible that a Murderer, when he is arraigned may want his hands, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95978:6"/>
another may be dumb; yet you may proceed to Judgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, if sufficient evidence come in, &amp; that the jury, who are judges in matters of Fact, (and if they will, in matters of Law) finde them guilty, surely you must take no ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some for the life of a Murderer, though he cannot, or will not hold up his hand at the Bar, or say that he is Guilty: for by the Law <hi>no man is bound to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cuse himselfe,</hi> therefore the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty person is not bound to say he is guilty, and if he should say, not guilty what is he the better?</p>
                  <p>This is my opinion, which I humbly leave to the serious consideration of this Honourable Bench: I would to God that you would try such men by the Lawes of God, who cast themselves upon God and the Country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And oh that you would put the judgements of God in execution! seeing you are his Stewards; all Lawes being subordinate to Gods Lawes, as the Country is to God himselfe, then your tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity would be lengthened. Consider what I say in the feare of God, for life is above liberty and estate. The Jewell of one mans life, all your estates cannot ballance. I tooke notice of a passage of the Lord Cheife Justice <hi>Rolls,</hi> and it was we I observed, how that the Theeves <hi>are honest before they come in Goale, and there they become naught; and learn to lye, by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not guilty, when they had confessed it before.</hi> If it be so, then great pitty it is that they should not be in such a place, where they may be put in a way, and course, to make satisfaction accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the direction of the wisdome of God, <hi>By whom Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Nobles, yea, all the Iudges of the earth are said to rule:</hi> So leaving these consciencious Dictates to your serious thoughts, I subscribe my selfe,</p>

            <p>This Letter was delivered unto the Bench about the third houre of the day, where when Mr. <hi>Chidley</hi> was called, he made answer, and came to the Board, and the Letter was there
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95978:6"/>
publickly owned by him, as his owne hand-writing, which he would stand by and justifie, it being (as he said) a discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his conscience, as a testimony before them all, which he left to their serious consideration; wherupon he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Bench to depart, and was put out of the Court, he speaking in the justification of the Statutes of God to be right, and the Precepts of men to be wrong, in taking away mens lives for such triviall matters.</p>
            <p>After he was put out, they gave Sentence against the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner at the Bar, who was arraigned for stealing, and would not hold up his hand, nor plead, but besought them that the Letter might be read publickly, that all the Bench might hear, and then, saith he, afterwards I will plead whatsoever comes of it, whether I live, or dye; but they would not hearken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him but proceeded, and by the Recorder M. <hi>Steele,</hi> who was their Mouth, gave Sentence against him, which was to this effect; That he should goe from thence to the place from whence he came, and be led into a dark room where there was no light, and should be stript naked, only his privy members covered, &amp; his head covered, &amp; his arms to be stretched forth, both on the one side and on the other, as far as they could be stretched, and that he should be laid along on his back, and have as much weight laid upon him, as he was able to beare, and more; And the next day he should have only three mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Obj.</hi> And wereas they object, <hi>That it is the Law of the Land to put Theeves to death for stealing to the value of</hi> 13d. ob.</p>
            <p>I Answer, That no Law is to be observed, if it be against THE LAW OF GOD, especially in the taking away of mens lives; yea, God was so far from commanding such Theeves to be put to death, that he requireth <hi>their blood, at the hands of them that shed it, though done in the very act of breaking through, if the Sun be risen upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. THe putting them to death is expresly against the Law of God, because it disableth them for ever making satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the owners of the goods, yea, such is the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lawes and Customes of this Land, that he that

            <p>And such is the corruption of the Lawes, that if the Theife steale to the value of 13 <hi>d. ob.</hi> he shall be hanged, as Judge <hi>Byron</hi> in his cases hath declared; and sometimes their lives are taken away upon a single evidence, whereas there <hi>ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4. THis Law of putting poore Theeves to death for seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that are not able to make restitution out of their estates, is against GODS LAW, because in such case<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
