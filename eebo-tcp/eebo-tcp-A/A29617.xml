            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A CANTERBVRY TALE.</head>
            <l>IN Calidon did live a Potent Peere,</l>
            <l>Who had three Princely Sonnes of courage bold,</l>
            <l>For brave Achivements beyond all compare,</l>
            <l>Nere fairer Creatures ere were fram'd on Mould,</l>
            <l>Whose fame, whose honour and terrene renowne,</l>
            <l>Unto hopes highest station did aspire,</l>
            <l>Till fate and falshood sought to pull them downe,</l>
            <l>By breeding discord 'tweene them and their sire:</l>
            <l>Hell to their ruine being soly bent,</l>
            <l>Had not blest heaven crost their damn'd intent.</l>
            <l>For some malignant sprights had so inflam'd</l>
            <l>Their fathers wrath 'gainst one of his said sonnes,</l>
            <l>That he his death and downefall onely aim'd,</l>
            <l>So hot the rancor of his fury burnes;</l>
            <l>The sacklesse sonne on bended knees falls downe,</l>
            <l>Begging the favor of his frowning sire,</l>
            <l>The more he seekes the farther from his boone,</l>
            <l>For kindled was the the fury of his ire,</l>
            <l>By powerfull Prelates, who so fed the flame,</l>
            <l>That nought but his heart blood could quench the same.</l>
            <l>First he debars his guiltlesse son of bread,</l>
            <l>Aiming by famine for to worke his fall,</l>
            <l>Next him imprisons, oh most dolefull deed!</l>
            <l>When as the father shall the sonne enthrall,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:94111:2"/>But life is sweet, and liberty so deare,</l>
            <l>To free and noble mindes, that he breakes ward,</l>
            <l>And to his fathers presence doth repaire,</l>
            <l>With resolution not to be debard:</l>
            <l>His Princely reconcilement for to gaine,</l>
            <l>And punishment of those had bred his baine.</l>
            <l>His father meets him with an angry brow,</l>
            <l>And all his force in fury 'gainst him bends,</l>
            <l>He drawes his sword to give the fatall blow,</l>
            <l>But God who alwaies Innocents defends,</l>
            <l>Protects the sonne, who then himselfe to free</l>
            <l>From stripes, imprisonment, and cruell bands,</l>
            <l>From direfull death, and Romish slavery,</l>
            <l>Boldly steps in, and gently holds his hands,</l>
            <l>Begging still humbly on his bended knee,</l>
            <l>His grievances to heare, and him to free.</l>
            <l>The inrag'd father calls his other sonnes,</l>
            <l>Him to assist 'gainst this their loving brother,</l>
            <l>Commands them bring their Pistolls, Pikes, and Guns,</l>
            <l>They stand amaz'd, looking each at other,</l>
            <l>Yet forth the elder steps, and with like zeale,</l>
            <l>On bended knees implores their wrathfull sire,</l>
            <l>His brothers suite to heare, perchance our weale,</l>
            <l>It may concerne (good Sir) grant his desire.</l>
            <l>The younger seconds him, they both prevaile,</l>
            <l>The father is content to heare his tale.</l>
            <l>In presence then of his kinde loving brothers,</l>
            <l>His grievances he gently gins relate,</l>
            <l>All plots and stratagems he then discovers</l>
            <l>Which were contriv'ed against their fathers state,</l>
            <l>Each damn'd designe he plainely then relates,</l>
            <l>Which had beene hatcht by hell, at Rome or Spaine,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:94111:3"/>For bringing in the Babylonish rites</l>
            <l>To brand them and their fathers house with shame,</l>
            <l>Making them hatefull to the great Commander,</l>
            <l>That he might list them in black <hi>Pluto's</hi> Callender.</l>
            <l>Deare Sir, quoth he, will you gaine heavens frowne,</l>
            <l>Through the bad counsell of accurst misleeders?</l>
            <l>Or will you lose the comfort of a son,</l>
            <l>For pleasing Parasites or mischiefe breeders?</l>
            <l>Nay will you hazard all? For all their ends,</l>
            <l>Aime at my brothers ruine as well as mine,</l>
            <l>The Sychophants which now doe seeme their friends</l>
            <l>Will prove tart foes if they finde place and time.</l>
            <l>Consider then it is not I alone</l>
            <l>Must smart and suffer, though I soly grone.</l>
            <l>This mischiefe which hath now befalne to me,</l>
            <l>At first was fram'd against my elder brother,</l>
            <l>By that curst conclave of impiety,</l>
            <l>The Cardinalls and painted whore their mother.</l>
            <l>But great Iehova who did then foresee</l>
            <l>How that their damn'd designes were to oppose</l>
            <l>The glory of the eternall Deity,</l>
            <l>Was pleased that I their plots should counterpose,</l>
            <l>And gave me courage with a filiall awe,</l>
            <l>'Gainst foes in your defence my sword to draw.</l>
            <l>Thinke what pernitious plots have beene contriv'd</l>
            <l>By fire and water for to worke your baine,</l>
            <l>Consider what Armados have ariv'd</l>
            <l>Upon your costs your Countries for to gaine,</l>
            <l>Yet all in vaine, prais'd be the power divine,</l>
            <l>The ruine they have sought of you and yours,</l>
            <l>And ever shall while you and they combine</l>
            <l>In perfect love, in spight of all their powers,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:94111:3"/>Crush then that cursed and most viperous brood,</l>
            <l>That moves you thus to spill your childrens blood.</l>
            <l>See then the sufferings of your sakelesse sonne,</l>
            <l>And his intentions with a gracious eye,</l>
            <l>View their endeavours who would have undone</l>
            <l>Your selfe, your state, and Princely Progeny,</l>
            <l>Ponder their plots who plundred have the streame,</l>
            <l>And current of your hoped happinesse,</l>
            <l>Weigh all their actions with an upright beame,</l>
            <l>That Justice may imbrace faire Righteousnesse;</l>
            <l>So none shall dare t'eclipse, or once pull downe</l>
            <l>The glorious splendor of your high renowne.</l>
            <l>This said, his brothers shed some brinish teares,</l>
            <l>Which molified their furious fathers heart,</l>
            <l>Who then replied (deare sonnes) it now appeares,</l>
            <l>You are resolved all to take one part,</l>
            <l>And so am I, Ile second you, goe on,</l>
            <l>And rid me of these fire brands of debate,</l>
            <l>Root them all out, be sure you leave not one</l>
            <l>That sought the ruine of you, or my state;</l>
            <l>And thou my sonne, whose bane I late did wish,</l>
            <l>Receive thy reconciled fathers blesse.</l>
            <l>For henceforth my deare children I shall know</l>
            <l>Our friends from foes, since truely now I finde,</l>
            <l>Who aim'd our blesse, our bane, our weale, our woe,</l>
            <l>Which I have printed in my heart and minde,</l>
            <l>No damn'd designe hereafter shall take place,</l>
            <l>Or once be harbor'd in your fathers brest,</l>
            <l>Which him, or his may in the least disgrace,</l>
            <l>And you oppresse, or rob of quiet rest;</l>
            <l>Sweet peace and plenty each where shall abound,</l>
            <l>While all our actions with love shall be crown'd.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:94111:4"/>Downe at their fathers feet these joyfull wights,</l>
            <l>Prostrate themselves and lye as men amaz'd,</l>
            <l>At length couragiously they rouse their sprights,</l>
            <l>Which long with care and griefe had beene surpriz'd,</l>
            <l>And all resolve unfainedly to see</l>
            <l>Their fathers foes cut off by fatall stroke,</l>
            <l>That sought the downfall of his dignity,</l>
            <l>And 'gainst them his displeasure did provoke,</l>
            <l>The hand is up (oh speake that word agen)</l>
            <l>To give the blow let all hearts say Amen.</l>
