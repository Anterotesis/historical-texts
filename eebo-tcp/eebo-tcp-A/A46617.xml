            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Thought it my bound Duty to return your Lordſhip Thanks for the great Care you have taken in preſerving the Peace and Proſperity of this City, and for your Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty to my late Soveraign Lord the King and His Brother. My Lord, I ſhall always Admire you, and more eſpecially the late Aldermen your Brethren; And as for Sir <hi>John Moors,</hi> he ſhall never be forgotten, for the great Care and Pains he took, and no Magiſtrate was ever ſo Abuſed, yet tho he had Power, he Revenged it not: And as for Sir <hi>William Pritchard,</hi> he carried himſelf both Prudent and Wiſe. And as for the late Sheriffs, I think They were as Worthy Civil Gentlemen as any that could Serve the City. And as for the People, none more inclin'd to Love their own Prince than they, but not willing to be in Subjection to another, and ſurely that is no Crime; for if it be a Crime, how highly guilty am I, that have always Loved my Soveraign Lord and no other: For how entirely did I Love my late Soveraign? For there was nothing in the World I lov'd above Him, but God. O! That I had Died, that He might have Liv'd, then you would not have been expoſed to the Flouts, Mocks, and Deriſions of your Adverſaries; but it is the Wiſdom of God to ſuffer it to be ſo, for all our Trials, and I do not doubt but your Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty will remain to the end, that you may obtain the Crown of your Reward: But, my Lord, you know that Loyalty without Piety toward God, will avail nothing in the day of His Anger. Therefore I humbly beſeech your Lordſhip, and the Aldermen your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and all the Loyal Men of this City, that they ſhould be as Zealous for Gods Glory and His Truth, as they have been for the Kings Intereſt, and then I do not doubt but that God Almighty will accept of your Endeavours, and you may obtain that everlaſting Name of being <hi>Good Servants to God, and Good Subjects to your Prince</hi>; altho the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of <hi>Joſeph</hi> be forgotten, and the Loyalty of the Church of <hi>England</hi> deſpiſed, and Her Adverſaries Triumphing over Her, ſaying, <hi>Take down Her Hedges, that the Wild Boars of the Forreſt may devour Her.</hi> O! who would have thought that my Soveraign that I Lov'd ſo well, and Pleaded His Cauſe in all Things, and before all Perſons, whom I admire above all Princes for His <hi>Wisdom and Goodneſs,</hi> ſhould now Expoſe us! <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I'll put no Confidence in Princes, nor in the Sons of Men,</hi> but in God alone, who is able to Preſerve us; and I ſhall always pray for my Soveraign Lord, that God would keep and preſerve Him from that that is Hurtful to Princes. For I have been Concern'd for the Peace of this Nation above theſe Twenty Years, and it was Love to God that made me Love the King, and Love to the King that made me Love the People; And when any Pronounc'd any Judgments againſt this Nation for the Sins of the People, it troubled me, therefore I humbled my ſelf with Faſting, to Implore the Almighty, that the Judgments might be prevented, but I find that many People mocks at his Judgments, and do not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their Sins, as if they delighted to provoke the Moſt High to deſtroy them. Indeed when I firſt undertook the Quarrel, they blam'd me infinitely for it, ſaying, <hi>They were, not worthy of it,</hi> but I matter'd it not, for I knew God did not delight in the Deſtruction of any; and let them be how they would toward me, yet my Love was ſo toward them, that I did not matter what they ſaid, for I Loved my Soveraign, therefore I was not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have His Kingdom deſtroy'd, or His Throne uneaſie; and indeed the Lord hath been very Good to me, for He hath given me Favour before the Eys of all ſorts of People; yet not with ſtanding I am very ſenſible, I have a great many Enemies, that would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed me a great while ago, it my Soveraign had not been as an Angel to preſerve me, tho I muſt needs ſay the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> hath been very Civil to me, but it is in hopes to make me a <hi>Proſilite,</hi> but it is a queſtion whether their Love will laſt any longer than their Hopes; therefore I am very ſorry for them, that they ſhould think that none can be Sav'd but what owns <hi>Rome,</hi> when we all have but one God, one Saviour and one Holy Spirit, and yet that we muſt be counted <hi>Heretical and Damn'd,</hi> it muſt proceed from Ignorance or Malice; yet I am perſwaded, there is many <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> that Loves me, and I wiſh them Well; and for many Diſſentors, I do not queſtion but they Love me likewiſe, tho they thought me to be <hi>Popiſhly Inclin'd,</hi> but I never was, and I hope in God never ſhall be; And as for the <hi>Church-men,</hi> they have a great Reaſon to Love me, becauſe I could Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice my Life for them all, for their <hi>Good is my Good, and their Unhappineſs is my Unhappineſs, and I delight greatly in having them Happy.</hi> Therefore God requires that ſhould be Juſt, and then Merciful, and to abound in all <hi>Good Works,</hi> for Chriſt ſays, <hi>By this all Men know you are my Diſciples, if you keep my Commandments.</hi> To Love one another, and to Pray for the King, and to yield Obedience to Him in all Things that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable <hi>to Gods Commands.</hi> And if our Diſſenting Brethren had done this, <hi>there would have been no Contention amongſt us</hi>; but <hi>Offences will come, but Woe to them by whom they come:</hi> They have <hi>Condemn'd their Brethren for being Fools,</hi> I wiſh that they may not be <hi>condemn'd with the ſame Judgment as they have condemn'd others.</hi> And ſo I reſt,</p>
