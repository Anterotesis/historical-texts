            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>COME then at last, while anxious Nations weep,</l>
               <l>Three Kingdoms stak't! too pretious for the deep.</l>
               <l>Too pretious sure, for when the Trump of fame</l>
               <l>Did with a direfull sound your Wrack proclaim,</l>
               <l>Your danger and your doubtfull safety shown,</l>
               <l>It dampt the Genius, and it Shook the Throne.</l>
               <l>Your Helm may now the Sea-born Goddess take,</l>
               <l>And soft <hi>Favonius</hi> safe your passage make.</l>
               <l>Strong, and auspicious, bee the Stars that reign,</l>
               <l>The day you launch, and <hi>Nereus</hi> sweep the Main.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Neptune</hi> aloft, scowr all the Storms before,</l>
               <l>And following <hi>Tritons,</hi> wind you to the Shore;</l>
               <l>While on the Beach, like Billows of the Land,</l>
               <l>In bending Crowds the Loyal English stand:</l>
               <l>Come then, th√¥ late, your right receive at last;</l>
               <l>Which Heaven preserv'd, in spite of Fortunes blast,</l>
               <l>Accept those hearts, that Offer on the Strand;</l>
               <l>The better half of this divided Land.</l>
               <l>Venting their honest Souls in tears of Joy,</l>
               <l>They rave, and beg you wou'd their lives employ,</l>
               <l>Shouting your sacred name, they drive the air,</l>
               <l>And fill your Canvas Wings with gales of prayer.</l>
               <l>Come then I hear three Nations shout agen,</l>
               <l>And, next our <hi>Charles,</hi> in every bosome reign;</l>
               <l>Heaven's darling Charge, the care of regal stars,</l>
               <l>Pledge of our Peace, and Triumph of our Wars.</l>

Heav'n eccho's Come, but come not Sir alone,</l>
               <l>Bring the bright pregnant Blessing of the Throne.</l>
               <l>And if in Poets charms be force or skill,</l>
               <l>We charge you, O ye Waves, and Winds be still,</l>
               <l>Soft as a sailing Goddess bring her home,</l>
               <l>With the expected Prince that loads her Womb;</l>
               <l>Joy of this Age and Heir of that to come.</l>
               <l>Next her the Virgin Princess shines from far,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Aurora</hi> that, and this the Morning Star.</l>
               <l>Hail then, all hail, They land in <hi>Charle</hi>'s Armes,</l>
               <l>While his large Breast, the Nation's Angel warms.</l>
               <l>Tears from his Cheeks with manly mildness roul,</l>
               <l>Then dearly grasps the treasure of his Soul:</l>
               <l>Hangs on his Neck, and feeds upon his form,</l>
               <l>Calls him his Calm, after a tedious Storm.</l>
               <l>O Brother! He cou'd say no more, and then,</l>
               <l>With heaving Passion clasp'd him close again.</l>
               <l>How oft he cry'd have I thy absence mourn'd,</l>
               <l>But 'tis enough Thou art at last return'd:</l>
               <l>Said I return'd! O never more to part,</l>
               <l>Nor draw the vital warmth from <hi>Charles</hi> his heart.</l>
               <l>Once more, O Heav'n, I shall his Vertue prove,</l>
               <l>His Council, Conduct, and unshaken Love.</l>
               <l>My People too at last their Errour see,</l>
               <l>And make their Sovereign blest in loving Thee.</l>
               <l>Not but there is a stiff-neck'd-harden'd Crew</l>
               <l>That give not <hi>Caesar,</hi> no nor God his due.</l>
               <l>Reprobate Traytors, Tyrants of their Own,</l>
               <l>Yet Grudge to see their Monarch in his Throne.</l>
               <l>Their stubborn Souls with brass Rebellion barr'd,</l>
               <l>Desert the Laws, and Crimes with Treason guard.</l>
               <l>Whom I‚Äîbut there he stop'd, and cry'd 'tis past,</l>
               <l>Pity's no more, this warning be their last;</l>
               <l>Then sighing said, my Soul's dear purchas'd rest,</l>
               <l>Welcome, Oh welcome, to my longing Brest:</l>
               <l>Why should I waste a tear while thou art by,</l>
               <l>To all extreams of Friendship let us fly,</l>
               <l>Disdain the factious Crowd that wou'd rebell</l>
               <l>And mourn the Men that durst in death excell,</l>
               <l>Their Fates were Glorious since for thee they fell.</l>
               <l>And as a Prince has right his Arms to weil'd,</l>
               <l>When stubborn Rebels force him to the Field:</l>
               <l>So for the Loyal, who their Lives lay down,</l>
               <l>He dares to Hazard both his Life and Crown.</l>
