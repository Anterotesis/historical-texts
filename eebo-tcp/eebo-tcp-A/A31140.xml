            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>
               <hi>The Caſe of the Common Brewers,</hi> Keeping Publick Brewing-houſes in the Country, now Petitioners before the Honourable Houſe of Commons, and their Objections againſt ſeveral Clauſes contained in a Bill brought into the ſaid Houſe for an Additional Exciſe upon <hi>Beer</hi> and <hi>Ale,</hi> Humbly offered to the Members of the ſame.</head>
            <p>THAT the ſaid Petitioners, as to the Rates to be Impoſed and Added, Humbly ſubmit themſelves to the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the ſaid Houſe, and will chearfully obey the ſame.</p>
            <p>That having for ſeveral Years laſt paſt, been extremely abuſed by the Charges and Returns of the Gagers, and other Officers of the Exciſe: As,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. In Charging and Returning Beer to be Ale, whereby they have loſt the Allowances by the former Acts for Exciſe Granted them <hi>(viz.)</hi> four Gallons in every Barrel, and one Barrel in every three and twenty, amounting to above the eighth part of their Profits.</item>
               <item>2. In Returning and Charging Beer by them Brew'd and Sold for Six Shillings Beer, as Ale and Strong Beer, whereby they have loſt their Allowances aforeſaid, and Charged with the whole Duty for Ale.</item>
               <item>3. In Gaging Worts, and Charging and Returning accordingly; whereas they ought to Gage in the Tun, and return according to that, becauſe of the waſte of the Liquor before; and thereby your Petitioners have not had 30 Gallons to the Barrel.</item>
            </list>
            <p>That tho' they have made their continual Complaints and Applications, yet could have no Redreſs, by reaſon the Commiſſioners have always (tho' againſt Law, as your Petitioners conceive) conſtrued the former Acts, that the Gagers Return was a binding and indiſputable Charge upon the Brewers, both as to quantity and quality. Nay, inſtead of Redreſs, they have been ſtill charged more outragiouſly, and proſecuted upon the Fines and Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties laid upon them by the Oaths of the Gagers (who are generally perſons of ſmall Reputation) and admitted to no Defence.</p>
            <p>Therefore your Petitioners did humbly apply themſelves to this Honourable Houſe for Redreſs for the future, That ſeveral Clauſes in this Bill (as now Drawn) tho' thereby it is pretended the avoiding all Differences and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes between the Gagers and Brewers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> touching Beer and Ale, and the Returns and Charges thereof; yet in truth, in conſequence, not only faſtens the former Abuſes more unavoidably upon the Brewers, but will give op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for Greater. For,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That no Perſons are Appointed before whom your Petitioners may have their Complaints, nor any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Appointed to whom they may have their Appeal: But only that all Fines, Forfeitures, <hi>&amp;c. (viz.)</hi> (on the Brewers parts) ſhall be heard determined, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before the Commiſſioners in their ſeveral Diſtricts, or by Two Juſtices. Nay, the very Appeals by the former Acts ſeem to be taken away.</item>
               <item>2. No Penalty laid upon the Gager or other Officer for any falſe Return or Liberty given to the Brewer to diſprove the ſame, if it be falſe, either in quantity or quality.</item>
               <item>3. That the Remedy which ſeems to be propoſed by the ſaid Bill <hi>(viz.)</hi> to make the Barrels of Beer and Ale equal, and the Allowances the ſame, will be the Ruine of moſt Beer-Brewers in the Country: 1. For that thereby they muſt be forc't to Cut and Alter all their Veſſels. 2. They muſt Loſe their Cuſtomers, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Inn-keepers ſtill expecting the ſame Meaſure and Price; and eſpecially in <hi>Oxon,</hi> where the Price is ſet upon the Brewer; and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where their Meaſure is Gaged by the Univerſity; and if the Meaſure and Prices be alter'd, moſt private Families will return to Brewing, which will much prejudice the Exciſe. 3. That the Allowances to be the ſame, will be very unjuſt, becauſe the Waſte and Leakage of Beer and Ale are very unequal, for which reaſon the former Acts made the Difference in Allowances.</item>
               <item>4. That by the Clauſe whereby it is to be Enacted, That if it appear to the Gager that any Worts are miſſing, or not let fairly down into the Tun, it ſhall be lawful for him to charge the Brewer at his Diſcretion. Your Petitioners are left totally to the Mercy of the Gagers, and that without any Remedy or Appeal; who upon all occaſions will make uſe thereof to their own Advantage, and your Petitioners Ruine.</item>
               <item>5. That the only Clauſe in the Act of the 15th of <hi>Car. ſecundi,</hi> that ſeem'd any way beneficial for the Brewer, and to give him liberty to diſcharge himſelf from the Oppreſſion of the Gager, is by a <hi>Proviſo</hi> in this Bill, render'd altogether ineffectual, leaving him ſolely to the Mercy of the Informing Gager, if he pleaſe to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any Crime upon him.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore your Petitioners humbly pray, That the ſaid Bill may be Amended in the Premiſes, and ſuch Clauſes added, as thereby they may have ſome effectual Remedy of their ſaid Abuſes.</hi>
