         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Ondon</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> (though neither of you are my Native or Naturall Mother, yet) I was borne in <hi>Glocester,</hi> a City that hath stood to it in our Loyall and obedient Warres against the King, not much inferiour for Parliamentall obedience or Publique Faith and Confidence to you, as hath been obstinately manifested. But leaving <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> with her <hi>Massy</hi> zeale and valour, I returne my loving Remembrance to <hi>London,</hi> who hath been, and is the inexhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible Magazine for Men, Mony, and Maintenance, for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of those durable, famous and lasting Warres against the King, (which the Cavaliering and Malignant Party calls Rebellion) and which we have causes to call, entitle, nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and acknowledge to be the Holy Cause.</p>
            <p>And as our Armies have with unexpected successe, been Horrible, Terrible, Dreadfull, Fearefull, Victorious, and Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, and have forraged through <hi>England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Coventry,</hi> and <hi>Canterbury,</hi> yet that stiffeneck'd Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and People of <hi>Oxford,</hi> have (till now) stood out in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious opposition against us; for that <hi>Academy</hi> and <hi>City,</hi> have ever since these distracted and disturbant times, been the Treasury of Refractory obstinacy, and the Store-house of our Mischiefes; whom to suppresse and bring into order and conformity, our Almighty Parliament hath sought by all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable meanes, and by most perswasive Exhortations from the Presse and Pulpits, there hath been nothing by us negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,

that might reforme them. But finding their obduracy immoveable, their inveteracy implacable, and their reducancy impossible; we (out of a Christian care of the future prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of that Renowned well-spring and Fountaine of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) much against our pious Inclinations, were inforced to surround it with our Potent and unresistible Forces of hostility, twice in two severall yeares.</p>
            <p>In two monthes of <hi>May,</hi> we have given them two gentle and friendly Visitations (<hi>viz.</hi> 1644, and 1645.) and we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies used the most submissive way of Summoning His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty and that stubborne City to our obedience. What a faire warning we gave them the first yeare, is not unknowne, and how fairly we came of and on, we have cause to remember, for two great Generalls and Armies did onely face them, as an Instruction for them to avoyd their further desolation and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity. But seeing that gentle and mollifying Cataplasmes and Pultisses would not serve to soften the Corrodency of their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postumated Inveteracy, we have now (about the latter end of this last <hi>May</hi>) in the <hi>Whitsun</hi> week, vouchsafed to lance her Malignant maladies, and by incision and occission, to let out her malevolent and contagious Corruptions.</p>
            <p>To which end and purpose, our (potent, powerfull, perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and pittifull) Parliament, begirt and swathed that contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matious City with a strong Swaddle band of Warre, with foure severall Armies, which being conjoyned into one, with a Quadrapliciticall Vnity, under the conduction of such a Messe (or <hi>Murnivall</hi>) of Martiall Commanders, that the like (or bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) <hi>Heroes,</hi> never issued from the Loynes of <hi>Mars</hi> &amp; <hi>Belona,</hi> amongst whom the most Excellent, Expert, Exact, and Exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site Souldier, Sir <hi>Thomasius Fairfax,</hi> was Commander in chiefe, being the admired <hi>Agamemnon</hi> of our Host, and the only chosen, pick'd, or cul<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

and dreadfull <hi>Skippon,</hi> appear'd like the Magnanimous <hi>Achilles,</hi> with his most unmatchable multitude of <hi>Mirmidons.</hi> Fourthly and lastly, (but neither last or least in worth) was the Illustrious Bold <hi>Browne,</hi> in whose Braine, the Art of Armes is <hi>Pyled,</hi> and in whose Breast, Honour is Billited, he most Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, Fearfully, drew his Trenchant Sword, wherewith he chop'd in sunder the Faggot-Bond of his fury, insomuch that his flaming Valour (like a burning <hi>Bavin</hi>) appear'd most Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulgently perspicuous to the besiedged <hi>Oxonians.</hi> These foure Generalls (drawne in their particulars) were <hi>Quarter'd</hi> in the Villages that doe Verge, Fringe, or Girdle the City, namely <hi>Kennington,</hi> South <hi>Hinkesey,</hi> West <hi>Hinkesey, Botley, Witeham, Wolvercot, Marson, Hedington, Sampford, Ifley, &amp;c.</hi> By which meanes it was so strongly Block'd up, that the Garrisons Forces and Inhabitants began to look thin upon the matter, for they were so unprovided, and unprepared to endure a Siedge, that within five dayes we brought them to such a hard strait, that Wheat was mounted to the price of 4s. the Bushell, Butter and Cheese at 6<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> the pound, Milke at a penny the quart, but 9 or ten Egges a groat, Radishes a halfe penny the bunch, a Iugge of Beere 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, Beefe and other Flesh so scarce, that none was to be had amongst them (without credit or ready mony.) In this extremity, we perceived they were unable to hold out long, therefore our Valiant Commanders, (like the foure Windes) assaulted them at their foure severall Portes, His Excellency, play'd the part of <hi>Boreas,</hi> and Blustred Impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously at the <hi>North; Browne</hi> with his Brave Bold Boyes Blew Boystrously like <hi>Auster</hi> at the <hi>South; Cromwell</hi> Acted the part of <hi>Eurus</hi> with untireable Snuffing, Puffing, and Huffing at the <hi>East</hi>; and <hi>Skippon</hi> (like a second <hi>Scipio</hi>) Rag'd most Tempesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentially (like <hi>Zephyrus</hi>) on the <hi>West.</hi> Thus on all sides, Parts and Portes was <hi>Oxford</hi> Beleaguerd, without and within every House, Lane, and Street, was full of Horror, Terror, Trembling like Hills. There you might behold a Woman quaking like a Custard before an Alderman, and in another place another sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king like an Oven; there was carelesse security in sundry and severall shapes and noyses, some halfe, and some whole drunk,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38075:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
some piping and whiffing, some Riming and singing, some watching and guarding, (not at all regarding either us or any thing that we could doe to them) as may appeare by a mad fellow that wrote these Verses in a jeering Contempt of us and our Forces.

                  <l>For <hi>Browne,</hi> for <hi>Skippon, Cromwell,</hi> and for <hi>Fairfax,</hi>

                  <l>The Parliament would Hang em up like Calves.</l>
               </q>
Some of them said, that our Armies should not offend the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament so farre, as to doe their worke by halves, or to doe halfe the worke they were sent about; thus continued this hotch potch, mingle mangle galleymawfrey of variable opinions and humourous expressions, for the space of seven daies and nine nights, with an afternoone or two; Our Cannons with perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Battry having disgorg'd 6789 shot, our Horse, Carbines, and our innumerable Foot environ'd them round, with groves, thickets, and woods of Pikes, our Mu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Amongst and amidst these Rough Robustious salutations, and Mortall Monumentall mortuary greetings, one of our Cannons (being) discharged or fired at Random, from his Excellencies Quarter at <hi>Marson,</hi> flew by chance over Saint <hi>Iohns Colledge,</hi> and most strangely wheel'd about on the left hand, hard by the Crosse and weathercock on Saint <hi>Maries</hi> Steeple; and passing in post hast to <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> it broke a corner of a window in the great <hi>Quadrangle,</hi> and from thence it mounted, and took the great Lanthorne on the top of the Hall, which never fell to ground till it drop'd into <hi>Abington</hi> market place; just in the same Pavement whereon the Idolatrous <hi>Crosse</hi> stood, that was Piously overthrowne on the 31 of <hi>May,</hi> 1644. (much about the month, day, and time of the yeare as the aforesaid shot fell into <hi>Christ-Church</hi>) by the most Victorious and Vanquish'd, the Renowned and Nobly slighted, the Conquer'd Conqueror, Sir <hi>William Waller</hi>; the aforesaid Lanthorne, being now in the tuition of the Valiant Colonell <hi>Browne,</hi> who hath it as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his Noble services, and is determined to keep it till he

dyes, and afterwards it is to be hang'd up (as a <hi>Trophey</hi>) over his Tombe, for a Monumentall Remembrance to Posterity, of his Valour and Victories.</p>
            <p>But to returne to the Siege againe; The Reader must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that our Parliament are so happy to have such Generalls and Commanders as are in their Valours, not only invincible, but invisible also. The Canoneers and Gunners had the Art to discharge many hundreds of their Ordnance, and no fire or Bullet to be seen, nor Report of any Gun heard. For of all the great numbers of shot (before specified) there were very few of them came to the knowledge of the Besieged; insomuch that they were uncapable of perceiving any danger they were in. This Rare hidden Art was first invented by an <hi>Italian,</hi> whom they called Doctor <hi>Iackaneico,</hi> he was an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> witch, (or a cunning man) in the Raigne of <hi>Ptolomy Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getes</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the Command of Sir <hi>Tom</hi> (his Excellency I meane) there was an Artificiall <hi>Naturall</hi> Geometricall Bridge, made over the River <hi>Charwell,</hi> about a mile from <hi>Oxford</hi> (North East and by Westward) what good service that Bridge did it is impertinent, and not much materiall to speak of; But this is certaine, that the month of <hi>May,</hi> ending on the 31, which being Saturday, fell out luckily to be the latter end of the week, the Sunday following proved to be the first day of <hi>Iune,</hi> so that (by consequence) Monday was the next day after; on which Monday morning, we had the happinesse to gaine a glorious Victory. On that day, (that memorable, remarkable, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, dainty delicate day) our Forces ascended to the top (or altitude) of Mount <hi>Hedinton</hi> (vulgarly called <hi>Hedinton Hill</hi>) but for that day, and on that Hill (to which Hill, <hi>Pinda, Ossa, Olympus, Parnassus, Gadds</hi> Hill, <hi>Shotover,</hi> and <hi>Shuters</hi> Hill, shall hereafter strike saile) our prosperous <hi>Parliamentonyans,</hi> inclosed, encompassed, environ'd, enwrapped, envelloped (or what the Reader meanes to tearme it) the whole Body, or Bodies of the Malignants, we fought Valiantly, they fell Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, some dead, some kill'd, some slaine, some hurt, some wounded, some fled, some ran away, some escap'd, some taken

Prisoners, some put into Bondage, some thrust into Thraldom, and some carried into Captivity, so that in lesse time then halfe an howre, the mutability of fickle fortune was apparent, by a suddain turne of her foure square-Round wheele, for beyond all expectation, when the Enemy was singing scurvy Songs, &amp; jeering with intollerable abusive Language and gesture, at the Sacred Persons and Honours of those whom they have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sworne to obey with Allegiance and Loyalty. Then at that Time, even then, betwixt the howres of two and three in the morning, we fell upon them <hi>Pell mell, Helter skelter,</hi> where in a moment 40 or 50 fell, to seek their habitation in another world, many were sore wounded; and having thus won the Field, we presently won <hi>Oxford,</hi> we entred without Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants at the East, by Saint <hi>Clements,</hi> we Conquer'd <hi>Maudlin</hi> (or <hi>Magdalen Colledge</hi>) with a bare Summons, we march'd Triumphantly to <hi>Cairfax,</hi> (and leaving the Gallowse on our right hand) we with force or perforce entred and surpriz'd the Castle, we staid in the Castle three dayes, in all which time our Generalls were so Nobly pittifull, and our other Commanders, Officers, and Souldiers so mercifully mannerly, that we neither did the Towne any harme, or Plunder'd the people of anything (except Victualls) but whatsoever we had was freely given to us, nor did any of us so much as give the <hi>Oxford</hi> folke so much as a hard word, nor troubled them to lye in any of their Beds or foule sheets, or any linnen; and was not this a mercifull Victory? All this was done by lesse then 150 Parliament Souldiers, in so small or little a time, that it must ever be with Thankfulnesse remembred, and it is not to be doubted, but <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster</hi> will expresse their joyfull gratitude, with Bells, Bonefires, and an holy publique Thankesgiving.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I have an humble desire (on Request) to all Valiant men of our Parliament Armies, which is, That they will stoutly, stiffely, and desperately stand and persevere in the Cause, you know that many of us, could never have gotten such Estates by our Trades, as we have purchased by this Trade of Warre; it is not Loyalty and Allegiance, that will preferre

a <hi>Tinker</hi> to the Estate of a <hi>Commander,</hi> it is not that beggerly Thing call'd <hi>Honesty,</hi> nor that despised fancy of <hi>Learning,</hi> will bring a man to <hi>Promotion, Conscience</hi> is a Toye, it will never make a <hi>Cobler</hi> a <hi>Preacher,</hi> or a <hi>Wood-monger</hi> a Sergeant <hi>Major Generall,</hi> or <hi>Colonell</hi>; we are now <hi>Grammar'd</hi> in our Noble Actions, and a <hi>Peace</hi> would put very many of us back againe to our <hi>Horne-bookes</hi>; a just and lawfull <hi>Peace</hi> would cause the King to have His Owne againe, and every man to have his Right; a <hi>Peace</hi> would restore the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> to it's Pristine Purity; and then what will become of our Zealous new <hi>Directorie,</hi> for a <hi>Peace</hi> will bring in againe, the contemned Booke of <hi>Common Prayer</hi>; and finally a <hi>Peace</hi> would make Thousands of us to surrender so much Pillage and Plunder to the Right owners, that we should be like (<hi>Aesops</hi> Crow) poore naked Rogues, when every Bird had his fether from us; Let our Conquests encourage us, let our hopes spurre us forward, let our surprize of <hi>Oxford,</hi> fill our Vei<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
