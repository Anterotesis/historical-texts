            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat whereas your Petitioners weigh with mature conſideration, the Diurnall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and indefatigable paines of the Parliament for the ſecurity of this Kingdome, notwithſtanding your Majeſties long abſence from them, doe conceive it to bee no leſſe heart-bleeding griefe unto all your loving Subjects, then a great diſcouragement unto your Parliament. For while they are wraſtling with the great diſturbances, and diſtractions of this Kingdom, they are oppoſed by new, &amp; ſtrang ſuſpitions: while they are breaking the Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atrice egge, Wherein the envie of a malignant partie is hatching, in the meane time a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Serpent of growing jealouſie doth ariſe: while they are curing the corrupted wounds of the body with the medicable balſome of the Lawes, the Head ſeemes to bee diſtempered. And whereas your Petitioners underſtanding, that your Majeſties continuance at <hi>York,</hi> will be both diſadvantageous to your owne Royall perſon and preiuditiall to the Epidemicall welfare of this whole Kingdome, and that your Majeſties intention to take <hi>Hull,</hi> would not have beene more ſecure, then to have taken <hi>Whit hall,</hi> and that your Majeſties ſuppoſed reſolution to take Armes againſt the Parliament (which ſtrooke amazement it ſelfe amaz'd) was ſo derogatory from the heart of a Prince, and ſo oppoſite to the Lawes of the Land, that (your Petitioners muſt impartially confeſſe) that they could ſearce entertaine any ſuch ſuſpition in their mindes, having greater confidence in you their Soveraigne, and in your Majeſties more ſollicitous care for the publique peace and welfare of your Kingdomes, which by the Law of God, and man you are to maintaine; In the revolution of all which premiſſes your Petitioners hearts have beene deepely wounded with pationate griefe, and the ambiguous feare of imminent danger; Wherefore your Petitioners ſeriouſly conſidering the manifold dangers inpendent to this Kingdome, and all flowing from one generall fountaine in your Majeſties abſence, doe with all ſubmiſſion of heart, and ardency of affection, humbly beſeech your Sacred Majeſty grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to vouchſafe to returne to your Parliament, to the accompliſhment of the future peace, and ſafety of the Kingdome, wherein your Petitioners doe acknowledge themſelves, and their Poſteritie to be involved. And withall your Petitioners doe obſequiouſly implore your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie to concurre, and comply with your Parliament, and correſpond with them in all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations by the bleſſed connection of love, that ſo both all feares, and ſuſpitions, all griefes, and moleſtation, which hath long poyſoned their hearts in your abſence, may be forthwith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled with the happie Antidote of you Royall preſence.</p>
            <p>In humble ſupplication to your Majeſtie, we likewiſe deſire that you would gratiouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to the diſpoſall of the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdome, as the Parliament have already ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly ordered and appointed: That ſo we may be Armed in preparation to mitigate any domeſticke Inſurrection or Mutany, and able to withſtand the oppoſitions of any foraigne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy whatſoever: That your Maieſtie would not altogether forget the bloody continuance of the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and their ſtill perſecution of the Britiſh Nation, but that greater ayde and aſſiſtance may be ſpeedily ſent; And that the fountaine of Religion may flow in a more ſanctified, and purer current, to the abſolute extirpation of Popery and Superſtition, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall faction, and Schiſme, and to the pious reformation of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> But moſt eſpecially, what the <hi>Alpha,</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of our Prayers intimates, is, That your Majeſtie would be gratiouſly pleaſed to returne ſuddenly to the Parliament, and bee conioyned to them in a reciprocall, and coherent unity, and then the perfection of our wiſhes ſhall bee conſummated, while your Petitioners will maintaine and ſecure your ſacred Majeſtie from any unjuſt injurie to the utmoſt of their lives, fortunes, eſtates, and liberties.</p>
