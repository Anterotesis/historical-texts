         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>His Majeſties Declaration to the Miniſters, Freeholders, Farmers, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall Copy-holders of the County of <hi>York:</hi> Aſſembled by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties ſpeciall Summons at <hi>Heworth-Moor,</hi> neer the City of <hi>York,</hi> on Friday the 3. of <hi>June.</hi> 1642.</head>
            <p>VVE would have you to be aſſured that we never intended the leaſt neglect unto you in any former Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of the Country, Our love, as well as Our protection, extending to all Our Subjects, But as you are a great Body, time and conveniency must be obſerved in your Aſſembling.</p>
            <p>That you may know the generall Reaſons of Our being here, you muſt understand, That when We found it neither ſafe, nor honourable, to expoſe Our Perſon to the tumultuous and licentious proceedings of many (which to this day are unpuniſhed) who did diſorderly approach neer Our Court at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> We truſted this part of Our Dominions chiefly to reſide in; whereas moſt of the Gentry already have, ſo We aſſure Our ſelves the reſt of you will give Us cleer teſtimony of your ſervice and obedience, which we will never uſe otherwiſe then for the defence of the true Orthodox Religion profeſſed and ſetled in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, and confirmed by the Authority of the Statutes of this Realm, the defence of the Laws and Fundamentall Conſtitutions of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (as the juſteſt Meaſure and Rule for Our Prerogative, and your Liberties and Rights;) and laſtly, for the preſervation of the Peace of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>As for Our own Zeal to the Proteſtant profeſſion, We refer all the world to Our daily exerciſe of, and Our Declarations concerning it, and execution of the Laws againſt the Papiſts; ſo likewiſe We cannot but declare Our Self moſt heartily ſorry to finde ſuch Separatiſts and Schiſmaticks, who preſume againſt the Law, to foment new Doctrines and Diſciplines to the diſturbance of Church and State.</p>
            <p>For the Law, it being the common inheritance of Our people, we ſhall never inforce any Prerogative of Ours beyond it, but ſubmit Our Self to it, and give you, and all Our Subjects the fulleſt latitude of it, both for the liberty of your Perſons, and the propriety of your eſtates. And for the inviolable confidence and aſſurance hereof, as We take God (the Searcher of all hearts) to witneſſe Our reall intention herein, ſo We ſhall no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger deſire you to ſtand for the defence of Our Perſon, Honour, and juſt Prerogatives, then we ſhall maintain the Laws of the Land, the liberty of your perſons and the propriety of your Goods.</p>
            <p>And for the cleer underſtanding of Our Reſolutions to maintain Peace, we may have the confidence and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to refer (against all malignity whatſoever) to Our former Sixteen yeers Reign; (too long to diſſemble Our Nature) if in all this time We never cauſed the effuſion of one drop of bloud, it muſt needs be thought, that in Our riper judgement in Government, We ſhould never open ſuch Iſſues as might drown Us and Our Poſterity in them: But we are ſure to have no enemies, but in the defence of the true Proteſtant Profeſſion, the Right of the eſtabliſhed Laws, and for the preſervation of peace, and certainly all theſe muſt be all yours, as well as Our enemies.</p>
            <p>And to the end that this preſent Poſture wherein we meet, ſhould not affright you with the diſtempers of the times, the Example of the two Houſes having made Us prepare for a Guard to Us and Our Childrens Perſons, We wiſh you to look into the Compoſition and Conſtitution of it, and you will finde it ſo far from the face or fear of War, that it ſerves to ſecure you, as well as Us, from it: For Our Choice is of the prime Gentry, and of one Regiment of Our Trained Bands, which cannot be thought to oppreſſe the Countrey-(being their own) nor war with themſelves. And we further aſſure you, We never intended to uſe Forraigners or diſaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Religion: And that you may fully aſſure your ſelves of Our ſole dependancy upon the love and ſervice of Our own People, to live and die with them, We have armed theſe Our Subjects; which had been moſt irrationall, if we had ever intended to have uſed Strangers: And further, you may perceive that We receive none, but ſuch as ſtand cleer in Loyalty and Religion, for which reaſon We have cauſed the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy to be given them. Likewiſe, to prevent any diſtempers at home, We have, and ſhall put the Trained-Bands of all this Our Kingdom under the Command of Perſons of honour, confidence, and affection to their Country, ſtraitly charging, upon their Allegiance, no Officer to accept any command in them, nor Souldiers to obey any, ſave ſuch as are authorized by Us. And for the prevention of any innovated power over you, you ſhall have Us here to govern you, and the Souldiory to protect you in peace, and to relieve you againſt all oppreſſions; for that, as we have told you before, muſt ariſe from ſome great violation (which we hope God will prevent) and not from this preparation of our Subjects. Therefore let none of you be affrighted with vain fears; if ſuch a War ſhould follow, it follows the authors home to their own doors: And ſuch (by the confidence of Our Perſon with you) We aſſure Our Self you are not.</p>
            <p>Here We had left you to your fidelity and duty, had not ſome malicious inſolence in Our former meetings ſent forth moſt preſumptuous Summons, deceiving Our people, and preſuming upon Our Royall Authority; and theſe preſent themſelves as great Defenders or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, peace, and liberty; Whereas they become infectious, and contagious to the people, ſeducing them into vain fancies and deluſions, as may appear by their Warrants which we could trace to ſome pulpits, as We are credibly informed: And you ſee it were juſt in Us, to puniſh theſe as Authors of ſedition, but that it would be too great a favour, for it would honour them with the Title of Martyrdom, for Gods cauſe, as they vainly pretend: But you may now ſee from whence this Spirit comes, that would make Us to be in the Act of deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Religion, Our perſon a diſturber of the peace, and ready to introduce ſlavery. Theſe here are all the forraign Forces We have, or ever ſhall intend to have, to act theſe great deſignes, notwithſtanding the vain fears hitherto imagined. So that you ſee it is high time that theſe fancies were diſperſed and driven away, that We might be repaired in Honour and Intereſt, and you enjoy the bleſſing of peace and happineſſe; the advancement whereof ſhall be Our ſtudy and comfort: and therefore We ſhall (when you ſhall think it a convenient time) eaſe you in the number of the Trained-Bands: And for your Billet-money, it had been long ſince paid, but that no part of the Subſidies (which We paſſed for that purpoſe) came to Our hands, and We ſhall not be wanting in any thing that lyeth in Us, for the full ſatisfaction thereof: And ſhall make Our Grace and Bounty to you anſwerable to your beſt fidelity and loyalty, as occaſion ſhall be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Us.</p>
