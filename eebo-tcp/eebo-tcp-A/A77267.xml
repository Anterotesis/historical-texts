            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For what houre in all my life, ſince my firſt entrance into this life, wherein I have not in ſome manner or meaſure, nay above all meaſure, become a grievous tranſgreſſour? But there is

mercy with thee, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore art thou feared, mean time I of all others, have greateſt cauſe to feare for abuſing thy mercy. I have plentuouſly taſted of thy love; and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, I have many times reſolved to become a faithfull convert and zealous obſerver of thy Law. But theſe faire promiſes cloſed in a weake per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; No ſooner was there the leaſt opportunity offered me of ſinning, then it found in me an eaſie impreſsion.

the gates of death, leſt they ſhould receive me, thy grace prevented me.

               <p>YOung, and ſo very young I was when I firſt came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Idumaae;</hi> as my tender age required a <hi>Guardian</hi> to manage my youth. And divers good and gracious <hi>Conſorts</hi> there were, whom at the firſt I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into my acquaintance:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:135696:14"/>
And with theſe I lived for a little time familiarly: and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered my ſelfe much by their company: But alas for griefe, I continued not long with them; Other <hi>Companions</hi> drew me from them. Thoſe good and vertuous ones betooke themſelves, as I thought, to a courſe of life too ſtrict for my looſe affection to follow. I felt the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>youth</hi> ryoting within mee. Thoſe devout tasks, which before I obſerved; begun now to bee intermitted. I held a ſober regular life too eremiticall: private retired walkes too ſtoicall. I thought with myſelfe, how I had ſtaied too long in the <hi>Tyring-houſe,</hi> I muſt now ſhew my ſelfe upon the <hi>Stage;</hi> where I played the <hi>Prodigals part</hi> to life: for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed my whole <hi>life</hi> upon the action of that <hi>part:</hi> when I
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:135696:15"/>
ſaw a Thiefe, I followed him: and with the Adulterer I divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my portion. I beſtowed the <hi>day</hi> in variety of follies: and a great part of the <hi>Night</hi> in a delightfull remembrance of thoſe follies. Let us prepare our ſelves (ſaid one) for the ſpoile: and I had an hand as ready to further it, as hee to demand it. Let us drinke wine in bowles, and carouſe till our eyes be red; let the day care for it ſelfe, while the day of our life admits no care. Let us take our full of pleaſure, (ſaid the wanton) let our delight be in dalliance: and I followed the ſteps of the <hi>whoriſh woman;</hi> though her wayes led to death. And I delighted my ſelfe in the company of the Drunkard: yet had I read (and the more my ſinne not to reteine) To <hi>whom</hi> was <hi>woe; to whom ſorrow

               <p>TOo true have I found that Proverbe; <hi>Who can have a worſer friend then he brings with him?</hi> Foes I had without, Feares within: but my <hi>boſome friends</hi> I found ever to bee my <hi>buſieſt foes.</hi> And what leſſe could I expect, then that my <hi>boſome friends</hi> ſhould prove my deadlieſt Foes, being <hi>receivers</hi> and <hi>Abetters</hi> of my <hi>boſome ſins?</hi> O what diſorderly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions raged, nay raigned in me? what divided thoughts of <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>feare</hi> were ever encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring me? In my proſperity, feare of adverſity wrought upon me: in my adverſity, hope of proſperity ſeazed on mee.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:135696:16"/>
Neither did either of theſe <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> well content me: for, as thoughts of the one made mee proud; ſo a conceit of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made me impatient. Now, what hourely affronts did I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by my owne, while I ſtood thus purſued by them? I found nothing on earth worthy my deſire: yet were my crawling deſires ſo faſt glued to earth, as if they had no other Heaven to aſpire to. Naturall Philoſophy had ſufficiently taught mee in my minority, that betwixt <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi> and <hi>infinite</hi> there was no proportion: that my <hi>Soule</hi> was of too large a circumference, to be confin<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:135696:17"/>
Circle was to be filled. In this, my <hi>Speculation</hi> had inform'd me, but the <hi>uſe</hi> and <hi>application</hi> of it was farre from me. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it poſſible, that a Sconſe ſhould be ſecur'd from foes without, that harbour'd ſo many dangerous Traytors within. For my miſ-guided affections (like ſcattred troops falne off from their Captaine) committed all inſolencies. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing found they in me, which was not expoſed to their fury. Thus did my <hi>Familiars,</hi> and knowne Acquaintance worke upon my weakneſſe; take mee with their ſubtilties; and lead me captive to all miſeries. Yet for all this was I ſilent, pleaſing my ſelfe with the impunity of a delinquent. So I might ſinne ſafely, and flatter my ſelfe with a ſeeming ſecurity: and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to my ſelfe a long life foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly,

becauſe in it the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty; I could hugge my betrayer: And herein ſo farre was I from vindicating my wrong; as I accounted him my beſt friend, who had ſhewn himſelfe privately my malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou'ſt Foe. So farre was I (I ſay) from revenging my ſelfe of him, as I fought to ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate my ſelfe with him. For the injuries I ſuffer'd, I was either inſenſible of them, or I diſſembled them. I neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved him, nor ſhewed a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing count'nance towards him; though for many yeares together, Hee and his Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces had lived familiarly with me, ſit at my table, received meat from my hand, ſlept in my boſome, converſed with me when hee pleaſed, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of me as he liked.

               <p>I Am now to tell you how I enter'd Liſts; and how weak a Combatant I proved amidſt thoſe encounters wherewith I grappled. The <hi>Field</hi> where I pitched was the <hi>World.</hi> A place full of Snares, and ſuch as ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all Eſtates. I could not ſee that place, wherein I could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy true peace. That which in reaſon ſhould have beene my contempt, became my content. Thoſe <hi>May-buds</hi> of proſperity, honour and humane glory were ſcattered here and there to take mee; and no ſooner

               <p>That retired Cell, wherein I both enjoyed my ſelfe, and the contemplation of Him that made me, had now for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon beene eſtranged from mee.

Were it <hi>Honour</hi> that I ſought after, I found a way quickly to enjoy her, though the purchaſe made mee an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy gainer.

left me) yet other aged mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies grow ſtrong in me; againſt which I muſt prepare my ſelfe for the encounter, or I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for ever. Would you heare what my diſtempers are? They are theſe: Though few bee my houres; hoary my haires: yet am I as numerous in my worldly cares, as if I were but even now entring into the world. I cannot without an envious eye ſee my Neighbours field flouriſh; others proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity gives me occaſion of repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: others adverſity grounds of rejoycing. Honour I would have, yet can I hardly <hi>ſupport</hi> my ſelfe, much leſſe that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor which is conferred on me</p>
               <p>Alas, poore mouldred earth! Now, when I carry about me, ſuch conſtant Companions of my mortality! when Aches, Cramps, and Coughes are my

Now, when <hi>Death</hi> waits at the Wicket, and bids me come away, and leave the world, ſeeing it is weary of me: and fit me for my ſhrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſheet, being all that is left me; yet have I a moneths mind to be greater, or richer, or more eminent in the eye of the World, as if I could diſpenſe with age, or make a truce with death.</p>
               <p>Thus am I encountred with new temptations: Night and day am I beleagred: nor can I find any reſt; ſo fierce and furious is this Combatant my <hi>Fleſh.</hi> O how juſtly then may I complaine of this my houſhold enemy! And how may I eſcape her ſubtilty!

And with her <hi>left eye</hi> ſhee darted <hi>adverſity</hi> at mee, and ſo made me murmure againſt him that made me. O how I feele my ſelfe now failing and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to earth; yet how are my thoughts ſo glued to earth, as if they had no other place to thinke on!

               <p>O Thou envious one, was it not ſufficient for thee to loſe thy ſelfe by thy <hi>Pride:</hi> but like a cruell cunning <hi>Nimrod,</hi> haunt day and night after inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood. Thou art for ever loſt, and thou wouldſt have my poore ſoule in the ſame ſtate. And to bring thy purpoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, thou haſt practiſed with people of my owne family, to betray my <hi>Fort</hi> unto the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Thou haſt winnowed me: and as thou found mee affected, thou wrought upon me. Thou had <hi>baites</hi> in ſtore for every ſoule, to take him napping in his Darling ſinne.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:135696:25"/>
If thou foundſt him labor of that <hi>birth</hi> wherein thou periſhed, thou couldſt ſuggeſt to him thoughts of his owne abilities; bring him to a disdaine of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Tell him, the State did not take ſufficient notice of his worth. Adviſe him to hold an higher opinion of himſelfe: and by contemning others, to raiſe his owne eſtimate. But whereto ayme all theſe trains? to undoe him; for, being fed with theſe conceits, he begins to aſpire to places of honour: wherein being croſſed of his hopes, he fals into diſcontent, which clozeth the unhappy Scene of his life in miſery and contempt. Or deprived of what hee once enjoyed, and to an unexpected thraldome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, with the heavy memory of his former felicity, and preſent miſery, hee either lives
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:135696:26"/>
deſperately encountred with thoſe affrighting thoughts of danger, or takes his leave at once both of life and honour.</p>
               <p>Againe, if thou foundſt him <hi>Covetous,</hi> thou hadſt <hi>Achans</hi> wedge, and <hi>Gehaza's</hi> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in readineſſe for him: Hee ſhall have his <hi>deſires</hi> and a <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie</hi> to boot. If <hi>riotous,</hi> the <hi>Rich-mans</hi> table could not bee better furniſhed, his delicious and liquoriſh appetite muſt bee ſatisfied: nothing wanting that may tend to ſurfetting, but with thoſe <hi>Rioters</hi> before the <hi>Flood,</hi> hee little knowes how neare hee is periſhing. If <hi>laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civious,</hi> his fleſh muſt want no provocation, to bring this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded Minion to deſtruction. Fancies by night, and more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Objects by day, are ſent forth to ſeaze on his heart, and make him forgetfull of God.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:135696:26"/>
If <hi>Paſſionate,</hi> hee ſhall find mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives enough to inrage him; nothing hee ſees can content him. Fury is in his eyes, and revenge in his heart. Many waters cannot quench this heat: for hee aymes at nothing but death. If <hi>Envious,</hi> others ſucceſſe finds him matter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to worke on. It is hard to ſay, whether his own gaine or others loſſe pleaſe him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Thoſe walkes in faire flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing fields which are made to recreate others, are juſtly made to macerate himſelfe. For to ſee his Neighbours ground proſper, begets in him a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper. If <hi>ſloathfull,</hi> the Summer-beames, though they ſhine never ſo gloriouſly upon him, muſt not rouze him: there is an <hi>Adder</hi> in the way: <hi>yet a little, and then a little,</hi> makes him forget his <hi>poverty.</hi> If Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

               <p>Thus thou profeſt Enemy of man-kind, aſſaultſt him: and, according to every occaſion, prepareſt thy temptation. And of all others, I poore Pilgrim, became in theſe moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For well knew thy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty my weakneſſe and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

I invited them to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journe with me. Neither did this <hi>Concupiſcence</hi> want woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing termes to winne me, who was wonne already; nor to plead to me what intereſt ſhee had in mee: ſeeing ſhee was conceived and borne with me; and from the very firſt time I came into the world, conſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with me.

Doe not then ſo eſtrange thy ſelfe from mee, nor refuſe her familiarity who can ſo fully delight thee. Looke upon mee, and ſee if there bee nothing in me, that may pleaſe thee! nay, looke every where about thee, and ſee if ought could content thee, if I were abſent from thee! As thou art the <hi>Fleſhes Gueſt,</hi> ſo am I the <hi>Fleſhes Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi> Shee, with whom thou dwelleſt, under whoſe roofe thou ſojourneſt; would hold this <hi>World</hi> a <hi>Wilderneſſe:</hi> and every <hi>Creature</hi> in it, as a <hi>Peli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> of the <hi>Deſart,</hi> were not I to cheere her while ſhe lives in it. Doe not then leave mee, ſeeing thou canſt not live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me. I have variety of pleaſures to refreſh thee, leſt the enjoyment of one ſhould cloy thee. I have freſh fragrant Gardens for thee to

walke in; faire goodly Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for thee to plant in; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſights to delight thine eye; ſweet ayres to pleaſe thine eare; odoriferous ſoots to cheer thy ſmell; dainty cates to feed thy taſte; choice embraces to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thy touch.

And what doe I, poor <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> but deprive my ſelfe of all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, by giving way to your concupiſcence? I have lived in many places, and converſed with men of all conditions: and I found in perſons of every quality, a naturall proneneſſe unto vanity: but examining whence the grounds of thoſe vanities came, I found them proceeding from you; from you, thoſe in-lets to all diſ-obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. For were not you the cauſe; thoſe who are now proud, contemning others, and magnifying themſelves above the condition of earth, from whence they came, would learne humility. Thoſe, who are now covetous, thinking that the earth has not enough to fill their mouthes, would be contented. Thoſe who now give way to wrath, would put
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:135696:33"/>
on the ſpirit of meekeneſſe, and learne to bee patient. Thoſe, who are now eaten up with envy, by wiſhing to others as to themſelves, would be chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably diſpoſed.

Oh ſigh and groane poore unhappy <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> take thy ſelfe now into the ballance; weigh and examine thy ſelfe. Let not one houre paſſe over thee without a ſigh; not a minute without a ſob.

Hee who commanded thee that theſe things ſhould bee done, will doe for thee what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hee hath commanded to be done. But this, poore Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim, thou knewſt long ſince.

but mov'd him to compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate thy infirmities.

He ha's told thee how he was <hi>thy Lord, thy God:</hi> and that thou ſhouldeſt have <hi>no other Gods but Him.</hi> Now lye thine hand on thine heart, and tell mee, Haſt thou performed this? yes, wilt thou ſay, I was never ſo Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh as to worſhip any Gods of the Gentiles. It was his houſe I went unto: His
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:135696:43"/>
Name I did honour to. I joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Supplication of Saints; I went after no <hi>ſtrange Gods:</hi> It was the <hi>Lord of Hoaſts</hi> whom I ſerved: The <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>whole Earth</hi> whom I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured: yet, tell me, were there no other <hi>Lords on Earth</hi> whom thou ſerved? yea, didſt thou not make the very <hi>Earth,</hi> thy <hi>Lord,</hi> in preferring it before Heaven, and the hopes of a better life? Whatſoever is by us, moſt loved; that for a God is by us worſhipped. Now, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve mee, unhappy Pilgrim, wherein can more love bee ſhowne then in weakning and enfeebling our ſpirits with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of what we love? Now, compare thy houres which thou haſt beſtowed on the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>Mammon;</hi> with thoſe thou haſt more happily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Courts of <hi>Sion!</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:135696:44"/>
Haſt thou not beſtowed ten houres on Earth, for one on Heaven? Nay, haſt thou not depended more upon thoſe <hi>Egyptian reedes,</hi> theſe <hi>Helps</hi> on <hi>Earth,</hi> then thoſe <hi>Hopes</hi> of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?</hi> Though thou wentſt to the Lords houſe: and with a ſeeming humility caſt thy ſelfe down before him.

For long before hadſt thou built a <hi>little Bethel</hi> in thine heart: where thou offered thy daily ſacrifice. And here didſt thou erect a Shrine of Gold for thy God. Earth was thy Deity: thus in the Chamber of thine Heart
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:135696:44"/>
didſt thou commit Idolatry. For hadſt thou taken him whom thou profeſſedſt to ſerve for thy God, thou wouldſt not have diſtruſted his providence, but with an holy and heavenly affiance relied on his promiſes. Nay, hadſt thou taken him for thy God, thou wouldeſt have ſerved him as he commanded thee: and with all thine heart loved him, as he well deſerved from thee. Thou wouldeſt not have ſuffer'd his <hi>Members</hi> to have ſtarv'd while thou ſurfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: nor his <hi>Family of faith</hi> to have mourned while thou ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oted. Thou wouldeſt have had the <hi>ſtaffe</hi> of <hi>bread</hi> in readineſſe to ſupport them, counſell in ſtore to adviſe them: all fitting ſupplies in the time of their neceſſity, to relieve them.

                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:135696:45"/>
with a deafe eare couldſt thou heare their grones: with a pittileſſe Eye behold their teares. Nay, ſo farre were't thou from taking him for thy God, as thou fled to other Gods: chuſing rather to loſe God by abuſing his goodneſſe, then to loſe any of thy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. The Wizard and the Southſayer muſt be viſited by thee: the Witch of <hi>Endor</hi> muſt not loſe her honour. Tell me, is this to put thy truſt in God? Is this to have no other Gods before him? Is this the way to eſpouſe thy ſelfe unto him? Is this in a true and religious way of obedience to ſerve him? No; No; thou canſt not ſerve <hi>two Maſters: God</hi> and <hi>Belial.</hi> Thou muſt put off the <hi>Old man,</hi> before thou put on the <hi>New.</hi> Thou muſt leave thoſe <hi>Groves</hi> and <hi>High-places,</hi> and in the

And I underſtood how there was nothing to be compared

With what pious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequies I ſolemniz'd her Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls; whom I once enjoyed: with what purpoſes I enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to remaine a conſtant Widdower, after ſuch time as I was deprived of her. Yet, though ripeneſſe of yeares had nipped in mee the bloſſoms of of youth: nay, though age had writ deepe furrows in my brow, yet found I youth enough in my doating fancy. For I am aſhamed to thinke with what an unbeſeeming lightneſſe I encountered a ſtrange face. How ſoone I could gather by the wandring motion of her eye, the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her heart.

Where I found <hi>revenge</hi> playing her part, crying, <hi>No peace, no peace.</hi> And I became one of her Followers.

               <p>VVHat a dangerous thing the <hi>Memory</hi> is, when made a <hi>Reteiner</hi> of injuries! This cauſed that noble Heathen to deſire rather how to learne the art of <hi>forgetfulneſſe</hi> then the art of <hi>Memory;</hi> becauſe hee remembred more things (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>offences</hi> done him) which hee deſired to forget, then ever hee forgot what hee deſired to remember. This very caſe is mine: I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, but not comparably to what I have made others ſuffer. I held the <hi>offences</hi> done me ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable, as they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the power of fleſh and blood to beare.

death I pretended eaſie to ſuch an injury.

offence done by the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt enemy, that may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to thoſe which wee daily doe to his divine Majeſty? O no! How is it then?

               <p>THis Leſſon was taught me by my Saviour, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others hee ſuffered for mee the worſt of all others. When the feares of death en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed him; when nothing but ſorrow and heavineſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him; even then, when his Perſecutors deſerved leaſt, ſhewed he his charity moſt. <hi>Father forgive them, for they know not what they doe.</hi> Thus did hee excuſe them from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, imputing all they did unto ignorance: ſo full of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was hee, even in his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt anguiſh.

               </p>
               <p>Another I found taken with his owne <hi>beauty;</hi> who tooke ſuch content in looking upon himſelfe, as hee had not one looke to beſtow upon his needy Brother. Another was ſo <hi>rich,</hi> and ſo devoted to that worldly Idol, as it was death to him to afford one crumme of comfort to relieve him that was diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:135696:88"/>

               <p>IT is wonderful thou ſhouldſt not remember thy poore <hi>thirſty</hi> Brother with one cup of cold water, when thy cup flowes over ſo plentuouſly, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of Gods bounty in ſo ample a meaſure. Thy cuſtome has beene to riſe early in the morning, and to gather thy Companions together, and to drinke till your eyes grew red, and to put away farre from you the evill day in jollity and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Meane time, thoſe very <hi>Snuffes</hi> which your exceſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, would have beene ſweet drops to many poore <hi>thirsty</hi> ſoules, who for want of drinke have fainted. O but I can gheſſe why thou, who thus rioteſt in thy delights, decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thine health with healths; art
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:135696:91"/>
ſo forgetfull of thy <hi>thirsty</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Deep drinkers are ever of the ſhalloweſt memories. But I muſt tell thee, that a day will come (and fearefull will be that day) when, howſoever thou now with full cups and looſe company removeſt theſe things far from thy memory: all theſe neglects, uncharitable neglects, ſhall be preſented before thee. Then thou wilt find none with a light ſong to ſpend a ſerious houre. Sulphur and brimſtone will be then an unſavory po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And yet this muſt be thy portion: becauſe thou abuſed the good creatures of God; in beſtowing them on wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that might have miniſtred reliefe to others neceſſities.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Gracious Saviour, thou who in thine extreme</hi> thirſt, <hi>hadſt no better drinke given thee then</hi> Gall <hi>and</hi> Vinegar, <hi>which

when thou hadſt tasted, thou wouldſt not drinke, perceiving the malice of the Iewes to be ſuch, as it raged even to thine end. Give me grace to remember the ſtate of my</hi> thirſty <hi>Brother.

               <p>THe Pilgrims Harbour, is a Chriſtians Honour. Mild <hi>Moſes,</hi> loving <hi>Lot,</hi> faithfull <hi>Abraham</hi> were excellent pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes of this duty. Some of theſe received <hi>Angels</hi> in the habit of <hi>Strangers.</hi> That chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table widdow would have a bed-ſtead for a Prophet. This
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:135696:92"/>
I know well thou approveſt, for even thy ſelfe art here a <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim</hi> upon earth: ſojourning up and downe in this vale of miſery; wholly <hi>harbourleſſe,</hi> unleſſe ſome take pitty of thee. For the very beſt that lives here upon earth, has only a place of <hi>ſojourning,</hi> no place of <hi>abiding.</hi> Wee come unto our Inne, and the next morning we are gone. But let mee returne to thee; and now in good ſadneſſe tell mee, haſt thou to thy power performed this Office of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Haſt thou received ſuch poore <hi>harbourleſſe</hi> Gueſts as came unto thee? Hadſt thou a lodging for them, in the time of neceſſity? Took'ſt thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to conferre with them; to miniſter what was needfull unto them? was their ſight deare unto thee, and that for his ſake who made both them and thee? O no! me thinkes
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:135696:93"/>
thou hangs downe thine head, as one who acknowledg'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe guilty. Thou canſt not find one of this ſort, to whom thou haſt ſhewne this <hi>Worke</hi> of <hi>Mercy.</hi> Others indeed, there are, to whom thou haſt given free hoſpitality; entertaining them cheerfully: and inlarging thy boſome unto them in all offices of court'ſie. But theſe were none of Chriſts poore ones; Theſe were none of his little ones. Theſe were none that ſtood in need of any ſuch favour. Theſe, if their hearts would have ſerv'd them, might as well as thy ſelfe have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med theſe good offices: and with a liberall hand ſupplyed others neceſſities. And was this to <hi>harbour the harbourleſſe?</hi> Chriſt himſelfe was an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple unto thee of great poverty: for whereas the <hi>Birds</hi> of the

               </p>
               <p>Now thinke with thy ſelfe how memorable that worke of <hi>Magdalen</hi> was, in pouring her boxe of precious oyntment upon his head; how commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable that devout office of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> was, in beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the body of our bleſſed Saviour; in embalming it, and beſtowing it in a new Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre; what an happy occaſion little <hi>Zacheus</hi> had, in receiving him and giving him <hi>harbour.</hi> And if theſe were ſuch good and acceptable Offices to the <hi>Head,</hi> they cannot chuſe but have their reward, being with a ſingle and ſincere heart done to his Members.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Deare Saviour, may it be mine honour to be hoſpitable to my

Whereas now they are made to let in cold, and to keepe out heat. O I muſt tell thee, delicate Pilgrim, that from top to toe if thou meet thy poor Brother deſtitute or unprovided, and thou haſt in ſtore to ſupply him, and yet doeſt deny him, thou art a falſe Brother in defeating him of what is due unto him. For that very Garment which thou ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereſt to Moath-eate in thy Cheſt; thoſe very ſhooes which thou ſuffereſt to rot; are none of thine, but the ſhooes and Garment of thy poor Brother:

yet rather then thou wilt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him what is due unto him, thou canſt bee well contented that they both rot together.</p>

to picke a new quarrell at him: while the remitting of one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the admitting of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: yea, where a wrong is threatned and not revenged, it emboldneth the Actor to ſee it executed.

But evill Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell is worſt for the Counſellor; this I find too true to my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort.

next lodging to mee, that I might enjoy the benefit of their Company more freely.</p>
               <p>But having now broke off my diſcourſe with that Gueſt of mine; a man wholly made of earth; and looking aſide, I might perceive a freſh youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Conſort entring the room, where wee converſed. By his habit, gate and faſhion, I could ſcarcely diſtinguiſh him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee were man or woman. So ſtrangely effeminate, and to light diſcourſes ſo affected, as hee breathed nothing but amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Songs and Sonnets; looſe love was the line by which hee directed the whole courſe of his life. His boſome was farced full of amorous Knights ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures: His morning Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures were <hi>Boccace</hi> and <hi>Alcae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us:</hi> His evening Anthems were <hi>Arioſto</hi> and <hi>Reginus.</hi> For
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:135696:122"/>
his perſon, he was of a promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing conſtitution, but of pale complexion: a quick piercing eye; a nimble perſwaſive tongue: and of ſuch a wooing winning action, as no expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on came from him which would not enforce affection. I muſt confeſſe, I no ſooner ſaw him, then I found a glowing heat within mee towards him: yea, I begunne mee thought, to conceive better of him, then either of the two with whom I had before converſed; ſo full of delightfull variety was his diſcourſe; ſo melodious his voyce; ſo affectionately mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and compleate in every part. I deſired much to know his deſcent and Countrey: and hee reſolved mee readily; that his firſt plantation was neere to the banks of that famous Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Sybaris:</hi> where he erected
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:135696:123"/>
a Schoole for love: afterwards richly endowed by ſuch emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent proficients as had beene Schollers in it: but deſiring much to ſee forraine Countries, not onely to improve his own knowledge, but obſerve her commands to whoſe ſervice he ſtood obliged; Hee coaſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long by <hi>Paphos,</hi> where his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Soveraigneſſe of every loyall Lover, then kept Court: And from thence with merry gale hee came to <hi>Cyprus:</hi> and ſome few moneths after to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned <hi>Latium.</hi> Where hee found ſuch entertainment, as neither care nor coſt were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wanting to procure his liking. I importun'd him much to heare ſome of thoſe Leſſons which he had formerly taught? and wherein I deſired much to become his Scholler: but ſmall importunity needed, ſeeing his
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:135696:123"/>
owne deſires were thereto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected: ſo as, taking me apart from the reſt of the Company, hee imparted to mee ſuch dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as nothing became more pleaſing to me then the embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of folly. Wanton Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, light amorous Poems; looſe licentious meetings; luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Feaſtings ſeazed ſo ſtrongly on my deluded fancy; as <hi>love</hi> became both my <hi>Ditty</hi> and <hi>Deity.</hi> For hee adviſed me to walke by the twi-light; and and to engage mine honour to an Harlot. Thus was I drawn by the cords of vanity; made a ſlave to ſinne; an enemy to my owne ſoule; and in the end a by word to the people.</p>

               <p>HAving thus freely enjoyed the conference of theſe three Gueſts; in whoſe fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity I took much content.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:135696:125"/>
to meet with one, but the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming'ſt one of all my Gueſts, for his complexion ſeem'd ſo withered and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed: his body ſo meagre and macilent; as he appeared rather like ſome <hi>Anatomy</hi> then any living Creature. This poor marrow-eaten Wretch I found ſighing and making a pittifull mone, as if ſome hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy miſ-chance had befalne him: but inquiring the reaſon of his ſorrowing, he told mee that the occaſion of his griefe proceeded not from any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happe falling to himſelfe; but for the happineſſe he perceived many others lived in. For to ſee anothers field flouriſh; or his goods to increaſe and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; was ſuch an eye-ſore unto him, as nothing could more diſtemper him. This I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be a baſe condition,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:135696:125"/>
and ſuch as to humanity had very ſmall relation. So as, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to quit my houſe of him; and give him his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port: finding nothing in him but an harſh unſociable hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; rejoycing in nothing more then the ruine of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet deſiring to ſift him a little further, and to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, to make tryall of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; I took firſt, occaſion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of him of what Parents hee deſcended; and in what Coaſt he firſt planted? and he told mee, that <hi>Iewry</hi> was his native Countrey; and his <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Iewes;</hi> with whom he long time remained neare to the Lake <hi>Aſphaltos.</hi> I asked of him what content he could take in the World, when nothing but the evill ſucceſſe of others pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him any object of joy in the world? And he anſwer'd
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:135696:126"/>
mee, if I knew what ſtrange content the <hi>Envious</hi> man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended from others miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, I would preferre that humour before any perſonall honour: for, ſaid hee, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſtands ſo affected, hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not want variety of Subjects to miniſter to him that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent which he deſired. I muſt, indeed, confeſſe, quoth he, that I am of neceſſity now &amp; then to encounter with ſome argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of diſcontent; as I did this very Morning in ſeeing your Neighbours Paſtures ſo fruitfull; their harveſt ſo hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: but for one of theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, I ſhall find an hundred occaſions of content. No place is exempted from mee: no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon excepted from playing one part or other in this enterlude of folly. O how it joyes mee to ſee a proud ambitious ſpirit

entring liſts with his Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titor: where the one muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily fall to advance the other? Honour was their bait, and it proves their baine.

               <p>NO ſooner had I diſmiſt this ſtarveling; then I encountred another cleare of another temper: plumpe he was and well-liking; one who cared not much what <hi>arrow</hi> of Gods judgment were ſhot, ſo <hi>famine</hi> were left out. He told mee, he had beene a profeſſor of Philoſophy in the Epicures
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:135696:128"/>
Academy. How he was by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a <hi>Sidonian,</hi> and deſcended from the <hi>Vitellian</hi> family. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, in the manner of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, he diſcovered no great arguments of a Scholler; being of a dull and clodded fancy: and of apprehenſion ſlow and heavy. His providence meerly conſiſted in purveyance for the belly. Wherein hee obſerved ſuch delicacie; as hee ſcorned much to ſit at that Table which was not ſtored with all Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I told him Strangers were not to be ſo curious; but rather contented with whaſoever was for the preſent provided. Wherewith ſeeming a little moved; Sir, ſaid he, I am nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo wanting in friends nor fortunes, as I need rely upon reverſions. I have thus long lived and fed deliciouſly, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my Bellie my Deitie. And
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:135696:128"/>
if you knew what delight there were in a luſcious Tooth, and what pleaſure in full Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes; what ſtrength they afford to nature: and how they infuſe into the Bloud a freſh revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving vigour, I am perſwaded you would preferre this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light before any other plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>Sir, anſwer'd I, take me not up ſo ſhortly; I was never yet knowne ſuch a niggard; as for ſparing a little traſh to ſtarve my Belly. Others through their miſery may ſtand indebted to it, but for my part I will rather chooſe to abridge mine <hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie,</hi> then be ſo taxed by it.</p>
               <p>But by your favour I muſt tell you what I have heard; that <hi>Surfets</hi> kill more then the <hi>Sword.</hi> How he who makes a God of his Bellie, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fets in the delight of ſuch a
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:135696:129"/>
daintie Deitie. And I have ſometimes read <hi>Leſſius</hi> his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe in Phyſick. How, when Nature grew ſo weake in him, as there was no hope of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering him: and that his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians had left him: yet by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing himſelfe a ſtrict Diet, and by duely obſerving what he had preſcribed; he even in his declining age became youthfull; in his recreations freſh and cheerfull: and even to his death ſtrong and health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p>And yet he for all this died (ſaid my delicious Gueſt) and tell me then what did his rules of Phyſick, availe him? Go to, Sir, he that lives Phyſically, lives miſerably; let us cramme and feed our ſelves fat while wee live; ſatisfy our deſires in what wee love. So long as wee live in the World, let us enjoy
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:135696:129"/>
with all freedom, the pleaſures of the World. Abſtinence ſuites better with an hermitage then a Pallace.</p>
               <p>Take ſo much paines one day as goe into a Monaſterie; and what will you find there, but, as <hi>Climacus</hi> obſerveth, <hi>Breathing Coarſes?</hi> their ſpirits waſted; their radicall moiſture with their Lampe-oyle conſu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med; nothing left to preſent the reſemblance of men, ſave only bare Sceletons, or fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Images of men; and theſe ſo uſeleſſe for Earth, as their ſole devotions and deſignes are for Heaven. But leaving theſe, if you pleaſe but to take a turne or two in our Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall Cloiſters: you ſhall find Creatures of a freſh and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing vigour; of a ſtrong and ſinnowy temper: and ſuch as promiſe a numerous ſupply to

               <p>This diſcourſe came with ſuch confidence from him, as I had no mind to interrupt him.

               <p>THe very next I took occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to talke withall, was the moſt braving and imperious Gueſt that ever any one gave harbour to. For during thoſe few dayes wherein hee had ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed with mee, he begunne
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:135696:131"/>
to keepe ſuch a quarter, as if the whole houſe had beene at his command. Not a ſervant but ſhak't and ſhudder'd when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hee came in preſence. So teechie and froward was his humour, that all things ſeemed in his judgement out of order. Thus did my whole family ſuffer through his fury. So as indeed, I had a great deſire to quit my houſe of him: for daily did mine eares glow with complaints againſt him. No ſervant would ſtay with mee ſo long as hee remained with mee. All things grew out of joynt; all things out of ſquare. And now having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to put in ſpeedy execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion what I had intended; I tooke the opportunity to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with my mind. But when I had told him, how my whole family grew weary of
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:135696:131"/>
him: and that I might of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity keepe my houſe alone, if I rid not my doores of him: Hee fell into ſuch a furious paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as I feared much he would have offered ſome violence to mee: but as good fortune was, his fury reſolv'd it ſelfe into words: which were delivered in that braving and domineer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner; as mee thought I begunne to take affection to that humour. For he told me, and that in ſuch a ſcornefull way, as not a word came from him but it breathed contempt, or threatned a miſchiefe, that if I thought hee was beholden to me for my entertainment, I was much deceived: for he held my entertainment ſo unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of him, as I might hold my ſelfe ſufficiently contented that hee would accept of it. But Sir, ſaid hee I muſt tell you,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:135696:132"/>
I cannot chuſe but ſmile at your folly; to ſee you thus over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aw'd and baffall'd by your own family. Your indiſcreet pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if you quicken not your temper, will ere it bee long, make you a Servant of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: and by their malepert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe bring your command in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a bondage.</p>
               <p>Your Neighbours too, they obſerve the quietneſſe of your diſpoſition; and they play up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your eaſineſſe. For ſhame, be of ſharper mettall. Make your Servants tremble when they heare you: and enforce that commanding awe to your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours, that as if they heard thunder, they may <hi>bleſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> when they come neare you. Impunity opens a paſſage to all impiety; if any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended or committed to your charge ſhall but lightly offend;
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:135696:132"/>
yet you muſt not be too indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in rendring a pardon. I hold it farre better, and for your ſtate or condition fitter, never to debate the cauſe with mildneſſe, for that taſteth of too much ſoftneſſe, but to <hi>ſtrike</hi> before you <hi>ſpeake;</hi> to ſeaſon your reproofe with correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which will beget in you a reverence, and in them more ſubjection. This that Roman <hi>Vedius</hi> could doe bravely; and in ſuch an imperious ſort exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his Soveraignty: as his very becke was a word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to all his family. And this while I was in <hi>Thebes</hi> (for I am a Theban borne) did I conſtantly practiſe; and that not onely over ſuch as I might command: but over ſuch too, whoſe ſpirits I found ſo ready to vaile to one of my quality; as I made them no leſſe ſubject
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:135696:133"/>
to my uncontrouled will, then if they had beene of my owne family. For during my reſide in that famous City, none but I raiſed that fearefull fraternall emnity betwixt <hi>Eteocles</hi> and <hi>Polynices:</hi> which unnaturall conteſt (ſo ſtrongly had my fury wrought upon their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits) could receive no end, but in one anothers blood. Neither was it my humour to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined: for I had dreamed a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before my departure thence, how with unfortunate <hi>Hecuba,</hi> I was conceived with a <hi>fire-brand,</hi> and that it could not bee quenched but in the blood of many nations. Neither did that ominous Dreame of mine prove falſe: for though with <hi>Caſſandra's</hi> propheſie, it would not be believed, the fatall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters of many flouriſhing E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates have before this time
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:135696:133"/>
confirm'd it. For to omit the ſubverſion of many ancient Empires; whoſe memory now ſleepes in duſt, I appeale even to your ſelfe, by whoſe meanes thoſe ruines were occaſioned, and that lately amongſt our <hi>Free States?</hi> By whoſe agency thoſe fearefull and fatall diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſprung up in <hi>Calidore:</hi> where <hi>Religion</hi> made the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,</hi> but <hi>innovation</hi> of <hi>govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> plotted the <hi>ground.</hi> And who became the manager of thoſe diſloyall attempts but my ſelfe? If then your deſire bee, to be one of note or fame in the world; obſerve my directions, admit of no reconciled foe into the liſt of your diſcourſe. And if at any time you have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an injury, be it publike or private: if hee be your <hi>inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> or ſubject to your power, ſqueaze him: nippe him I
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:135696:134"/>
ſay, ſo ith'head, as you may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent him of all future hope of riſing: but if he be your Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, and you not able to vye with him in power, over-vye him in policy; faune on him; yet ſtill carry a ſtone in your boſome; watch ſome oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity wherein you may ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize him: but bee ſure when you once have him in your clawes, to cruſh him. What matter makes it, though the jeering <hi>Lyricke</hi> call anger a <hi>ſhort madneſſe;</hi> hee is in my opinion moſt mad, that is leaſt angry: for a mild Maſter cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts a family. Now, I would have you to skrue your paſſion to an higher pin. Anger is of too ſhort continuance, it is not for your honour: give harbour then to <hi>Wrath,</hi> for that is an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate anger.</hi> This will make you ſo terrible to your foes; as
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:135696:134"/>
you ſhall eaſily worke your owne ends, by thriving there beſt, where you are feared moſt.</p>
               <p>This Diſcourſe, though at firſt it diſtaſted mee; for how could it ſound well in the care of reaſon, to heare one breake forth into the immerited praiſe of an immoderate paſſion? yet the conceit of revenge wrought ſo ſtrongly on my affection, that howſoever I op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the <hi>premiſſes,</hi> I approved well of his <hi>Concluſion.</hi>

               <p>BVt amongſt all others, who had liberally partak't of my bounty; there was one, who ſo little deſerv'd it, that in a careleſſe ſecurity, as one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectleſſe of any courteſie, hee would all the day long take his reſt; and ſcarcely riſe without much adoe to take his neceſſary repaſt. And one day I chanc'd to find him, when all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions were addreſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to one exerciſe or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, turning or rather row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himſelfe in his bed, like a doore upon the hinges. So as, I begun to take him under hand, and to reprove him; bidding him to ſhake off <hi>Sloath</hi> for ſhame, and prepare himſelfe
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:135696:136"/>
for ſome taske: leſt in time he might incurre <hi>Margites</hi> cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, who, becauſe hee neither digged, plowed, nor did any good thing all his time, was not onely barred all civile ſociety living; but was not admitted to have his aſhes depoſited in the Vrne of his Anceſtors, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I deſired to know fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of him what content hee could take in groveling after that manner in his bed of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, while every creature ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ranke or quality, diſcovered ſome token of their induſtry. And in a ſluggiſh manner hee told mee; how there was none, but at one time or other hee might thrive, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that hee kept his ſhop; Now, what did any one know but that it was his <hi>Calling</hi> to make his ſhop his bed: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was hee (as hee impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:135696:136"/>
pretented) unimployed, when hee ſeemed for reſt moſt addicted. For that very mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and no longer ſince, hee told mee that hee kept his bed, not ſo much for his owne caſe, as for compoſing a maine diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which two noble Ladies had referred to him. For there had lately appeared to him two brave women attired in prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly habit, who contended much for ſuperiority: and the names of theſe two Ladies were <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phuia</hi> and <hi>Argia.</hi> Now theſe, after ſuch time as they had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before him, diſcovered both their <hi>Deſcents</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</hi> For <hi>Euphuia,</hi> as ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her ſelfe deſcended from an <hi>induſtrious</hi> family; ſo ſhee ſhewed her ſelfe a true daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for ſhee was wonderfully given to <hi>induſtry.</hi> Whereas <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi> was clear of another humor:
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:135696:137"/>
for nothing ſuited better with her diſpoſition, then to doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Theſe two, accordingly as they ſtood ſeverally affected, brake forth into commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of what their natures ſtood moſt inclined to. <hi>Euphnia</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that nothing improved any ones private eſtate or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey more then <hi>Induſtry.</hi> The other, with no leſſe confidence ſpake all ſhe could in praiſe of privacy, and a ſleepy kind of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; ſaying, how that was well got, that was got in a warme bed: and that <hi>Timandra</hi> purchas'd as much pleaſure in the embrace of her friend, as ever <hi>Thaleſtris</hi> did in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfiture of her Foe. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to advance the honour of Armes with all other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt manuall employments, with much moderation repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her frowardneſſe; telling
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:135696:137"/>
her, that ſhee did but all this to ſhew her wit: for elſe ſhee would ſpend no breath in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending <hi>Sloath,</hi> which was the death of a living ſoule. But ſaid he, ſo ſtrangely did theſe two cloze in the knitting up of their arguments, as with mutuall conſent, the difference was referred to me. Now, I am here conſulting with my pillow, to whether of theſe two I ſhould give the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. Nor, doe I intend to riſe, till I have compoſed the difference. Thus did my lazie Gueſt play the eaſie Arbitrator, deſiring rather a nappe in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, then diſcharge the part of a Moderator: So as, I might eaſily conjecture, to what ſide hee inclined moſt, by his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſſe from labour. And, indeed, I muſt freely confeſſe, I begunne not altogether to
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:135696:138"/>
diſlike his humour. For when hee had more fully acquainted mee with the quality of his condition: how and in what manner hee had ever lived; how hee had ſhunned all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like employments: deſiring rather a <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>eaſe,</hi> then to diſ-eaſe his owne quiet for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers good. Againe, what a madneſſe it was, to toyle or turmoile ones ſelfe in the world; to have a <hi>ſickle</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>corne;</hi> or to have an <hi>oare</hi> in every ones <hi>boat?</hi> To be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a wiſe and ſubtile Commiſſioner; and ſo ſpend his ſpirits about a fruitleſſe or thankeleſſe labour? To play the carking Husband, in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering for a progeny of hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Rake-hels? To afflict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the hoording up of that; which is got with paine and toyle, kept with care, and feare,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:135696:138"/>
and loſt with pangs and griefe? No, no; ſaid hee, let the world wagge, ſo I may enjoy my reſt; draw my Curtaines cloſe; take my morning nappe; let the Husbandman meet with a Snake in the way; Let the thirſty worldling play the Mole, digge and delve; I ſhall rather pitty his folly, then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy his happineſſe.</p>
               <p>This humour, the more I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it, the more I affected it. So as I begunne to imitate my Gueſt, and to ſing the Sluggards Lullabe, with <hi>yet a little,</hi> and <hi>then a little.</hi> And though poverty came ſo upon mee, yet the enjoyment of a little Summer made me forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of an enſuing Winter. An hundred excuſes would I mould, purpoſely to ſleepe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely: and free my ſelfe of all buſines, though it did never
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:135696:139"/>
ſo nearely concerne mee. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there was an <hi>Adder</hi> in the way; or the weather was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable; or ſome indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to health, injoyned me to keepe my bed. Thus did my delicacy bring mee to ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which howſoever I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd my ſelfe, was ſo farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from me: as in the end I found my perplexed eſtate ever to danger moſt ingaged, where weakneſſe of opinion dreamed to mee, that I was moſt ſecured.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 56.</hi> How by their treacherous aſſault, his <hi>Cinque ports,</hi> became endangered.</head>
               <p>THus, thus became I poore Pilgrim aſſaulted; thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came I foiled. But why doe I inveigh againſt their treachery, I became to my ſelfe the moſt treacherous Enemy? For by yeelding my <hi>Fort</hi> to the ſpirit of <hi>Pride,</hi> my <hi>Luciferian</hi> glory grew darkned. By entertaining <hi>Covetouſneſſe</hi> my former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent vaniſhed. By cheriſhing <hi>Luxury,</hi> both mine inward and outward faculties were diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. By feeding <hi>Envy,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a feeder of mee, and ſo my ſpirits became waſted. By cockering <hi>Gluttony,</hi> my ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall infirmities were ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:135696:140"/>
By harbouring <hi>Wrath,</hi> charity the choiceſt comfort of Chriſtian ſociety was baniſhed. By foſtering <hi>Sloath,</hi> out of my <hi>great Masters</hi> check-roule, became my name to be razed. Neither were theſe unthankfull Gueſts ſo contented; for by their treacherous attempts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came my <hi>Cinque ports</hi> endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered. So as, thoſe darlings of mine which had they been loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally affected, ſhould have beene my aſſiſtants, proved to be my private Aſſacinates. Not one of them but they failed in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming thoſe due offices to which they were deputed. My <hi>eye,</hi> indeed, knew how to look,<note place="margin">Bern. Med. <hi>14.</hi>
                  </note> but by wandring it corrupted my underſtanding with the thought of luſt. My <hi>eare</hi> knew how to heare, but by hearing amiſſe it diſtracted the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mine heart. My <hi>noſtrils</hi>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:135696:141"/>
knew how to ſmell, but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting thoſe flowers of divine ſweetneſſe, I begunne to ſnuffe up the wind with the <hi>wild Aſſe</hi> in the wilderneſſe. My <hi>touch</hi> knew how to performe her of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but by touching uncleane things, or by uſing cleane things uncleanely, that ſenſe became ſlaved to all ſenſuality. My mouth became an open Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher; mine <hi>Heart</hi> ſinnes Harbour. Thus fares it with the State ſpirituall, as it doth with the Politicall; if the <hi>Cinque Ports</hi> bee opened, the State becomes endangered; leſſe ſecured, becauſe to Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion more expoſed. What then could this poore razed Fort of my ſurprized ſoule expect but utter ruine, miſery and deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Foes wrought on mee without: and feares ſeazed on mee within. I had none left
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:135696:141"/>
to comfort mee: for my beſt comfort I had deſervingly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtranged from mee; For had I not with <hi>Demas</hi> left God for the world, I might have had God for my Friend, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently all the creatures of the world. For to leave God, is to make every creature his foe, which ever God made.</p>
               <p>O, was it not enough for thee to have others to betray thee, but thou muſt adde new ſtrength to their force, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying thy ſelfe unto thine Enemy? Hadſt thou taſted ſo freely of that ever ſtreaming fountaine of Gods mercy; and was it thy duty to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence his bounty with thy diſloyaltie? This had beene great inhumaniry even to have ſhewne to the moſt low and deſpicable creature: and couldſt thou find in thine heart, to
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:135696:142"/>
offer this abuſe unto thy Maker? O woe is mee, that I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all good things from the Lord, and requite him with nothing but evill! O that I had ponder'd theſe things well in mine heart: ſo might I in the day of my trouble have found helpe: and received comfort in the day of wrarh.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>O my deare Lord, juſtly may I complaine, and in the bitterneſſe of my ſoule, cry out:</hi> Sinners <hi>have</hi> built <hi>upon me: nay, they have made</hi> deepe furrowes <hi>upon my</hi> backe. <hi>And there is no health in mee becauſe of thine heavy diſpleaſure. O, though I bee a Sinner, bee not unmindfull of thy poore creature. Receive mee, O receive mee into the armes of thy mercy; while I confeſſe unto thee, who knoweſt the ſecrets of all thoughts, my iniquity? There is
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:135696:142"/>
not one</hi> ſenſe <hi>that thou haſt given mee, but I will declare unto thee how it has diſhonour'd thee. O thou Balme of</hi> Gilead, <hi>heale my wounds, for they are many!</hi>

               <p>LOoke on mee, and pitty mee, when you ſhall heare how this <hi>ſenſe</hi> has deluded me! And take warning by my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that yee ſuffer not your <hi>Dinahs</hi> to wander, leſt they loſe their honour. This <hi>ſenſe</hi> which ſhould direct mee, did firſt intrap mee: for I no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>beheld,</hi> then I was held captive by that which I beheld. Neither was I altogether ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of theſe things: for I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood how <hi>Death</hi> enter'd in
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:135696:143"/>
by the <hi>windowes.</hi> And yet I would not ſhut them, but ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd my mortall enemies to enter in by them. Nor a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence but by thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded portels received ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance. Our Grandham <hi>Eve</hi> to our ſhame and loſſe, ſaw that the <hi>fruit</hi> was <hi>pleaſant,</hi> and ſhee tooke of the fruit and taſted of it. This <hi>apple</hi> remaines ſtill in the <hi>eye,</hi> and muſt continue an <hi>eye-ſore</hi> to all her <hi>poſterity.</hi> Thus have our <hi>Fathers</hi> eaten ſowre grapes, and their <hi>Childrens</hi> teeth are ſet on edge. O how often have I reſolved with my ſelfe (but as in all things elſe, how weak are mens reſolves?) to ſhut theſe gates againſt all temptations: and on that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject never to fixe my <hi>ſight,</hi> that might give any <hi>Inlet</hi> to ſinne: or to looke on that intentively, which I might not deſire ſafely.
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:135696:143"/>
And to ſtrengthen this reſolve, I thought upon ſome whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome meditation, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory whereof I had good hope would keepe thoſe <hi>lights</hi> within mee: and not ſuffer them to bee taken up by any worldly vanity. But no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner gave time and place oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, then thoſe weake re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves were quite razed: the thoughts of goodneſſe diſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; piety became a Stranger to me: for corruption had ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed on mine heart, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd up her Hold unto the Enemy. O how happy had I beene; had I in my youth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled thoſe diſtemper'd heates which my wanton <hi>eye</hi> firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed! But ſo farre was I from repenting of what my youth had committed: as now my riper yeares are not aſhamed to reteine a delight in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:135696:144"/>
of what my youth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. And what more hard to cure, then an old Vlcer, an aged ſore? O yee treacherous Spies, why have yee thus wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred about to ſeeke my undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? what gaine may yee reape by my perdition? Is there no end of your fury; nay, of your madding folly? O remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, how for theſe beautifull ſights which you have preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to mee: and wherewith you have deceived mee; ougly and gaſtly Spectacles ſhall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both you and mee. For you, and none but you, moved mee ſo unjuſtly to covet my Neighbours field, becauſe it was fruitfull. And to hunt after the ſtrange woman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhee was beautifull. Your Preſentments made mee in all things ſenſuall. Thus by bitter experience have I found how
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:135696:144"/>
by the <hi>Countenance</hi> piety be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came hindered; by the <hi>eyes,</hi> chaſtity became harmed.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>O my deare Saviour, looke upon mee, who have loſt my ſelfe by looking and longing after what was unlawfull for me.

                  <q>It joyes mee much, good Pilgrim, to ſee you thus brought from death to life. But it were well for you ſo to moderate theſe comforts which you have received: as not to loſe your ſelfe, leſt you might deprive your ſelfe of the benefit of this comfort. You may doe well then here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to imitate the <hi>Fly,</hi> which putteth not her feet into the great Maſſe of honey, but only taketh with her tongue ſo much thereof as ſerveth her turne and no more, leſt by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe, ſhe might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine taken and drowned therein.

<pb n="393" facs="tcp:135696:195"/>
cloyeth: and too much of comfort drowneth. Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate then theſe, as you tender your invvard peace. Time has beene vvhen the very leaſt beameling of theſe comforts which now ſo plentuouſly reflect on you, would have infinitly refreſhed you: for your ſpirit was wounded within you: preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and future hopes had wholly eſtranged themſelves from you.

Many, by being unhappy have become happy: but very few have attained true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, by being in this world ever happy.

<pb n="394" facs="tcp:135696:196"/>
theſe confirmed you: So ſhall it be my care, who am their poore contemptible ſiſter, to prepare you for them, as they have prepared them for you: that ſuch choyce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts may be applyed to that end for which they were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred: and your comforts ſuch, as the iſſue of them may not be repented.</q>

gravity, ſhee thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered mee.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>You muſt not gather by my <hi>Habit</hi> what I am. For I weare the worlds livery; ſuch as ſhee is pleaſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon mee; with no leſſe content, then ſhee throwes it on me with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.

But alas, I found <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi> ſaying too true! The vertuous did more frequent the doores of the rich, then then the rich of the vertuous. The poore were vertuous,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:135696:197"/>
and repaired to the doores of the rich: but the rich were vicious, and would not open their doores to the poore. I obſerved how vertue was accounted ſuch a treaſure, as 'twas held more fitting to be out of the world then in it: whereas riches held that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation amongſt men: as men were held of no reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without it. But you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know my name; and you ſhall have it: but I pray you doe not imitate the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of this preſent world, by loving one worſe when you hear it.

I have never yet beene known to bee more ready to <hi>promiſe</hi> then <hi>performe.</hi> Yet ſhall the
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:135696:198"/>
promiſe which I make unto you, bee of infinite conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: for it ſhall make you eternally happy in the performance. You are here planted in a <hi>vaile</hi> of <hi>miſery,</hi> where I promiſe to cover all your <hi>ſcarlet ſinnes</hi> with the <hi>white roabe</hi> of <hi>mercy.</hi> Nay, I will yet goe a little farther to conferre on your peacefull progreſſe the higher honour: If you will deagne to leave the world, and receive mee who am deſpiſed of the world: If you will, I ſay, leave her ſociety, and bid adue to her blooms of vanity: by keeping mee company, I ſhall conduct you ſafely to the Kingdome of glory.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Nor, let it be the leaſt of your feare, that I promiſe above my power. For as my ſiſters imparted their love unto
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:135696:198"/>
you, in cheering, comforting, and confirming you: So ſhall you find no leſſe alacrity in mee, in perfecting what they have ſo happily begunne in you. For I muſt tell you, (neither would I have you thinke that this proceedeth from any <hi>vaine glory,</hi> being that which could never chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the leaſt affinity with true <hi>charity</hi>) that though my ſiſters may ſeeme to have priority in liſt and number, yet am I to challenge preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in reſpect of dignity and order.

And foraſmuch as there was no <hi>ſafety</hi> out of the <hi>Arke;</hi> nor no ſalvation now without the <hi>pale</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> figured by the <hi>Arke:</hi> and that the <hi>tares</hi> from the <hi>wheat</hi> muſt be ſevered: the <hi>Sheepe</hi> and the <hi>Goats</hi> muſt not into one <hi>Fold</hi> be gathered: HERE in the preſence of God and his bleſſed Angels; for the diſcharge of mine owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and the ſatisfaction of others, who, perchance, have in their opinions been divided, doubting much how I in points of Religion ſtood affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; Doe I make a free and publike confeſſion of my Faith: being that <hi>Cement</hi> by which
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:135696:206"/>
we are knit unto her, and made <hi>Members</hi> of her.</p>
               <p>I beleeve the <hi>holy Catholike Church,</hi> to be the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Faithfull,</hi> whereof I deſire to live and dye a Member: for which to ſuffer I ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it an honour: holding this for a <hi>Principle</hi> ever; That none can have <hi>God</hi> for his <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> that will not take his <hi>Holy Spouſe</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> for his <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> There is no Article in the Apoſtles Creed which I do not beleeve for Catholike and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxall, with the expoſition thereof, and every Clauſe or Particle thereof in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as it hath beene univerſally received by the holy Catholike Church, from the firſt four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after Chriſt: and as it holds in conſent or harmony with the Holy Scripture, the Chriſtians Armour; by which
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:135696:206"/>
and the conſtant practiſe of piety, every faithfull Souldier of Chriſt Ieſus may be enabled to pull downe thoſe ſtrong Holds of his ſpirituall enemy: and by poſſeſſing his ſoule in patience, obtaine a glorious victory. And as there have been at all times tares in Gods field; ſo is it more to be pittied then doubted, that there are many ſurreptitious errours crept into the boſome of the Church through the corruption of time, and our enemies malice: which though they ayme not at the <hi>Corner-ſtone,</hi> nor at the maine <hi>foundation,</hi> yet being but <hi>ſtubble,</hi> &amp; no wayes conducing to ſo glorious a building, they are to bee accounted of that quality, as they blemiſh much her primitive beauty. Theſe then being the fancies of humane braines, and introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:135696:207"/>
into the Church for private ends; and ſo continued rather by an imperious then juſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, I hold them ſo farre from being effectuall to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they become ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to many tender conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and conſequently deſerve rather to be rejected then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced. But for the <hi>Ornamenss</hi> of the Church, as ſhee is the <hi>Kings Daughter,</hi> ſo ſhe ſhould be comely: and for her <hi>muſicke</hi> or <hi>melody;</hi> being his <hi>Spouſe,</hi> it admits harmony: for ſo drowſie is mans zeale and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as hee ſtands in great need of ſomething to ſtirre up his devotion. Likewiſe of thoſe ancient and decent <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> of the Church, being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly, and not ſuperſtitiouſly uſed, I have ever reverently eſteemed. Neither am I igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant how diſputation in argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:135696:207"/>
of controverſall learning hath beene of late yeares in more requeſt then care of blameleſſe converſation and living; how indiſcreet and impertinent reaſoning has in many places brought that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full effect, as it hath begot many irreparable rents in Chriſts ſeameleſſe Coat: thus wounds left to the handling of unexpert hands became ſo farre from curing, as they grew more dangerouſly ſpreading, and deſperately increaſing then they were in the beginning, and before they came to hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Theſe Deficience are with pious teares and devout prayers to be repaired, that men of learning may bee likewiſe men of living; being endowed with that zeale, as in all their arguments by way of private diſcourſe or more publike op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:135696:208"/>
their ſole ayme and deſire may bee to propagate the Goſpel, and in it the glory of God, with all ſingleneſſe of mind, and that without ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of judgement; being ſo free from all manner of oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or the ſpirit of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, as they may ſhun no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then popular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, nor hold any thing more deare then the Churches peace. So as, to compoſe this breach, I never held thoſe in points of Religion to be fitting Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, who made it their onely ayme in a ſcholaſticall manner to weave up their Arguments: but ſuch moderate ſpirits, whoſe deſires were rather to cleare mens conſciences from inbred ſcruples, then broach new differences.</p>
               <p>With all due reverence I eſteeme of thoſe two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments;
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:135696:208"/>
                  <hi>Baptiſme</hi> and the <hi>Supper</hi> of the Lord, as thoſe two nurſing breſts of the Church: the one to clenſe and purifie us at our entring: the other to ſtrengthen and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us living: and to glorifie our ſoules at their departing. As with mine <hi>heart</hi> I <hi>beleeve</hi> unto <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> ſo with my <hi>Mouth</hi> doe I <hi>confeſſe</hi> unto <hi>ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> Neither, doe I profeſſe my ſelfe ſuch a <hi>Soli-fidian,</hi> as to hold <hi>Faith</hi> ſufficient to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without <hi>Workes.</hi> Neither ſuch a <hi>Champion</hi> for <hi>good workes,</hi> as to hold <hi>works</hi> effectuall without <hi>Faith.</hi> As <hi>Faith</hi> is the root, ſo are <hi>works</hi> the fruit.

<q>That in the Reſurrection of my Saviour Chriſt Ieſus is my hope: and in his Aſcenſion is my glory.</q>
For, <hi>I beleeve that my Redeemer liveth, and that with theſe eyes I ſhall ſee him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus have I rendred an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my faith; the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance whereof as I have ever profeſſed in my life: ſo I hope with all Chriſtian conſtancy to continue the profeſſion thereof even unto death. So as, though the aſſaults or temptations of the Devill, my ſpirituall enemy, whoſe practiſe hath beene ever by cruelty or ſubtilty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive man of his hope of glory, ſhould with all fury aſſaile me,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:135696:209"/>
yet ſhall they never have power to prevaile againſt mee; for the Lord, who is my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, will in mercy draw neare mee, and in that dying conflict give mee the victory. This then ſhall be my clozing
<q>Reſolve, I meane to continue in the profeſſion of that <hi>Faith,</hi> now when I am old; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in being a child I was borne.<note place="margin">Hier. ad Pammach. et Ocean de error. Orig.</note>

               </p>
               <p>And having thus returned a due account of my Beliefe; I hold it very fitting not to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that laudable uſe of diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that eſtate whereof God in his goodneſſe and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence towards me, made mee here his Steward.

                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 20.1</note> 
                  <hi>Set thine houſe in order, for thou ſhalt die, and not live.</hi> True it is, when

the <hi>outward houſe</hi> is orderly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, the <hi>inward houſe</hi> cannot chuſe but bee better prepared. To remove then from mee the cares of this preſent world, that I may take a more willing adeiu of the world before I leave it, and ſo addreſſe my cares for a better world by wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my deſires from it: for live hee cannot in the Land of the living, who prepares not himſelfe for it before his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: my mind and will is, that my worldly ſubſtance bee diſpoſed of in manner and forme following.</p>
               <p>Firſt, then after this veſſell of Earth, this poore ſhell of corruption ſhall bee to earth committed, and as neare to the bones of mine Anceſtors as the conveniencie of the place may permit, interred: and that my Funerall expences ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged;
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:135696:210"/>
in the performance of which Chriſtian duty I approve of decency, but in no caſe too much ſolemnity; (which has too often drowned the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of mortality in the lees of ſenſuality) after this, I ſay, my Will is, that this ſmall eſtate wherewith God hath bleſſed mee, ſhall be divided in equall parts or portions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt my Children: that, as they are all equally mine, ſo they may bee equall ſharers in mine: Of whom I will not propheſie that they will <hi>diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate</hi> or ſcatter all I leave them: I have better hopes treaſured in them. For the portions I leave them, though ſmall yet competent, if they be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and more then I could wiſh them, if otherwiſe affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. A very little will ſuffice nature; enough I leave them,
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:135696:211"/>
if well employed: too much if abuſed. May Gods bleſſing and mine be ever with them in their improvement of it. And that I may crowne their hopes, and my houres with one bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing more: Bleſſed Spirit, by which every Paſſenger is ſafely conducted from this vale of miſery, to the Kingdome of glory, as theſe little ones are mine by <hi>generation,</hi> ſo may they be thine by <hi>regeneration,</hi> to whoſe gracious protection both now and ever I commit them.</p>
               <p>Now I nominate and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point for Surperviſors of this my laſt Will and Teſtament, my deare friends, <hi>Agapetus &amp; Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licrines,</hi> if they ſhall bee then living at my death: whom I heartily deſire, for the loue they beare to goodneſſe; nay, for the love they bear to him, who
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:135696:211"/>
is the fountaine of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and as I repoſe much truſt in them; to performe this my Will.</p>
               <p>And now mee thinkes,<note place="margin">Hieron.</note> all my worldly cares are drawne neare unto their period. Seeing then I am ſailing towards mine Harbour; Let mee ſtrike An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor: that taking the wings of the Morning, I may fly to the boſome of my dear Redeemer. Go forth then my Soule, what feareſt thou? goe forth, why trembleſt thou? Thou haſt had enough of <hi>Idumaea;</hi> for what foundſt thou there but anguiſh? Now then turne thy face to the <hi>Wall,</hi> and thinke of the <hi>Land</hi> of <hi>Promiſe.</hi> Thou haſt but now a little time left thee: the remainder whereof is juſtly exacted by him that made thee.

The Enemy can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prevaile, where Chriſtian <hi>feare</hi> and conſtant <hi>hope</hi> poſſeſſe the Soule.
