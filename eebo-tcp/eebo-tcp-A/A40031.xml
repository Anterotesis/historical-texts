            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For by it thou wilt see, that the representing the true Houre by the shadow made by the Axis of the World is but one of those infinite wayes which may be invented, and that it is as possible to do the same thing by the shadow of the Axis of one of the vertical Circles, and by the projection of one Ellipsis upon a plain, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the place of all the Parallels comprehended within the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks.

            <p>Lastly, we advertize thee (<hi>Reader</hi>) that our Authour, in regard of his great and long infirmities, could not fit either this, or any other of his Treatises for the Presse, as he desired and intended; and therefore they must needs want much of that accomplishment which otherwise they would have had.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecause here is no declination supposed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the draught will be the more easie.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Make B C for the longer Diameter of your Ellipsis, and count one halfe of it, that is A B or A C as the Radius, and through the point A, draw an infinite line (as D E) at right angles to B C. Then for the shorter Diameter, you must consider the eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pole above your plain. Looke therefore to make A D or A E equall to the Sine of the Poles elevation, which Sine must be estimated to the Radius A B. Thus you have the two extream diameters.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Through the four points D B E C you may describe the Ellipsis, either by Elliptical Compasses, or by finding many points through which it is to passe: for effecting which there are multitudes of wayes prescribed.</p>
                  <p>One may be this. Describe two Circles upon the two extream Diameters B C and D E. Divide them both into any like parts, as B <hi>f h n p q</hi> C, and V <hi>i k</hi> E <hi>o t</hi> X; and from each couple of those like divisions (as <hi>f</hi> and <hi>i</hi>) draw <hi>f g i g,</hi> (the first parallel to A <hi>n,</hi> the second parallel to A B) cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting each other at right angles in <hi>g,</hi> so the point <hi>g</hi> shall be one of the points through which the Ellipsis is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed. In the same manner, from <hi>h</hi> and <hi>k</hi> must be drawn
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57111:8"/>
two lines concurring at right angles in <hi>m,</hi> which will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be another point through which the Ellipsis must passe. So again from <hi>p</hi> and <hi>o, t</hi> and <hi>q,</hi> lines are to be drawn, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring at right angles in <hi>s</hi> and <hi>r,</hi> which are two other points of passage for the Ellipsis. After this manner may the other halfe B D C be described.</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>How to divide the Ellipsis into its requisite parts.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. If the parts B <hi>f h n p q</hi> C were all equall, and 12 of them in number, then would the points <hi>g m, &amp;c.</hi> be the houre points. And accordingly, if those houres were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided into equall halves and quarters, &amp;c. there would be found points for the halves and quarters, &amp;c. of the houres.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57111:9"/>
And if the Ellipsis be first drawn, then the exteriour Circle it selfe by lines issuing out of <hi>f h p q,</hi> drawn parallel to A <hi>n</hi>) will divide the Ellipsis: or, where these lines cut it more obliquely (as at <hi>g</hi> and <hi>r, &amp;c.</hi>) there the lesser Circles equall parts (at <hi>i</hi> and <hi>t, &amp;c.</hi>) will cut the same Ellipsis at more right angles, so that one of them may help the other in this division.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Or, If the quadrants B <hi>n</hi> C, or V E X (or of any other Circle described upon the center A) were divided into Horizontall Spaces, such as are proper for this Diall (as you see them done upon the quadrants B <hi>y</hi> C) and a Ruler laid from the center A did transfer those divisions into the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipsis (as is done upon that halfe of it which is noted with B D C) this division would be the same with the former.</p>
                     <p>The proportion whereby to make the Table of Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Spaces for this Ellipsis, is inverse to that which is for common Horizontall Dials: thus,</p>

                     <p>And according to these spaces must every houre be set on from <hi>n</hi> or <hi>y</hi> towards B or C.</p>

                     <p>The former descriptions do suppose that the yearly course of the Sun is to be set in a streight Scale, in which the parts neerest to the two Tropicks will be exceeding close toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and those at the Aequinoctiall or middle part of the Scale will be wide. But if it shall better be liked that the parts should stand distinctly one from the other; it will then be most expedient, First, to limit out the whole length of the Scale: then upon that length (as a diameter) to describe a Circle, and to divide it as is here under shewed.</p>

                     <p>You are first to divide the Circle (it selfe, or one equall to it) into 360 equall degrees, and by them to divide the said Circle into such unequall parts as the numbers of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and minutes expressed in the Tables will require. The two Tables are the Right Ascensions of such parts of the Ecliptic as are due to the Suns place or Declination, in any of the Signes, or of any dayes of the 12 moneths. The Tables are here placed. The manner of dividing the Circle is the same with other like things of this kinde.</p>

(called here the Zodiacall Index) must move according to the length of the plains Meridian line, either in it, or paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel to it, alwayes so that the fiduciall edge of the Dials In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex may ever stand in the Meridian line.</p>

                     <p>But it is supposed hitherto, that the plain be either direct, looking full North or South, or else Horizontal: and in every such plain, there must be drawn the Meridian line of the place or plain, which in direct flats are one and the same. And according to the Coast of this Meridian line must the moving or sliding be, as also the line of 12 upon the Ellipsis must lie in or parallel to it.</p>
                     <p>This way therefore requires, first, a Meridian line to be drawn, whereby to place the Ellipsis. And in all direct plains the Meridian line is the same with the Vertical line of the plain.</p>
                     <p>But if to this Elliptical Dial, be adjoyned a common Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal Dial with an Axis, then there needs no finding of a Meridian line before hand, because they two betwixt them will finde one, and consequently will place themselves in a true position.

                        <p n="2">2. In the 11 page there are two Rules given whereby to finde that Scale of Tangents out of which the Zodiacal Scale is to be divided. If then out of that Scale of Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents so found and limited, you take the Co-tangent of your Latitude, and divide that length as a Radius or whole line of Sines into houres and parts of houres, and put in so many of them as will reach the Suns greatest Declination, or the length of the Zodiac both wayes from the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall; then the former rectification of the Zodiacal Index to the day of the moneth or Suns place, will perfectly shew (in this Scale, and for that Latitude to which all the work is made) the Ascensional difference, with what depends there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: namely, the length of the Day and Night, and the time of Sun Rising and Setting.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Dial being fixed in a true position, the Place or Coast of the Sun rising and setting upon the plain, may be discerned in the heavens.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not here to be enquired whether the plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining, be erect or leaning; for one rule serves both these kindes. But then it must first be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, that the plains situation is in all respects known, how much and which way it declines and reclines or inclines.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, These three things must further be found (either by calculation or otherwise) namely,

                        <item>1. The Poles elevation above the plain.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>These are pre-requisites to that which comes after, in which you must proceed by the following directions.</p>

                     <head>How to limit and draw the <hi>Ellipsis.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>Having the substylar or proper Meridian drawn upon the plain, in its true position, and also knowing the elevation of the Pole above the plain, you may, upon the substylar line, set out your shorter diameter, and on a line drawn perpendicular thereto, you may set off the longer diameter, in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion: Let the longer Diameter be as the Radius, the shorter as the Sine of the plains Latitude taken to the same Radius. Or, the longer semidiameter may be the Radius, and the shorter semidiameter must then be the Sine of the elevation of the Pole above the plain.</p>
                     <p>Upon these two extream diameters thus limited, may the Ellipsis be described with Elliptical Compasses. Or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it may be done by two Circles, the one circumscribed, the other inscribed, both divided into like parts, and so points found through which the Ellipsis is to passe, as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer direct plains was prescribed, and through those points the Ellipsis may, with a stedfast hand be described. In right Horizons or Polar plains there will be no Ellipsis at all, but it vanisheth into a streight line only.</p>

                     <head>How to divide the Ellipsis into such requisite parts as the plain shall require.</head>
                     <p>If you should put in the houres proper to the plain there will be no difficulty, for then the substilar being taken for the line of 12, the houres must be drawn as before was shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in direct plains. For in this case the Dial is Horizontal, shewing the houre of the day to all places that lie under that Meridian under which the plain it selfe lyeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But</p>

                        <pb n="24" facs="tcp:57111:16"/>If you would put in the houres of the place (as most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is desired) then you are to work (for the division of the Ellipsis) either by calculation or by protraction. If you calculate for the Ellipsis, you must first forme all the angles at the Pole as the manner is in these kindes of Dials: Then you are to invert the terms of proportion from the common way of calculating ordinary Dials, and say thus:</p>
                     <p>As the Sine of the Poles elevation above the plain, Is to the Radius;</p>
                     <p>So is the Tangent of each angle at the Pole, To the Tangent of the angular distances of all the houres from the substylar line of the plain.</p>

                     <p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:57111:16"/>Supposing therefore that you had your Ellipsis before described, and the substilar line set off from the plains Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical line in its true position, you may from that substylar line (and by the horary spaces found by calculation) set in every houre point into the Ellipsis, by help of any Circle described upon the center A. As you see here are two Circles, the circumscribed and the inscribed, either of which, or any other circle else, will serve to prick on the houres by. The houre points are here set upon the circumscribed Circle, and transferred into the Ellipsis by a Ruler laid to A, the common center of the Ellipsis and of the Circle. This is one way, and is best done by calculation: here you may also put in the halves, and quarters, and halfe quarters of houres, or what other parts you shall best like of.</p>

                     <head>How to limit the Ellipsis, and divide it, without Calculation.</head>
                     <p>But if you are desirous to do it rather by protraction, then must you work somwhat as formerly was done, the manner I will in briefe shew, wherein you may see the way both how to describe the Ellipsis, and also how to divide it, all under one.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Having prepared all necessary requisites before hand, you must first set off the substilar line in its true position from the Vertical line, which to do, I here suppose already known. So in the following figure you see A C B drawn for the substilar line, or the proper meridian of the plain.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Upon this plain, and upon some point of the Substy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar line, as at A, as upon a center, describe the Circle B M E, and quarter it, and let the Semidiameter of that Circle be counted as the Radius</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:57111:17"/>3. Upon one of the quarters, set off the Poles elevation as from E to F, and draw A F, and from E to A F take the least distance, as E G, and with that distance, upon the former center A, describe another lesser Circle as C H.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. From B (where the greater Circle cuts the substylar) set B M equall to the plains difference of Longitude: and from M divide that exterior Circle into 24 equal parts, which signifie the 24 houres; and by a Ruler laid to the common center A, transfer them into the lesser Circle, as M H, 10 I, 6 K, &amp;c.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p n="5">
                        <pb n="37" facs="tcp:57111:17"/>5. From every point in the great Circle, draw lines paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel to the substylar, and from every point of the lesser Circle draw lines perpendicular to the substylar, or parallel to the longest diameter P A R, and so each couple of these lines shall cut each other at right angles.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Note where every line thus drawn from any point of the greatest Circle, meets with the other line which is drawn from the like point in the lesser Circle. For the concourses of these answerable lines are the points here required. That is, Those are the points which shew both where the Ellipsis is to be drawn, and also where it is to be divided into its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite parts.</p>
                     <p>Thus in the precedent figure: M O and H O meet in the point O, 10 L and I L meet in the point L, 6 N and K N meet in the point N, and so the rest will meet in their due places. These points shew the way where through the Ellipsis is to be drawn, and the same points shew where the houres are to be marked out. The like may be done for quarters and halfe quarters of houres, or any other division that shall be best liked of.</p>
                     <p>There are many other wayes to do the same things, but I suppose this to be most expedient.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>Note: that</head>
                     <p n="1">1. The Index in these Elliptical Dials must stand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly upright upon the plain, making right angles with it every way, as it was ordered to do upon the former sort of direct plains.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:57111:18"/>2. The annual course of the Sun must be limited as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in the other plains, that is, making the greater semidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter as a Badius, you must finde the Co-sine of the Poles elevation above the plain. This Co-sine is to be made either as a Tangent of 45 <hi>gr.</hi> whereof you are only to use 23½: Or else it is to be made a Decimal Scale. By both these you have Tables and Rules how to compleat the Suns annual course, either in degrees of the Signes in the Zodiac, or by the dayes of the 12 moneths.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Either the Index must move and the Ellipsis lie still, or contrarily. Every man in this must do as his invention shall best suggest. And that motion must be made either upon the substylar line, or else parallel to it, which way so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, it must be precisely and punctually ordered.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. All other things concerning the time of Sun rising and setting, the Suns Amplitudes and Declinations, may here (in the same manner as before) be inserted either proper to the plain, or proper to the place, as shall be desired.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. In right Horizons or Polar plains, the Ellipsis closeth quite up into a streight line: and so the division of it is only by the exterior Circles parts projected upon it by those lines that are drawn parallel to the substylar.</p>
                     <p>Thus far of the Elliptical Dial, as it is to be described upon declining plains whose Indexes stand perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular to the plains, and which do not lie under the Meridian of the place but swerve from it.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or this purpose here are two Tables joyned together, both of them made for the Latitude of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> 51 <hi>gr.</hi> 30 <hi>min.</hi> the like to which every man may calculate for his own place.</p>
                  <p>The first of them is a Table of such angles as are made by the hour lines (coming through the center of the Ellipsis) with the Meridian line or line of 12. And it was made by that rule which was given (in this case) at the beginning of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise. Namely,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:57111:19"/>As the Sine of your Poles elevation (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is here 51 <hi>gr.</hi> 30 <hi>m.</hi>) is to the Radius;</p>
                  <p>So is the Tangent of each houre and their quarters (counted from 12 a clock,)</p>
                  <p>To the Tangent of the angle required.</p>
                  <p>The second Table is of the Altitudes of each houre and quarter, in the Equinoctial Circle, above the Horizon; and it is calculated by this Rule.</p>
                  <p>As the Radius,</p>
                  <p>To the Co-sine of your Latitude (which is here the Sine of 38 <hi>gr.</hi> 30 <hi>min.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>So is the Sine of each houre and their quarters, (counted from 6 a clock,)</p>
                  <p>To the Sine of the altitude which is here sought.</p>
                  <p>Then having computed these two Tables, you may (by help of them) both draw and divide the Ellipsis into its true houres and quarters by these following directions.</p>
                  <p>First, draw the two lines 6 6 and D E, crossing each other at right angles in A, and let A D be the Meridian, and 6 A 6 the two six a clock lines.</p>
                  <p>Then upon A as a center describe the Circle 6 D 6 of any convenient bignesse; and upon the same Circle from D (on both sides of it) set on the houres and their quarters, as 11 and 1, 10 and 2, &amp;c. by help of the degrees and minutes of the angles set to every houre in the former Table. And through every of these points inscribed into the Circle, draw lines from the center A, as A 11, A 10, A 1, A 2, with the rest of the houres and their quarters if you will.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, supposing A 6 to be the Radius, you may divide
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57111:19"/>
                     <figure/>
it into 90 Sines; the beginning or largest parts whereof must be at A, but the numeration must be the contrary way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at 6 and ending at A in 90. Or you may take the complements of the former Altitudes in the Table, and take them out of a line of Sines numbered the right way, which will be best for the Sector, or such Instruments which will best perform this work without any great trouble.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, looke in the second Table for the altitudes of the Equinoctiall at every houre. Then count those Altitudes in the line of Sines, and take with your Compasses the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral distances of them from A, &amp; transfer the said distances

from the center A to every houre respectively, so shall those intersections give you the points through which the Ellipsis must be drawn.</p>
                  <p>Thus the altitude of 7 and 5 a clock (which is 9 <hi>gr.</hi> 17 <hi>m.</hi>) being taken upon the line of Sines from A towards S, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted into 4 houres at the note <hi>m.</hi> And the altitude at 8 and 4 (which in the Table is 18 <hi>gr.</hi> 8 <hi>min.</hi>) being taken and transferred to the four houres at <hi>n,</hi> do give four points more. The rest of the altitudes give (each of them) two houres only, as at <hi>o, i,</hi> and <hi>r,</hi> is done. And the last of all at 12, gives one only point at <hi>t.</hi> The like may be done for the quarters. And so through these points thus found the Ellipsis may easily be drawn, and the lines formerly drawn give the divisions that are due unto it.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. This is propounded only for Horizontal plains, but it may without difficulty be applyed to any other direct plain. The trouble that is, comes by reason that the foresaid plains have a different elevation of the Pole, from that elevation that belongs to the Horizon or place where they are to stand: and consequently there will be required two new Tables for that elevation which is proper to the plain; the calculation of which will easily be done by the two former proportions set down for that end. Note further that by these two Tables you may prick down an Ellipsis upon any leaning (not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right) plain whatsoever. But the Index must then lie in the Zenith line of the place, (not of the plain) and the Ellipsis (or Index) must move in the Meridian of the place (not of the plain) and the Zodiac must be like or proportional to the Zodiac of the Horizon, but augmented, for the most part, in this proportion.</p>

But in these will be found more difficulty then in the former plains which declined not, unlesse it be required to put in the houres that are proper to the plain; for in that case the work is the same which was in them. But if the houres of the place are to be inscribed, as most usually they are, then there will be some trouble, by reason that the difference of the plains Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude seldome falls upon any just houre. I purpose not here to shew the way, it being such as will prove un-pleasant to the unskilfull, and such as have knowledge will finde it out quickly. Perhaps the pleasure of the thing done, will recompense their labour.</p>

And drawing a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian line upon the said immoveable plate (just under the Meridian of the Ellipsis, and) from the foot of the Index you may divide that Circle (beginning from the Meridian line) into 360 <hi>gr.</hi> or so many of them as shall be needfull. By these degrees you shall finde the Suns Azimuth by the shadow of the upright Index, and by the divisions of the Ellipsis you may know the houre of the day.

                     <p>This kinde of Diall must be set in its true position (for it will not set it selfe) and must there be fixed. If it be upon an Horizontall, or any direct plain, you may draw a Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an line thereon, and either draw the Azimuths true upon it, and so make the Ellipsis to move to and fro according to that Meridian: Or else, if both your plates be to be fixed upon any Base prepared for them, you may, first, upon that Base draw a true Meridian line, and to that line make the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of the Diall to agree.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. A second excellent use may be for the setting of move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Dials, such as are made to stand out of the weather, and are only to be set in the Sun at pleasure, when the houre shall be required. Of this kinde are Polyhedrall Bodies made of some light matter, and Concaves, &amp;c.

These things being so fitted, you may place your Body or Concave in the Sun, and turn it about till you discern that both kindes of Dials do agree to shew one houre, which when they do, then all stand right in their true situation, which will never else happen but only when the houres do in both agree.—To this place is referred the Double Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Diall, the one of them giving the houre by the Axis, the other by the upright Index.—And here it must be noted, that the worst time of the day for this setting the Dials in a true position, is at the neerest to noon, and the best time is about the Suns b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

posture) before a casement in any window that hath a flat board upon which it may move. And the Index to it may be an upright threed (precisely upright it must be) that is fixed at the top and bottome of the window, to and from which the Ellipsis must move in a Meridian line that is drawn upon the board of the window, &amp; from or justly even upon the threed.—And where I say the window must be flat, it is to be understood that there is no extraordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actnesse required in that. For if it should rise or incline 5 <hi>gr.</hi> to the Horizon, it would not erre one minute of time about our Latitude; provided that the Meridian be truly drawn, and the Index perfectly upright, in which all possible exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is required.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irst, Instead of the Ellipsis drawn to the proper Meridian and Latitude of the plain, there may be used a true Circle equally divided: but then let these things be observed.</p>
                  <p>First, That the Index must be perpendicular every way to the plain on which the Circle is elevated, standing upright upon it. Secondly, That the motion (either of Index or Circle) must be according to the proper Meridian of the plain. Thirdly, That the Zodiac must also be proper to the plain, and must lie upon the plain or Base it selfe, and must be the same with that which should serve for the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipsis. But then, Fourthly, this equally divided Circle must be elevated over the proper Meridian of the plain (that is, the Base of it must rest upon the proper East and West line of the plain) so much it must be elevated as the elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Equinoctiall above that plain comes unto. And the elevation of it may be either way; that is, either upon the South Coast, and then it will be answerable to the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall in the heavens; or else it may be towards the North, but still so much as the Equinoctials (not the Poles) elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on comes unto, and in some cases it must be done both
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57111:23"/>
wayes that the Sun may come at it, and it must then have two Indexes. Both wayes it is alike true. It must be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into equall houres and parts, and so much of it must stand above the Base or plain on which it moves, as the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est day comes unto. The beginning of the division must be from the line of 12, and if the plain be not direct, then must the difference of Longitude be counted in the circular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, from the highest point, or from the Verticall line of this Equinoctiall Circle.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Diall is not so tyed to a plain, but that it may also be brought to an un-even Superficies, yet so, that the motion of it, or the Zodiacal Scale must be upon some plain. But to shew the manner how this should be performed, is more proper for those Projecting wayes which I have in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place had some assayes of. Only remember that the Horizontal Diall must be projected, not by the Axis, but by the Zenith.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A double Diall depending upon this kinde, may be made to set it selfe, and to shew the houre in a Craticular forme, which is also more properly to be handled in my other wayes.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. MAke a right angled Parallelogram, as A B C D, whose length may be about three times the breadth: and let the limbe (upon which the graduations stand) be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then the Plain or Area of it.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. Describe a Semiellipsis to your own Latitude, whose longest Radius let be M O, a little longer than A B, that when the center M is left out and cut off, so much as M N comes to (which may be about halfe a quarter of an houre from 12 in the Ellipsis) the remaining breadth N O, or E F, or G H, may be just fit to A B the breadth of the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Area, in which this lesser rectangled Parallelogram E F G H may be moved to and fro as there shall be occasion. And let the thicknesse or depth of this moving plate be the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57111:24"/>
same with the thicknesse of the limbe of the lower plate. The division of the Ellipsis may be made according to the rules before given.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In the midst of this lesser plate, let a hole be pierced quite through it; and in that hole let a threed be extended, as I K, which is to serve for an Index, by which the said Semiellipsis is to be rectified. And therefore it is best that the threed I K be laid just in the longer diameter, which is the 6 a clock line.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Take the lesser Parallelogram and put it into its place, as close to the end A B as it will go, and when it is there laid, observe where the threed lies upon the lower Area, and draw the line upon which it lies, which must be the line 90, 90; upon which the Scales (that are inscribed) must take their beginning. And likewise you are to take the longer Radius O M, and as the plate there lies, set one foot of that Radius upon O, and let the other reach as far as it will, which must be upon the rising limbe beyond the inner edge of it, so much as M N comes to: in that point you are to make one center: so again, turning your lesser plate about, you must lay it in the contrary way, close to A B, as you did before, and from the point O you may finde the second center: both these centers (in each of which must a threed be fastned) will happen to fall in the former line 90, and 90, neer the points T and V.</p>

but the degrees of a Circle projected thereon from the two centers: which may therefore without difficulty be done either from the degrees of a Circle, or else by Tangent lines, as any man will easily perceive.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Secondly, For the other Scales you must make them parallel to the edge of the limbs. There are three of them in number: The longest is a Scale of Tangents: The mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlemost is a Scale of houres, made in the form of a line of Sines: The third is a Zodiac, or Scale of the year.</p>
                     <p>The Tangents are made thus. Taking M O as Radius, finde the Co-sine of your Latitude agreeable thereto: and making that Co-sine as a Radius, or Tangent of 45 degrees, all the other Tangents are to be fitted accordingly. Then to know how far of this line will be usefull, put the lesser plate again into its place, as close to the end C D as it will go, so shall the threed I K shew the furthest point of it that will be usefull.</p>
                     <p>The middle Scale of Sines is made thus. Count the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of your Latitude upon the new made Tangent line, and from the beginning of the Scale to that point, make a line of Sines for six houres and their quarters, so shall this Scale be fitted.</p>
                     <p>The Zodiac or Annual Scale is equall in length to the Tangent of 23 <hi>gr.</hi> 30 <hi>min.</hi> and the manner of inscription with Tables whereby to do it, are set down before, and need not be here repeated.</p>

                     <p>The upper plate therefore being rectified, either to the Suns place, or to the Stars Declination, the threed will shew upon the middle Scale, the Ascensionall difference, if you count the houres how many they are from 6. It shews the Seminocturnall arks, by the houres of setting and rising be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rightly taken according to the condition of North or South declination. It shews the time of Sun rising and setting, according to the houres upon which it lies. But for the Stars, it shews only upon what houre-circles they rise and set; but the true houre or time thereof must be found by turning the Stars houre into the Suns houre, which (as I said before) will be done with most ease by an ordinary Nocturnall, in which the Stars (that you deal with) are placed.</p>

                     <p>In the first of these Propositions I suppose the Azimuth, in the second I suppose the Houre to be given by observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For the observing of these two, you may make in any convenient window, both an Horizontall Diall, with a threed Axis lying in the Axis of the world, and an Azimuth Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle with a threed Axis, standing upright in the Zenith line. The divisions sutable to both these, may be inscribed upon the board of the window; and for the Sun, the shadow of the threed will give the houre of it upon the Horizontall Diall; or the Azimuth upon the Azimuthall Circle. But for the Stars that cast no shadows, you may make sliding sights, that may move upon the edge of the window board, or may be upon the bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And those moving sights must be furnished with short wires or pins which may best stand upon the edge of the sight, and go down to the window board, and to the divisions that are drawn upon it, which may be both for sights by which to looke at the standing Index and Star both together, and must serve as Indexes to shew the houre or Azimuth on which a Star is at any time. Only this generall caution must be given, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It were more expedient therefore that the Ellipsis were divided into houres and degrees, rather then into quarters and half quarters of houres. Which division (as also the description of it) may by protraction be performed by those rules that are given before.

                  <p>A lesser Ellipsis (I say) must be described, which though it be lesse, yet it must be like and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall to the former.</p>
                  <p>Therefore assuming any length as M P, for the longer Radius, you must (to that Radius) make M R and M S equall<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Then again, to this new Ellipsis there must a new Scale of Tangents be made, whose length must be limited as the former was, in this manner. To M P as Radius, finde the Co-sine of your Latitude, and make that Co-sine a Radius or Tangent of 45 <hi>gr.</hi> and according thereunto, continue the Scale of Tangents as far as it will go. It must begin upon the same line that the other Scale of Tangents began, and must go the same way with it. And in this new way of ordering the Scales and the Ellipses, it must be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what the other parts of the Instrument do signifie</p>
                  <p>The end of the lower plate, upon which the Scales be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, must be accounted for the North, the other end C D is to be taken for South. The side lines are the Meridian. The degrees of the limbs are to be used as the degrees of

the Equinoctiall. The threed applyed to those degrees are the Meridians comming from the Centers, which are the North Pole. The Tangents are the degrees of Altitude. The Ellipsis notes out that Almicantar which the threed Index stands unto upon the Tangent Scale.</p>
                  <p>And further. It is to be here noted, that if the Meridians (or threeds comming from the center) were rightly divided, those divisions or parts of it should signifie the degrees of Declination from the Equinoctiall. But the inconvenience of it is, that because one Ellipsis is to represent every Almi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantar, therefore the Radius cannot possibly be at all times the same in length, but must varie according to the removing or severall positions of the said Ellipsis. That is, when the Ellipsis signifies the Horizon (or stands at the beginning of the Scales, without any altitude at all) then the Radius M O in the first moving plate, or M P in the second moving plate, is the Scale of Declinations, but at other times, when the Ellipsis signifies any Almicantar, then must the Secant of that Almicantar (of Altitude) be taken as the Radius for that particular work. But alwayes the Radius (of what length soever it be) must be divided as a whole line of Sines, the greatest parts beginning towards the center, the least parts ending at the remotest end from the center, and yet then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the numeration of the parts or declinations of it must begin at the remotest end, and must end in the center at the Pole.</p>
                  <p>It might be applyed to use in the motions of the Stars, but that would be troublesome; therefore it shall suffice to make it usefull only for the Sun.</p>
                  <p>The best way that (for the present) I know whereby to divide this Radius (thus of severall lengths) is this. Divide the length from the center T to C into 90 Sines (the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57111:29"/>
greatest parts beginning at the center, but numbered the contrary way.) This line may be drawn from the center T into some part of the limbe, where it may have room to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive divisions. Then with your Compasses take the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius T V, equall to M O, and from the end of the former Scale, open the threed to the least distance, and where the threed stayes, there make a mark upon the limbe V D, for there is a new Scale to begin, for the Secants that were men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before.</p>
                  <p>Then lay the threed from T to 80 in the opposite limb, and move the Ellipsis till the point O fall just under the threed, and take T O in your Compasses, and put in that distance as before, so shall you put in 10 <hi>gr.</hi> into this new Scale. In like manner lay the threed to 70, 60, &amp;c. and bring the Ellipsis till the point O lies under it, so shall T O (in these severall positions) give the lengths to be inscribed in this new Scale, for 20 <hi>gr.</hi> and 30 <hi>gr. &amp;c.</hi> all the rest must be done in like manner, till you have put in as many as will come within the reach of the limb, which will be upon 60 <hi>gr.</hi> or thereabout.</p>
                  <p>The like should also be done for the lesser Ellipsis, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the same manner by the threed and the point P. These are called the new inscribed Scales.</p>
                  <p>The former line of Sines serves to them both indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently.</p>
                  <p>Now when things are thus fitted, the uses of them will be such as in particular Astrolabes is vulgarly known.</p>

                     <p>First, For North Declinations. Set the Ellipsis to the Altitude counted in the Tangent Scale. Then count the same Altitude in the new inscribed Scale of Secants, and thereto lay the threed. Afterwards, take the least distance from the Suns declination, (counted in the fore-mentioned inscribed Scale of Sines) to the threed. Set one foot of that distance in the center, and extend the other till it crosse the Ellipsis, and where it crosseth, thither apply the threed, which (in the limb) will shew the Houre and scruple (in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees) required. The same point of the Compasses doth also immediately shew (upon the Ellipsis) the Azimuth sought for. If the Compasses do crosse the Ellipsis twice (as somtimes it will) take that crossing that is furthest from the Meridian.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, for South declinations. The work is in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the same: only you must note that the threed will crosse the Ellipsis twice, and you are in this case to take that cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing which is neerest to the Meridian.</p>
                     <p>By supposing the Altitude to be 00, that is, by laying the Ellipsis upon the line T V, and using the Declination as before, you may finde both the Amplitude and Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionall difference as before, and what else doth thereon depend.</p>
                     <p>But because these things being done neer the Horizon, will not prove good, especially when the Declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is little from the Equinoctiall: and because the work at the best is but troublesome, I shall here break off, supposing that I have already written too much.</p>

                        <p>First, <hi>The Equinoctiall Circle, and all the Parallels of Declination, are projected upon the plain of the Horizon into like Ellipses. And that they are all of them divided (by the Meridians) alike or proportionally one to the other.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The reason of this may be conceived upon this ground. Since the Equinoctiall and all the Parallels are Circles of a just parallel situation one to the other (as their name imports:) therefore on what point soever of the horizontall Axis the eye is placed, the said Circles must be Ellipses (excepting only if the eye be placed upon the superficies of the Sphere, for then, and only then, they will be all perfect Circles,) as all that write upon this subject do sufficiently make good: and consequently, when the eye is placed upon the same Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is, in an infinite distance, as this Projection supposeth. But the second thing is more to our purpose, and that is, that all their degrees and quarters, and other like parts, art like and proportionall one to the other (not all the parts of one and the same Ellipsis are like, that is equall, one to the other, as in the Circles themselves upon the Sphere they are, but each one of these Ellipses is justly like any other of them, both in the whole, and likewise when any of the like parts of one be compared with the like parts of the other, as one quarter, &amp;c. with another.) And the reason briefly is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the eye is supposed (in this Orthographical Projection)
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57111:32"/>
to stand in an infinite distance from the plain on which the projection is made; and because it doeh stand in an infinite distance, therefore all these Circles are alike situated to the eye, and consequently must make a like or proportionall Projection of every of those parallels with their like situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted parts. But if the eye should stand at a finite distance, then these parallels would not have a like situation to the eye, neither in respect of distance, nor in respect of position, and so the like parts of the parallels could not be like one to the other in the Projection, because of their different positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But in the Orthographicall Projection at an infinite distance all things will be alike, being alike projected from a like position. I say in this it will be so, and in none besides this.</p>

                     <head>The application of these things to the purpose intended.</head>
                     <p>First, In the Projection it selfe we are to consider these things.</p>
                     <p>If it be furnished with parallels and houres, as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is, and laid horizontally with the Meridian line of it just North and South: and if further, there be an upright In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex set in the Zenith point at Z, then shall the shadow of that erect Index represent the Azimuth in which the Sun is, and if you note where it cuts the Parallel wherein the Sun (for that day) is, the same shadow will shew (among the houres of that parallel) the time of the day.</p>
                     <p>This conclusion is true upon any Horizontal Projection (the Stereographicall as well as the Orthographicall) for the streight lines or Azimuths whether shadow or Index com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from the Zenith, and cutting through any houre in any parallel, doth shew the Azimuth in which the Sun must be at that houre for the day of that parallel.</p>
                     <p>And further, because all the Projection is made upon the plain of the Horizon (which therefore must be the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Circle of the Projection, and) which for that cause is, and must be (as all fundamental Circles of any Projection are) equally divided; Therefore an upright Index standing
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57111:34"/>
in Z the center of it, and so answering to the Zenith line of the Sphere, and the degrees of the Horizontall Circle an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering to the degrees of the Horizon in the Sphere. I say the shadow of that Index doth really shew the true Azimuths of the Sun, or the true angles of position that the Sun at any time maketh with the Meridian line. And further, the same shadow or Azimuth where it crosseth the Parallel of the day (which Parallel is divided into its proper parts, like to the parts of the Equinoctiall, by the Meridian Circles issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Poles) it notes out also the houre of the day.</p>
                     <p>So that the Projection made in this manner with an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Index and divided Parallels, will (by the shadow of that Index) shew the true houre of the day upon that parallel that is proper for the day, if the Meridian of the Projection lie in the true Meridian of the Horizon.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>The next thing to be shewed, is how the Ellipticall Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall may supply the use of all the Parallels.</head>
                     <p>That is to say, How the Equinoctiall, being made mova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and the Index standing alwayes still, may be fitted to represent any of the Suns parallels. And because (as was said before) it is every way like to each of the Parallels, it will therefore be only required to give some rule how the said Equinoctiall may be at any time placed in a like positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Zenith point at <hi>Z,</hi> that any parallel hath to the same point, so as that any right line (or Azimuth) being drawn from thence may cut a like part or point in the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall that it doth in the Parallel.</p>
                     <p>Let the Parallel be H E, I would remove the Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Ae A so, as that it might have a like position to the point <hi>Z,</hi> that the Parallel H E hath.</p>
                     <p>By the <hi>Corollary</hi> of the first <hi>Lemma,</hi> it may represent it. By the <hi>Corollary</hi> of the second <hi>Lemma,</hi> the way of it will be
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57111:34"/>
easie. For first, the two Ellipses H E and Ae A, have their centers upon the Meridian line Ae H <hi>Z</hi> P, as upon one of their common Diameters. Secondly, the Parallel H E cuts the six a clock Circle, or Meridian P E A, in the point E, making E A equall in radiall degrees to H Ae (for the Parallel is every where equidistant to the Equator, and the Meridional Arks, therefore, intercepted between them, such as are E A and H Ae, must be equall.) So that E A is the Declination of that Parallel from the Equinoctiall. If therefore the line (or Azimuth) <hi>Z</hi> E be drawn infinitely through the point of 6 in the Parallel, or through the Declination (of that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel) counted in the Circle of six; and then the Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all (still keeping its center upon the common Diameter Ae P) be slipped up till the point A thereof do concur with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite line (drawn before) at G; in thus doing, I say that the Equinoctiall is in a like situation to the point <hi>Z,</hi> that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel H E is in, to the same point. And consequently, that any right line (or Azimuth) from <hi>Z,</hi> will cut the same (rather like) parts in one that it doth in the other. As by the <hi>Corol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary</hi> of the second <hi>Lemma</hi> will appear.</p>

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>The next thing to be enquired is, what the line A G is, or how it must be found and estimated.</head>
                     <p>For this purpose, consider, that <hi>Z</hi> P E and <hi>Z</hi> C O are two Triangles rectangled at P and C, and having a common an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle at <hi>Z</hi>; therefore, As <hi>Z</hi> P Co-sine of the Latitude, to <hi>Z</hi> C the Radius; So P E, the Co-tangent of the Declination, to the Tangent of C O. Or, As the Radius <hi>Z</hi> C, to the Co-sine of the Latitude <hi>Z</hi> P; so is the Tangent of E A, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels Declination, to the Tangent of A O, that is, to the line A G, which is the Tangent of A O, because the arke A O is expressed in its full quantity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging or fore-shortning, and the right line A G stands
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57111:35"/>
to it as a Tangent thereof, standing at the end of the Radius Z A. Now consider, that if Z C be considered as Radius, then must the Tangent of E A be the Tangent of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellels declination, estimated to the same Radius. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Z P is in the selfe same proportion to A C, therefore: If Z P (the Co-sine of the Latitude) be estimated for a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius, then must A G be esteemed as the Tangent (of this Parallels declination) to the said Radius Z P. And hence it will follow that</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Z</hi> P the Co-sine of the Latitude [being taken (as that Co-sine) to the Radius <hi>Z</hi> C or <hi>Z</hi> A, which is the longer Radius of the Ellipticall Equinoctiall] be counted as a Radius or Tangent of 45 <hi>gr.</hi> and so be divided and continued as occasion shall be, It is to be noted I say, That this Scale thus limited will be a right Scale for the requisite motion of the Ellipticall Equinoctiall to such a position in respect of the Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith point, as that it may represent any parallel, whose Declination is known, if it be removed to the same Declination counted upon that Scale. And being set in that like posture, any Azimuth or shadow of the upright Index that would passe through any houre point of the Parallel, will also passe through the same point of the Equinoctiall, and so this one may serve for them all.</p>
                     <p>This gives the reason of making the Zodiac or Annuall Scale, mentioned in the former Treatise, I say it gives the reason of the second way mentioned for lesser Latitudes. For if either the Signes of the Zodiac, or the moneths of the year be put in according to their declinations taken in this
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57111:35"/>
Scale, it will be all one to set your Ellipsis to the Signe or Moneth, that it is to set it to the Declination, since they are made one to answer to the other.</p>
                     <p>Then for the first way for greater Latitudes: because,</p>

                     <p>You see that if you divide the Co-sine of your Latitude into 45 Tangents; or the Sine of your Latitude into the Tangent of your Latitude, the Scale will be all one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the former proportion.</p>
                     <p>What is before spoken of North Parallels of Declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is the same in South also, and one Scale (for the kinde of it) serves both; only in North Declinations the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall goes neerer to the Zenith point, in South it goes further of.</p>
                     <p>All other Scales annexed to the Ellipsis have their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance wholly upon this Scale of Declinations, and will not need any further explication in this place.</p>
                     <p>Then again, it matters not where the little Scale or Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diac stands, so that it give the just quantity of removall for the Equinoctiall Ellipsis.</p>
                     <p>And so also, it is no matter whether the Index move, and the Equinoctiall stand, or contrarily: It is only required that their situation be such as may make the foot of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex stand in a proportionall position to the station of the Parallel, as was formerly shewed.</p>
                     <p>Further. For the circular year or Zodiac, the ground of it is thus. The Circle is supposed to be divided into equall

parts or degrees: and so every Sine (as is D F) is a proper Sine to any arke (as D C) to which it is annexed. Again, A B in another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration is to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed (as formerly for the Semidiameter of the Circle, so now again) for the Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of 23½ degrees, whence this propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will stand:</p>
                     <p>As the Radius A B, Is to the Sine F D; So the same A B, tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of 23½<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To the Tangent A E. Which is the Tange<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t belonging to the Right Ascension C D.</p>

                     <p>If therefore you have the Right Ascension belonging to any day, and put it into the Circle of equall degrees, as C D here is, the Sine of that Right Ascension, <hi>viz.</hi> F D, will be equall to A E the Tangent belonging to that Right Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, if B A be taken for the Tangent of 23½ <hi>gr.</hi> So that this way of putting in Moneths and Signes is the same in

The distinction is, because they are made to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Meridian than is their own, that is, to the Meridian of the place, and all the account of houres is deduced from it.

                        <pb n="67" facs="tcp:57111:37"/>But in this <hi>Section</hi> there is mention made of a Circle (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steed of the Horizontall Ellipsis) elevated to the height of the Equinoctiall. The reason of that will best be seen out of the Sphere it selfe, For there we know, that the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall and all the Parallels to it are both equally divided, and equally elevated, and so being all alike, the Equinoctiall may supply the room of each and all of them. Only it must be required (whether the Index move toward the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; or the Circle towards it) that this motion (if the Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac be upon the Horizontall plain) be limited by an Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontall Zodiac, such as was used for the Ellipsis upon any plain, (which plain, what ever it be, I now count as an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontall plain.) But if the Index be made to move upon the Equinoctiall (which though it do, yet it must still lie in the Zenith line, not perpendicular to the circular plain, but making an angle with it equall to the Latitude of the place, and not the Latitude of the plain.) If, I say, the Index be made to move upon the Equinoctiall plain, then must a new Scale be made like to that upon the Horizontal plain, but somewhat larger; that is, it must be augmented so as that the parts and whole of the Horizontall Scale, to the parts and whole of this Equinoctiall Scale; must be as the Radius, to the Co-secant of the Latitude. Or thus. Because, As the Radius, to the Co-secant of the Latitude; so the Sine of the Latitude to the Radius: and so again, the Co-sine of the Latitude, to the Co-tangent of the Latitude. Therefore, whereas on the Horizontall plain (for the Ellipsis thereon described) you looke the Co-sine of your Latitude, and make it a Radius or Tangent of 45 <hi>gr.</hi> you must in this take the Co-tangent of your Latitude, and make it a Radius or Decimall Scale; and by it you may put on the Zodiac or moneths as was prescribed before.

For from this Circle proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Orthographically (that is, by perpendiculars let fall from the Periphery to the subjacent plain) is the Ellipsis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and from that Ellipsis (again) is this Circle raised or restored. And so the reason of this Circular Diall with an upright Index will be understood well enough.</p>
                     <p>Then whereas it is said that it makes no matter which way this Circle be raised, that is, whether toward North or South, there is no difficulty in this, for which way soever it is turned, if the plain and center of it lie in a just distance from the Index or Zenith line, the same Index must shew the same point or houre, because in both wayes they are situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated from it upon the same Coast.</p>

                  <p>The way that I intend, is partly by projection of such lines as are usefull, and partly by inscription of such points as the Ellipticall line is to passe through, as shall be seen hereafter.

And consequently to these upright In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dexes there can no such Diall be made upon any upright plain.

First then, assume any point in the Index as at E, and from thence (by the projecting Quadrant, or some Levell) cast an Horizontall levell line as F G upon the plain; or if it cannot be cast upon the plain it selfe, set any board (for a time) that may receive it; lying in the same Levell with the assigned point at E. And further, the same Horizontall line must be continued and returned about the point E, by help of threeds stretched out from some points or other of the Horizontall line before drawn, as from F or G, unto two supporters set up (for a while) for this purpose (either upon the plain or otherwise neer to it) as is to be seen at H and I: so that now the points H F G I are all in one and the same Horizontall levell to one another, and likewise to the first point of the Index assumed at E.</p>

                     <p>BY the Meridians inclination is meant what angle the same line maketh with the plain of the Horizon, and in the former figure <hi>Pag.</hi> 70 it is expressed by the complement of the angle D A P, or the excesse of it. To finde it, you may either apply the edge of an Inclinatorie square to the said Meridian line, and then the threed (being drawn per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly down by the plummet) will shew the said ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation (or inclination) of the Meridian line above the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, in the degrees of the limbe, if the same degrees be taken to the threed from that side of the Square that stands perpendicularly upon the Meridian line. Or else another way may be by protracting or measuring the angle D A P,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57111:43"/>
which is the complement of the former required inclination. It may be done thus. Set one foot of your Compasses at A, and let the other foot be extended to any point of the Index, suppose to 8, then measure the same length A 8 upon the Meridian line, which let be A 7, and to this length fit your line of Chords (upon the Sector, or some like opening Scale of Chords.) Then take the length from 7 to 8, and measure the same upon your Scale of Chords, so shall you finde the quantity of the angle D A P, whose complement (or excesse) is the inclination, or elevation, or depression of the Meridian, which is here required.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. IF the Diall be described upon an irregular superficies, such as is not flat but writhen (as by this course it may very well be) then it is most convenient that the former Scale be set in some other place, and not upon the superfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es whereon the Ellipsis is described. It may be contrived two wayes.</p>
                     <p>First, If the Diall superficies (how irregular soever it be on that face whereon the houres are inserted) be flat at the bottome, and be made to move (the Index standing still) upon some other plain below it) then the best way will be to make the Zodiacall Index upon the moving bottome of it, and to describe the Zodiac upon the other plain upon which the motion is made. And to do this aright, you must project the Meridian line upon that nether plain, and finde out the inclination of it, and so finde the Scale by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant of that inclination, just as you were before directed. And so this work will be compleat.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57111:44"/>
The motion of dials unequall Superficies must be in or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to this last projected Meridian line, alwayes so as that the Meridian of the Diall must passe through the fiduc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now in this case of unequall Superficies, it is supposed that this foot of the Index cannot move parallel to that uneven Superfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, but must move streight forward in some right line, just along with the Meridian line. In this case you must finde the inclination of the foot of the Index to the Horizon, that is, what inclination a line drawn upon the foot of the Index, either in or parallel to the Meridian line, hath to the Horizon, which must be done by some Inclinatorie Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or some such way as is used in taking the Reclination or Inclination of Plains. And when this is done, you are to finish the Zodiac Scale by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Note here; That if to an Index standing in the Zenith line, a Plain be set in the Equinoctiall, the same plain shall have a Circular Diall upon it, equally divided. Then whether the said Equinoctiall plain or the Index move, if they be made to move upon the Horizontall plain, the Zodiac for the Horizontall plain must serve. But if the upright (or Zenith line) Index be made to move upon the Equinoctiall plain, the former Horizontall Zodiac must be set upon the Equinoctiall plain, and must there be enlarged above the Horizontall Zodiac, that is, every part of the Horizontall Zodiac must be made greater upon the Equinoctiall plain in proportion as the Radius to the Co-secant of the Latitude. That is, the Scales that made the Horizontall, being taken as Radius, must now here be enlarged to be as Co-secant of your Latitude; and from them (so enlarged) must the parts of the Zodiac be inscribed upon the Equinoctiall plain.</p>
                     <p>Note further. That for this Equinoctiall plain which is to descend downwards from South towards North, you may insteed of it set another plain quite contrarily, that is, des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending from North towards South; which will be the most convenient of the two, because the upper face of this will give the houre all the Seasons of the year, whereas the other will be only for Sommer upon the upper face of it, and will require an under face for Winter.</p>

                        <p>But if it lie leaning, then is it to be dealt withall in this place.</p>
                        <p>And first for the re / in-clination, it is best to be taken by some inclinatory (square or other) Instrument. The manner of the work is the very same that is performed
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57111:45"/>
in finding the re / in-clination of a plain: because the fiduciall edge of the Index is (here) like the Verticall line of a re / in-clining plain, and the application of the Square must here be the same to this edge that was there to the verticall line of the plain, and the degrees of re / in-clination are to be numbered in both these cases alike. So that it will not be needfull here to make repetition of that which is so often elswhere decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. You are here also to observe whether the re / in-clination be towards the North or towards the South.</p>
                        <p>Then for the declination do thus.<figure/> Suppose the Index to be A B. From the end of it that is furthest from the plain, as B, let fall or raise the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular B C, and let B C be some materiall object unto which the side of a Quadrant may be applyed. Or if they should be threeds (and so too
<figure/>
weake for such a purpose) you may extend another threed, as is D E, which may touch the two former threeds A B and C D, and so lie in the same plain with them, and then
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57111:46"/>
to this threed D E apply some upright plain or materiall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which may serve the intended work.</p>
                        <p>To this new plain therefore, or to the two lines A B, C D, apply one of the streight edges of a Quadrant, the limbe of it being turned alwayes towards the Sun, and observe the Horizontall distance of the Sun, as is usually done in finding the declinations of plains. Only here take this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that you count not this Horizontall distance from that side of the Quadrant which is perpendicular to the plain, but from that side which lies in the line E D, or upon the two lines A B, B C. And further, you are alwayes to account this Horizontall distance from that end of the Quadrants side which lookes the same way that the point B (of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex, which is furthest remote from the plain A C) doth look: as in the second figure is exprest, where the Horizontall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is more than a Quadrant, it being there to be accounted from F to H. Or for more easie conceit, you may alwayes suppose your Quadrant in that posture to be continued to a Semicircle, as is done in the second figure: and then count your Horizontall distance from that term of the Semicircles Diameter which respecteth the same coast of the heavens with that point of the Index which is most remote from the plain, which is B; that is, you must count it from F, and so the Horizontall distance will be F G H, more than a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant, in this particular case.</p>
                        <p>The Horizontall distance being thus accounted and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, you are immediately to take the Suns Altitude and to finde the Azimuth. Then for the declination of the Index, that is to know into what coast of the world, that is into what Azimuth of the Heavens (it being continued from the plain at A infinitely forwards toward B) it would point into: I say to finde this, you have only the same work to do
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57111:46"/>
which is usually done in finding the declinations of plains, the same work without any difference at all. And therefore I shall not here give any further directions in this particular, because I have done it often enough in other places, to which the Reader may have recourse.</p>
                        <p>And so I suppose the position of the Index in respect of re / in-clination and declination to be fully found out, both for coast and quantity; by which two things known, we are further to enquire what Longitude from our Meridian, and what Latitude the said Index pointeth unto, which will be the next Proposition.</p>
                        <p>¶ Note, that though I call A C a plain, yet it may be any curved Superficies as well as a plain, for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all will be described upon one as well as the other indifferently.</p>

                        <p>Now in the second case before given where the Index points downwards, or under the Horizon, where the plain is inclining, and so looking downward, we may shape the Projection a little otherwise, and the work then will be as easie as the former.

which shall represent the Pole of the World. And then further, if from the foot of the Index at A, to this Pole, you fasten a threed, the same threed will represent the true Axis of the world comming from the foot of the Index.</p>

When this is done, take the distance between the two knots <hi>m</hi> and <hi>n,</hi> and measuring it upon the same line of Chords, you shall finde what angle is contained between X A and A B. If A X therefore point from A towards the North Pole, and that X A B be lesse than a Quadrant, then doth the complement of that angle X A B give the North Latitude whereinto the Index pointeth: but if X A B be more than a Quadrant,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57111:49"/>
then doth the excesse give that South Latitude whereinto the Index pointeth. And so contrarily, if A X had pointed from A towards the South Pole, then the angle X A B being lesse than a Quadrant would give the quantity of South La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude: but if X A B had been greater than a Quadrant, then the excesse would give the North Latitude into which the Index tendeth.</p>
                        <p>All the difficulty in this work is, that there is no stable place whereon to fix the Compasses for measuring of the distance between the two knots <hi>m</hi> and <hi>n:</hi> but you may hold somthing underneath close to one of the points (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out disturbing the threeds place) on which setting one foot of your Compasses, you may measure the distance of the other point. Or else, because it is supposed that the threed Axis A X is fixed upon some solid thing at X, you may open your Compasses to the Radius A X (to which also you are to have a Radius of Chords equall) and set the same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent from A to R upon the Index (prolonging the Index if need be by a threed till it come to be of a competent length) and there fasten a slipping knot. Then because X is a stable point, you may take the extent from X (setting one foot of your Compasses in that point) to R, and measure the same upon your Scale of Chords, where it will give the former angle X A R, which is to be used as is shewed before.</p>
                        <p>There will be found other wayes to do this last work. So much therefore for the Latitude.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, For the Longitude of the Index, it will not be so easily had as the other was. The way that best likes me (amongst many others) for the present, is this. By the <hi>Precepts, Pag.</hi> 70. you must make some observation of the Sun's Azimuth (and so must you also do by the last prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Proposition</hi>) and you finde what Azimuth that is too.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57111:49"/>
You may also (further) project it upon your Diall superfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and then you have two Azimuths upon the said superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, namely, the Meridian, and the observed Azimuth. You are to know yet further, what Altitudes the Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all hath upon these two Azimuths. And for the Meridian it is certain enough that the Altitude there, is equall to the complement of your Latitude. For the other Azimuth say thus.</p>
                        <p>As the Radius, Is to the Co-tangent of your Latitude;</p>
                        <p>So is the Co-sine of your Azimuth, To the Tangent of the Equinoctials altitude upon that Azimuth Circle.</p>
                        <p>After this you must make some mark or knot upon your Axis A X, which suppose to be at <hi>m,</hi> and then with your projecting Quadrant (upon your Meridian and Azimuth) from the point <hi>m,</hi> set on the respective Equinoctiall Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, as the manner of projecting by that Instrument useth to be.</p>
                        <p>Next, you must project this Equinoctiall Circle all over the Diall-superficies (and upon some other objects where need shall be,) suppose it here to be the line S V.</p>
                        <p>And furthermore, you are to proiect the Axis A X, and the Index A B, one upon the other, and to observe the line that they both (in that position) do make upon the Diall-superficies, and other objects if need be. I say you must, first, principally observe this line, for it is the proper Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian line to the Index or Zenith line A B, because it passeth (<hi>quoad superficiem</hi>) through both the Axis of the world and the Zenith line. Suppose it in the former plain to be A ☉. And secondly you must note the intersection that this line makes with the Equinoctiall line which was now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57111:50"/>
which we may imagine to be at V, upon some object laid in the way of purpose. And so also you must (thirdly) take notice of the intersection of the Equinoctiall line with the Meridian line, which suppose at S. For these two E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall intersections and the point <hi>m,</hi> all three together, must do what we now intend.</p>
                        <p>The thing here now intended is, to know what angle is contained between the two superficies X A B, and X A T, which are two Meridian circles, or (which is the same) the angle V <hi>m</hi> S in the plain of the Equinoctiall, which angle measures the said inclination of the two forenamed Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as it doth of all Meridians.</p>
                        <p>Now to measure this angle V <hi>m</hi> S, the best way will be first to extend two threeds, one from V to <hi>m,</hi> and the other from S to <hi>m,</hi> crossing each other at <hi>m,</hi> and they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued further till they meet with some object (in the way standing, or else set for that purpose) where they may be both fixed as at F and G. Then measure from S to <hi>m,</hi> and from V to <hi>m,</hi> which is the shortest, suppose S <hi>m</hi> to be the shortest, and V <hi>m</hi> the longest. First, take V <hi>m,</hi> and lay it down in a line, as there is done. Then take S <hi>m,</hi> and measure it on the same line from M to S or D. Thirdly, take the distance from V to D out of this line, and set it from V to D, upon the line V <hi>m,</hi> so shall <hi>m</hi> S and <hi>m</hi> D be equall one to the other. To this distance therefore <hi>m</hi> S or <hi>m</hi> D as a Radius, open some line of Chords, then take the Chord or subtense from S to D (S is a stable point upon which you may firmly set your Compasses) and measure the same length upon your line of Chords, where you shall see how many degrees the angle S <hi>m</hi> D or S <hi>m</hi> V containeth.</p>
                        <p>Now all this businesse is to finde how great an angle is contained between the South part of the Meridian of the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57111:50"/>
place, and the Meridian belonging properly to the Zenith line. But here (if it be observed well) the angle now measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red is made between the proper Meridian and the North part of the Meridian of the place, so that this angle must be the supplement (to a Semicircle) of what is required. The supplement therefore of the angle now found, is (in this case) the Longitude or Meridian into which the Zenith line A B pointeth. I say the supplement of that angle is the proper Meridian of the Zenith line; or the difference of Longitude proper to that line, from the Meridian of the place. But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as the angle V <hi>m</hi> S doth measure the inclination or angle of this proper Meridian from the North part of the Meridian of the place, and that the shadow of the Index A B doth first come to the proper Meridian A O before it comes to A T the Meridian of the place: we may therefore in such case say, that the angle V <hi>m</hi> S gives the difference of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude; and that the said difference of Longitude lies East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from the South part of the Meridian of the place, as there in the Figure it appears to lie Westward from the North part. Suppose that the difference of Longitude were 39 <hi>gr.</hi> 25 <hi>min.</hi> and the proper Latitude 40 <hi>gr.</hi> And so much for this also.</p>
                        <p>If this way be thought not feasible enough, the former in the second Proposition may be used; yet variety in all kindes is delightfull, and not to be rejected in this. It is done, you see, without having respect to any declination or re / in-clination, which the former was founded upon.</p>

place, and to any Latitude differing from the Latitude of your place. After that the difference of Longitude is known, you are first to frame a Table of angles at the Pole, which will not be hard to perform, and the manner of it will be seen best in an Example, being altogether like the computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the said angles at the Pole for the houres of any place to the same declining plain.</p>
                        <p>I have here first of all in a generall Table set down the graduall distances of houres and quarters from 12 at noon or mid-day, which will be some help in performing the work. The houres that are on the left side of the degrees are the East or forenoon houres, and those on the right hand are the West or afternoon houres. Suppose (as before <hi>Prop.</hi> 4.) a difference of Longitude were given 39 <hi>gr.</hi> 25 <hi>min.</hi> towards the East, and it were required to know what angles our hours (namely those 12 that stand neerest to it, six upon one side, and six upon the other) with their intermediate quarters do make with this Longitude or Proper Meridian, for so I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to call it.</p>
                        <p>I first take the given Longitude or Proper Meridian, 39 <hi>gr.</hi> 25 <hi>min</hi> and enter it among the East houres of the generall Table, and I since it to fall in at A; that is, between a quarter and halfe an houre past 9 before noon, and I finde also the circumstant numbers to be 37.30 the lesser, and 41.15 the greater. The differences between these two num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and the Longitude given, are 1 <hi>gr.</hi> 55 <hi>min.</hi> and 1 <hi>gr.</hi> 50 <hi>min.</hi> as you see them set down in the said generall Table right against the letter A.</p>
                        <p>These two differences are to be first placed in this second Table of Angles at the Pole, as you see in the Example, where, first of all is written Proper Meridian 00.00 separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the rest as signifying only the place where it is to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57111:52"/>
stand, and above it is placed (the difference between 37.30 and the proper Meridian 39.25, namely) 1 <hi>gr.</hi> 55 <hi>min.</hi> So again, below it is placed 1 <hi>gr.</hi> 50 <hi>min.</hi> (which is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of 39 <hi>gr.</hi> 25 <hi>min.</hi> the proper Meridian from the next greater number 41 <hi>gr.</hi> 15 <hi>min.</hi>) Now to these two radicall numbers, I adde ¼ ½ ¾ and one whole houre, namely <hi>a, b, c,</hi> and thereby produce <hi>e, f, g,</hi> on both sides the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Meridian. Then to <hi>r, e, f, g,</hi> I adde 15 <hi>gr. d,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the number of one houre, and thereby do further produce <hi>h, i, k, l,</hi> on both sides the Proper Meridian, as before. And afterwards for more ease, to the numbers <hi>r, e, f, g, h, i, k, l,</hi> I adde 30 <hi>gr.</hi> or two houres, and do thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce on both sides the eight numbers noted with the letter <hi>m.</hi> And so still adding 30 <hi>gr.</hi> to the last eight numbers no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>m,</hi> or else adding 60 <hi>gr.</hi> to the first eight numbers noted with <hi>r, e, f, g, h, i, k, l,</hi> I shall make the eight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining numbers noted with the letter <hi>n,</hi> both above and below, on both sides the Proper Meridian. And so this Table of Angles at the Pole is compleated, for if it should (in the same manner) be further continued, the next num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers (above) would be 91 <hi>gr.</hi> 55 <hi>min.</hi> and (below) 91 <hi>gr.</hi> 50 <hi>min.</hi> both greater than 90 <hi>gr.</hi> beyond which there will be neither need nor expedience to go.</p>
                        <p>This way of forming the angles I thought best to take, because it is more plain and easie than any other, which else might have been in this work used.</p>
                        <p>You are afterward to place the houres (in this last Table) about the Proper Meridian, just as you see their order to be about the letter A in the general Table, and as you see they are in this particular Table of Angles at the Pole.</p>
                        <p>The like work serves for West Longitudes.</p>
                        <p>Thus you have the angles for 12 houres and their quarters,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57111:52"/>
the same angles serve for the other 12 houres: and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is hereafter computed for any of these 12 houres, must be understood to serve also for the 12 opposites, and so the work will be done for the whole Circle, or 24 houres of the naturall day.</p>

                        <p>WE must suppose that this Longitude or Meridian which we have before mentioned, is proper to some Horizon or other, above which also the elevation of the Pole must be imagined known, which we may suppose to be 40 <hi>gr.</hi> as before, <hi>Prop.</hi> 4. In respect of this plain or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon it is, that the Spaces now mentioned are called Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontall Spaces.</p>
                        <p>The way to finde them for this Ellipticall work is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse to that which is usuall in declining plains. Namely thus,</p>
                        <p>As the Sine of the Poles elevation above this Horizon or Plain, Is to the Radius;</p>
                        <p>So is the Tangent of each of these angles at the Pole, To the Tangent of the Horizontall space belonging to each of those foresaid angles.</p>
                        <p>So having found all these Horizontall spaces severally by this form of calculation, you may set them into a Table, as here you see it done in the first of the two main Columns. They signifie the distances of every of the houres and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57111:53"/>

                        <p>WHen you know the position of your Index in respect of Longitude and Latitude, you may then compute two Tables to the same Meridian or difference of Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and to the Latitude of your Index, as is done before in the 7 <hi>Proposition,</hi> one of which Tables is of Horizontall Spaces, the other of Equinoctiall Altitudes or Depressions above and under that Horizon which is proper to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex or Zenith line casually placed.</p>
                        <p>By these two Tables the work will be done in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as was shewed before, <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. The manner of the work is this.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. You are to assume some point in your Index A B, let the point be C, where you may fasten some knot of threed that it may not be lost again.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. From this point you must draw an Horizontall line, not in the levell of your own Horizon, but in that Horizon which is proper to that Index or Zenith line A B: that is, it must lie perpendicular to A B, making right angles (in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part of it) to that line, and must have respect (in this perpendicularity) to the point C. The meaning is, you must imagine a plain to passe through the point C, and the same plain to be perpendicular to the line A B; or that the line A B is a perpendicular surgent line to the said plain passing through the point at C.</p>
                        <p>Now this work will be somewhat hard to perform if A B
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57111:55"/>
                           <figure/>
be a threed only, and not of some more stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy substance. Yet the best of it is, that there is no very great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisenesse here required, for the work to be done will be good though this Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall plain be not placed so exactly perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
                        <p>[And so it may be noted, that if other Dials be described by the Equinoctiall Circle and not by the Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, the work of drawing the Equinoctiall perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular to the Axis will be difficult, but though no great accuratenesse be used, yet the work will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect enough, and no way defective for the losse of a degree or two in the perpendicularity required, which I thought good here also to note, because I have omitted it in all my other Precepts of Projecting Dials.]</p>
                        <p>Wherefore you may do it by some Pastboard, applying one edge of it to any line projected from A B the Index, as to A D, and keeping the edge there, you may turn the flat of it to the Index A B, and draw a line by it, or make two pricks through it into the pastboard, whereby a line may be drawn, but above all note the point C upon it. Then to this line of the Index thus drawn, and from the noted point of it at C, erect a perpendicular: So applying your Pastboard
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57111:55"/>
to its former place again (the edge of it lying upon A D, and the flat of it applyed to the Index A B, and the point in it, noted for C, being again fitted to C in the Index, I say thus doing) you may note where the last drawn perpendicular doth cut the line A D (which must be extended by help of some threed if need be) suppose at E: at the point E (then) you must say that one point of the proper Horizontall line is to be taken. Then in like manner you must seeke another Horizontall point: first by projecting a line from the Index (any where) such as is A F, and by applying one edge of a pastboard to that line, and the plain of that pastboard to the Index A B, and so noting the point C, and drawing or mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the line A B upon it, &amp;c. as was done before. So you shall finde another point of the same Horizontal line or plain (rather) which suppose to fall at F.</p>
                        <p>Now having three points of the Horizontall plain at C, E, and F, (which I suppose not to lie in one and the same right line, for that must with carefulnesse be avoided here) you may project some part of that line upon the plain, as E F, the rest of it (so much as shall be found usefull) may be made up with returns of threed, and regulated or kept in the same plain by projection, as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of working that way useth to be, and as here you see exprest, by the line H E F G, lying in the same plain with the point C, and that whole plain lying perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to the Index A B.</p>
                        <figure/>
                        <p n="3">3. The next thing to be done is the drawing of the houre lines upon the plain. And the first

                           </gap>re presupposed to be done, is the drawing of the proper Meridian, performed by the 8 <hi>Prop.</hi> That (I say) is supposed as already done before any of this work is begun. Let the proper Meridian be A V. Having then made Tables (by the 7 <hi>Prop.</hi>) for the Horizontall Spaces of your hours from this proper Meridian A B; you must first apply a past<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board to the Horizontall line E F, and fit the center of it to C: and upon the Pastboard, project the proper Meridian from C to A V, or from C to P. And then by the Table of Horizontall Spaces in the 7 <hi>Prop.</hi> (for we now here suppose that this is the Diall for which those Tables were computed) you may (upon that pastboard) set off all the houres and quarters from the proper Meridian upon this pastboard: and applying the pastboard into its proper place, namely to the Horizontall line E P F, and to the point C, you may project the houres and parts of houres from the Pastboard to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontall line H E P F G, as the manner in this way of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alling is well known.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Having transferred the houre-points into the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontall line, you may (by help of your Index A B) project and draw the houre lines upon the plain, which we will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose done, because the manner of doing it is the same with that which was done before for upright Indexes.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. To know where the Ellipticall line must come, or to finde the points in those houre lines, through which it must passe, we must work in the same manner as before (in the 7 § of <hi>Pag.</hi> 7<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>.) is exprest, namely thus. We must make a Scale of right Sines of a fit length, and number them Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly, and out of that Scale we must take such Altitudes or Profundities (which you will, one or both) as the Table <hi>Pag</hi> 97. giveth, which Table we here suppose to be compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for this Example whereabout we now are. And taking
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57111:56"/>
these Altitudes from that Scale (that is, from the end at 90, to the altitude numbered upon the parts of the Scale) we must insert them into their respective houres to which they belong. They must be inserted in this manner. Having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken any altitude out of the Scale, and found the houre upon which it must be placed, you must set one foot of that extent upon the houre line (keeping it alwayes thereon, but) remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it untill the other foot being turned about, may only touch the fiduciall edge of the Index: and when the feet of the Compasses are thus fitted, you must note upon what point of the houre line the foot that is thereon doth stand, for through that point of that houre must the Ellipticall line passe.</p>
                        <p>The same manner of work you must perform upon every houre, untill you have gone through 12 of them, which do make up halfe the houres of the whole Diall. And if you strike the lines through the center, you shall have all the 24. And looke what is done upon any one houre line, the same is to be done upon the opposite. That is, looke what distance (upon a plain) the Ellipsis hath from the center upon any one line, the selfe same distance from the center must the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site line have. But if the description be made upon an uneven superficies, then this rule may not, perhaps, hold: yet this will; namely, Looke what distance from the Index (the least or perpendicular Index I mean) any point of the Ellip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis hath, the same perpendicular distance is to be given for the Ellipsis upon the opposite houre line. And by this means you may put in as many houres and Ellipticall points as you please. And through these points you are to draw the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipticall line.</p>

And it must be noted, that this proper Meridian thus projected never falls directly under any Index that is (not direct but) declining, but it falls aside from it, according as the Index stands aside from the proper Meridian upon the Diall superficies, and as it shall be laid by projecting it.</p>
                        <p>But if the Index move (the Diall standing still) then the fiduciall edge of it must be made to move alwayes according to, and in the very proper Meridian line it selfe, and not any where else, which may be contrived sundry wayes, as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man shall invent to his own liking.

                        <p>If the Index be made to move, then either the Zodiac may be set upon the foot of the Index which guides the motion of it, and the peculiar or Zodiacall Index may be set somewhere where it may stand to point at the Zodiac.

                        <p>The Index or Diall plate (that is the mover) must move according to the proper Meridian of the Diall Superficies, and precisely so, as that fiducial edge of the Index must move (not elsewhere, but) in the very proper Meridian it self. This is, if the Index move. But if the Diall Superficies move, then the proper Meridian thereof (or the Superficies of the proper Meridian, namely the Superficies made by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Meridian cutting through the Diall plate, which is of any thicknesse) must move directly upon, or through, the fiduciall edge of the Index. These things are intimated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And that the Zodiac is to be described upon a plain,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57111:58"/>
though the Diall it selfe be not so. And further, that if the Diall plate move, (though it be not a plain it selfe, yet) it must move upon a plain, and that the proper Meridian is to be described upon the same plain, and the motion to be directed according thereunto. These things are often incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, because they are hard to be conceived, and had need of the better consideration for that reason. Now further.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. If the Diall plate be supposed thus to move upon a plain, and on it the proper Meridian be drawn, then first of all, The angle is to be inquired that is made between the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex and that part of the proper Meridian which is projected upon the plain whereon the motion is made, which how to measure will be a hard matter to give rules for, because the variety of cases and positions of one to the other will be so various. It is first to be supposed, that it makes a just right angle with it, and consequently that the Zodiac is described upon the proper horizon of the Index. And if upon this supposition the Zodiac be to be limited, then the rule will be the same with the former given in the like case, namely thus. Upon your Scale of Sines (by which you described your Ellipticall line) take from 90, to the Latitude of the Index, and count that length for a new Radius, and keepe it. Then when you have found the forenamed angle (of finding which more is said <hi>Prop.</hi> 13. following) to this new Radius finde the Secant of the complement or excesse of that angle: this length or Secant will be the Tangent of 45 <hi>gr.</hi> or the Decimall Scale by which you are to describe the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diac on both sides from the Equinoctiall point or line, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the numbers in the generall Tables made for this purpose, <hi>Pag.</hi> 4, 5, 6, and 7.</p>

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57111:58"/>
you must set all in the same posture that they had when the Diall was described: and when you have made fit place for the Zodiac, and set on some pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Zodiacall Index, you must note the place upon which the said Zodiacall Index pointeth, for that place is the peculiar place for the Equinoctiall, from whence all the other parts of the Suns annuall course must be set on.]</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If the Index be made to move in any depth under the Diall superficies, then a slit must be made in the same Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies that the proper Meridian would cut, and the Index continued therein, down into one streight line till it meet with the foot whereon the Index is fixed, and which being moved, carryeth the Index along with it. And the Zodiac must be described either upon this foot (the Zodiacall Index being made to stand still while that said foot with its divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons moveth) and that also parallel to (or in) the proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian projected upon it: or else the foot must carry the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diacall Index, and the Zodiac must be described upon some other convenient place, as the sides (&amp;c.) of that foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned flat. And here, for limitation of the Zodiacs length, you must finde the Inclination of this moving foot to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex or Zenith line (which angle of inclination is mentioned before, and spoken of afterwards in the 13 <hi>Prop.</hi> following) and work directly as you did before by finding the new Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius, and the Secant of the complement (or excesse) of the angle.

And in this case the Index may be also set fast first, and quite finished before the Diall be drawn at all. Then also the Diall will be drawn more easily, and the motion of the Diall plate may sooner (this way) be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, then can the motion of the Index be contrived when the said Index is to move and the Diall stand still. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as hath been often said) must be according (that is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel) to the proper Meridian: and the slit (for the fiduciall edge of the Index) may be so contrived that the fiduciall edge it selfe (which is best to be a fine threed) may be also the proper Index, and the Zodiac may be described upon the Diall-moving-plate, closely contrived to the threed. Or thus at least, The lenght of the whole Zodiac may be so li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited as is before mentioned, and then if you desire to have it drawn upon some other place of the plain upon which the Diall superficies moveth, and the same Diall plate to carry the peculiar Index for the Zodiac; then (I say) by these two terms prefixed to the length of the Zodiac (by the fiduciall edge of the Index) having reference to the Diall-moving-plate (as before) you may determine the length of the same Zodiac upon the standing plate whereon the Diall plate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, for the new Zodiacall Index set fast into the moving plate, will (upon the standing plate) shew the terms of the same Zodiac suting with the terms upon the moving plate fitted to the standing Index. This will be direction enough because one way may serve as well as many. Yet I doubt not to set down many more which would be without end, if they were all put together, for inventions in this kinde would be too too many.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If the Index be thought best to move, then must a pattern of it (that is some threed) be first set up. And to this
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57111:60"/>
vice-Index must the Diall be described upon the plain (or whatever curved Superficies it be.) And the Zodiac is best to be fitted either upon the plain whereon the foot of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex is to move (for a plain it must move upon, whatever be the Superficies whereon the Diall is described) and that same foot to carry the Zodiacall Index upon it; or else upon the foot of the Index, and the Zodiacall or peculiar Index to stand fixt upon the plain (or Diall superficies) And then when all this is done, the vice-Index must be taken away and a true substantiall Index put in the place of it. And for that purpose, you were best, before you take it away, to finde at what elevation it stood from the plain, and likewise to draw the perpendicular just under it. For by these two helps you may set up a true substantiall Index, regulating it thereby into the same position; which to do, must be left to the judgement of every man to contrive as he shall see requisite.</p>
                        <p>But in both these wayes care must be had what inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Zodiacall Scale hath to the Index, according to what is said in the 13 <hi>Prop.</hi>

                        <p n="3">3. It must here again be taken for a Rule, thot a plain, if it lie parallel to the index is not possibly capable of these kindes of Ellipticall houres, but the Index must have some inclination to the plain, and make some angle with the same.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. All these Precepts do serve to make such Dials as are upon fixed walls or Superficies that cannot be removed. But if it be to be done for moveable Bodies, if they be regularly cut, then the declinations of every of the plains are known by their regularity; so that such plains of them as are capable of any Diall before mentioned (for the Index and the plain must not be parallel in any case, they may be perpendicular) may have such Dials upon them as they are capable of, either to Indexes perpendicular to their plains, or to Indexes lying
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57111:60"/>
in the Zenith line of the place. But for these casuall Index<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es upon them, you will be put to it, to know what declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they have from the Meridian upon the regular body (for I suppose that there is a Meridian drawn upon some one of the plains or other.) The way that for the present I think upon is this. Set the Body upon the foot true in respect of horizontall or upright position, that is, let the foot of it stand upon some just horizontall plain, though in respect of declination it stand at all adventures. Then from the fidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall edge of your casuall Index, let fall a perpendicular (I mean perpendicular to the Horizon of the place, not to the plain) and to that perpendicular point, from the point of the Indexes concourse with the plain, draw a right line; this line shall represent the Azimuth wherein the said Index lyeth. Then again, with your eye repose a perpendicular hanging threed upon the two points (namely, the center or concourse of the Index with the plain, and the late found perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar point) both together, and project the umbrage of the threed so hanging upon the Horizontall plain. So also you must repose the shadow of some one of the Cocks or Axes with your eye, upon the Meridian or line of 12, and then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the perpendicular threed must be projected upon them both joyned before into one, so that Threed, Stile, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian must now be all as one line; and the threed so hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing project the shadow of it upon the same Horizontall plain. Now these two lines thus projected either do concur and make an angle, or else (by drawing a parallel to one of them through the other) they must be made to concur, and looke what angle they make at their concurrence, the same being counted the right way is the angle of the casuall Indexes declination from the Meridian line. Thus the Declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is found.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="112" facs="tcp:57111:61"/>Then the Reclination may be found as before is declared, and by help of them the Longitude and Latitude of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex may be had, and so the Diall made by the precedent Precepts.</p>

The way therefore that is used for the projecting of these houres (by help of the Table in 29 <hi>Pag.</hi>) as it will serve to finde the Ellipticall points upon the Horizontall plain it selfe, so must it serve to finde some

one point of these surgent houre lines upon any other Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies, because they keepe the same distances alwayes from the Zenith line (from whence the projection of them is made, and whereon they depend altogether) and therefore it findes (upon any Superficies) the points of those lines which passe through, or do intersect the Diall Superficies. Therefore it is that these Ellipticall points (upon all Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies) are points of those surgent lines rising from the Horizontall plain, and that the Zenith line must have the same relation and situation to them, that it had to the points upon the Horizontall plain it selfe, And consequently, that this way must be of the same truth upon any Superficies that it is upon the Horizontall.

For the Table of Angles and Altitudes by which they are made, are calculated to that Horizon which is proper to the Index, considered as a Zenith line. And so from that Horizon we may imagine the like surgent lines to rise all parallel to the Index or Zenith line, and the very same reason to hold in these, that held in the former.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Circular wayes have dependance, and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of the precedent Ellipticall wayes; and the Cases are but two, wherein the same may be done upon any Horizon or plain, as may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the former Precepts, wherein the altitudes of the Indexes above the plain are ever made to be either halfe the complement of the Plains Latitude, or else (the summe of the Latitude and that halfe complement, which summe is equall to) the complement of that forenamed halfe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement.</p>
                     <p>According to these two cases here are two Schemes fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The projections are made upon the plain of the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Circle P Z H X.

D B C X represents one Azimuth or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Circle proper to the plain R A, and by that one all the rest of them may be understood. D A represents the Index in both the former Cases, and R A the Horizontall plain (not of the place but that Horizontall plai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57111:68"/>
belonging to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex or Zenith line D A. The first Scheme shews the first of the two former Cases, the second shews the second of them. Their Demonstrations will be both one. For the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in them both is, How to these inclinations of the Index, the Diall, or hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry line, that falls upon the Horizontall plain of the place, comes to be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Circle.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>First, therefore consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that in all the Ellipti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Dials, the horary line hath relation to the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall Circle, and to the Index or line that is to give the shadow (whatsoever the Superficies be upon which the projecture is made, whether plain or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise it matters not, as appears before, but here we deale only with plains, because Ellipses and Circles are plain Figures.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>Secondly, consider, that through the severall houre points of the Equinoctiall Circle, right lines are to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to passe infinitely extended, till they meet with the plain whereon the projecture is to be designed. Which
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57111:69"/>
issuing out of these infinite lines (if they be regularly cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about with an inflected Superficies must comprehend a Cylindricall concave, either round or compressed according as the forenamed infinite lines are either perpendicular to the plain of the Equinoctiall, or not perpendicular to it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, These parallel lines so drawn through the houre points of the Equinoctiall, parallel to the Index, must all fall perpendicular to the Horizontall plain which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonging to the Index as a Zenith line. And the same lines upon that proper Horizon do alwayes make an Ellipsis, except only these two Cases. First, If the Horizon be the same with the Equinoctiall Circle, and the Zenith line or Index the same with the Axis of the world, for then those lines do there make a perfect Circle. Secondly, If the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon be a Polar or Meridian Horizon, and the Index or Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith line fall into the Equinoctiall (having no Latitude from it) for then those lines do all fall into (or coincide with) the plain of the Equinoctiall, and consequently do make (upon their proper Horizon) a direct right line: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ea more, because the said lines do lie all upon the plain of the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall, and are all drawn out of the equall divisions of the Equinoctiall Circle, and besides are all parallel one to the other; therefore they make (in this case) a double line of Sines, as is said before in the fifth note <hi>Pag.</hi> 37. Now to come to my intended purpose, which is, to prove <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dexes so laid (as is mentioned before in the two precedent Cases) will require (upon the Horizontall plain of the place) a true Circle and not an Ellipsis.</p>
                     <p>Suppose therefore D A to be the Index (according to one of the two precedent conditions) then must R A be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Horizon to that Index. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57111:69"/>
houre points in the Equinoctiall, and Azimuths drawn through them from D the Verticall point of the Index, then I say (in these two cases and not otherwise) looke how the Equinoctiall is divided by those Circles, in the same manner is H O the Horizon of the place divided. But because the Equinoctiall is ever equally divided in respect of houres, therefore the Circles from D to X (from the Zenith of the proper Horizon R A to the Nadir, which are Azimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thall Circles) shall cut the Horizon of the place (H O) into equall parts. This, I say, is true, Because D Ae B and X H C are equall Sphericall Triangles in three of their quantities [For D Ae is equall to X H, and the angles at D and X are equall, as also the right angles at Ae and H] and therefore equall in all the rest, if like be compared to like: that is, H C is equall to Ae B; and consequently A C equal to A B: so also C X equall to B D. And if so, then the Chord B C must be parallel to the Index or Zenith line D X, and so Ae H is parallel to D X, and so contrarily (in these two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses) right lines drawn from the houre points in the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall Circle, parallel to the Index, must cut (upon the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon of the place) equall parts, equall to one another, and equall to the houres upon the Equinoctiall Circle. That is to say, they cut the horizontall Circle it selfe into 24 equall parts or hours. And consequently (in these two Cases) those forementioned right lines must designe (the horizontall Circle it selfe, that is) a Circle upon the horizontall plain of the place, though upon the proper Horizon it selfe (R A) they must designe an Ellipsis (falling perpendicularly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) according to the third observation in the 128 <hi>Pag.</hi> And from that Ellipsis these lines B C, H Ae, may be conceived as surgent lines (such as are mentioned before <hi>Pag.</hi> 113) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a compressed Cylinder, which Cylinder being cut

If the Index were set upon the proper Horizon R A, then it must move thereon (perpendicularly) from A to S suppose.

                        </gap>racting Dials is either by one contingent line (which is a right line;) or else by two Tangent lines, as by the Sector is usually done. But it must be considered, that the contingent line is infinite, and this line (here mentioned) is finite. Again, that other way by the Sector, is not by one finite line, but by two at the least; whereas this is by one finite line<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Some difference there is. And besides; that other
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57111:73"/>
by Tangents may be as well done upon a single crooked line, this cannot.</p>
                     <p>This streight line is mentioned before, that in right Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons or Polar plains the Ellipsis shutreth up into a streight line. And it is true, that this falls out to be so, onely in right Horizons (if the Index stand perpendicular to the plain, as is before intended) which cases happen but seldome, and to some plains onely. But here my purpose is to shew how it may be done to all plains whatsoever: observing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this one condition; alwayes to set the Index so, as to point up into the Equinoctiall Circle: for so it must do, and will not be done any other way, according to this forme of casting the houres.</p>
                     <p>There are two Cases which will offer themselves.</p>
                     <p>The first is, when the Index pointeth up both into the Equinoctiall Circle, and likewise into the plains proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian Circle.</p>
                     <p>The second is, when it points up into the Equinoctiall Circle of the heavens (for so it must ever do) and into some other Meridian Circle, such as is not proper to the plain.</p>

                        <p>IN this Case, the Index is to lie just over the proper Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of the plain, and is to be elevated so much above that line as the height of the Equinoctiall above that plain comes unto, and must point up into the Equinoctiall Circle it selfe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="137" facs="tcp:57111:73"/>It must therefore here be supposed that the situation of the plain, with such things as are thereon depending, are known. Such are these that follow.

                        <figure/>
                        <p>These things are to be found by the common wayes of making of Dials upon plains, which need not here be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, but shall be supposed to be already known, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in their true positions upon the plain. Let A B be the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57111:74"/>
proper Meridian of the plain truly placed, and A D the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex standing over it, and pointing up into the Equinoctiall. Let the degrees of the difference of the plains longitude be C L, and let the point L stand from C upon the right Coast according to the exigence of the plain. Then for drawing and dividing the line that is to give the houres, do thus.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Supposing A to be the point of the Equinoctiall (in the Zodiacall motion of the Index) through that point draw R A S perpendicular to B A C the proper Meridian; and upon A as the center, and to any convenient extent, describe the Circle R C S, in which, C L is to be set according to the difference of Longitude, as was before mentioned. So that L is the point from whence you must begin to divide your Circle, for from L is the point of the houre 12 dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Therefore,</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Divide your Circle from L into 24 houres at <hi>a, b, c, d, e, f, &amp;c. l, m, n, o, &amp;c.</hi> and from each of these points let perpendiculars fall upon the diameter R S, as L <hi>m, an, bp, &amp;c.</hi> the same Perpendiculars shall divide the Diameter into the houres required: <hi>m</hi> shall be the point of 12, because it falls from L, the point of the difference of Longitude: <hi>n</hi> and <hi>o</hi> shall be the next houres to 12 on both sides: <hi>p</hi> and <hi>q</hi> shall be the second houre points on both sides 12, and so the rest in their orders.</p>
                        <p>But then in these Dials, when the difference of Longitude falls not just upon an hour (as very seldome (and then but casually) it doth) the line R S will be crosse divided as you see it in this example, for <hi>e</hi> R <hi>u</hi> is one hour, and unequally broken and set upon the Diameter R S: so <hi>t</hi> S <hi>o</hi> is the space of 5 houres; and the points <hi>t</hi> and <hi>o</hi> stand crosse or distant one from the other, and are not coincident; which I say must alwayes happen when the difference of Longitude is
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57111:74"/>
not equall to one or more just full houres.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. In these crosse houres (for so I may call them) you may divide each side of the line severally, as thus:</p>
                        <figure/>
                        <p>Or else you may make a double line in this manner, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the fiduciall line to be the white that lies intire and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided betwixt them.</p>
                        <figure/>
                        <p>This kinde of Diall will be somwhat difficult in the use, because of this crosse division of the houres. Yet I thought best not to omit it, because it is the ground of the next Case which will be more usefull.</p>

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57111:75"/>
parts upon one side justly corresponding to the just houres and parts upon the other side. This will be for more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite use than the former way could be, and no such trouble nor confusion in the numeration of houres and parts of houres, as will appear in the next Example.</p>
                        <p>In this Case that we are now going upon, we must consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these things.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. How the Index is to be ordered, so as that it may look up into some just houre point of the Equinoctiall?</item>
                           <item>2. How the line of the Diall or houres (the horologicall line) is to be placed, and limited and divided?</item>
                           <item>3. How the Zodiac is to be placed and limited?</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>¶ First, for the Index: The best way will be to finde what Declination and Reclination (in respect of the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian and Zenith of the plain) the houre point (into which the Index must point) hath. And that is done by these two Rules.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. As the Radius, to the Sine of the Equinoctials altitude above the plain:</p>
                        <p>So is the Co-sine of the distance of that houre point from the Meridian of the plain, to the Co-sine of the Recli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; or to the Sine of the elevation of the Index above the plain.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As the Radius, to the Sine of the Poles altitude above the plain:</p>
                        <p>So is the Co-tangent of the former distance (of the intended houre point from the Meridian of the plain,) to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangent of the declination of the Index from the Meridian of the plain. Or thus, 2.</p>
                        <p>As the Sine of the Poles altitude above the plain, to the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius, So is the Tangent of the former distance, to the Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of the declination of the Index from the plains Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="142" facs="tcp:57111:76"/>Thus,] suppose A B were the proper Meridian of the plain, make the angle B A C on the right Coast, and equall to the declination of the Index (now found) and elevate A D just perpendicularly over A C, to the angle D A C equall to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Index above the plain, and so you shall place the Index in a just posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it shall looke up into a just houre point of the Equinoctiall. That is the first thing.</p>
                        <figure/>
                        <p>¶ Secondly. The Horologicall line is to be set for position as it was before in the precedent Case, namely, perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to the proper Meridian, as in the former and this Scheme you see R A S.</p>
                        <figure/>
                        <p>Then again, this line which in the former fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure was equall to R S the Diameter of the Circle (or two assumed Radiusses) must now in this case be enlarged, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as you have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered your Index to wrye from the proper Meridian of the plain to any other just houre; as in this figure it is made to be distant from that
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57111:76"/>
proper Meridian unto the houre of 12: that is, it is supposed to be turned so, as to looke into our 12 a clock point in the Equinoctiall: which point of 12 in the former figure was noted at L, and so in this figure let it be supposed again. I say, let it be supposed that (because the former Horologicall line was crossely divided, and therefore untoward for use) this way that is now spoken of shall be to take away that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience in use which was in the former. And therefore suppose the. Style or Index to be wryed from the proper Meridian of the plain to the Meridian of the place, or to the point of 12. It may as well be put to any other just houre, as to 12, but be it so in this Example, and let the point be L selected from all the rest.</p>
                        <p>From the selected point L, draw the diameter L A M, and from the selected point L divide the Circle into 24 equall parts or houres. Then from each two houre points corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondently distant on both sides the Diameter L M draw right lines, as G <hi>h</hi> and <hi>n</hi> O, and G O, which will be all parallel to the Diameter L M. Draw these lines (I say) and continue them untill they meet with the horologicall line R A S, sufficiently prolonged both wayes. By this draught thus made, the horologicall line R A S shall be both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to <hi>h</hi> O, and also divided just as a line of Sines, so the parts of it are in the same proportion that the parts of the Diameter G A G are, which are Right Sines both wayes from the center, or Versed Sines from G through A to G.</p>
                        <p>¶ Note that here (as formerly) you may assume the Circle of what extent you list, and shall finde most fitting your purpose.</p>
                        <p>It is plain then by this Example, First, that the Radius
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57111:77"/>
of the Circle A R, is to be enlarged, according to the secant of the Equinoctiall distance between the proper Meridian of the plain, and that just hour (wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ever it be) inro which the Index is made to point. As you see that arke to be here L C, or G R, or G S, whose secant is A <hi>h,</hi> or A <hi>o,</hi> in respect of the assumed Radius A R. And secondly, that <hi>h o</hi> thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged is divided like a double line of Sines, as it ought to be.</p>
                        <p>And for numbering the houres, if A be 12, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex look toward the South, then must <hi>o</hi> be 2, and the other <hi>o</hi> must be 6; and the first <hi>o,</hi> 10 at night. And <hi>h</hi> must be 9 in the morning; the other <hi>h,</hi> 6 in the morning; and the first <hi>h</hi> 3 in the morning.</p>
                        <p>But if the Index had not pointed up into 12 at L, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to some other hour as P, then must a Diameter have been drawn at first from P to the center A quite through, and all the houres parallel to P A, and then the horologicall line would have been thus numbered with 7 at the two extreams, and 1 in the midst at A.</p>
                        <figure/>
                        <p>And here is one speciall thing to be noted (as formerly <hi>Pag.</hi> 125) but this here is alwayes so, and in all Oblique Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizons. That in our Climates where the dayes are in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer longer than 12 houres, the shadow of the Index doth really go forward and backward. As to make it plain. If the Diall were described upon an Horizontall plain (for instance) and it were our longest day, then the shadow of the Index
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57111:77"/>
would begin at 4 a clock (figured below the line) and would go thence towards the left hand to 5, 6, and 7. At 7 it would return back towards the right hand through 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, untill 7, and then being arrived at 7, the utmost point on the right hand, it will come back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain towards 8 and 9 to the left hand. This for the placing, limiting, and dividing of the horologicall line.</p>
                        <figure/>
                        <p>¶ Thirdly, Concerning the Zodiac how it must be placed and limited, consider of these things. The Zodiac (in
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57111:78"/>
this case of wrying the Index from the plains proper Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an) must be augmented in length, and changed in situation from what it was in the former case where the Index looked up into the plains proper Meridian. Yet I will here first begin with that way so far as it goes, and then proceed to what is further needfull. Let the Figure <hi>Pag.</hi> 137 be here repeated. To the Radius A R, the Tangent of 23 and a halfe is A F, and the same is there augmented thus.</p>
                        <p>As the Radius, To the Secant of the Poles elevation above the plain;</p>
                        <p>So let AF be supposed to be, To AB.</p>
                        <p>So that if the Index were pointing directly to the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian point (in the Equinoctiall) which is proper to the plain, then the businesse was at an end; for A B must be the length of the Zodiac, and standing square to R A S. But now we here suppose the Index to be wryed from that point, as much as the arke C L comes to; which turning aside will both lengthen the Zodiac again, and turn it out of its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular standing to R A S. Which thing is thus to be effected. To A F as a Radius, finde the Tangent of the Poles elevation above the plain; suppose that Tangent were G H. Then say, As the Radius, to the Tangent of C L the quantity of wrying, so G H to X Z. Make B K equall to X <hi>Z,</hi> and parallel to A R, and draw A K, so shall A K be the length, and shall also give (in this position) the situation of the Zodiac. The manner how to divide it need not be repeated, because it hath been often set down heretofore, You must only remember to place this line upon that Coast of A B which is contrary to the Coast of the Indexes devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation or wrying from the proper Meridian point of the plain: this work may either be protracted, or calculated, or wrought Instrumentally, as shall best be liked of.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="147" facs="tcp:57111:78"/>
                           <figure/>
                        </p>
                        <p>Another way I will here adde to do the same work, which may perhaps be not inferior to the former. Let all things preparatorie in the former Figure, be here again repeated, R A the Radius, and A F the Tangent of 23 degrees and a halfe to that Radius: then to A F as Radius, finde the Sine and Co-sine of the Poles elevation above the plain: let F P be the Sine, and A P the Co-sine. Make A <hi>m</hi> equall to A P; and from <hi>m</hi> draw the line <hi>m n,</hi> making the angle <hi>n m</hi> C e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to the angle B A C <hi>Pag.</hi> 142, and standing on the contrary Coast, which is the angle of the declination of the Index from A C in this Figure, the proper Meridian of the plain.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="148" facs="tcp:57111:79"/>Then say, As the Radius, is to the Tangent of the Recli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Index (which is the Complement of D A C (<hi>Pag.</hi> 142) the elevation of the Index above the plain,) So is the Sine F P to a fourth quantity, suppose the same to be D G: make <hi>m n</hi> equall to D G, and draw the streight line A <hi>
                              <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>,</hi> so shall A <hi>n</hi> in this Figure be equall to A K in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, and the angle <hi>n</hi> A C be (here) equall to the angle K A B in the former.

                        </gap>th the Equinoctiall Circle, and must therefore be a right Horizon or Polar plain.</p>
                     <p>When the Index is pitched in a true posture, all the houre points of the Equinoctiall Circle must be supposed to have lines issuing from them all parallel to the Index. This is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall truth in the whole course of the Ellipticall Dialling, Wherefore,</p>
                     <p>First of all, These lines will (in this case) fall all upon the plain of the Equinoctiall; and because the common section of any two plains must be a right line, therefore it is that all these lines so issuing, will fall upon one and the same streight line, namely, whensoever the Equinoctiall meets with or cuts any other plain. Hence comes it to be <hi>Rectilineal Horo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiography,</hi> being performed upon a plain.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Because they are all parallel to the Index, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they must all be parallel to one another; and because they come originally from a Circle, and are parallel, they will all also keep distance one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another as the Sines in a Circle do.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Because the Index moves alwayes in a parallel position to it selfe, and would shew the houre upon the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular divisions of the Equinoctiall Circle (at all times of the year, that is, when this Equinoctiall is made to represent all other parallels of Declination) it must follow that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex when (the shadow of) it falleth upon any one such point, it must also fall upon the whole line that issueth through that point. The reason is, because the line is alwayes parallel to the Index, therfore is it touch one point it must shadow the whol.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Hence will follow, that any line drawn upon the plain of the Equinoctiall, crossing those forementioned pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel lines, shall be a line of Sines (or a double line of Sines, if you will rather expresse it properly) and if it passe through the center o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the Equinoctiall Circle (where the Index also
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57111:82"/>
doth alwayes passe) then is such a line one of the Dials that we here are to deal with. Because every plain is taken for a great Circle cutting the Equinoctiall in the center. And the divisions of this line (the Sinicall divisions) must be the houre points, as is said before.</p>
                     <p>Now all that we have here to say is the making good of the former rules of limiting out and placing the houre line, the Zodiacall line, and the Index. If we therefore (in all cases) suppose the Index to be a Zenith line, and then an Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal plain to be placed perpendicular to it, this plain must be the proper Horizon to that Index (or Zenith line) and must (in these Cases here handled) go through the Axis of the world (a part of which I must call the primary Zodiac) and will cut the Equinoctiall plain in a right line placed perpendicularly to the Index, which I call the primary horizontall line.</p>
                     <p>And again, all that is done in other plains (not perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to the Index) must be imagined primarily (or original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) to be deduced from this proper Horizontall plain.</p>
                     <p>First therefore, for the houre line. If the Index lie in the proper Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>idian of the plain (as is supposed in the first of the former Cases) then the Diameter of the Circle that is at first assumed, serves for the horologicall line without any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because the proper Horizon, and the plain upon which you work, do (both of them) cut the Equinoctiall in one and the same line, which is to be the horologicall line. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in plain reason, so much of the Equinoctiall as the Index is wryed from this proper Meridian of the plain, so much of the same Equinoctiall must the proper Horizon be wryed with it, and consequently, so much will be between the proper horizontall line and the horologicall line of the plain, but still both these lines will continue upon the same plain of the Equinoctiall, and consequently they must in both
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57111:83"/>
cases be one and the same line, namely that which is made by the projection of the Equinoctiall Circle upon the plain, on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y it must b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> augmented according to the proper horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall lines departure from the section of the plain with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall, that is, according to the wrying of the Index, as is plain enough by what is said in the 142 <hi>Pag</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And so for the division of that line in the same Page. For G G and <hi>h o,</hi> do both lie in one and the same plain of the Equinoctiall: and all the projecture must be made parallel to the Index, whence <hi>h</hi> A is the secant (to G A Radius) of R G or C L, the wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Index.</p>
                     <p>Then for the Zodiac, you are to deduce it from the Axis which is perpendicular to the Zenith line or Index: and from so much of it as containeth the Tangent of 23½<hi>gr.</hi> to the Radius G A. Now though the Index do keep the proper Meridian of the plain, yet the Axis is elevated above the plain. And because the projecture of that Tangent or part of the Axis must be parallel to the Index, therefore look what elevation the Axis or Pole of the World hath, to such a Secant of the Radius equall to the Tangent of 23½ before mentioned must the Zodiac be extended. By which means the Index keeps the same situation and distance from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall plain that it would do if it moved according to the proper and primary Tangents upon the Axis, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise. And so doth the former enlarging of the horolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall line produce the like effect, namely, that the Index doth upon that enlarged line shew the same houres that it would do upon the proper horizontall line.</p>
                     <p>Then for the Zodiac to a wryed Index, it is both displa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and enlarged too, according as right lines drawn through the divisions of the Axis, and parallel to the Index, would make a projection of it. According to which, there are three wayes given.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="153" facs="tcp:57111:83"/>The first makes A F equall to the Tangent of 23½ to the Radius R A, to be Radius, and to that Radius findes F H, and to that again as Radius, finde H Z the Tangent of wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And so A Z is the Semizodiac placed and enlarged.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>The second makes A F as a Radius, and to it findes F P the Sine, and A P the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sine of the Axis his elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on above the plain. And then this line F P being perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular to the plain, it stands as the proper Zenith line of the plain. And because we are to cast all according to

                        <pb n="154" facs="tcp:57111:84"/>
the lying of the Index, therefore what reclination from the plains proper Zenith, and declination from the plains proper Meridian the Index hath, the same must the projection (or projecture) of the line F P have. That is, we may suppose the Index, or a line paral<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>el to the Index (in his true posture) to passe through the point F, and then we are to inquire where it will strike through the plain. That is to say, it must looke into the same Coast that the Index doth, and so the angle Z P Q being made equall to the declination of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex from A Q the proper Meridian line, and the line P Z drawn, it is certain enough that the projecture of the point F must be upon the line P Z. And to know where, because F P Z is a right angle, and the side F P is known, with the angle I F M (equall to the reclination of the Index from the plains Zenith line F M) or P F Z; Therefore,</p>
                     <p>As F P Radius, To P Z the Tangent of the angle P F Z;</p>
                     <p>So is F P in the former known length (found to A F Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of 23½ <hi>gr.</hi>) To P Z.</p>
                     <p>Therefore Z is the point terminating the extremity of the projected Zodiac, and so A Z must be the Semizodiac, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what was delivered in the second way <hi>Pag.</hi> 147.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="155" facs="tcp:57111:84"/>The third way resolves a Sphericall rectangled Triangle, made between the proper Meridian of the plain P A, the plain it selfe A B, and the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an in which the Index lyeth, or into which it pointeth, P B. In which three quantities are known. P A the altitude of the Pole above the plain. The angle at A a right angle. And the angle at P equall to the arke of the Equinoctiall or wrying of the Index from the proper Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of the plain. And there is first required A B.</p>

Therefore in the third work (<hi>Pag.</hi> 148) it is said,</p>
                     <p>As A F, Radius, To A Z, Secant of F A Z;</p>
                     <p>So is A F in parts, (as a Tangent of 23½) To A Z in the same parts.</p>
                     <p>And so the Zodiac is both placed and limited.</p>

are all coincident into one line, which is perpendicular to the proper Meridian of the Index. This shews that this Dial will be a single line, and that by the former generall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Section VIII.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Then for the second thing, that it will be a line of Sines, or (though a curved line, yet) to be thence deduced or divided, it will appear by the seventh Proposition <hi>Pag.</hi> 96. Because,</p>

                     <p>For if the two first terms be the same, then the two latter must be equall too.

Meridian Circle. But you must then be carefull to place some one houre line true, so as to answer to some just houre circle in the heavens, which upon this Equinoctiall plain (when the Axis is once truly placed) will be easie. For if the Axis give a shadow, and you at the same instant time (noting the shadow) do observe the houre, that shadow will repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the same houre. If therefore upon that shadow line (as a Diameter) you describe a Circle, you may (from the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sections of the said line, with the Circle) set off any one full and just houre, and then from that just houre you may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Circle into the 24 houres. This equall setting of the Index is allowable upon the Circle, but not upon the right lines D E or F G, for in them there will be confusion of parts, which in the Circle are distant.</p>
                        <p>Note further, that you need not make the Center of the horologicall Circle just in the point A, where the extremity of the Index which came down upon the plain, but you may make it in any point where the Index A C will touch the plain, as at H, or in other like places.</p>

upon the Axis it selfe. It may move according to any line
that lies in the same plain with the Index D E and the Axis
A X, that is, it may move according to the line A B, which
we here suppose to be in the same plain or Meridian with
A D and A X. This condition is alwayes requisite, and it
must ever keep one &amp; the same angle with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this being observed, you may insert the Zodiac upon

respect of the Radius of the horologicall Circle,) to a fourth
quantity; the length whereof gives A E. And now this line
A E must be esteemed as a Tangent of 23 degrees and a half,
and by it must the Semizodiac or halfe year be put in, as
hath been shewed formerly. So this is done also, For the
Index will move upon A E, according to the parts upon A
C, as it is bound to do. Only note that these Dials upon

But here the same forementioned parallel lines issuing from the houre points of the Equinoctiall Circle, and flowing out upon the plain of that Circle, do so appear in full view to the eye, because the eye stands so as fully to view the said plain and not looking edgewise upon it.

                     <p n="1">1. You must know the situation of your plain, that is, what Declination and Reclination it hath in respect of your own Horizon. This is to be done the ordinary way, as in all plains is usuall.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. You must know the Declination and Reclination of your Index. That is, if the Index be set casually you must then finde out the Declination and Reclination thereof, which is shewed, <hi>Pag.</hi> 80. how it must be done, namely, by observation from the Sun, and cannot be otherwise perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Or if you choose a Longitude and Latitude wherein to lay your Index, then must you (by that Longitude and Latitude given) finde what Declination and Reclination is due thereunto, in respect of your own Horizon: and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Declination and Reclination you are to lay your Index. See the Schemes <hi>Pag.</hi> 83, 84, for by those or the like you are to conceive of your Sphericall work in this kinde.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Having thus found the situation both of plain and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex, in respect of your own Horizon, you must then finde what situation the Index hath in respect of the plain; that is, what Declination it hath from the proper Meridian of the plain, and what Reclination it hath from the Plains Zenith. This Proposition hath not been handled before, but must be put here in this place.</p>
                     <p>Let your own Horizon be N W S E, the Zenith Z, the Pole P, and let A V E be a declining reclining plain, whose Declination and Reclination we now suppose to be known
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57111:92"/>
                        <figure/>
by former rules; that is the angle S Z D (equall to the Declination) is known, and Z V or D T (equall to the Reclination) is known. So that in the Triangle P Z T, there is P Z (equal to the complement of P N, the Poles altitude,) Z T (equal to the complement of Z V the Reclination,) &amp; P Z T (equall to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of S Z T, the plains Declination from the South:) therefore you may now finde the three unknown quantities; namely, P T the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of the Poles elevation above the plain: and Z P T, the distance of the plains Meridian from yours, which is the plains difference of Longitude: and lastly, Z T P the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of P T the plains proper Meridian from V Z T the Verticall line of the plain. Or which three soever you have, you may finde the other three. As having the difference of the plains Longitude, the angle P, with the plains Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude the complement of P T: and <hi>P Z</hi> the complement of your own Latitude. You may finde all the rest. And by that means you may set a plain to any Latitude and difference of Longitude, that is answering to the Horizon of any known place in the world.</p>
                     <p>The next work is to finde what situation an Index (set up upon the plain) shall have to the plain, and the fundamental lines thereon described, <hi>viz.</hi> the Verticall line, and proper Meridian.</p>
                     <p>I suppose first, that the Declination and Reclination of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57111:93"/>
the Index (in respect of your own Horizon) is known by the former things already spoken of, and from thence you may gather what is here required. Thus</p>
                     <p>Let the Index point up to X: and let Z X (the reclination from your Zenith) be known, and S Z X (the declination from your Meridian) be also known. Now therefore in the triangle T Z X, there are three things known.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 T Z the Complement of the Plains reclination in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of your Horizon.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 <hi>Z</hi> X the complement of the Indexes reclination in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of your Horizon.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Thirdly, the angle T <hi>Z</hi> X, which is the difference of the two declinations, namely of the plain and of the Index. By these all the rest will be found; as namely,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 T X, the reclination of the Index X from <hi>T</hi> the pole of the plain, which is called the proper reclination of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 <hi>Z</hi> T X, or V Y, or rather V M, which shews how much the <note n="*" place="margin">Subindicall line I call that line upon the plain which lies perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly under the Index, as the substilar doth under the Stile. I mean perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicularly in respect of the plain, not of the Horizon.</note> Subindicall line lies from the Verticall line of the plain (in degrees of a Circle described upon the plain) and consequently, because P T Z was known before, therefore P T X is now also become known, which shewes the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the * Subindicall line from the plains proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian, which may therefore be called the proper declination of the Index.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The angle <hi>Z</hi> X <hi>T</hi> (if it be of any use here) shews how much (in Azimuthal position) your Zenith <hi>Z</hi> lies from <hi>T,</hi> the Zenith of the plain upon that Hotizon whose Zenith line is the same with the Index, which is therefore the proper Horizon to the Index.</p>

                     <head>Or if you would set an Index so as to fit it to any assigned difference of Longitude, and to any assigned Latitude also, you must work thus.</head>
                     <p>LEt X P S be the assigned difference of Longitude, and P X the complement of the Latitude, into both which the Index shall point up in X. Because the plains difference of Longitude <hi>Z</hi> P <hi>T.</hi> is known before, therefore the angle T P X is known. And P T the complement of the plains Latitude is also before known. Therefore in the triangle T P X these three things are known, <hi>viz.</hi> P X, P <hi>T,</hi> and the interjacent angles T P X. By which three you may finde all the other quantities: namely, <hi>P T</hi> X, or B Y, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the Subindicall line from the plains proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian: <hi>T</hi> X the proper reclination of the Index X from T the pole of the plain, or the complement of it (X Y) which is the elevation of the Index above the plain just over (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly over in respect of the plain) the Subindicall line: with the angle <hi>P</hi> X <hi>T</hi> (if there were any use of it) which shewes how much the pole of the plain declines from the proper Meridian of the Index. I say, it shewes this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination upon that Horizon (whatever it should be) which shall be properly belonging or perpendicularly placed to the said Index as the proper Zenith-line.</p>
                     <p>Thus the situation of the Index (whether casually, or by election set) is found to the true coasts of the plain it self.</p>

                     <p>To project the houre points of the Equinoctiall, and the Zodiacall Scale upon the Axis (which Zodiacall Scale upon the Axis it self is made by the Tangents of 23 <hi>gr.</hi> and an half, to the Radius of that Sphere wherein you shall imagine your Circles to be) I say. To project (all such points) upon the plain, by lines passing through each one of them, and all and each of the same lines to be drawn parallel to the Index given. This is the summe of what is here now to be done, and of what hath been done formerly quite through this Book. For all that is before effected upon any plain or cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Superficies, is nothing more then what I have now said; namely, a determining of the true places of every such (houre and Zodiacall) point, as they shall be projected upon the Dialls Superficies, by lines going through them, and going parallel also to the Index that is to give the houre. For so, the Equinoctiall Circle will very well supply every parallel of the Sun, the Index and horologicall line being rectified by the Zodiac in a true site one to the other, as hath been often mentioned before; And then the Index, casting its shadow upon the houre point, either in the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall or in the parallel Circle, must also cast it upon the whole projecting line, which passeth th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And so for the points of the Zodiac, they are also projected in such manner, as that the Index moving in them (however they may seem to stand awry and out of order) shall alwayes cut the Axis of the World (if it were there placed) and cut it according to the Tangents of declination thereon expr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <head>How to make an Ellipticall Diall upon any Plain, to an Index perpendicular to the Plain.</head>
                     <p>THe first work is done before, partly by Calculation, and partly by protraction, <hi>Pag.</hi> 25, 26, but more fully and better, <hi>Proposition</hi> 5, 6, 7, <hi>Pag.</hi> 92, 95, 96, by which you make two Tables, one of Horizontal spaces, the other of Altitudes. So that I shall not need to say any more of it. By that work (I say) you may make two Tables which may serve to prick down the houre points, which points you shall see to winde about the center in forme of an Ellipsis.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is first requisite that the pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>per Meridian of the plain be rightly situated upon the plain (as is there also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely required. And it is again requisite that the proper line of the two sixes (proper I mean to the plain, considered as an Horizon by it selfe) be also drawn: which line (as in all Horizontal Dials is usuall) must be perpendicular (upon the plain) to the proper Meridian. And the points also of the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57111:96"/>
two sixes must be carefully set on, whose distance from the center is the longer Radius of the Ellipsis. The reason why these points of the proper Sines must be had, is, because the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ew Ellipsis (which we now look for) must passe through them both. So also the just point of the proper 12 (or the section of the Ellipsis with the plains proper Meridian) must be with the same care designed upon the plain. And the Subindicall line must be drawn in its true position upon the plain, according to the proper declination of the Index.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. After this is done, you must call to minde what the Declination and Reclination of your Index is (I speak now of the proper Declination and Reclination before mentioned) as <hi>Pag.</hi> 172 is mentioned.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Then from every houre point lately made upon the plain, you are to draw right lines, parallel to the subindicall line, and draw them both wayes or on both sides of each houre point, because you know not which of them (as yet) you are to make use of for the pricking down of your New or Distorted Ellipsis.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Take the larger Radius of your primary Ellipsis (that is the length from the center of it, to the point of the proper six a clock) and (upon the Sector, for that Instrument is most fit for this use or practise) entering it upon the Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of 45 degrees, open your Sector to tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> length: then take over from the reclination of the Index (the proper reclination I now speak of) counted on the same Scale of Tangents, to the other leg, and reserve this length. That is, As the Radius, to the Tangent of the proper reclination of the Index; So is the larger Semidiameter of the primary El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipsis, to a fourth quantity, which is equall to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>rmer reserved length, and to that large Semidiameter or Radius, is the Tangent of the Indexes proper Reclination.</p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <pb n="179" facs="tcp:57111:96"/>5. This reserved length must again be entered from 90 in the line of Sines, and the Sector set according to it, and being so set it is fit for the rest of the work that is to ensue. Because this proportion we are to go upon: As the Radius, to the Tangent of the Indexes proper reclination (which two terms are they that now do set the Sector,) so is the Sine of every altitude of the horary points in the Equinoctiall, (which altitudes your Table of altitudes computed by the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Proposition, <hi>Pag.</hi> 96, 97, will help you unto,) so is the Sine of every (horary-equinoctiall-points) altitude, to the Tangent of the reclination of every one of those severall houre points of the Equinoctiall Circle. Note that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations here mentioned are, in respect, and from the proper Zenith line of the plain. And note also that these Tangents thus found, are to be estimated to the larger semidiameter of the primary Ellipsis as to their proper Radius.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. By these Tangents so found, you are to set on the new houre points, by which both the new Ellipsis is to be descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and also divided. I say the new houre points are to be set on upon the lines drawn through each of the old houre-points parallel to the Subindicall line, and they are to be s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t on from each of the said old houre points in those lines. But which way, or on which side of them, will be still doubted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as was before mentioned § 3. And to take away this doubt, it will be best to consider the point of the proper 12 upon the primary Ellipsis, when the Sun is (any day) in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per 12 point of the heavens, then must the upright (or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Index of the plain) cast its shadow into the proper 12 point of the primary Ellipsis. Then further, supposing the Sun to stand still there, imagine how your slope Index is to lie from the proper Index, and by that you shall easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern which way the inclination of that Index will wry the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57111:97"/>
proper point of 12 from the primary Ellipsis, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently you shall be able (thereby) to judge upon which part of that line which is drawn through the point of proper 12 (parallel to the subindicall line) the houre (of proper 12) shall be cast into the secondary Ellipsis from the primary. This point being set right, you may place all the houre points from that proper 12 to the two proper sixes, the same way with this first point: but all the other points on the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter side of the proper 12, must go the contrary way, as you will easily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Then because the Index leaneth from the upright Index (or Zenith line of the plain) towards S, therefore the proper 12 at O must go towards S, <hi>viz.</hi> to A: and therefore also 9 B, 8 C, &amp;c. 11 G, &amp;c. must go the same way till you come to the two proper sixes at P and Q, and then the houre points D E F must be set from 3 2 1, the contrary way to that wherein the first houres were placed; as you may plainly see the form of the new Ellipsis will require. For it cannot possibly be made to turn again from P towards M, if it must make up an Ellipsis, as in this case it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it should do.</p>
                     <p>Now all the Tangents before found (§ 5) are the lines

10 H, 9 B, 8 C, 11 G, &amp;c. each set off from his proper houre point at O, A, B, C, and taken to its true Radius, namely, the Radius P R or R Q. But if you work by the Sector (as is taught in the 5 §) the very lengths there found shall be the quantities here to be set off, namely, 10 H, 9 B, 8 C, 11 G, 12 N, &amp;c. without any more relation to the Radius P R, without any more relation (I say) than what was formerly done upon the work of the Sector § 5. The like may be done for halves and quarters of houres. And so these directions will be enough for pricking down the houre points this way.</p>

Then again to the Radius R O, finde out the Co-sine of the difference of Longitude, and set it upon the line T I, from T to I. All this work is only to finde the point of 12 in the primary Ellipsis, as you see it expressed in the former Figure at 12.

                     <p>TO omit other wayes, I shall here pitch upon that which is most suitable to this manner of working upon which we now are. To the Radius P R (which is the larger Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diameter of the primary Ellipsis) first, finde the Tangent of 23 degrees and a halfe; which suppose to be R ξ: and then to this line, being taken as a new Radius, finde the Co-sine of the plains Latitude, or the Sine of the Equinoctials alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which suppose to be the length R W, which is also to be set from the center R upon the proper Meridian of the plain, as here it is from R to W. Then through the point W, draw a line, as W Z, parallel to the subindical line R S.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57111:100"/>
When this is done you are to finde the Sine of the Poles ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation above the plain, to the same Radius R ξ, which Sine you may suppose to be the length of the line φ ψ. Then say again; As the Radius, to the Tangent of the Indexes reclination; so φ ψ (the Sine of the Poles elevation above the plain) to a fourth line; which line let be represented by λ ω. Take this line λ ω therefore, and set it upon W Z, the line formerly drawn, from W to Z. And lastly, draw the line R Z, and make R <hi>y</hi> equall to it, so shall <hi>Z y</hi> be the Zodiac in its true length and position: and R <hi>Z</hi> or R <hi>y</hi> shall give the halfe of it, which halfe is to be estimated as a Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of 23 degrees and a halfe, and so the Zodiac to be set on as hath formerly been often shewed.</p>
                     <p>You are here to take care that all things be set in their right position. In this example, Z turns from W towards the left hand, because it is here supposed that the North Pole is elevated upon the plain, and so the Axis riseth out of R a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the plain: and therefore that 23½ tangent degree upon that Axis a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e above the plain. From which extream point of 23½ above the plain, you may suppose a line to issue out parallel to the Index, which inclines from R towards S, and therefore that line inclining so too, must project that extream point from W towards <hi>Z.</hi> All the reason of the work de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon that which hath been formerly said: Namely, that both houre points of the Equinoctiall, and declination points in the Axis, are all projected from their true positions in the Sphere (upon or unto a plain) by right lines passing through each of them, parallel to the assigned Index. I shall need to say no more, because I think enough (if not too much) hath been said already.</p>

Out of which Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine this (as a particular branch) is dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. It containeth not any new thing, but because it may be more frequently made use of (in practice) than other Cases, therefore I adde it, that it may also be the more plain and easie in operation. It is (for more ease) intended that the Index should point up into some just houre Circle, and to have some just degrees of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination from the Zenith of the Horizon.</p>
                     <p>I purpose not to give variety of wayes, for they are shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the last precepts now given which are generall, and may easily be brought and applyed to this particular Case, as a branch of that generall before.</p>

                     <p>It must be noted that the making of one will make the other, because they are to be set upon one plain, and their differences of the Indexes Longitudes, is in each 5 houres, and the reclination of the Index in each 45 degrees. Only the Coasts in respect of situation must be changed, because the positions of the Indexes are not parallel, but contrary one to the other, and so will the Ellipses be, as you may see in the next page. The first thing to be done, is,</p>
                     <p>By having the difference of the Indexes Longitude (75 <hi>gr.</hi>) and the reclination of the Index (45 <hi>gr.</hi>) to finde what declination the Index must have: Or to finde the declination of the subindicall line from our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>When this work is done;</p>

                     <p>Then making 6 R for Radius, finde thereto the Sine of the Latitude of the place 51 <hi>gr.</hi> 30 <hi>min.</hi> which let be the line R C, and set it upon the North part of the Meridian line A B (I call it the Meridian line because it is the said line upon the Horizontal plain whereupon these descriptions are now made) from the center R to C. Then from the point C, draw C D parallel, and the same way with R S the Subindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call line. So shall C be the point of 12 upon the primary Ellipsis which should be drawn, if an Ellipticall Diall were to be made upon the Horizontall plain to the upright Index, which is the proper Zenith line of the Horizontall plain.</p>
                     <p>After this, to the same Radius R 6, finde the Co-sine of your Latitude, or the Sine of the Equinoctials height, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (in this particular work) the depth of it under the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, which Sine let be the line E F.

                     <p>As the Radius, is to the Tangent of 45 <hi>gr.</hi> the Indexes reclination; so is the Sine E F, to a fourth; which fourth will be (in this Example) the same line with E F, because the Tangent of 45 (the Reclination) is the same length with the Radius, yet I will call it the fourth quantity.</p>
                     <p>Take this fourth quantity and set it off upon the line C D, from C to D, so shall D give the point of 12 upon the

                     <p>By these meanes we have now got two conjugate Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters. And now the rest of the work will be easie. For you are onely to</p>

                     <p>IT is the same work with that which went before, <hi>Pag.</hi> 185. yet I will here insert it again.</p>
                     <p>First, work thus. As the Radius, is to the Tangent of 23½ <hi>gr.</hi> So let E F (which was formerly found to be the Sine of the Equinoctials altitude above the Horizon 38 <hi>gr.</hi> 30 <hi>mn.</hi> in respect of the Radius R 6, and must now again be here used) be to a fourth quantity, which suppose to be F W. Take therefore that length F W, and set it from R to X on the North side (in this example:) and through X draw X γ parallel to the Subindicall line R S.</p>
                     <p>Then say again. As the Radius, is to the Tangent of 23 <hi>gr.</hi> and an half; So let R C (which was before found to be the Sine of the Latitude of the place 51 <hi>gr.</hi> and an half in respect of the Radius R 6, and comes now to be here used again) be to a fourth quantity, which suppose to be F <hi>z.</hi> Take therefore F <hi>z,</hi> and set it upon the line formerly drawn through X, from X, contrary to the going of the Subindical line, namely Southward (in this example) I say from X to γ Then from γ through R, draw γ R π, and make R π equall to R γ, So shall γ π be the Zodiac both placed rightly and justly limited.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="193" facs="tcp:57111:104"/>For division of it, you must conceive that R γ or R π is a Tangent of 23 and an half <hi>gr.</hi> the Suns greatest declination, and consequently you may by it set on either 12 moneths, or 12 signes, as you will; the manner whereof hath been often shewed in this Book, and especially <hi>Pag.</hi> 10, 11. and <hi>Pag.</hi> 14, 15, &amp;c. so that now all this work is come to an end. The Index must slide to and fro upon the line γ π (or the Index standing, the Ellipsis must move after the same rate) γ π is the proper Meridian of the Index. And if your work (when you make this Diall, according to this case here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore put) be exactly true, you shall finde the Zodiacall line π γ to fall just into the houre lines of 5 and 7, as they ought to do, because the difference of the Indexes Longitude was assumed to be 75 <hi>gr.</hi> from the South Meridian of the place, which is the same with those houres.</p>
                     <p>The signe ♋ must be placed at γ, and ♈ at π in this Diall.</p>
                     <p>The Index must lie (when it is in the Center R) just over the line R S, and must alwayes move in a parallel position to it self. And it must in this example recline 45 <hi>gr.</hi> or rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Horizon (or above R S making an angle above that line 45 <hi>gr.</hi> also. But though it lie thus, yet it must move in the line γ π, and it must be so set on, that when you project the fiduciall edge of it into a point (as workmen use to do, when with their eye they tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e the straightnesse of a line) all that edge may at once justly appear to run into the line γ π, wherever the Index be set in the Zodiac. This is to be done carefully.</p>
                     <p>I have here set two of them, whose proper Meridians, (I mean proper to the Index, which are the lines of their Zodiacs, <hi>viz.</hi> γ π) do not lie in one and the same right line, or parallelism (which is the samenesse of po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ition) but make angles one to the other. This is done, because they should

not lie in one Meridian: for by that meanes they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes set one another, which the Horizontal Diall with the single Ellipsis to an upright Index will not do at all times.

                     <p>I have set that whose Index looks North-east upon the left hand, you may set it on the right hand if you will, and the other on the left. For this makes no materiall change.</p>
                     <p>The Index is best to be a threed. Other circumstances I remember none but what the Workman will be well able to go through.</p>

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>For the Zodiac.</head>
                     <p>IN this Example remember, that the Index declineth North East / West 60<hi>gr.</hi> 5 <hi>min.</hi> Reclineth 45 <hi>gr.</hi> Differeth in Longitude South East / West 75 <hi>gr.</hi> Hath Latitude 50 <hi>gr.</hi>37<hi>min.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Because the difference of Longitude is 75 <hi>gr.</hi> from the South, therefore our two houres of 7 in the morning, and 5 at evening, are the proper Meridians upon which the Indexes must slide.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For that cause you must consider how much of those two Meridians is intercepted between the Equinoctiall and our Horizon. You may finde it by this Rule.</p>
                     <p>As the Radius, is to the Sine of 15 <hi>gr.</hi> (the Conpl. of 75,)</p>
                     <p>So is the Tangent of 38 <hi>gr.</hi> 30 <hi>min.</hi> to the Tangent of 11 <hi>gr.</hi> 38 <hi>min.</hi> which is the arke required.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Because the Latitude of the Index is 50 <hi>gr.</hi> 37 <hi>min.</hi> North, the complement of it must be 39 <hi>gr.</hi> 23 <hi>min.</hi> and so much under the Equinoctiall points of 7 and 5 (and upon the houre circles of 7 and 5, which are the proper Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to the two Indexes) doth the proper Horizon of each
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:57111:107"/>
of those Indexes cut the said houres of 7 and 5 upon the South-east and South-west; and so much do they cut the same Meridians above the Equinoctiall upon the South-west and South-east. So that upon the Southerly Coast, that portion of these Meridians which is comprehended between the Equinoctiall and our Horizon, namely 11 <hi>gr.</hi> 38 <hi>min.</hi> must be taken from 39 <hi>gr.</hi> 23 <hi>min.</hi> and the remainder will be 27 <hi>gr.</hi> 45 <hi>min.</hi> which is the arke comprehended between the proper Horizon of the Index and our own Horizon, which upon the South part (in this particular Example) is below our Horizon, on the North part above.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. First, therefore the limitation of the Semi-Zodiacs length must be to that Latitude of the Index or proper Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon 50<hi>gr.</hi> 37 <hi>min.</hi> And then secondly, the said Zodiac first found and limited must be augmented (in this Example) in proportion of the Radius to the Secant of 27 <hi>gr.</hi> 45 <hi>min.</hi> In this manner, by the second rule given at the beginning of this Book <hi>Pag.</hi> 11. To the Radius P R finde the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine of the Latitude of the Index, namely the Sine of 39 <hi>gr.</hi> 23 <hi>min.</hi> which suppose to be N T.</p>
                     <p>To this length N T as a Radius, finde out the Secant of the forementioned arke 27 <hi>gr.</hi> 45 <hi>min.</hi> which suppose to be N V.</p>
                     <p>This length N V shall give the Radius or Tangent of 45 <hi>gr.</hi> which is the Tangent or Decimall Scale, out of which (either of them) you are to make your Zodiac by the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of those Tables in the 6 and 7 <hi>Pages.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this Radius or Decimall Scale, or Tangent of 45 <hi>gr.</hi> N W is the Tangent of 23 <hi>gr.</hi> and a halfe, wherefore the Semizodiac, R L or R M is to be made equall in length to N W. Thus the Zodiacs length is limited.</p>
                     <p>For the position of the Zodiac, it was before said, that it
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:57111:108"/>
must lie in the line of 7 in the morning, or 5 in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon. So in this last figure you see it points to Z, which is 7 in the morning, (and consequently also to X, which is 7 in the evening) in the distorted Ellipsis: because this is that Diall whose Index looks North-east: you see it do so likewise in the first figure <hi>Pag.</hi> 189, as in the second figure there it lies to 5 in the evening, and consequently also to 5 in the morning.</p>
                     <p>Observe in the last figure (which is as true and just in the two other <hi>Pag.</hi> 189.) that the angle P R Z, and so Q R X, is equall to the angle made (upon our common Horizontall Diall) between 6 and 7 a clock, namely, 18<hi>gr.</hi> 54 <hi>min.</hi> and consequently that 1 R 1 (a line drawn from 1 to 1 in the primary Ellipsis) is perpendicular to the Zodiac L M: but P R C is not equall to the angle thereon between 6 and 8 a clock; nor is it so in any other of the houres.</p>
                     <p>Observe again, that if a line be drawn parallel to O K. through A the point of 12 in the distorted Ellipsis, till it meet with the Zodiac (extended) at <hi>y</hi>; observed (I say) that if R M be taken as a Tangent of 23½ <hi>gr.</hi> (as it is taken in this work) then will R <hi>y</hi> be the Tangent of (the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your Latitude, namely) 38 <hi>gr.</hi> 30 <hi>min.</hi> And this must be so, because if the Sun should decline 38 <hi>gr.</hi>30 <hi>min.</hi> Southward, then the Sun must only peep up upon the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon at 12, and consequently the shadow of the Index (namely the point of it that intersects with your Horizon, for the Sun hath no altitude at that place and time) must run full from South to North to shew the point of 12 at A.</p>
                     <p>Other observations might be made, but I go no further.</p>
                     <p>The reason of the precedent work will be demonstrated out of the former things delivered in this Book: especially out of this last Treatise, which begins <hi>Pag.</hi> 171, and ends
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:57111:108"/>
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 186. And therefore I wholly omit to adde any thing more to this particular subject.</p>
                     <p>They that understand the things before, will not be to seeke in the necessary Demonstrations of these particulars.</p>

                     <p>Whence it will follow: That whatsoever is in this Book declared concerning the projection of the houre points of the Equinoctiall Circle upon any plain, &amp;c. the same may be applied to the projection of Azimuths or points of the Horizon upon any plain, &amp;c. Onely <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi>) instead of the Equinoctiall and Poles of the World, you are to use the Horizon and the Poles of it, (<hi>i.e.</hi>) Zenith and Nadir.</p>
                     <p>Then for the Zodiac (which depends upon the Scale or Tangents of Declination, which exceed not 23 and a half <hi>gr.</hi> you are to use (in the Azimuthal work) a Scale of Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents (rightly limited) going up from oo to so much alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude as you mean to use (if it be for the Suns course, to 62 <hi>gr.</hi> here at <hi>London.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>As there you rectifie the Index to the Declination of the Sun: So here you must (answerably) rectifie it to the Suns altitude taken by observation, and then the Index being set
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:57111:109"/>
to the altitude gives the Azimuth for that moment and no more.</p>
                     <div type="corollary">
                        <head>COROLLARY.</head>
                        <p>Therefore, to finde the Azimuth by this way, you must take the Suns Altitude, and so finde the Azimuth for one moment onely.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> Because it is a thing of no use, but of a great deal of trouble: for the altitude is to be observed, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex set thereto every moment,</p>
                        <p>

                           <hi>Answ.</hi> No; for there the Index set once, may serve in that place one whole day very well, because the Suns decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation doth not alter much in one day.</p>
