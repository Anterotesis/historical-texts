            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:12948:8"/>
hath a certaine Iuri≈ødiction, which is well to be vnder≈øtoode in his owne lands: But in the Empire where he hath no place among≈øt the Princes of the Empire: no Iuri≈ødiction may be allowed him, without demini≈øhing of the Emperiall Maie≈øtie: Let no man ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him≈øelfe once to be moued for that which hath bin ≈øo long ≈øaid, that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> is in the place of Chri≈øt here vpon earth. Chri≈øt him≈øelfe denied that his Kingdome was of this world. The Di≈øciple is not mightier then his Ma≈øter, nor the ≈øeruant greater then his Lord.</p>
            <p>What is more euident and plaine, then that which Chri≈øt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe ≈øaith. Let the Kings of the Nations beare rule, but with you it mu≈øt not be ≈øo: neither is that firmer that they hope for the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, from the triumph, and other proofes, wherewith they haue alwayes defended their cau≈øe, that Chri≈øt ≈øaid, All power is giuen me in heauen and in earth: <hi>Maldonatus</hi> refuteth this with the≈øe words. <q>Chri≈øt ≈øpeaketh not here of all power, but of that which he gaue to the Apo≈øtles: that is of the power to obtaine and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together his ≈øpirituall Kingdome, for which bu≈øine≈ø≈øe hee ≈øent out the Apo≈øtles; like as temporall Princes are carefull of their temporall goods, ≈øo are they al≈øo of their Iuri≈ødictions. Here auaileth that which the olde Father <hi>Bernard</hi> wrote to Pope <hi>Eugenius,</hi> in his fir≈øt booke of Ob≈øeruations, Your power is ouer offences or ≈øinnes, and not ouer po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions. The≈øe ba≈øe and earthly things haue their Iudges, Kings and Princes of the earth; wherefore doe≈øt thou enter vpon other mens iuri≈ødicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Wherefore doe≈øt thou thru≈øt thy Sickle or Sythe into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans Harue≈øt? Moreouer, he ≈øaith in his eleuenth booke, Dominion was forbiden the Apo≈øtles, dare≈øt thou then v≈øe it <hi>(A Lord)</hi> the Apo≈øtle≈øhip, or an Apo≈øtolicall per≈øon dominion, verily both the≈øe are forbiden you, if you will enioy both the≈øe at once. Therefore asketh <hi>Ho≈øtien≈øis,</hi> what ≈øhall we ≈øay of that which concerneth the Pope in worldly or temporall affaires? whereunto he maketh an≈øwere, with his Lord <hi>Innocentius,</hi> that vnto him, <hi>viz.</hi> the Pope, it concerned nothing at all. The ≈øame al≈øo may de read by <hi>Iohn Parien≈øis,</hi> in the tenth Chapter of the power of Kings and Popes. This is long agoe tolde vnto them,
<pb facs="tcp:12948:8"/>
but they giue it no audience, from hence ari≈øeth the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh complaint by <hi>Mathew Paris,</hi> where hee treateth of <hi>Henry</hi> the third. That it is ≈øufficiently knowne and found, that the wrath of God is falne vpon the Romi≈øh Church, becau≈øe their Magi≈øtrate and Regent, doe not diligently apply them≈øelues for the denotion of the people, nor for the gaining of ≈øoules; but to purcha≈øe Reuenues, and to ≈øcrape money together.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Other Nations v≈øed very grieuou≈øly to complaine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and that with good rea≈øon, e≈øpecially <hi>Germany,</hi> who≈øe Princes long agoe ≈øeeking remedy hereof, were not very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, who could neuer ≈øatisfie the Romi≈øh Clergie, with riches and dignities: from this vn≈øatiable gulfe, al≈øo ari≈øeth that they in the third Article, de≈øire to cut off the conditions for their aduantage, which for the common peace ≈øake, were receiued aboue ≈øeauenty yeares ≈øince at <hi>Pa≈ø≈øow.</hi> But it is not in the Popes power, not in the Clergie, to breake that which was concluded by a generall Councell of the States, where the Authority of <hi>Charles</hi> entertained.</p>
            <p>Heere followeth the Cen≈øure vppon the ≈øecond part, which extendeth it ≈øelfe farre larger then the fir≈øt, in regard that it not onely ≈øheweth the Cardinali≈øh Prince, but that which lyeth next vnder. This afore-≈øaid part containeth 20. Articles, in which they with the like proofes doe proceede, as yet ≈øeemeth: yet their obiect indeede is ≈øomething el≈øe, more then in the former. In which it ≈øeemeth to be ≈øufficient to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Lonigus:</hi> That if the Duke of <hi>Bauaria</hi> could but be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwaded, that hee would ≈øeeke for the con≈øent of the Pope, in tho≈øe dignities where he was honoured. In ≈øuch manner the chiefe≈øt Cardinals doe take the reynes of good rea≈øon too too long into their hands; Nay, as <hi>Phacton</hi> vpon the Waggon of their Auarice, to the great danger of the world, and more e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of <hi>Germany,</hi> doe ride out of the common rout of the Popes: like as if it were a matter of no moment, to pronounce ≈øuch an horrible ≈øentence of the Tran≈øport of the Elector≈øhip
<pb facs="tcp:12948:9"/>
of the <hi>Pal≈øgraue,</hi> and the occa≈øion thereof: whereof we will not now di≈øpute, and ≈øo they fall aboord the Prince-Electors of <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> in the behalfe of the Rights of the Election: what is it el≈øe but with the like thunderbolt to da≈øh the heads of the ≈øacred Empire? they ≈øay they are Heretickes: It is now no time to enquire after here≈øie, but rather ≈øoundly to di≈øpute, whether that a Bi≈øhop like as hee hath right to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate a man for here≈øie; Whether therefore hee hath the power al≈øo to rob and ≈øpoile a man of his dignities and meanes? verily therein is great difference: Chri≈øt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded that the excommunicated ≈øhould be counted as an Heathen or Publican: but in no place willeth hee that men ≈øhould rob the Heathens or Publicans of their Authority, or ≈øhould ≈øpoile them of their goods. Chri≈øt him≈øelfe paid Tole vnto the publicanes, and by his example, hath ≈øhewed vs the way what we ≈øhould doe. The Apo≈øtles liued vnder Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh Emperours, and were obedient to their lawes: in like manner al≈øo were all their Succe≈ø≈øors: nay the Apo≈øtles being obedient, v≈øed to pray to God for them: <q>There ≈øaith <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> in his Analogie, in the thirtieth Chapter, wee inuoke the eternall God for the pro≈øperity of the Emperour, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he may haue a long life, a peacefull gouernment, an e≈øtabli≈øht habitation, ≈øtrong Armies, faithfull Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and a peacefull world:</q> When <hi>Iulian</hi> left Chri≈øtianity, and betooke him≈øelfe to Heatheni≈øme, did the Chri≈øtians then detrude him forth of his Empire?

            <p>We know it all of vs, that the Empire was tran≈øported, but withall that it was done by the councell of <hi>Rome,</hi> as al≈øo all <hi>Italy</hi> con≈øented thereunto, either priuatly or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely. Of the we≈øterne people I will pa≈ø≈øe ouer in ≈øilence; They ≈øay againe that we haue many Writers, which make repetition of that which <hi>Leo</hi> did; who denieth that: but they commend <hi>Leo,</hi> as being one of the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øt citizens, and ≈øo had the greate≈øt re≈øpect of any man in the Citty: they commend him al≈øo as being Bi≈øhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who with his hands was to ≈øet vp the crowne, as being a ≈øign or repre≈øentation of the Empire; Therefore the≈øe writers were in no here≈øie, becau≈øe they meant that either <hi>Leo</hi> did the ≈øame alone, or el≈øe principally could haue done it. Many other who are no le≈ø≈øe in number, nor in re≈øpect then the≈øe, doe relate vnto vs the cleane contrary: they ≈øay expre≈øly, that the ≈øame was done and performed according to the decree &amp; will, as is afore≈øaid of the Councell of <hi>Rome.</hi>

            <p>How much more is it to beleeue that which is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by witne≈ø≈øes, which is denied by none: then not to beleeue tho≈øe which doe confirme the ≈øame, becau≈øe that all of them do not affirme, although there be no body that doe deny the ≈øame: <q>for after this manner writeth <hi>Michell Coccimmus</hi> very well, in his booke of the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øport of the Empire, we mu≈øt beleeue that the ≈øame tran≈øport was performed, and had his power or opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the con≈øent and authoritie of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and other people of <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </q> That which <hi>Innocentius</hi> the 3. wrote vnto <hi>Bartold</hi> Duke of <hi>Zaringe,</hi> doth not contradict the ≈øame: That the apo≈øtolicall ≈øeate of <hi>Rome,</hi> tran≈øported the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire vnto the per≈øon of the famous <hi>Charles</hi> from the <hi>Grecians</hi> vnto the <hi>Germanes,</hi> for in this wee con≈øent: That the Apo≈øtolicall ≈øeate vpon no other meaning did tran≈øport the Empire, but that they who did tran≈øport the Empire, did con≈øent thereunto, or el≈øe made declaration that they ≈øhould tran≈øport the ≈øame. But ≈øuch a tran≈øport hath had its power from the vniforme con≈øent of the people.</p>
            <p>Hence may very plainely appeare in what maner the tran≈øport which <hi>Leo</hi> performed was done, and by this meanes that is very ea≈øily ouerthrowne, which they ≈øay:
<pb facs="tcp:12948:10"/>
That the Empire was tran≈øported for Here≈øie: the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of the tran≈øport is here formerly related out of <hi>Sigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus:</hi> the true cau≈øe thereof was, becau≈øe the Emperours of the Ea≈øt did neglect, or were carele≈ø≈øe of the We≈øterne Empire and authoritie: and ≈øo (as is afore≈øaid) did let it pa≈ø≈øe; this we can confirme and approue with very firme te≈øtimony; <hi>Lupoldus</hi> ≈øaith in his fourth booke of the rights of the authoritie of the Empire, in this maner. <q>The <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperour in the time of <hi>Carolas Magnus,</hi> nay before his time al≈øo, <hi>viz.</hi> when his Father <hi>Pepin,</hi> and his Grandfather <hi>Carolus Martellus</hi> liued, gouerned onely with the name of the We≈øterne Empire: ≈øo that neither the Romi≈øh Church, nor the other Chri≈øtian Congregations, nor tho≈øe of the <hi>Longobardes,</hi> who were contrary to all law ≈øuppre≈øt, could either by the Ea≈øterne Emperour, nor by their authoritie obtaine any right in the We≈øterne Empire: ≈øo that the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaid Emperours made no account nor reckoning of the We≈øterne Empire, but held it loo≈øely as a derelict, onely commanding therewith the name, as appeareth in diuers Chronicles; Of the ≈øame opinion is <hi>Iohannes Pari≈øien≈øis,</hi> in his 16. Chapter, writing of the Kingly and papall power. It was not done by the Pope onely, but that it was the peoples de≈øire, who may ≈øubiect them≈øelues to whom they will, without preiudice to any other: and therefore that was done for a nece≈ø≈øary rea≈øon, for to defend them again≈øt the Heathens and infidels, becau≈øe they could not be defended by any other: which right they might doe: for the people make the King, and the Army the Emperour.</q>

            </p>
            <p>Hence appeareth plaine enough, that they are either fooles, or el≈øe are much deceiued, which thinke that the Empire was tran≈øported to the <hi>Francks</hi> for here≈øie.</p>
            <p>This al≈øo is worthy con≈øideration, that although the Ea≈øterne Empire was tran≈øported by Pope <hi>Leo</hi> to the We≈øterne, that the Pope hath now the ≈øame right to remoue the Empire according to his will. In olde time it was otherwi≈øe then it is now. Let vs grant that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> had ≈øome right, as the be≈øt qualified citizen of the citie; nay that the City (which neuer yet was done) had tran≈øported all her power vnto him, what doth that concerne the≈øe our pre≈øent times, ≈øince that the Pope hath driuen the Emperour out of the dominion of the Citie. After what manner (≈øay I) hereafter ≈øhall either <hi>Rome</hi> it ≈øelfe, or the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> pretend any right in the electing of an Emperour, ≈øince they doe not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Emperour for their Lord; yea ≈øince it is acknowledged that the prince Electors are to be ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the con≈øent and voices of the States, and this is by the approbation of <hi>Gregory</hi> the 5; hath not the Pope lo≈øt his right when he con≈øented hereunto? ≈øo that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that authoritie which the Pope a≈øcribeth to him≈øelfe is quite ouerthrowne. What a number of proofes might be produced again≈øt this power of the Pope? yea al≈øo the te≈øtimonie of principall per≈øonages, who by rea≈øon of their learning, are exceeding famous.</p>
            <p>Here followeth the third part, which falleth very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uou≈øly
<pb facs="tcp:12948:12"/>
both with tooth and naile vpon the bodies of all tho≈øe that di≈ølike the ≈øentence of the Pope, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øteth in the three la≈øt Articles.</p>
            <p>And fir≈øt that is touched which concerneth the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, that is, the right of voice is taken from the Prince Elector the Duke of <hi>Saxon;</hi> vnder this pretext, becau≈øe for≈øooth the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not confirmed that dignitie wherwith that family for the≈øe many yeares hath been inve≈øted, nor is it confirmed by the Pope: as if that illu≈øtrious Family had not been ≈øo wi≈øe, as neuer to haue required the ≈øame of the Pope. It is but too well knowne vnto them, that they whom the Hope glorieth to haue honoured with the name of Empire or Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that hee taketh away from them the maie≈øtie of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie: ≈øo that his inve≈øting may well be called di≈øro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, and his crowning a dethroning or depo≈øing. For I pray you, of what con≈øequence is the confirmation of the Pope vnto tho≈øe whom he driues into a bodily feare, if he had no temporall power? It is ≈øuch as <hi>Origen</hi> long ago vnder≈øtood to be; which he taught, as appeareth by his writings vpon <hi>Mathew,</hi> on his twelfth Homily: <q>Among you which are mine, the≈øe things ≈øhall not be; to the end that tho≈øe which haue any power in the Church, doe not ≈øeeme to domineere ouer their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, nor to v≈øe any authoritie. For like as a nece≈øsitie is impo≈øed vpon temporall matters, and not left to the will; and ≈øpirituall matters in will, and not in nece≈øsity: ≈øo ≈øhall the dominion of ≈øpirituall Princes be confirmed in loue, and not in bodily feare.</q> If therefore the power of the prince Electors be from the Pope, becau≈øe that the Emperiall power is from him, as our adver≈øaries affirme: how can they proue that the dignitie of the prince Elector mu≈øt proceed from the Pope, if it be not needfull that the Emperour be confirmed by the Pope? There is a text that ≈øaith, The Army maketh an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. The Glo≈ø≈øe ≈øaith thereby, He is a right Emperour before he be confirmed by the Pope. This they of <hi>Ba≈øil</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:12948:12"/>
vnder≈øtood very well; who after the death of <hi>Lodowicke,</hi> where the Lord of <hi>Bambergher</hi> chiefe Pre≈øident made this an≈øwer: That Emperour which the prince Electors ≈øhall ordaine for vs, him will we accept of, although he haue no re≈øpect vnto the Pope. This appeareth <hi>in ≈øupple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento Vr≈øpergen≈øi.</hi> Nay that which is more; the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe confe≈ø≈øeth, that not the Empire it ≈øelfe, but the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall title re≈øted onely in him. Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the fourth, in his Epi≈øtle to the Archbi≈øhop of <hi>Ments, Tryer</hi> and <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> ≈øaith: The name of the Emperour is from the Pope, but the Empire and Authoritie cometh from the prince Electors. Hence then is confuted that which is ≈øaid in the 27.

            <p>I am forced to ≈øtop my eares by the rea≈øon of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame proud and ambitious affront which is ≈øet downe in the 28 Article: That although the two mo≈øt pui≈ø≈øant Kings of <hi>Great Brittaine</hi> and <hi>Denmarke,</hi> or the two il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu≈øtrous prince Electors of <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> ≈øhould require of the Emperour that the <hi>Pal≈øgraue</hi> of the <hi>Rhine</hi> might be re≈øtored againe vnto his hereditary po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈øsions and dignitie of prince Elector, that they then robbed the Seate of <hi>Rome</hi> of the right of its maie≈øtie, and did attribute the power of the prince Electors dignitie vnto the Emperour.

            <p>Here ought we to ob≈øerue, how cunningly and craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily the Colledge of Cardinalls ob≈øerue and aime at the example of the ancient holy Church, chiefly in the time of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7: vnder which this lurketh, that this Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> was the very fir≈øt who dur≈øt a≈øcribe &amp; take vnto him≈øelfe the right of the Empire; At what time (I pray you) liued this Pope? about the yeare 1100. is the antiquitie whereof they boa≈øt; I may affirme with <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that this is noueltie; what holine≈ø≈øe was there in tho≈øe dayes, when all maner of fractious, cu≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, frauds, deceites, and villanies had their full ≈øwinge: and to write much thereof would be to dangerous, and be no honour to Chri≈øtendome; Like as the Writer of tho≈øe times affirmeth in the dayes of the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. It is very well knowne vnto all men, what Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Benno</hi> hath written and tran≈ølated of that Pope:

(although Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> iudgeth that the ≈øame was wrtten by a Lutheran;) In like manner, it is al≈øo but to well knowne by other Writers, who haue painted out in liuely colours this Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> euen to the life. A certaine man named <hi>Orthamus Gracious,</hi> very much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to the Romi≈øh Church, was the fir≈øt publi≈øher thereof in a booke, wherein are contained very many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable ob≈øeruations: out of the actions of this Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> the Colledge of Cardinals, in the 19.

            <p>It is indeed much to be wondred at, that the Clergie men are grown to that pa≈ø≈øe, that they ≈øo ≈øtoutly attempt that which all the world hath in abomination, and with ≈øuch polluted hands to lay hold vpon the mo≈øt famous ≈øtate of the Empire. We ob≈øerue al≈øo how ≈øhamele≈ø≈øe the Colledge of Cardinalls are, willing that we (from the euill liues and wicked actions of decea≈øed Popes) ≈øhould conclude how great the authoritie of the Pope is: at lea≈øt they neede not to be ≈øo contumelious, and arrogant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt tho≈øe Emperours, which in former times the Popes haue acknowledged to be them≈øelues ≈øeruants of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours; The Pope al≈øo ought to haue in con≈øideration that he by meanes of the Empire hath obtained ≈øo great riches, and now by the greatne≈ø≈øe of his power, and all maner of ≈øen≈øuallities, blindeth the eyes of many tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall princes.</p>

He is enriched with earthly countries, to the end he ≈øhould enrich vs with the heauenly, and now they ≈øerue him to take away our earthly; He is enriched, to the end that by his religious care, we might liue in greater ≈øecuritie in the Empire: now he careth not for that, although there be trouble rai≈øed in the Empire, ≈øo he may liue brauely and laciuiou≈øly; This is the reward of peruerted liberalty: ≈øo that for many ages it hath been very truely ≈øaid: <q>Religion brought forth riches, and the Daughter hath deuoured the Mother.</q>
            </p>
            <p>You props and pillers of the Empire, (mo≈øt Illu≈øtrious Emperour, Princes Electors, Princes, and States) tollerate no longer this triumph and pride of the Romi≈øh Clergie: you ≈øee how boldly they violate the lawes of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, they limite your e≈øtabli≈øhed law, and preferre vnto you that which they do but thinke and inuent: leauing vnto you the bare name of the empire, but haue drawne the maie≈øtie thereof long agoe to them≈øelues.</p>
