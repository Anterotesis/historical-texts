            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

From all this very plainely appeareth, that the French aſſuredly knew, that it was in the Popes power to eſtabliſh the Emperiall command in their Kingdome, and to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from the Germanes the Empire and the right of the Election: and therefore may the Pope according to the plenitude of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, no longer vſe conniuence, when as theſe Arch-Hereticks, the <hi>Saxon</hi> and the <hi>Brandenburgher,</hi> would throw downe into hell, the antiquity and order of the Empire.</p>

            <p>HEre are preſented vnto vs 29. Articles, from the Prelates of the Romiſh Church, whoſe Elegancie is not much to be commended, and doe tend to the preiudice of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:</hi> for the better examination whereof, we will courſe through all the members or particulars, and to the end that no man may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched therewith, we will adminiſter vnto the ſimple an Antidote againſt this poyſon.</p>
            <p>The beginning ſhall be of the three firſt Articles, wherein the Clergy of <hi>Rome</hi> doe imagine vnto themſelues a moſt excellent growth as well of the Iuriſdiction, as of the Temporall goods.</p>
            <p>To ſpeake in order of both theſe: I ſay the Pope for as much as he is Pope, hath no Iuriſdiction at all, but for as much as he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched by the liberality of Princes, he hath alſo his owne lands, and
<pb facs="tcp:12948:8"/>
hath a certaine Iuriſdiction, which is well to be vnderſtoode in his owne lands: But in the Empire where he hath no place amongſt the Princes of the Empire: no Iuriſdiction may be allowed him, without deminiſhing of the Emperiall Maieſtie: Let no man ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himſelfe once to be moued for that which hath bin ſo long ſaid, that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> is in the place of Chriſt here vpon earth. Chriſt himſelfe denied that his Kingdome was of this world. The Diſciple is not mightier then his Maſter, nor the ſeruant greater then his Lord.</p>
            <p>What is more euident and plaine, then that which Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſaith. Let the Kings of the Nations beare rule, but with you it muſt not be ſo: neither is that firmer that they hope for the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, from the triumph, and other proofes, wherewith they haue alwayes defended their cauſe, that Chriſt ſaid, All power is giuen me in heauen and in earth: <hi>Maldonatus</hi> refuteth this with theſe words. <q>Chriſt ſpeaketh not here of all power, but of that which he gaue to the Apoſtles: that is of the power to obtaine and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together his ſpirituall Kingdome, for which buſineſſe hee ſent out the Apoſtles; like as temporall Princes are carefull of their temporall goods, ſo are they alſo of their Iuriſdictions. Here auaileth that which the olde Father <hi>Bernard</hi> wrote to Pope <hi>Eugenius,</hi> in his firſt booke of Obſeruations, Your power is ouer offences or ſinnes, and not ouer poſſeſſions. Theſe baſe and earthly things haue their Iudges, Kings and Princes of the earth; wherefore doeſt thou enter vpon other mens iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Wherefore doeſt thou thruſt thy Sickle or Sythe into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans Harueſt? Moreouer, he ſaith in his eleuenth booke, Dominion was forbiden the Apoſtles, dareſt thou then vſe it <hi>(A Lord)</hi> the Apoſtleſhip, or an Apoſtolicall perſon dominion, verily both theſe are forbiden you, if you will enioy both theſe at once. Therefore asketh <hi>Hoſtienſis,</hi> what ſhall we ſay of that which concerneth the Pope in worldly or temporall affaires? whereunto he maketh anſwere, with his Lord <hi>Innocentius,</hi> that vnto him, <hi>viz.</hi> the Pope, it concerned nothing at all. The ſame alſo may de read by <hi>Iohn Parienſis,</hi> in the tenth Chapter of the power of Kings and Popes. This is long agoe tolde vnto them,

but they giue it no audience, from hence ariſeth the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh complaint by <hi>Mathew Paris,</hi> where hee treateth of <hi>Henry</hi> the third. That it is ſufficiently knowne and found, that the wrath of God is falne vpon the Romiſh Church, becauſe their Magiſtrate and Regent, doe not diligently apply themſelues for the denotion of the people, nor for the gaining of ſoules; but to purchaſe Reuenues, and to ſcrape money together.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Other Nations vſed very grieuouſly to complaine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and that with good reaſon, eſpecially <hi>Germany,</hi> whoſe Princes long agoe ſeeking remedy hereof, were not very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, who could neuer ſatisfie the Romiſh Clergie, with riches and dignities: from this vnſatiable gulfe, alſo ariſeth that they in the third Article, deſire to cut off the conditions for their aduantage, which for the common peace ſake, were receiued aboue ſeauenty yeares ſince at <hi>Paſſow.</hi> But it is not in the Popes power, not in the Clergie, to breake that which was concluded by a generall Councell of the States, where the Authority of <hi>Charles</hi> entertained.</p>
            <p>Heere followeth the Cenſure vppon the ſecond part, which extendeth it ſelfe farre larger then the firſt, in regard that it not onely ſheweth the Cardinaliſh Prince, but that which lyeth next vnder. This afore-ſaid part containeth 20. Articles, in which they with the like proofes doe proceede, as yet ſeemeth: yet their obiect indeede is ſomething elſe, more then in the former. In which it ſeemeth to be ſufficient to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Lonigus:</hi> That if the Duke of <hi>Bauaria</hi> could but be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that hee would ſeeke for the conſent of the Pope, in thoſe dignities where he was honoured. In ſuch manner the chiefeſt Cardinals doe take the reynes of good reaſon too too long into their hands; Nay, as <hi>Phacton</hi> vpon the Waggon of their Auarice, to the great danger of the world, and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of <hi>Germany,</hi> doe ride out of the common rout of the Popes: like as if it were a matter of no moment, to pronounce ſuch an horrible ſentence of the Tranſport of the Electorſhip
<pb facs="tcp:12948:9"/>
of the <hi>Palſgraue,</hi> and the occaſion thereof: whereof we will not now diſpute, and ſo they fall aboord the Prince-Electors of <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> in the behalfe of the Rights of the Election: what is it elſe but with the like thunderbolt to daſh the heads of the ſacred Empire? they ſay they are Heretickes: It is now no time to enquire after hereſie, but rather ſoundly to diſpute, whether that a Biſhop like as hee hath right to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate a man for hereſie; Whether therefore hee hath the power alſo to rob and ſpoile a man of his dignities and meanes? verily therein is great difference: Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded that the excommunicated ſhould be counted as an Heathen or Publican: but in no place willeth hee that men ſhould rob the Heathens or Publicans of their Authority, or ſhould ſpoile them of their goods. Chriſt himſelfe paid Tole vnto the publicanes, and by his example, hath ſhewed vs the way what we ſhould doe. The Apoſtles liued vnder Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Emperours, and were obedient to their lawes: in like manner alſo were all their Succeſſors: nay the Apoſtles being obedient, vſed to pray to God for them: <q>There ſaith <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> in his Analogie, in the thirtieth Chapter, wee inuoke the eternall God for the proſperity of the Emperour, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he may haue a long life, a peacefull gouernment, an eſtabliſht habitation, ſtrong Armies, faithfull Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and a peacefull world:</q> When <hi>Iulian</hi> left Chriſtianity, and betooke himſelfe to Heatheniſme, did the Chriſtians then detrude him forth of his Empire? When they heare of this, then will they contend with later examples, ſaying, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then may not the Pope, by the ſame right for hereſie, tranſport the dignity of the Prince-Electorſhip vnto another, ſince that Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the third, for the ſame occaſion tranſported Empire from the Grecians vpon the <hi>Francks?</hi> This is that <hi>Achilles</hi> which ſo boaſts in the Colledge of the <hi>Cardinalls,</hi> but yet he is not ſtrong enough to take in our Citie of <hi>Elium.</hi> They abuſe themſelues exceedingly with this example; firſt from the Act of the Pope, they conclude the iuſtneſſe of the Act, if we may ſo driue our Arguments, there is no Act of any
<pb facs="tcp:12948:9"/>
man, but it may be found fault withall: they erre alſo herein, that they affirme that to be done, which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer done.</p>
            <p>We know it all of vs, that the Empire was tranſported, but withall that it was done by the councell of <hi>Rome,</hi> as alſo all <hi>Italy</hi> conſented thereunto, either priuatly or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely. Of the weſterne people I will paſſe ouer in ſilence; They ſay againe that we haue many Writers, which make repetition of that which <hi>Leo</hi> did; who denieth that: but they commend <hi>Leo,</hi> as being one of the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt citizens, and ſo had the greateſt reſpect of any man in the Citty: they commend him alſo as being Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who with his hands was to ſet vp the crowne, as being a ſign or repreſentation of the Empire; Therefore theſe writers were in no hereſie, becauſe they meant that either <hi>Leo</hi> did the ſame alone, or elſe principally could haue done it. Many other who are no leſſe in number, nor in reſpect then theſe, doe relate vnto vs the cleane contrary: they ſay expreſly, that the ſame was done and performed according to the decree &amp; will, as is aforeſaid of the Councell of <hi>Rome.</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Sigebertus</hi>ſaith in the yeare 801: The <hi>Romans</hi> now, who long agoe had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne their affections from the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, as then finding very good opportunitie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that a woman, when the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was depriued of his ſight, gouerned them by his Son: then proclaimed they with one accord the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> for their Emperour, they crowned him by the hand of Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> they ſtiled him Emperour and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus.</hi> A popiſh writer <hi>Theodoricus de Niem,</hi> who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards was Biſhop of <hi>Verden,</hi> ſaith, about the very time of the Coronation the people of <hi>Rome</hi> made a Law ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the old cuſtome, but it was very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to recollect all things that happened ſo often: therefore the ſentence, right and power of the Empire, was left vnto the Emperour as we finde it written: then the people of <hi>Rome</hi> tranſported all this vnto <hi>Charles,</hi> &amp;

               <hi>Blondus</hi> alſo in his firſt book, decad 2: and <hi>Aneas Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius,</hi> or <hi>Pius</hi> 2. in <hi>Blondus</hi> his ſhort relation: alſo <hi>Iacobus Wymphelingies,</hi> in his ſhort relation of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the xi. Chapter, doe affirme that the Coronation by <hi>Leo,</hi> was performed and done with the knowledge, and at the entreatie of the people of <hi>Rome.</hi> Theſe are the wordes of <hi>Onuphrius Panuimus in faſtis: Leo</hi> by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and at the entreatie of the clergie of <hi>Rome,</hi> proclameth <hi>Charles</hi> Emperour. So that from theſe and others who affirme that it was done by the Councell, and the people of <hi>Rome;</hi> muſt thoſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters be interpreted, that they doe not confirme, nor yet deny the ſame?</p>
            <p>How much more is it to beleeue that which is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by witneſſes, which is denied by none: then not to beleeue thoſe which doe confirme the ſame, becauſe that all of them do not affirme, although there be no body that doe deny the ſame: <q>for after this manner writeth <hi>Michell Coccimmus</hi> very well, in his booke of the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport of the Empire, we muſt beleeue that the ſame tranſport was performed, and had his power or opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the conſent and authoritie of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and other people of <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </q> That which <hi>Innocentius</hi> the 3. wrote vnto <hi>Bartold</hi> Duke of <hi>Zaringe,</hi> doth not contradict the ſame: That the apoſtolicall ſeate of <hi>Rome,</hi> tranſported the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire vnto the perſon of the famous <hi>Charles</hi> from the <hi>Grecians</hi> vnto the <hi>Germanes,</hi> for in this wee conſent: That the Apoſtolicall ſeate vpon no other meaning did tranſport the Empire, but that they who did tranſport the Empire, did conſent thereunto, or elſe made declaration that they ſhould tranſport the ſame. But ſuch a tranſport hath had its power from the vniforme conſent of the people.</p>
            <p>Hence may very plainely appeare in what maner the tranſport which <hi>Leo</hi> performed was done, and by this meanes that is very eaſily ouerthrowne, which they ſay:
<pb facs="tcp:12948:10"/>
That the Empire was tranſported for Hereſie: the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the tranſport is here formerly related out of <hi>Sigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus:</hi> the true cauſe thereof was, becauſe the Emperours of the Eaſt did neglect, or were careleſſe of the Weſterne Empire and authoritie: and ſo (as is aforeſaid) did let it paſſe; this we can confirme and approue with very firme teſtimony; <hi>Lupoldus</hi> ſaith in his fourth booke of the rights of the authoritie of the Empire, in this maner. <q>The <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperour in the time of <hi>Carolas Magnus,</hi> nay before his time alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> when his Father <hi>Pepin,</hi> and his Grandfather <hi>Carolus Martellus</hi> liued, gouerned onely with the name of the Weſterne Empire: ſo that neither the Romiſh Church, nor the other Chriſtian Congregations, nor thoſe of the <hi>Longobardes,</hi> who were contrary to all law ſuppreſt, could either by the Eaſterne Emperour, nor by their authoritie obtaine any right in the Weſterne Empire: ſo that the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Emperours made no account nor reckoning of the Weſterne Empire, but held it looſely as a derelict, onely commanding therewith the name, as appeareth in diuers Chronicles; Of the ſame opinion is <hi>Iohannes Pariſienſis,</hi> in his 16. Chapter, writing of the Kingly and papall power. It was not done by the Pope onely, but that it was the peoples deſire, who may ſubiect themſelues to whom they will, without preiudice to any other: and therefore that was done for a neceſſary reaſon, for to defend them againſt the Heathens and infidels, becauſe they could not be defended by any other: which right they might doe: for the people make the King, and the Army the Emperour.</q>
               <hi>Aneas Syluius</hi> in his booke of the riſing, and authoritie of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, ſaith in the 9. Chap.  <q>At the laſt when the <hi>Grecians</hi> were careleſſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> and leauing the ſame to be made a pray, and to be ranſacked one while by the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and alſo by others: the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> who with their blood had got ſuch great riches, who by their valour had erected the Monarchie of the

world, <hi>ſaluted by the name of Emperour, Carolus Magnus then King of the Francks, being a German borne,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered the Citie and the Holy place from the inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of enemies: firſt greeting him with this title, <hi>Patricius:</hi> and afterwards <hi>Auguſtus:</hi>
               </q> the Popes good will and pleaſure hereunto concurring. <q>Alſo ſaith <hi>Nauelerus</hi> in his 27. <hi>generat,</hi> in the yeare 800, vpon the day of the Birth of our Lord, good deliberation procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: <hi>Leo</hi> the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> conſidering that the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinopolitan</hi> Emperours did very careleſſely defend that name, and held the Weſterne Empire as loſt: he declared, with the conſent of the people of <hi>Rome, Charles</hi> Emperour of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and crowned him with the Crowne; when the commonaltie of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> three times cried out aloude, <hi>Carolo Auguſto, &amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> in his Hiſtorie of the <hi>Francks,</hi> ſaith thus: <q>The Maieſtie of the Emperours was now at this time, and before very ſlight; and there after he ſaith: the principalleſt of the <hi>Romans</hi> being of another cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and audacitie, gaue their voyces, that the ſeate of the Empire being (as it were voyde) and poſſeſſed of none: as if it had beene Gods will, and had beene ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained: ſhould be inueſted with the King of the <hi>Francks,</hi> becauſe that he by his ſeruice which he had done for the Church, had well deſerued the ſame: and that they were obligde and bound to him, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Michaell Coccimus</hi> ſpeaketh yet more plaine concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the tranſport of the Empire, ſaying: <q>When the <hi>Romans,</hi> and almoſt all the people of <hi>Italy</hi> by proceſſe of time, and the Inuaſion of many Nations and pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, as being ſubiect to the <hi>Gothes, Vice-Gothes, Humes,</hi> and <hi>Longbardes,</hi> and being not able with their owne forces to defend themſelues, and the <hi>Grecians</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no care at all of them for the performance therof: nay that which is more, they themſelues heaping euill vpon euill, and vſing all diligence to ſuppreſſe and ſpoile them, vſing to great auariciouſneſſe and deſire of
<pb facs="tcp:12948:11"/>
authoritie ouer them; they marking the exceſsiue couetouſneſſe of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and alſo their careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: obſeruing alſo the worthineſſe, capacitie, and equitie of the <hi>Germanes:</hi> they tranſported the Empire from the <hi>Grecians</hi> vnto the <hi>Germanes,</hi> and recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the ſame to <hi>Carolus Magnus;</hi> This tranſport of the Empire being effected by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Italy,</hi> and that with the common conſent and authoritie of them all, out of all doubt had full power, and hath remained firme.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Hence appeareth plaine enough, that they are either fooles, or elſe are much deceiued, which thinke that the Empire was tranſported to the <hi>Francks</hi> for hereſie.</p>
            <p>This alſo is worthy conſideration, that although the Eaſterne Empire was tranſported by Pope <hi>Leo</hi> to the Weſterne, that the Pope hath now the ſame right to remoue the Empire according to his will. In olde time it was otherwiſe then it is now. Let vs grant that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> had ſome right, as the beſt qualified citizen of the citie; nay that the City (which neuer yet was done) had tranſported all her power vnto him, what doth that concerne theſe our preſent times, ſince that the Pope hath driuen the Emperour out of the dominion of the Citie. After what manner (ſay I) hereafter ſhall either <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe, or the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> pretend any right in the electing of an Emperour, ſince they doe not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Emperour for their Lord; yea ſince it is acknowledged that the prince Electors are to be ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the conſent and voices of the States, and this is by the approbation of <hi>Gregory</hi> the 5; hath not the Pope loſt his right when he conſented hereunto? ſo that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that authoritie which the Pope aſcribeth to himſelfe is quite ouerthrowne. What a number of proofes might be produced againſt this power of the Pope? yea alſo the teſtimonie of principall perſonages, who by reaſon of their learning, are exceeding famous.</p>
            <p>Here followeth the third part, which falleth very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly
<pb facs="tcp:12948:12"/>
both with tooth and naile vpon the bodies of all thoſe that diſlike the ſentence of the Pope, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in the three laſt Articles.</p>
            <p>And firſt that is touched which concerneth the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, that is, the right of voice is taken from the Prince Elector the Duke of <hi>Saxon;</hi> vnder this pretext, becauſe forſooth the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not confirmed that dignitie wherwith that family for theſe many yeares hath been inveſted, nor is it confirmed by the Pope: as if that illuſtrious Family had not been ſo wiſe, as neuer to haue required the ſame of the Pope. It is but too well knowne vnto them, that they whom the Hope glorieth to haue honoured with the name of Empire or Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that hee taketh away from them the maieſtie of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie: ſo that his inveſting may well be called diſro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, and his crowning a dethroning or depoſing. For I pray you, of what conſequence is the confirmation of the Pope vnto thoſe whom he driues into a bodily feare, if he had no temporall power? It is ſuch as <hi>Origen</hi> long ago vnderſtood to be; which he taught, as appeareth by his writings vpon <hi>Mathew,</hi> on his twelfth Homily: <q>Among you which are mine, theſe things ſhall not be; to the end that thoſe which haue any power in the Church, doe not ſeeme to domineere ouer their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, nor to vſe any authoritie. For like as a neceſsitie is impoſed vpon temporall matters, and not left to the will; and ſpirituall matters in will, and not in neceſsity: ſo ſhall the dominion of ſpirituall Princes be confirmed in loue, and not in bodily feare.</q> If therefore the power of the prince Electors be from the Pope, becauſe that the Emperiall power is from him, as our adverſaries affirme: how can they proue that the dignitie of the prince Elector muſt proceed from the Pope, if it be not needfull that the Emperour be confirmed by the Pope? There is a text that ſaith, The Army maketh an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. The Gloſſe ſaith thereby, He is a right Emperour before he be confirmed by the Pope. This they of <hi>Baſil</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:12948:12"/>
vnderſtood very well; who after the death of <hi>Lodowicke,</hi> where the Lord of <hi>Bambergher</hi> chiefe Preſident made this anſwer: That Emperour which the prince Electors ſhall ordaine for vs, him will we accept of, although he haue no reſpect vnto the Pope. This appeareth <hi>in ſupple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento Vrſpergenſi.</hi> Nay that which is more; the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe confeſſeth, that not the Empire it ſelfe, but the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall title reſted onely in him. Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the fourth, in his Epiſtle to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Ments, Tryer</hi> and <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> ſaith: The name of the Emperour is from the Pope, but the Empire and Authoritie cometh from the prince Electors. Hence then is confuted that which is ſaid in the 27. Article, ſince that the Pope hath confirmed the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> in the dignitie of prince Elector, that then not onely the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> (who is there mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) but alſo the Emperour is bereaued of the power to reſtore againe vnto the <hi>Palſgraue</hi> his hereditary poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsions and the dignitie of the prince electorſhip. For if the Pope hath no power in the affaires of the Empire, then ſhall the Emperour by his doings not loſe his right, much leſſe any other Prince, if he before the Popes deed had any right of ſuffrage.</p>
            <p>I am forced to ſtop my eares by the reaſon of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame proud and ambitious affront which is ſet downe in the 28 Article: That although the two moſt puiſſant Kings of <hi>Great Brittaine</hi> and <hi>Denmarke,</hi> or the two il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrous prince Electors of <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> ſhould require of the Emperour that the <hi>Palſgraue</hi> of the <hi>Rhine</hi> might be reſtored againe vnto his hereditary poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsions and dignitie of prince Elector, that they then robbed the Seate of <hi>Rome</hi> of the right of its maieſtie, and did attribute the power of the prince Electors dignitie vnto the Emperour. The Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> doth very falſly attribute that Maieſty vnto himſelfe, which appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Emperour, and to the Princes of the Empire and the States. Very falſly is the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> called here, the Fountaine and Sourſe of the prince Electors
<pb facs="tcp:12948:13"/>
dignities, becauſe that power is ſprung out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the Germaine Princes. Like as <hi>Naucleius</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat.</hi> 34. The writer <hi>Theodoricus Niemus</hi> vſeth theſe words: The Princes of <hi>Germanie</hi> haue ordained it ſo. The very ſame alſo do other writers affirme. Neither do I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that it was with the approbatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 5. Therefore the temporall dignitie is not chiefely from the Pope, for not the Pope, but the princes of the Empire doe repreſent the whole body and people of the Empire, in whom immediatly, as in the ſubiect the temporall power conſiſteth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nicholas Cuſanus</hi> in his third booke of the catholicke concordance, in the 4. Chap. In my iudgement iudgeth very well thereof, writing in this maner, ſaith: <q>The prince Electors, who elected in the place of others, were (in the time of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 5, being a <hi>Germaine)</hi> ordained of the naturall kindred of <hi>Otho</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not tollerable that the prince Electors ſhould haue their power of electing from the Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi> (ſo that now, vnleſſe he conſented theſe ſhould not haue it: or if he would, that he would take it from them.) I aske, who hath giuen the people of <hi>Rome</hi> power to elect an Emperour, but the Law of God and nature; for by way of a voluntary ſubiection, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in predecedencie, all ſorts of gouernments are well and holy inſtituted: and afterwards there he ſetteth downe yet ſomething elſe; the prince Electors that were conſtituted by the generall vniformitie of voices, of all <hi>Germaines</hi> and others belonging to the Empire: in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the 2. had their fundamentall power from the generall conſent of voices of all, who by the law of nature might chuſe themſelues an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, not from the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> himſelfe, in whoſe power it is not to giue to euery prouince a King or an Emperour when it pleaſeth him, and when it doth not pleaſe him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, the <hi>Articles</hi> were ſealed vp with this Oath.
<pb facs="tcp:12948:13"/>
That the Pope himſelfe, without preiudice to his ſeate, may not reuoke the Electorſhip from the Duke of <hi>Baua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> ſince that he hath confirmed him in that dignitie; nay, that all the Prelates of the Romiſh Church, are bound with force of Armes to maintaine the Duke of <hi>Bauaria:</hi> and yet more, that all thoſe that are of the Romiſh Church, are bound to bring all their force to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to maintaine the ſame. So that the Romiſh Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie diſdaining the prerogatiue of Kings and Princes, doth very boldly determine and decide theſe controuerſies which ariſe in the Empire, and threatneth to force them by warre who are not content with the Popes ſentence; How ilſauourly theſe things doe ſute and agree with Pope and Clergie of <hi>Rome,</hi> is ſhewed vnto vs in that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous place of <hi>Peter Damianus,</hi> who liued in the yeare 1060, his words in his Letter vnto the Biſhop <hi>Firminus</hi> are theſe.</p>

               <q>Like as the Sonne of God himſelfe did ouercome all the obſtacles of this raging world, not by any proofe of vengeance, but by conſtant patience, and inuinceable Maieſtie: ſo ſitteth it beſt that we rather ſuffer, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently endure the worlds raging with humilitie: then either by taking Armes in hand, or requiting wounds with wounds: eſpeciall ſince that betweene the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and the Prieſt-hood, the offices are ſeuerall; The King ſhall vſe the temporall Armes, the Prieſt ſhall put on a ſpirituall ſword, which is the word of God; <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of the princes of this world, that he beareth not the ſword in vaine, being a Miniſter of God, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenger in wrath, vpon him that doth euill. King <hi>Aza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias,</hi> becauſe he tooke vpon him the Prieſts office, was ſtricken with Leproſie: ſo that Prieſts which ſhall take vp Armes, (which is the worke of the Laitie) what deſerueth he? If now any man would obiect, that Pope <hi>Leo</hi> oftentimes thruſt himſelfe into warres, and yet for all that was a iuſt Pope: I tell you mine opinion. <hi>Peter</hi> neuer obtained the Apoſtle-ſhip becauſe he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke
<pb facs="tcp:12948:14"/>
his Maſter; Nor <hi>Dauid</hi> the gift of propheſing, becauſe he defiled anothers mans bed. Here is not to be conſidered of good and euill things according to the deſert of the poſſeſſors, but they are to be iudged accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their owne qualities. Doe we reade any where that Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> who endured ſo many roberies and pillages of the <hi>Longebeards,</hi> either did or wrot the like; Doe we reade any where, that any of the holy and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Popes did euer take vp Armes to make a warre: no neuer in no place; grant then that the Lawes of the ciuill Magiſtrate may narrowly fift, pry, and determine any certaine queſtion which ariſeth in the Church: or elſe determine and iudge of that which concernes not the Iudgement ſeate of the ciuill Magiſtrate, by an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of the Councell, or an aſſembly of Diuines: to the end that either by the iudgement of the Magiſtrate, or the Iudicate of the Pope, there ariſe no warre which might be accounted to our ſhame.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Clergie men of <hi>Rome</hi> are altogether of another oppinion, practiſing and endeauouring almoſt nothing elſe but warre, not onely with their Armes, but alſo threatening others, and whilſt they are doing this, they are not aſhamed to affirme, that they are bound thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the Lawes of God; Let them obſerue what Chriſt commanded the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> to put vp the ſword into the ſheath. Where hath euer God commanded the Clergie, that they ſhould intermeddle in matters of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall dignities, or ſhould vndertake warres: much leſſe that they ſhould blow the Trumpet, or beate Allarmes as they do now. (haue I the deſire of Dominion their God) Obſerue diligently I pray you, that bloody Oath inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by all the Prelates, to the end the faſhion of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and holy Church might be maintained intire, like as if the faſhion of their Church now were, as it was wont to be in former times; Let vs reade that which <hi>Tertullian, Ambroſe, Auguſtine,</hi> and other Writers, who ſubiect the Clergie vnder the power of the Temporall; Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorius</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:12948:14"/>
               <hi>Magnus,</hi> writeth himſelfe vnto the Emperour <hi>Mauritius</hi> theſe words: <q>I the vnworthy ſeruant of your pietie: and a little after he ſaith yet farther, To this end authoritie is giuen to me from heauen aboue all men, that belong to my Lords the Emperours for pietie cauſe;</q> When as the ſaid <hi>Mauritius,</hi> would haue that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> ſhould publiſh a law which he had made: and this Pope adiudging the ſame to be vnreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and oppoſing the liberty of the Church: he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did not blaſpheme againſt the Empire, but was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient vnto the command of the Emperour his Maſter, not diſſembling to ſpeak his minde and opinion of the Emperours Law: theſe are the Popes owne wordes: <q>I being ſubiect to authoritie, haue ſent theſe Lawes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeuerall quarters of the world, and becauſe they are not agreeable to almightie God, I haue communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſame vnto the Illuſtrouſe Lords, by amiſsiue of my owne oppinion, ſo that I haue fully diſcharged my dutie on both ſides: ſhewing as I am bound obedience to the Emperour: and not concealing my opinion in that which concerneth God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here ought we to obſerue, how cunningly and craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily the Colledge of Cardinalls obſerue and aime at the example of the ancient holy Church, chiefly in the time of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7: vnder which this lurketh, that this Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> was the very firſt who durſt aſcribe &amp; take vnto himſelfe the right of the Empire; At what time (I pray you) liued this Pope? about the yeare 1100. is the antiquitie whereof they boaſt; I may affirme with <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that this is noueltie; what holineſſe was there in thoſe dayes, when all maner of fractious, cuſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, frauds, deceites, and villanies had their full ſwinge: and to write much thereof would be to dangerous, and be no honour to Chriſtendome; Like as the Writer of thoſe times affirmeth in the dayes of the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. It is very well knowne vnto all men, what Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Benno</hi> hath written and tranſlated of that Pope:
<pb facs="tcp:12948:15"/>
(although Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> iudgeth that the ſame was wrtten by a Lutheran;) In like manner, it is alſo but to well knowne by other Writers, who haue painted out in liuely colours this Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> euen to the life. A certaine man named <hi>Orthamus Gracious,</hi> very much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to the Romiſh Church, was the firſt publiſher thereof in a booke, wherein are contained very many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable obſeruations: out of the actions of this Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> the Colledge of Cardinals, in the 19. Articles do conclude the Popes authoritie, and not out of theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones onely, but alſo of other Popes who haue delt moſt tirannically with the Empire. One could alſo hit the Cardinalls in the teeth, with that which Cardinall <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> in his ſecond Booke of the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> ſaith, in the 29. Chap. vpon the 4. Argument, viz. <q>That the Chriſtian Emperours haue oftentimes beene Iudges of the Popes: whereunto very ſubtilly he inferreth or anſwereth; That theſe things haue beene done, but how well they haue done the ſame, and by what right, that they themſelues ſhall anſwer.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is indeed much to be wondred at, that the Clergie men are grown to that paſſe, that they ſo ſtoutly attempt that which all the world hath in abomination, and with ſuch polluted hands to lay hold vpon the moſt famous ſtate of the Empire. We obſerue alſo how ſhameleſſe the Colledge of Cardinalls are, willing that we (from the euill liues and wicked actions of deceaſed Popes) ſhould conclude how great the authoritie of the Pope is: at leaſt they neede not to be ſo contumelious, and arrogant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe Emperours, which in former times the Popes haue acknowledged to be themſelues ſeruants of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours; The Pope alſo ought to haue in conſideration that he by meanes of the Empire hath obtained ſo great riches, and now by the greatneſſe of his power, and all maner of ſenſuallities, blindeth the eyes of many tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall princes.</p>
            <p>How blind are the men of this age, when the Sunne
<pb facs="tcp:12948:15"/>
ſhineth ſo bright, how little do they know or think what will fall out in the end; he hath got ſo great treaſures from thoſe of the Empire, to the end that he wanting nothing, might giue the better luſter vnto his religion: now abuſeth he theſe gifts, by driuing the Empire into a great feare. He is enriched with earthly countries, to the end he ſhould enrich vs with the heauenly, and now they ſerue him to take away our earthly; He is enriched, to the end that by his religious care, we might liue in greater ſecuritie in the Empire: now he careth not for that, although there be trouble raiſed in the Empire, ſo he may liue brauely and laciuiouſly; This is the reward of peruerted liberalty: ſo that for many ages it hath been very truely ſaid: <q>Religion brought forth riches, and the Daughter hath deuoured the Mother.</q>
            </p>
            <p>You props and pillers of the Empire, (moſt Illuſtrious Emperour, Princes Electors, Princes, and States) tollerate no longer this triumph and pride of the Romiſh Clergie: you ſee how boldly they violate the lawes of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, they limite your eſtabliſhed law, and preferre vnto you that which they do but thinke and inuent: leauing vnto you the bare name of the empire, but haue drawne the maieſtie thereof long agoe to themſelues.</p>
            <p>What will this worke in the end, if you be content any longer with patience to behold or looke vpon the ſame, neuer thinke that they will omit to increaſe theirs, and decreaſe yours; You haue heard how they threaten you, and what they intend as enemies to proſecute: and you know that the abominable deeds which the Popes haue performed againſt the Emperours, doe ſerue them now for very faire examples.</p>
            <p>Since then it is not yet to late, take councell prouident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Romiſh Cardinalls in the end may be glad to leaue their affronts, and their proud courage may quaile, vndertake firme and ſubſtantiall courſes, that their diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and inſolent deſire of dominion may be reſtrained and bridled: then ſhall the Maieſtie of the empire be
<pb facs="tcp:12948:16"/>
preſerued: whereunto Almighty God giue you his bleſsing in all your conſultations. from whom you haue receiued the poſſeſsion and gouernment of the Empire.</p>
