         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I finde in the Science of Aſtronomie, there bée foure manner of Cholers in mans body, of the foure complections.</p>
            <p>The firſt is bloud, the ſecond blacke Choler, the third Flumes, &amp; the fourth yelow choler, and if one of the foure lack, all the bodie wil be foorthwith dead. Foraſmuch ſuſtaineth one of them the body as the other.</p>
            <p>And euery each of them ought to bée at a certaine, for if one of them ſurmount the other, all the body ſhall haue dom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage thereby, and all foure bée perillous, for if the bloud ſurmount the other, hée will the ſooner deſtroy and ouercome the bodie, and make him to dye, for hée gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and likewiſe congealeth euen right on the heart and the breath, and in that manner, (leſſening) by little and little, is ouercome and dead, but all that tyme when the great courſe taketh him, he may
<pb facs="tcp:14890:3"/>
ſoone bée aſſwaged to leſſe him a little, ſo take away a little bloud from him, and then all will aſſwage of this perill. Alſo the blacke coler is right perſlous, and they ſurmount all the other, they make great domage to the body by many and diuers meanes, for they may cauſe and make the body to fall as the euill ſickneſſe, and loſe his wit and knowledge, and béecome a foole, and cauſe all the body to be full of euill ſcabbes, and oft times to bée meſill, and maketh a man to bée fearefull and a coward, and of many euill manners.</p>
            <p>And when they ſurmount the other, they bée right gréeuous and damagious. And by hearbes, flowers, faſting, abſtinence, drinkes and medicines, they may bée aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaged.</p>
            <p>The flumes that bée white bée peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, when they ſurmount the other cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the body, they doe great domage and hurt, for they engender goutes, and many other euill ſickneſſes that bée cold, and they hurt alſo the féete, the hands, the raines, the knées, the legs, and the téeth, and make the mouth and the breath ſtinking, and the noſe and the cares, and
<pb facs="tcp:14890:3"/>
cauſeth many other diſeaſes and ſickneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and they may be aſſwaged by hearbs, flowres, rootes, drinckes, medicines, and alſo by vomiting.</p>
            <p>Alſo the yealow cholers bée perillous, for when they ſurmount the other cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in a mans body, they aſſorbent the heart, and trauaile the braine, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all the members féeble and ſoft, and taketh away the will and appetite from the body, that hée may neither eate nor drinck, and alſo they chaunge a mannes Cholers and maketh him to loſe his ſight and become blinde: and they may bée aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaged, as by hearbs, flowres, rootes, and by vomiting.</p>
