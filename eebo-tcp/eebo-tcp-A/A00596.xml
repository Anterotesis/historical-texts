            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE OCCASION
AND ISSVE OF THE LATE
CONFERENCE HAD BETWEEN
Dr. White Deane of Carleil, and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Featly,
with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Fisher and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Sweet, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites,
was this as followeth.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>EDward Buggs</hi> Esquire, about the age of 70
yeares, being lately sick was solicited by some
Papists then about him to forsake the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
faith, telling him there was no hope of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
without the Church, there was no Catholik
Church but theirs, and to beleeue <hi>the Catholike
Church</hi> was the Article of his Creed, and by it could
no other Church be meant but the Church of
Rome, because it could not be proued by all the
Protestants in the kingdome, that they had any
Church before <hi>Luther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Gentleman being much troubled in his
mind with these and the like suggestions, who all
his life time had bin and professed himselfe a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Protestant, became now more sicke in minde
then body; and if by Gods mercifull goodnesse he
had not recouered of this sicknesse, it is to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
hee had falne both from his Mother Church
and his former faith, as some of the nearest of his
owne blood (to his great griefe) haue lately been se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by like inticements.</p>
            <p>After his recouery, being much troubled in mind
<pb facs="tcp:21566:3"/>
with these former suggestions of the popish Priests,
he repaired to Sir <hi>Humfrey Lynde</hi> Knight, who by
reason of his alliance and long acquaintance vvith
him, gaue the best satisfaction he could to his said
cousin M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Buggs,</hi> who seemed to take content in
such his conference, and to be well satisfied by him
in all points.</p>
            <p>But the Popish Priests and Iesuites not desisting
to creepe in further where they had once made a
breach, perseuering still in questioning him, where
his Church was before <hi>Luther.</hi> Whereupon he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
againe to Sir <hi>Humfrey Lynde,</hi> and required
some further satisfaction of him concerning that
demand. And thereupon Sir <hi>Humfrey Lynde</hi> tolde
him, it was first in Christ and the Apostles, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
also conspicuous in the primitiue Church
for 600 yeares after Christ, after which time some
errors crept into the Church, as diseases into a mans
body; so that the Church which Luther and we
acknowledge, was in generall the same Christian
Church, as his body was the same substantiall body,
being now well, and lately sicke, though different
in the qualities.</p>
            <p>And for the better strengthening of his mind, the
said Sir <hi>Humfrey Lynde</hi> inuited him to his house in
the countrey, thereby the better to preuent the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sollicitation of those dangerous seducers. And
after his returne to London, the said Sir <hi>Humfrey
Lynde</hi> going to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Buggs</hi> his house in <hi>Drury</hi> lane
to visite him, found M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fisher</hi> the Iesuite there,
where after some debates about Religion and the
visibilitie of the Church, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fisher</hi> called for pen
<pb facs="tcp:21566:3"/>
and inke, and set downe this question <hi>in terminis;</hi>
thereby adding vnder his hand, that he would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
vpon it negatiuely, as chalenging and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
opposers, deliuering also the paper into the
hands of the said Sir <hi>Humfrey Lynde,</hi> who vpon view
of it, answered, that it was an historicall question,
and not so proper for disputation. But M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fisher.</hi>
vrging it, Sir <hi>Humfrey</hi> told him, if he would go to
Dr. <hi>Whites,</hi> where formerly he had been, the said
Doctor would easily resolue those doubts. Which
being refused by the Iesuite, the said Sir <hi>Humfrey</hi>
did then returne him his paper againe, and so left
him.</p>
            <p>About two dayes after, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Buggs</hi> repaired to Sir
<hi>Humfrey Lynd,</hi> and intreated him (for his satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
to giue M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fisher</hi> a meeting, saying, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher</hi>
had againe told him, that he would maintaine
what he had set downe, and that our Diuines
could not proue our Church visible before <hi>Luthers</hi>
time. Whereupon Sir <hi>Humfrey</hi> told him, that D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
<hi>White</hi> and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Featly</hi> were to dine with him on Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
following; and if after dinner M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fisher</hi> would
come thither with foure or six at the most, they
should be admitted for his sake and his wifes, who
(by reason of such sollicitation) were troubled in
their minds, and satisfaction should be giuen as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
required. And these were the true causes of
the meeting, as is before declared. Vpon which
Friday, being the 27 of Iune 1623. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fisher,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
<hi>Sweet,</hi> Iesuites, and some others with them, came to
Sir <hi>Humfrey Lynds</hi> house, into a little dining roome,
where they found the aforesaid M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Buggs,</hi> his wife
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21566:4"/>
and children, and others of Sir <hi>Humfreys</hi> friends
that had then dined with him, together with some
others also; whose comming in, as the said Sir <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi>
did not expect, so he could not with ciuilitie
put them forth his house, but did instantly cause
his doores to be locked vp, that no more might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in; notwithstanding which his command, some
others also came in scatteringly after the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
began.</p>

            <head>A RELATION
OF WHAT PASSED IN A
CONFERENCE TOVCHING
the visibilitie of the Church.
Iun. 27. 1623.</head>
            <p>DOctor <hi>White</hi> and Doctor <hi>Featly</hi> being inuited
to dinner by Sir <hi>Humfrey Lynde,</hi> and staying
a while after, had notice giuen them that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fisher</hi>
and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Sweet,</hi> Iesuites, were in the next roome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to conferre with them touching a question set
downe by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fisher,</hi> vnder his owne hand, in these
words: viz.</p>
            <p>Whether the Protestant Church was in all ages vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
and especially in the ages going before <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi>
2. And whether the names of such visible
Protestants in all ages can be shewed and proued
out of good Authors.</p>
            <p>This question being deliuered to the parties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
named, and it being notified vnto them that
there were certaine persons who had been solicited
(and remaining doubtfull in religion) desired satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
especially in this point, they were perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to haue some speech with the Iesuites touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this point, the rather because the Priests and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites
do daily cast out papers and disperse them
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21566:5"/>
in secret, in which they vaunt, that no Protestant
Minister dare encounter them in this point.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of his meeting, when the dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
were set, D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Featly</hi> drew out the paper, in
which the question aboue rehearsed was written,
with these words in the margent, viz. <hi>I will answer
that it was not;</hi> and demanded of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fisher</hi> whether
this were his owne hand; which after he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Featly</hi> began as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>D.</hi> Featly.</note> To this vniuersall demand, requiring
rather an Historicall large volume, then a Syllogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
briefe dispute, we answer:</p>
            <p>1. That although diuine infallible faith is not
built vpon deduction out of humane history, but
diuine reuelation, as is confessed by your owne
<hi>Schoole-men,</hi> and expresly by Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine:
Historiae humanae faciunt tantum fidem humanam, cui
subesse potest falsum:</hi> Humane stories and records
beget onely an humane faith, or rather credulitie
subiect to error, not a diuine and infallible beliefe,
which must be built vpon surer ground.</p>
            <p>2. Although this question be grounded vpon
vncertaine and false supposals; for a Church may
haue been visible, yet not the names of all visible
professors thereof now to be shewed and proued
out of good Authors; there might be millions of
professors, yet no particular and authenticall record
of them by name. Records there might be many
in ancient time, yet not now extant, at least for vs
to come by; yet we will not refuse to deale with you
in your owne question, if you in like maner will vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
the like taske in your owne defence, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21566:5"/>
maintaine the affirmatiue in the like question, which
we now propound vnto you here in writing:</p>
            <p>Whether the Romish Church (that is, a Church hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the particular entire doctrine of the now
Romanists, as it is comprised in the Councell of
Trent) was in all ages visible, especially in the first
600 yeares: And whether the names of such visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or legible Romanists in all ages can be shewed
and proued <hi>out of good Authors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Featly</hi> reading this question, through a
mistake, in stead of <hi>out of good Authors,</hi> read <hi>out of
Gods word.</hi> Whereunto M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fisher</hi> replied, <hi>No, I will
proue it out of good Auhors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then said one that sat at the table: By no means
can M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fisher</hi> endure to demonstrate his Church
out of Gods word.</p>

               <speaker>

               <p>God is a good Author, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fisher,</hi>
but it is true I did mistake; what say you to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
will you vndertake to name visible Papists
in all ages out of good Authors?</p>
            </sp>

Church.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Here an order was set downe, that D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Featly</hi>
should for an houre and a halfe oppose M. <hi>Fisher</hi> in
this question; and afterwards M. <hi>Fisher</hi> for the last
houre and halfe should oppose D <hi>White</hi> in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
question for the visibilitie of the Romane
Church.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>M.</hi> Sweet.</speaker>
               <p>Before you proceed to dispute, I desire
these conditions may be assented vnto on both sides:</p>
               <p>1. That all bitter speeches be forborne.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>That none speake but disputants.</hi> Which condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

a large Historicall volume, then a briefe Syllogisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

such a question, and my taske the harder; yet being
propounded as a question, I will keepe my selfe to
Logicke forme. But before I propound my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I craue leaue in few words to lay open the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
of the vsuall discourse, wherewith you draw
and delude many of the ignorant and vnlearned.
You beare them in hand, that there was no such
thing in the world as a Protestant before <hi>Luther;</hi>
and that all the world before his time beleeued as
you doe. That your Church hath not been only vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
in all ages and all times, but eminently conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
and illustrious; which is such a notorious vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth,
that I here offer before all this companie to
yeeld you the better, and acknowledge my selfe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome,
if you can produce out of good Authors,

I will not say any Empire or kingdome, but any Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
parish or hamlet, within fiue hundred yeares
next after Christ, in which there was any visible as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
of Christians to be named, maintaining and
defending either your Trent Creed in generall, or
these points of Popery in speciall, to wit,</p>
               <p>1. That there is a Treasury of Saints merits, and
superabundant satisfactions at the Popes disposing.</p>
               <p>2. That the Laity are not commanded by Christs
institution to receiue the Sacrament of the Lords
Supper in both kinds.</p>
               <p>3. That the publicke Seruice of God in the
Church ought or may be celebrated in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
tongue.</p>
               <p>4. That priuate Masses, wherein the Priest saith,
<hi>Edite &amp; bihite ex hoc omnes,</hi> and yet eateth and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
himselfe onely, are according to Christs insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
               <p>5. That the Popes pardons are requisite or vseful
to release soules out of Purgatory.</p>
               <p>6. That the effect of the Sacrament dependeth
vpon the intention of the Minister.</p>

was intended, to wit, to shew to those who are not able
by their owne abilitie to find out the infallible faith ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to saluation, without learning it of the true visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

is any man able by his owne abilitie, without the

it must first be proued to be pertinent, or else it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerteth
vs from the chiefe end of our dispute, which was,
as I said before, That infallible truth may be learned of
the true visible Church, and not the true visible Church
by first finding euery particular infallible truth, and by
that to conclude which is the true visible Church.</p>

thereof, which makes a visible member, and
the like profession of many members a visible
Church. Where the cause is perpetuall, the effect
must needs be perpetual. Therefore where the faith
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21566:12"/>

               <p>3. That the Romane Church onely was and is
the authenticall custos of vnwritten traditions?</p>
               <p>4. That all generall Councels were called by the
sole authoritie of the Pope; and that he might rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
and disanull whatsoeuer pleased him in them.</p>
               <p>5. That the Pope onely had power to canonize

               <p>This is to diuert the question: the question
is not now, whether our faith or yours be the catholicke
primitiue faith, but the question now is of the effect, to
wit, the visibilitie of your Church, which you ought to
proue out of good authors.</p>

               <p>May not a man proue the effect by the

               <p>An effect is <hi>posterius;</hi> the question is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
an effect; therefore you ought to proue it <hi>à poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riori.</hi>

               <p>If I should relinquish my former ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,

            </sp>
            <p>To preuent all such misreports to the wrong of either, it was moued by the
hearers, that is should be written downe by the common writer of the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
that both the Disputants being willing to proceed, <hi>D. Featly</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fired
by the companie (because it was late) to produce the names of such Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
as were extant before <hi>Luther</hi> in all ages. This being written and
subscribed by them both, <hi>D. Featly</hi> proceeded to his induction.</p>

               <p>An Induction is a forme of argument
in which we proceed from enumeration of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
to conclude a generall, after this manner:</p>
               <p>It is so in this and this, <hi>&amp; sic de caeteris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo</hi> it is so in all.</p>
               <p>According to this forme of arguing, thus I dispute:</p>
               <p>The Protestant Church was so visible, that the names
of those who taught and beleeued the doctrine thereof,
may be produced in the first hundred yeares, and second,
and third, and fourth, <hi>&amp; sic de caeteris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo</hi> it was so in all ages.</p>
               <p>First I name those of the first age; and I begin
with him who is the beginner of all, <hi>our Lord and
Sauiour Iesus Christ,</hi> blessed for euer, at whose Name
all knees must bow both in heauen and earth, and
vnder the earth, (at which words all the companie
expressed an holy reuerence;) after Christ I name
the twelue Apostles, and Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> and because
there were few writers in the first age, at least whose
vndoubted works haue come to our hands, I name
onely <hi>I gnatius</hi> after the twelue Apostles and Saint
<hi>Paul.</hi>

one, then two, then three, and so forward. I name
(as I said before) in the first age for our Religion,
our blessed Lord and Sauiour the Founder of all
Religion, the twelue Apostles, and after them S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Ignatius</hi> the Martyr. For the second age, I

<hi>this is confest on both sides.</hi>

it before Christ himselfe at the dreadfull day
of iudgement, answer now vpon your conscience
before all this companie, whether you beleeue that
Christ and his Apostles taught our faith or yours;
this is the maine point of all; answer directly to my
Induction.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Notwithstanding this deep charge, <hi>M. Fisher</hi> still refused to answer to the
argument of instance in Christ and his Apostles; whereupon diuers thereupon
expressing their distast at such refusall, desired <hi>D. Featly</hi> to surceasse, telling
him that he ought not to talke any longer with such a one who refused to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
Christ and his Apostles. And so the Conference brake vp.</p>
            <p>This Conference though it tooke not that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
which was desired, by reason of the Iesuites
tergiuersation, not permitting D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Featly</hi> to come
to the ripenesse of any argument; yet it hath not bin
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21566:16"/>
fruitlesse: for since that time, the aforesaid M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Buggs</hi>
came to Sir <hi>Humfrey Lynde,</hi> and gaue him many
thanks for the said meeting, and assured him that
he was well resolued now of his Religion; that he
saw plainly, it was but the Iesuits bragging, without
proofes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and whereas formerly by their Sophistical
perswasions he was in some doubt of the Church,
he is now so fully satisfied of the truth of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
that he doth vtterly disclaim the Popish priests
companie, and their doctrine also.</p>
            <p>Vpon Monday following, M. <hi>Fisher</hi> and M. <hi>Sweet</hi>
came vnsent for to the house of Sir <hi>Humfrey Lynde,</hi>
to know of him, whether the parties that had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
conferred, would proceed or no; who answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that if they might confer priuatly with leaue
in some other place, they would easily make good
their cause; and so they parted without further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of place or meeting.</p>
            <p>Since which time, notice being giuen by my Lord
Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi> of his Maiesties pleasure, that the
truth of the late Conference should be certified to
his Maiestie, and further meetings staid; a Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist
hath confidently auerred to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Buggs,</hi> that our
side hath laboured to haue all future meetings tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
this occasion forbidden, because we durst not,
nor are not able to make good our assertions against
them.</p>
            <p>And this is the true relation of the Conference
it selfe, together with the occasion thereof, and the
effect which it produced.</p>
