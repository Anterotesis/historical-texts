            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <head>Firſt:</head>
                     <p n="1">1. By the ſpeedy raiſing a ſtock of Cattel, though from a very mean prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and beginnings: a notable Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy in the thriving <hi>Spaniard</hi> upon <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> and eſpecially, on <hi>Cuba,</hi> which is better <hi>peopled;</hi>) and 'tis this: Near ſome convenient place, in the Wood, that is beſt <hi>ſtored</hi> with all ſorts of <hi>fruit-bearing</hi> Trees, as Orange-trees, a ſort of Cabbage-trees, rag'd with berries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they build two or three little Houſes, or more; by them called a <hi>Crawle,</hi> and in theſe, they firſt incloſe theſe tame Hogs, with which they begin their ſtock, and there feed them; that after (being let out) they will come to the <hi>haunt,</hi> at the ſound of a Horn; But if they be out of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170586:18"/>(they many times ſuſpending all care of them for a week together) they goe out with three or four Dogs, that hunt them in; the whole Herd make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing homewards ſo ſoon as ever the Dogs do <hi>Bay</hi> them; unto which <hi>diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,</hi> if any of the Hogs be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable, his refractorineſs coſt's him his life; his keeper (for example ſake) ſcarcely <hi>indemnifying</hi> him for the firſt fault.</p>
                     <p>Thus two or three <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſlaves, (for a native <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſcorns the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy) will look to ſix or ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Hogs, and provide them meat, not putting their Maſters to a penny charge.</p>
                     <p>Which courſe may as effectually be managed upon <hi>Iamaica,</hi> in any part of the Iſland; unparallel'd by any other <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſettlement in the more <hi>VVind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> Iſlands.</p>
                     <p>For a ſtock of Sheep, Cows, Horſes, Goats, and the like, there is excellent Paſture in the <hi>Savana's;</hi> ſome of them,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170586:18"/>fourty, ſome fifty miles in circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, wherein the graſſe ſprings freſh and green all the year long.</p>
                     <p>The Earth never recalling her lent ſap (as ſhe does mock the <hi>Europeans</hi>) by giving and taking again, every Moneth being an <hi>April;</hi> The Trees and Plants being never <hi>diſrobed</hi> of their <hi>Phary-liveries,</hi> but wear their beſt clothes every day; in which <hi>prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> they are licenc'd and born out, by their <hi>indulgent</hi> Parents, the Sun and the Earth; Theſe Regions being their <hi>Darlings,</hi> and (to uſe Sir <hi>Walter Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi>'s ſtile (<hi>The Paradiſe of the world.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In ſo much as here is plenty of food to relieve the Planters Cattel through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the year, needing no winter-<hi>hoard;</hi> The providence of the <hi>Ant</hi> being uſeleſſe here.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another ſingular benefit to the Planter, is the large numbers of <hi>wild Horſes,</hi> well ſhap'd and very ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, being all bred of the <hi>Spaniſh Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,</hi> one of theſe tam'd and well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170586:19"/>may be bought for three pounds <abbr>
                           <hi>ſterl</hi>
                        </abbr> which would yield ſix thouſand pounds of Sugar at the <hi>Barbadoes:</hi> of which ſpecial advantage, in eaſing the charge of making Sugars, needs no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thirdly, the ſaid <hi>Savana</hi>'s are <hi>common</hi> to every man that will make uſe of them; For as they are good for little elſe: The <hi>woody</hi> ground produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the beſt Proviſions for a family, as Corn, Potatoes, Plantanes, Caſſauder, Sugar Canes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo ſeating your ſelf upon the <hi>skirt</hi> of a <hi>Savana, bordering</hi> upon a Wood, you may with conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience enjoy the benefit of both.</p>
                     <p>Again, as you may ſtock theſe Plains without limit; ſo you may have fifty Acres, <hi>per head,</hi> for your ſelf and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, freely <hi>aſsign'd</hi> and made over to you, in any place you beſt like to make your choice; ſo that the ſeat, you pitch upon, be not firſt taken up by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; whereas in St. <hi>Kits, Barbadoes,</hi> &amp;c. you cannot turn a Horſe out but
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170586:19"/>he preſently treſpaſſeth upon his Neighbour, if not upon your own <hi>Canes:</hi> the moſt barren Rocks (even in the <hi>Scotland</hi> of <hi>Barbadoes</hi>) owning a Proprietor, and the whole Iſland pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered with a ſuper-numerary <hi>glut</hi> of Inhabitants; too ſmall a Hive for ſuch a <hi>ſwarm</hi> of people.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, I ſhall conclude the tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of this Iſle, by the abundant plenty of choice Timber trees and Wood for the Dyer's uſe, as <hi>Fuſtick, Braſiletta, Ebonies,</hi> and a kind of <hi>Log<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood;</hi> (but not ſo effectual as that which grows in the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Campeachee</hi>) together with choice of medicinal Drugs, as <hi>China</hi> Roots, Gum <hi>Guaic.

                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:170586:23"/>immediately from the Tree, at the footing of the branches.</p>

               <p>Which incovenience diſſwaded the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from gracing it with ſo much as one houſe, ſeating themſelves near a pleaſant River, and by the ſide of a moſt lovely <hi>Savana,</hi> in the famous Town of

               <p>WHich was as well built, and as large as any Town in <hi>England;</hi> but now haſt loſt much of it's <hi>priſtine</hi> luſtre, ſince the Landlords became <hi>Engliſh;</hi> for it did contain two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fand Houſes, and upwards, with ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Churches and Chappells, when it was firſt <hi>ſeized</hi> upon by the Army con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by Gen. <hi>Venables;</hi> now there remains only the <hi>Skeletons</hi> of two Churches and an <hi>Abbey,</hi> with about five or ſix hundred Houſes; ſome of which are yet very pleaſant and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>

               <p>The mentioned <hi>Savana</hi> that faces this Town is now pretty well ſtockt with Sheep, Goats, Cowes, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially tame Horſes. But it did contain many thouſands of each whileſt the <hi>Spaniard</hi> own'd it.</p>
               <p>The back-ſide of the Town is

               </p>
               <p>About twenty or thirty years agoe, this Town was wonne by a little Fleet of <hi>Engliſh men,</hi> fitted out from the <hi>Chariby</hi> Iſlands, chiefly from Sr. <hi>Kits,</hi> under the Command of Gen. <hi>Iackſon,</hi> who landed about five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men at <hi>Paſſage-Fort,</hi> and fought his way up to the Town, againſt two thouſand <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who ſtill fled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; but ſome what retarded his <hi>Carcer,</hi> by ſix or ſeven ſeveral Breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, caſt up athwart the Road, on purpoſe to Bulwark this Town, (the Jewell of this Iſle) from ſuch Inroades and ſudden ſurprizals: For the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention whereof they kept continual watch upon a great Hill that overlooks the Sea, the Harbour, and the Town, from whence the Centinells, in the twinkling of an eye by tokens agreed upon, ſignified the imminency of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching dangers; As at this time
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170586:31"/>when Gen. <hi>Iackſon</hi> made the On-ſet; the ſtrength of the Iſle being drawn up on the ſhore, before he could land his men; whom, though the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſome what reſiſted, and at their ſeveral Breſt-works caus'd them to make an unwilling Halt; yet the fury of <hi>Iack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>'s men, greedy of ſpoil, overcame all difficulties, neglecting dangers in compariſon thereof: Thus with the loſſe of fourty men, forcing to the Town, plunder'd it, to their no ſmall enrichment. The booty likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advanced by a large <hi>Fine</hi> paid him by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> on condition the Town might be preſerved from burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which was accordingly ſav'd, and their retreat to the Fleet undiſturb'd.</p>
               <p>But when the ſwelling <hi>Armado</hi> with Gen. <hi>Venables,</hi> attempted this Town, (after their worſe ſucceſſe againſt <hi>St. Domingo</hi>) they beat the buſh ſo long, till the Bird was flown. For the ſubtle <hi>Spaniard,</hi> belaying our men with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, and fair words, in the interim di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatches
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170586:32"/>away Bag and Baggage; ſometimes ſending Beeves to ſtay the ſtomacks of the hungry Soldiery; and bearing Gen. <hi>Venables,</hi> in hand with choice <hi>Viands;</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dainties preſented to his Lady, who had more mind to eat then fight.</p>
               <p>Thus ſtaving them off, till their <hi>Train</hi> and beſt Movables had got ſo much <hi>Law,</hi> that afterwards the ſwifteſt purſuit could not give them a <hi>Turn,</hi> before they had got <hi>Covert</hi> in their Faſtneſſe, the Woods.</p>
               <p>And certainly, the treaſure they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with them could not but be very conſiderable if we may gueſs at the worth of the Jewell by the ſplendor of the Cabinet, that kept it: or eſtimate the largeneſs of the Bird by the Neſt: the <hi>Town</hi> being then even to magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, adorn'd with ſpatious Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>For the ſafe-guard whereof the <hi>Spaniards</hi> never durſt <hi>cope</hi> with our men in the plain field; yet would

               <p>For though the numbers of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Forces at <hi>Rio-Novo</hi> doubled the <hi>Engliſh</hi> (being ſent from <hi>Cuba</hi> to reinforce and reſettle the Iſland) and thoſe ſtrongly entrenched; yet ſuch was the enraged earneſtneſſe of the Souldiery to redeem their wounded Honours, that (regardleſſe of all odds and diſadvantages) they <hi>ſtorm'd</hi> them in their trenches with a reſolution as undaunted as the ſucceſſe was proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.

               <p>For all the treaſure that his Plate-Fleet brings home from <hi>Carthagina</hi> ſteer directly for St. <hi>Domingo</hi> in <hi>Hiſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niola,</hi> and from thence muſt paſs by one of the ends of this Iſland to <hi>reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> the <hi>Havana,</hi> The common ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouſe of this whole <hi>Armado,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it returns home through the <hi>Gulf</hi> of <hi>Florida.</hi> Nor is there any other way (whereby to miſs the Iſland of <hi>Iamaica</hi>) becauſe he cannot in any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable time turn it up to the Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of <hi>Hiſpaniola;</hi> the which though he might with difficulty perform, yet he would thereby looſe the ſecurity of
