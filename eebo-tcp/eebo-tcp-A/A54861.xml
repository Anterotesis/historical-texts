            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, in the Statute <hi>de correctionibus faciendis circa delicta leviora</hi>—(cap. 25. p. 62, 63.) The <hi>Fellows</hi> are capable of being <hi>put out of Commons,</hi> (and <hi>de facto</hi> have been often by Dr. <hi>Frewen,</hi> oftner yet by Dr. <hi>Langton,</hi> extreamly often by Dr. <hi>Humphry,</hi> as appears by the College Registers,) even by the strength of that weakest Statute: <q>

If any Fellow shall be guilty of manifest perjurie, or Breach of oath, of theft, of conspiracie against the good estate of the College, or of any other Fact bringing prejudice or scandal to the same; &amp; shall be convicted of it, either by his own confession, or by competent witnesses to be approved of in the judgement of the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, with the assistance of the Vice-President, two Deans, and Bursers of the College, or by evidence of the Fact; <q>EX TUNC <hi>à dicto Collegio praesentis nostrae ordinationis vigore,</hi> nulla alia praemissa monitone, <hi>eum exclusum, &amp; privatum fore</hi> ipso facto <hi>decernimus &amp; statuimus, absque</hi> CUJUSCUNQUE APPELLATIONIS remedio vel QUE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RELAE.</q> Here <hi>all Remedy</hi> by <hi>Complaint</hi> or by <hi>Appeal in any kind,</hi> is most strictly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the case of <hi>expulsion.</hi>

            <p>Fourthly, in the Statute, by which Dr. <hi>Yerbury</hi> was put out of Commons, (<hi>cap.</hi> 35, <hi>p.</hi> 92.) The President sitting with the Deans and Bursars, and other Fellows whom They shall choose, is to put an end to all dissensions and quarrels, <hi>within the College walls.</hi> Which proves, that in That, as in many other cases within the College, (though not in all,) the President with his Assessors is <gap reason="foreign">

               </q>

Nor did the Criminal himself ever pretend any such thing. <hi>Secondly,</hi> we observe, <hi>that when a doubt of the sense of any Statute</hi> does arise, the <hi>President</hi> must <hi>Appeal,</hi> and <hi>none but he. (Thirdly.)</hi> Nor must <hi>He</hi> do it neither, untill together with the <hi>Officers,</hi> he has <hi>debated</hi> the matter for 15. <hi>dayes.</hi> So careful was the Founder that the <hi>Visitor</hi> might not be <hi>troubled,</hi> but in a case of meer necessity; whereas if the <hi>Visitor</hi> will admit of an <hi>Appeal</hi> from every person, who shall <hi>repine</hi> at his <hi>punishment</hi> (though exceedingly less then his <hi>crimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,</hi>) neither the Visitor, nor the President, no nor the College where he presides, shall ever enjoy either peace or honour. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> we observe from our College Registers, that ever since the Foundation, (somewhat more than 200 years,) though frequently the Fellows have been put out of Commons, <hi>propter verba tantùm indecora,</hi> and frequently <hi>expell'd</hi> for their <hi>Rebellions,</hi> to the President's order and command, (<note n="*" place="margin">E.G.

Next, a <hi>submission</hi> is at once too general and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal a word, and comes not home to the <hi>Visitor</hi>'s <hi>instrument,</hi> which requires <hi>Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> is it self <hi>deficient,</hi> and very <hi>fraudulent.</hi> For besides the <hi>two particulars</hi> which are here <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> recited, he was yesterday told of his being obliged <hi>to confess, that his Appeal was null, unjust, and made up of things false, unjust, and illegal.</hi> Nor only so, <hi>but also in writing to recant and retract his</hi>

               <hi>very words, which he impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently had vented both against Dr.</hi> Clerk, <hi>and against the Statutes</hi>; which although the chief things exacted from him, he neither <hi>then</hi> did, nor doth he <hi>now</hi> take notice of. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> the two particulars which he recites of what he yesterday omitted, are very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> falsely recited in several respects. For according to the <hi>instrument</hi> his confession was to be this, [<hi>That it was well, and justly, and legally decreed by the President and the Deans,</hi> when he was put out of Commons for fifteen days;] The <hi>first</hi> and <hi>third</hi> of which <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs</hi> he wholly leaves out, and turns the <hi>second</hi> into an <hi>Adjective</hi>; betwixt which two there is a great and important difference; because a <hi>sentence</hi> may be just, which yet (in many respects) may be unjustly and illegally pronounced. Again, according to the <hi>instrument,</hi> wherein the words are, <hi>poenam ei inflictam fuisse favorabiliorem quàm pro delicti gravitate,</hi> he should have confessed in the English, that his punishment was more favourable than for the <hi>Grievousness</hi> of his offence: whereas he falsely translates it thus, (as well in mockerie to the <hi>instrument,</hi> as against <hi>common sense,</hi>) that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment was more favourable then the <hi>weight</hi> of his offence: as if <hi>gravitas</hi> in That place had signified <hi>weight</hi>; and that the <hi>weight</hi> of the offence had been <hi>favourable too</hi>; or that the <hi>punishment</hi> was but <hi>more favourable, than That which was not so at all.</hi> For which, and divers other reasons, (especially that the <hi>Visitor</hi> might not be mock't and derided, under pretense of his being <hi>obey'd</hi>) the <hi>President</hi> insisted on what he frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had injoyn'd, to wit, that Dr. <hi>Yerbury should shew the impartiality of his obedience to the Visitors Order &amp; Decree, by varying no more from the words of the Instrument, wherein his Recantation and Confession are injoyn'd,</hi> than * by turning the <hi>third into the first per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son singular,</hi> and the <hi>Subjunctive mood into the Indicative:</hi> which he often and finally would not <hi>perform. Fifthly,</hi> he saith <hi>he doth now in express terms confess and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge these particulars</hi>; whereas the Terms are not <hi>expressed in conjunction with his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> Confession;</hi> which if <hi>any,</hi> is but <hi>imply'd,</hi> as it stands in connexion with [<hi>express terms</hi>] and [these <hi>particulars.</hi>] <hi>Sixthly,</hi> he professeth to confess <hi>whatsoever else</hi> my Lord <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> our Visitor by his Instrument hath injoyn'd, in <hi>meerly indefinite</hi> and <hi>general Terms</hi>; neither naming the <hi>nullity, falseness, injustice,</hi> and <hi>illegallity</hi> of his <hi>Appeal,</hi> (which he was to confess in writing, and <hi>terms expresse,</hi>) nor so much as <hi>Comprehending or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:29652:6"/>
those things, which the <hi>Visitor</hi> had <hi>commanded him to recant and retract, and not to acknowledge, or to confess</hi>: unless he purposely means to <hi>scoffe,</hi> both at the <hi>Visitor</hi> and his <hi>Instrument,</hi> by <hi>declaring</hi> to <hi>confess</hi> what he is <hi>bound</hi> to <hi>disavow. Seventhly,</hi> by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> saying [<hi>That his Lp. had interpreted those words,</hi> retractet &amp; recantet, <hi>to respect only the imprudent and inconsiderate manner of what he said, without relating to the matter or truth of it,</hi>] he usurps and injures his Lp's. <hi>name</hi> and <hi>Authority, against his Lp</hi>'s <hi>own hand and seal</hi>; and withall against the <hi>judgement of Common sense.</hi> Against the <hi>former,</hi> as appears by the <hi>words</hi> of the <hi>Instrument,</hi> to which his <hi>Lp</hi>'s. own <hi>hand</hi> and <hi>seal</hi> are fixt; (a copy of which instrument Dr. <hi>Yerbury</hi> professed to have in <hi>his pocket,</hi> and so he could not make excuses from <hi>wants of knowledge</hi>;) against the <hi>latter,</hi> for these two reasons; <hi>first</hi> because the two words <hi>imprudenter &amp; inconsideratè</hi> are not <hi>ingredients</hi> in the <hi>object,</hi> on which the <hi>act</hi> of <hi>Recanting</hi> is in the <hi>Instrument</hi> to be <hi>placed,</hi> (unless by way of <hi>consecution,</hi> as the word <hi>Eadem</hi> doth relate to the <hi>whole clause</hi> going before; in as much as <hi>verba imprudenter &amp; inconsideratè emissae contra</hi> Hen.
