            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Thus you may see, here's an ample field of Matter discovered. To treat of all these at this time, is neither possible, nor pertinent to this solemnity.

               <hi>They that are Christ's</hi>; indeed and in truth. 1 <hi>Not only in Name,</hi> but also in <hi>Nature:</hi> Being <hi>New Creatures,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17. and partaking <hi>the Divine Nature,</hi> the true Image of God, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.24. with <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. 2 <hi>Not only in Form</hi> outwardly by a meer visible <hi>Profession</hi>; but also <hi>in Power</hi> inwardly by an holy <hi>Constitution,</hi> attended with an answerable <hi>Conversation, Matth.</hi> 25.3, 4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.6.</p>
            <p>These, have <hi>Life</hi> theirs, and <hi>Death</hi> theirs. 1 <hi>Life,</hi> their Day to labour in: <hi>Death,</hi> their night to rest and sleep in. 2 <hi>Life,</hi> their Race to run in: <hi>Death,</hi> their Goal to obtain the Prize in. 3 <hi>Life,</hi> their Sea to sail in: <hi>Death</hi> their Haven to land in. 4 <hi>Life,</hi> their Egyptian pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage

            <p>But waving <hi>Generalities,</hi> let's come to a more <hi>Particular</hi> Illustration of this Proposition.

               </note> But here three things must be distinguished, <hi>viz. Principium vivendi: Esse viventis: Operationes vitae.</hi> 1. <hi>Principium vivendi,</hi> the Principle of living. And that's the Form, or Soul: <hi>Vegetative,</hi> in Plants; <hi>Sensitive,</hi> in Bruits; <hi>Intellective</hi> or Rational; in Man. 2. <hi>Esse viventis,</hi> The Being of the living: which is properly such a Nature in the living Creature, while the Principle of Natural life is in it, as whereby it is disposed to exert and exercise acts of life.<note n="(n)" place="margin">Vivere, viventibus est esse.</note> 3. <hi>Operationes vitae,</hi> The Operations or Acts of Life. Properly and formally these are not Life; but the effects, fruits, and evidences of Life. These Acts of Life may be reduced to <hi>Motion.</hi> — <hi>In him we live, and move,</hi> — Act. 17.28. Every Creature that <hi>lives, moves.</hi> And as the <hi>Motion</hi> in any Creatures is more or less per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; so the <hi>Life</hi> of them is more or less perfect. Thus, <hi>Living Plants</hi> do move, by <hi>Nourishing</hi> themselves, <hi>Grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Fruit-bearing,</hi> and <hi>Breeding their like.</hi> Thus, <hi>Living

Thus, <hi>Living man</hi> moves by all the Motions of both Plants and Bruits; and above them all, by Understanding, Conscience, and Will. The <hi>Motion</hi> of Bruits is more perfect than that of Plants: and consequently, the <hi>Life</hi> of Bruits is more perfect than the Life of Plants. But the <hi>Motion</hi> of Man is more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect than the Motion of Plants or Bruits: and therefore Mans <hi>Natural Life</hi> is incomparably more perfect, noble and excellent than theirs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Death Natural</hi> or <hi>Temporal,</hi> is, The Privation of Life Natural, through the Separation of the Matter from the Form, of the Body from the Soul.<note n="(o)" place="margin">Eccles., 12.7.</note> In the Death of Plants or Bruits, the Form or Soul is so severed, that it's destroyed with the Body, <hi>Goes downward:</hi> But in the Death of Man, his Soul is so separated, that it separately subsists without the Body, <hi>Goes upwards</hi>;<note n="(p)" place="margin">Eccles. 3.21.</note> Returns to God, to be immediately disposed by him, unto eternal weal or woe, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12.7. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17.21, 22. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. &amp; 12.23. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.43. &amp; 16.22, 23. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19.</p>
