            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TO begg your Pardon, or Protection, were to suppose a <hi>Fault,</hi> or <hi>Hazzard,</hi> but in this Dedication finding neither, I shall waive that Formality: humbly submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>what</hi> I have to say; my <hi>Reasons,</hi> and my <hi>Self,</hi> to your <hi>Authority,</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> without more Prologue, or Apology.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is a Faction which under the note of <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> seems much concerned to stickle against <hi>Bishops,</hi> &amp; <hi>Church-rites,</hi> on the behalf of <hi>tender Consciences.</hi> Their Writings and Opinions, are with great


<pb facs="tcp:110404:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Freedom, Craft,</hi> and <hi>Diligence,</hi> dispers'd throughout the Nation; to the great Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of the true Church, and the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of those of the Revolt. But this is yet the least part of the <hi>Mischief,</hi> or in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of their <hi>Design:</hi> Their Ayme being to Tumultuate the People, and make a Partie against the Civil Power. Indeed their Pamphlets wear the Face of <hi>Church-dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes,</hi> and <hi>Modells</hi>; but he that reads them through, and marques them narrowly, shall find the King's <hi>Authority</hi> the Question.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the late War against the King was Lawfull;</hi> is a <hi>Position</hi> common to them all, and this they publiquely maintain, as the main <hi>Basis</hi> of the Cause. By which assertion, they cast the <hi>Bloud,</hi> and <hi>Guilt</hi> upon His <hi>Majestie;</hi> make his <hi>Adhaerents Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:</hi> place the <hi>Supreme Authoritie</hi> in the <hi>two Houses:</hi> subject the <hi>Law</hi> to an <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance:</hi> the <hi>Government,</hi> to a <hi>Faction:</hi> and animate the <hi>Schismatiques</hi> to serve His <hi>Majestie</hi> in beeing as they did His <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>


               <pb facs="tcp:110404:3"/>
This is the drift of their seditious <hi>Libells,</hi> and of their <hi>Projects</hi> too; if any judgement may be made upon their strict conformity of Argument, and Methode, to those that first embroyl'd us.</p>
            <p>How farr this matter may require your <hi>Care,</hi> becomes not me to meddle: I thought it might be worth your Honours <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> and led by an Opinion of my Duty, this state of the Affair, (such as it is) I doe most humbly lay before you.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Majesty</hi> had no sooner set Foot upon <hi>English</hi> ground, but swarms of Pestilent papers were in a Readiness to enterteyn him. Some of the sharpest of them, I delivered to several Members of that Session, with the Stationers name for whom they were Printed, <hi>(Smith,</hi> at the <hi>Bible</hi> in <hi>Cornhill, Croftons</hi> Agent) but all too little to suppress them. One Passage is this that Follows; spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the limited Power of Kings —</p>

            <p>THe <hi>Cm mon good</hi> is the Common pretence of all seditious Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations: and it is no new thing for a <hi>Crafty Faction</hi> to impose upon a <hi>simple Multitude,</hi> empty <hi>Appearances,</hi> for <hi>Truths</hi> and <hi>Reason.</hi> But our Reformers scorn to stop at this dull, general method of Confusion.

            </p>
            <p>No lesse than this is hinted in the


<pb facs="tcp:110404:5"/>
Presbyterians Justification of the <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish League</hi> and <hi>Quarrel</hi>: nor have they any other aim, than by procuring an Allowance of <hi>That War,</hi> to make way to <hi>Another.</hi> To this end, they disperse their poysonous Infusions into all Quarters of the Kingdom, under those very Forms of <hi>Piety,</hi> and <hi>Tenderness,</hi> by which they first betrayed us: and by those very means do they now prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute afresh their first Intentions. That is, they labour to promote the Cause, by scandalous and rank <hi>Invectives,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Church,</hi> and stirring up of <hi>Tumults</hi> to <hi>Reform</hi> it: by a loud Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical <hi>ostentation</hi> of their own <hi>Holyness,</hi> &amp; a sour churlish Censure of all <hi>Others</hi>: by sharp and sawcie <hi>Aspersions</hi> upon the <hi>Royal Party,</hi> and by Reflections yet more bitter and Audacious, upon his Sacred <hi>Majesty,</hi> and his <hi>Murtherd Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>

and Impunitie, as if they were <hi>Authorized:</hi> and to observe what foul Mistakes are grounded upon these grosse Allowances, to the Kings Disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and all without Controll or Confutation. <hi>This,</hi> and no other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son (so God blesse me) that is; of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate <hi>Passion,</hi> or <hi>Animosity</hi> of temper) hath drawn this honest Folly from me.

            <p>The <hi>Benefit</hi> of this Treatise is direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>People,</hi> and the <hi>Design</hi> of it is onely to lay open the <hi>Presbyterian Juggle,</hi> that in one Age they be not twice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by the same Imposture.

            <p>As the <hi>Delusion</hi> is apparent, so is the <hi>Justice</hi> of <hi>Discoursing</hi> it.</p>
            <p>Can it be thought, that by the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Pardon,</hi> his Majestie ever meant to subject all the <hi>Sober</hi> and <hi>Legal Interests</hi> of the <hi>Nation,</hi> to be worried by a <hi>Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> Who of the <hi>Royal Party</hi> charges them? Or if they did, what has the <hi>Law</hi> done to offend them? Or say the <hi>Law</hi> be sharp against them, his <hi>Majesties unparalell'd Mercy</hi> has by his Royal Grace taken off the edge of it; hazzard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself to preserve these unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full People, which are now practising upon that Authoritie, that saved them.</p>

            <p>And then for <hi>Ceremonies</hi>; they teaz and chafe the <hi>Common-people</hi> into a pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish scruple, that would be well and quiet enough without them.

And undoubtedly whilst these two remain divided, the Kingdom of</hi> England, <hi>and the Protestant Religion is divided against it self. This dis-union is removed, either by the Abolition of one Party, or by the Coalition of both into one. The former, if supposed possible, cannot be accomplished, but by violent &amp; perillous ways and means. The latter is brought to pass by Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, or mutual yielding. Moreover, there is a third way imaginable, Toleration indulged to the weaker side.

            <p>Well, but our Authour tells us, that <hi>Abolition if possible, is perillous,</hi> and <hi>Toleration</hi> only an <hi>Imaginary</hi> Remedy. Is not this to intimate that the Party makes less Conscience of a

               <hi>I do Acknowledge and Declare, that the Warre undertaken by both Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their defence against the Forces raised in the Name of the late King, was Just and Lawful; and that Magistracy and Ministery, are the Ordinances of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second, was in the Exclusion of the Royal Party from the next Choice, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Resolved, that all and every Person who have advised, or voluntarily aided, abeited, or assisted, in any War against the Parliament (since the first day of</hi> January 1641.) <hi>his or their sons, unless he or they have since Manifested their good affections to this Parliament, shall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable to be elected to serve as members of the next Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now how a Choice thus limited in the House, and Principled in the Field, should <hi>Necessarily</hi> set us right, does not to me appear?</p>
            <p>Perhaps it was the most the Time would bear: but God forbid, <hi>That Declaration charging the Guilt, and Blood of the late War upon the King,</hi> should stand upon Record to future Generations. Who ever affirms That War was lawful, does beyond Question me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate Another; not to say more than needs, It blasts the Memory of the late King, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King that now is, it reflects many Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, subjecting both his Dignity and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to his Fathers hazards. It administers Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for a New War; and shakes the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Foundation of Royalty. Grant That, the Act of Oblivion is on the wrong side; If the


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:110404:16"/>
King was in Fault, the Presbyterians must Grant the Pardon. From the clear reason of the matter in it self, and from the obvious Consequences; beside that Justice which both King and People owe to the Ashes of a Father and a Soveraign, It seems to me of high Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, to Counter-State that Declaration, and <hi>place the Militia of this Nation now in such hands, as will acknowledge the late Kings Quarrel was Defensive.</hi> I am the bolder in this Particular, because I find the Faction pressing beyond both Modesty and Reason, upon this Bottom.</p>
            <p>Where Majesty it self is Affronted, it were a second Injury to allow the Servant better Quarter than the Master. But they are very Exact and Careful in this Particular: as will appear in what follows.</p>

               </note>Let it be noted here, that (by His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession) <hi>the War was between the King and Both Houses of Parliament.</hi> Now <hi>to that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty who fought under the Banner of His late Majesty.</hi> (Whom he might have spared for the General's sake.)</p>
            <p>Truly, considering what havock hath been made of them, by <hi>Slaughters, Extrajudicial Sentences, Plunders, Sequestrations, Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Banishments; shipping them away into Plantations, &amp;c.</hi> — And this for twenty years continuance. 'Tis no great wonder to find some Abatement of their Power. But to Affirm that they contributed nothing to his Majesties Restauration, is very unkind, and something Rash. The <hi>Nation</hi> did, (he says) the <hi>City of London,</hi> and the <hi>Secluded Members</hi> of the <hi>Long Parliament</hi>; but not <hi>That Party.</hi> (A pleasant and phantastical Dis-junction.) This way of barely Affirming, and Denying; Crying One Party Up, and the Other Down, and proving nothing, is neither Mannerly, nor Prudent. How comes this man of <hi>Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical Inspection,</hi> that reads the very <hi>Thoughts</hi> of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and seems so well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in all the <hi>Actings</hi> of the <hi>Royal Party</hi>: How comes he by this wondrous Insight and Intelligence?

            </p>
            <p>So far were <hi>We,</hi> (for I write my self of that


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:110404:17"/>
Party) from this Unfriendly and Unchristian Temper of Dis-uniting, that we Declared unanimously against it, binding our selves by all that's Sacred, to an Eternal Union with all Parties, in order to the Restauration of His Majesty, all Differences apart; of what De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or Quality soever. In This, we had an eye to the King's Interest, and to the Nation's; for it Referred both to his Majesty's Return, and to a Lasting Peace; the Former being Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitated by that Conjunction of <hi>Interests</hi>; and the Latter, provided for by a Conciliation of <hi>Affections,</hi> to be wrought by suppressing all <hi>Motions</hi> toward Revenge in the one Party, and the <hi>Fears</hi> of it in the <hi>Other.</hi> It had been good Manners to have met us half way; but truly high Discretion, as well as Common Equity, to Close with us, and entertain the Offer. But far from this, we do not onely get not one <hi>Good</hi> word, but many a <hi>Bad</hi> one: <hi>Such, as those People that will never Leave the King, are to expect from such as do not love Him.</hi> Our Adversary talks much of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> Is it a <hi>Gospel-precept, to render Evil for Good</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What I have shewed already, that the Kings Party did, amounts to somewhat more than nothing. We'l see a little further, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet to all that Acted in that work their share of Glory.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Albemarle</hi> was the Leading Card, <hi>then in the head of an Army, better dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to his Command, than Design:</hi> and to him the Honest part of the City and Nation were no ill Seconds. But till he had tasted and


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:110404:18"/>
tri'd them, he did well to walk warily: and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take the middle and safer way, of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying all Interests then on foot, than the more Positive, and Hazardous, of Disobliging any Two Parties, in favour of the Third.</p>
            <p>For there were then Three several Interests in Play: the <hi>King</hi>'s, the <hi>Presbyterian</hi>'s, and the <hi>Phanatique</hi>'s: The Royal party press'd for a Free Choice and Convention, without <hi>Prelimination.</hi> The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> urg'd a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admission of the <hi>Secluded Members.</hi> The <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiques,</hi> they were for filling up the House, according to such <hi>Qualifications</hi> as the <hi>Rump</hi> should resolve upon. The course the General steer'd was this; — the <hi>Rump</hi> Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued; the <hi>Secluded Members</hi> Returned; and the <hi>Royallists</hi> were satisfied with the Assurance of a new Choice soon after. His Excellence acting in this Affair rather as a Conciliator, than a Party, and in order to a Settlement, giving things the best Consistency they would then bear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But had the antient Stock of Royallists no hand at all in this procurement?</hi> It never came to blows, so that the matter Rests upon the Effects of Policy and Counsel; whereof our undertaker cannot give any absolute account; nor shall we in our just Apology, exalt our selves, and cry, <hi>We brought the King in.</hi> That's <hi>Presbyterian Language.</hi> We did not drive him out, we'l say; and that we joyn'd with many Thousands, as honest as our selves, in Duty to Restore him. Whether there was place for Action, and to do the King a Service


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:110404:18"/>
that way, we never Articled for Offices or Rewards, but without further care of Interest, persu'd our Duties. In fine the Loyal part of the Nation was animated by the same Soul, joyn'd Stocks, and Counsels: and many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of brave Fellows that never saw the King, were forward and Ambitious to Die for him. I could say what was undertaken by the old Royal Party, particularly, in <hi>Hewson</hi>'s scuffle, (and indeed where not) but that it casts a Slur upon some of his Majesty's new Friends. This however, those Lads of the City, that would have done the work without more ado, had they not been Muzzl'd by some of their Mungrel Magistrates, that Din'd with the <hi>Mayor,</hi> and Supp'd with the <hi>Committee of Safety:</hi> those honest people will, if need be, bear witness for us, and in like manner the whole Nation, that by Action, Counsel, Writing, we did all that was possible in the Business.

They assert the study and knowledge of the Scriptures, to be the duty and priviledge of all Christians, that according to their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral capacities, being skilful in the Word of Righteousness, they may discern between good and evil, and being filled with all goodness, may be able to exhort and admonish one another: Yet they acknowledge the necessity of a standing Gospel-Ministery, and receive the directive authority of the Church, not with implicite Faith, but the Judgment of discretion: They hold the teaching of the Spirit necessary, to the saving knowledge of Christ: Yet they do not hold that the Spirit bringeth new Revelations, but that he opens the eyes of the understanding to discern what is of old revealed in the written Word: They exalt divine Ordinances, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base humane Inventions in Gods Worship, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly

Ceremonies properly Religious, and of Instituted Mystical signification: Yet they allow the natural expressions of Reverence and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, as kneeling, and lifting up of the hands and eyes in prayer; as also of those meer Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of decency and order, the omission whereof would make the service of God either undecent, or less decent. As they worship God in the spirit, according to the simplicity of Gospel Institutions, so they rejoyce in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, having no confidence in a legal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, but desire to be found in him, who is made unto us Rigteousness by gracious Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: Yet withal they affirm constantly, that good works of piety towards God, and of justice and charity towards men, are necessary to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Their Doctrine bears full conformity with that of the Reformed Churches, held forth in their publick Confessions, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly with that of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>in the nine and thirty Articles, onely one or two passages peradventure excepted, so far as they may import the asserting of</hi> Prelacy, <hi>and human Mystical Ceremonies. They insist much on the necessity of Regeneration, and therein lay the ground-work for the practise of godliness. They press upon themselves and others the severe exercise, not of a Popish, outside, formal, but a spiritual and real mortification, and self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal, according to the power of Christianity. They are strict observers of the Lords Day, and constant in Family prayer. They abstain from oathes, yea, petty oathes, and the irreverent


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:110404:22"/>
usage of Gods Name in common discourse; and, in a word, they are sober, just, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect in their whole behaviour. Such is the temper and constitution of this party, which in its full latitude lies in the middle between those that affect a Ceremonial Worship, and the heighth of Hierarchical Government on the one hand, and those that reject an ordained Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, and setled Church-order, and regular Vnity on the other hand.</hi>

It was the Protestant verity which they witnessed, and sealed in blood, in opposition to Popery; especially the prodigious Opinion of Transubstantiation, and the Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Romish Mass or Sacrifice.

The <hi>Petitioning Capacity</hi> is not for the Presbyterians purpose; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he waves That, and sticks to the Other. What their <hi>Power</hi> is, will best appear from the King's Writ of Summons, which both <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi> and <hi>Limits</hi> them, <hi>Pro QUIBUSDAM arduis, &amp; urgentibus negotiis,</hi> &amp;c. —<hi>OR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DINAVIMUS,</hi> &amp;c.— He states it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:110404:34"/>
and places <hi>a part of the Legislative Power in the Two Houses,</hi> which is not Doctor-like. For the <hi>Legislative Power</hi> is totally the King's.<note place="margin">

Is it not enough that the King can do nothing without the Two Houses, unless they may do every thing without the King? Grant this, and of all people living we are the greatest Slaves, as of all Constitutions ours is the most Ridiculous.</p>

It is the proper business of a Parliament to <hi>Make Laws, Alter,</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal</hi> them, not to <hi>Interpret</hi> them, unless in matters of very great Importance.

            <p>The Common, and most specious shift of all the rest, is, that <hi>the Government of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in King, Lords, and Commons.</hi> This must be swallowed with great wariness, or 'twill choak half the Nation.

               <hi>since the abolishing of Popery, hath ever held and taught, and so doth hold and teach still, that the sign of the Cross used in Baptism, is no part of the substance of that Sacrament; for when the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister dipping the Infant in water, or laying water upon the face of it (as the manner also is) hath pronounced these words,</hi> I Baptize thee in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost, <hi>the Infant is fully and perfectly Baptized. So as the sign of the Cross being afterwards used, doth neither add any thing to the vertue or perfection of Baptism; nor being omitted doth detract any thing from the effect and substance of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, It is apparent in the Communion Book, that the Infant Baptized is by vertue of Baptism, before it be signed with the sign of


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:110404:49"/>
the Cross, received into the Congregation of Christs Flock, as a perfect Member thereof, and not by any power ascribed unto the sign of the Cross; so that for the very remembrance of the Cross, which is very precious to all them that rightly believe in Jesus Christ, and in the other respect mentioned: The Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>hath retained still the sign in Baptism, following therein the Primitive and Apostolical Churches, and accounting it a lawful outward Ceremony, and honorable Badge, whereby the Infant is dedicated to the service of him that died upon the Cross, as by the words used in the Book of Common-prayer it may appear.</hi>]</p>
            <p>If this will not suffice to prove, that nothing <hi>Sacramental</hi> is intended by it, let it be noted, that in <hi>private Baptism the Cross is totally omitted.</hi>

            <p>If the Bishops excesses were the Cause of War, how came the Kings ruine to be the effect of it? But 'tis no new thing for a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian to saddle the wrong Horse.

            <p>The grand source of our Miseries was the <hi>Covenant,</hi> by which, as by a Spell (in the


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:110404:59"/>
Name of the blessed Trinity) the people were insensibly bewitched into an aptnesse to work any wickednesse which the Interpreters of that Oracle should say was the Intendment of it.</p>
            <p>The first notorious Rupture was in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in 1637. attended with a COVENANT, which without Question was formerly agreed upon by the confederate Faction of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, as the most proper and least hazardous way of tasting the Kings patience, and the Peoples humours. That their design was laid and carried on by Counsels, and Intelligence as aforesaid, may be collected from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent, and brotherly Agreements: and truly the Retrospect of the Act of <hi>Indemnity</hi> seems to hint no lesse, for it commences from the first Scottish Broyls, tho' four or five years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the War brake out in <hi>England</hi>; what was begun by <hi>Covenant,</hi> was so prosecuted.</p>
            <p>By virtue of the Covenant the Kirk-party supply'd themselves with Men and Monies: Armies were brought into the Field; and beyond doubt, many that truly loved the King, not knowing what they did, ingaged against him. To keep up this delusion, the Press and Pulpit did their parts, and to deal freely after this advance, I should as much have wondred if they had stop'd short of his death, as I find o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wondering how they durst accomplish it. Death with a <hi>Bullet</hi> or an <hi>Axe,</hi> is the same <hi>Mischief</hi> to him that suffers it: and the same <hi>Crime,</hi> wilfully done, in those that <hi>Act</hi> it. No man can rationally <hi>allow one,</hi> and <hi>condemn</hi>

the <hi>other:</hi> For if the Violence be Lawful; why not as well in the Field, as upon a Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold?</p>
            <p>In this particular, the Doctor is beside his Cushion. He makes me think of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiss of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> upon a sawcy Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Why should I remember that he's a Priest (says my Lord) if he forgets it himself? His next argument against <hi>Prelacy</hi> is a Modest, and (as I take it,) a queint One.</p>

               <p>As to the point of <hi>Imperial Honour,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Majesty may possibly concern himself more immediately: It is a high excesse of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to make his Favours <hi>Common,</hi> where they are look'd upon so <hi>cheap,</hi> (as <hi>here</hi>; Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness these daily new Transgressions, since his most Gracious Pardon.)

               <p>There remains yet a <hi>third</hi> Question under this Head of <hi>Honour</hi>; that is, <hi>How far his Majesties</hi> Generosity <hi>may extend it self, in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and Protection of those persons that have serv'd him, through all extremities till they have nothing left them beyond the hopes of honourable Epitaphs.</hi>

               <p>These people have <hi>Consciences</hi> too; a sense of <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi> They reverence the <hi>Episcopal Order,</hi> and <hi>That,</hi> which through the sites of <hi>Bishops,</hi> was equally wounded: The Order of <hi>Kings.</hi> At last, those that <hi>subverted</hi> the Former, and <hi>usurped</hi> the Latter, demand (I think in reparation of their hazards)


<pb n="131" facs="tcp:110404:74"/>
a <hi>Presbyterian Government.</hi> In which particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, our Duty teaches us not to direct our Master: only we take a sober Freedome to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer our Accusers; and to professe to all the World, that those who fought <hi>For King</hi> and <hi>Bishops,</hi> were in our Opinion as honest men at least as they that fought <hi>against them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To his Majesties <hi>honourable</hi> Consideration, I think in this point we may claim a Right.

               </p>
               <p>Lastly, There is a <hi>Justice</hi> of <hi>Prudence,</hi> wherein a man may frame a thousand reasons against the <hi>Encouraging</hi> of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi>

Qu. <hi>Whether the upholding of both parties by a just and equal accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be not in it self more desireable, and more agreeable to the state of</hi> England, <hi>than the absolute exalting of the one party, and the total subversion of the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I must needs take notice here of two <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes,</hi> the one in <hi>propriety</hi> of language, <hi>viz. the Vpholding of both parties.</hi> One of those Parties is not <hi>up,</hi> and cannot be <hi>upheld.</hi> The other, shifts the <hi>Question,</hi> and states the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the EXALTATION <hi>of the one,</hi> and the SUBVERSION <hi>of the other,</hi> when all that we desire is but to keep both where they were, without <hi>advancing</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing</hi> either.</p>

challenge, the same had <hi>Cromwel</hi> to the <hi>Crown.</hi> This Question must be better stated, before we think it worth an Answer.</p>
               <q>One Reflexion now upon the Whole.</q>
               <p>Here's <hi>Exaltation,</hi> — and <hi>Subversion</hi>;—but not a syllable of <hi>Toleration</hi>: and what's the reason of all this? They are afraid that would be granted; and how should they do then to pick a quarrel? Their way is never to be satisfi'd in <hi>Conscience,</hi> with what the King can give in <hi>Honor,</hi> and <hi>Reason.</hi> (His Sacred Majesty's Observation) <hi>A grand Maxim with them was always to ask something,</hi>

                  <hi>which in Reason and Honor must be deny'd, that they might have some colour to refuse all that was in other things granted; setting Peace at as high a rate as the worst effects of War.</hi>] I have cited this already, but every Line drawn by that Hand deserves to be repeated.</p>
               <p>To this, there is another end that's common to the Gang, which is, to draw an <hi>odium</hi> upon one Party, and a <hi>compassion</hi> toward the other. And other end than this do I see none at all, in his <hi>absoute exalting,</hi> — and <hi>total sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.</hi> We covet no Change, but desire the contrary. How little soever it may appear to <hi>our</hi> purpose, 'tis very much to <hi>theirs,</hi> to have the people understand by <hi>Absolute Exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> — the dangerous and intolerable <hi>pride</hi> of <hi>Bishops</hi>; and by their <hi>total subversion,</hi> on the other side, how sadly the word goes with <hi>The Professors of the Gospel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:110404:77"/>These trivial appearances have more weight, than commonly the world imagines: <hi>'Tis not so much</hi> (as <hi>Hooker</hi> says) <hi>how small the spark is that flyeth up, as how apt things about it are to take fire.</hi> Their business is to stir the affections of the common people, which must be done by means and ways, to wise men, in themselves <hi>ridiculous,</hi> but in their applications of most desperate effect.</p>
               <p>I speak in earnest, that very Tone they use in Preaching; that <hi>Fellow-feeling-Tone</hi> (as they would have it understood) is I believe of great use to their business. I have observed the <hi>Groans</hi> that follow the <hi>Ahi-mee's,</hi> and beyond doubt those snivelling affectations are not without their benefit. That 'tis a forc'd and acted pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, is evident in this; they almost all of them use the same emphasis.</p>
               <p>I would not for my Hand let fall a syllable should cast a scandal upon that Holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: and with my soul I reverence the grave and pious Clergy. We cannot attribute enough to God; assume too little to our selves. We cannot be too much afflicted for our sins, nor too sensible of our own unworthiness. Yet I suppose a fit Christian sorrow may be contain'd within such terms as to reach <hi>Heaven,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out disturbing the <hi>Congregation.</hi> To come to a Church-dore, and hear an out-cry, as if a man were cutting for the Stone; and what's all this, but an afflicted Pastor, mourning for those heavy judgments, that hang over the Land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of Common-prayer: And then the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters groan so ruthfully, you'd swear five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

women were in Labour. Away with these ostentations of Holiness, — but first away with the <hi>Discourse</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>I must confess, the Gentleman hath offered fair, and more I doubt then he can undertake for, were it accepted. What if Six Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians of Seven renounce his <hi>Moderation,</hi> and say he treated without Commission: where's his Pacifick <hi>Coalition</hi> then? 'Tis for a Parity they struggle; which when they have got, they shall as much contest among themselves to crush again, as ever they did to introduce it. Just thus was the King treated; He was to rule in <hi>Consociation</hi> too, by the <hi>advise</hi> of his Presbyters. And what came on't? The Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons interfer'd; the Change went round the Circle; and at long-length; in the place of a most <hi>Gracious Prince,</hi> up starts a most <hi>Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Protector.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet I verily think, a way might be found out to work upon these people: Let the King settle their strict Form of Discipline; fill the Presbyteries with Episcopal Divines, and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of his own Party; I verily believe these very men would be as hot for Bishops. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend the temper of that <hi>Sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tenderness,</hi> that makes men <hi>Digest</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops <hi>Lands,</hi> and yet forsooth they cannot <hi>swallow</hi> the <hi>Sleeves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Onely this word. Some of the Authors I have quoted <hi>for Episcopacy,</hi> (to deal sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely) may be as well produc'd <hi>against</hi> it. For That, let them look to't, I am Innocent: and my Cause Clearer for it. They found it


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:110404:78"/>
for their Interest to Engage their Disciples in many Opinions, which for their Honor they would not undertake to defend against their Equals.</p>
               <p>I Should end here, were I not drawn out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my purpose, by a <hi>Second Part</hi> from the same Hand; which should not yet divert me from my first Intention, could I but save my self, in letting it absolutely alone. By the Formalities of <hi>Title</hi> and <hi>Connexion,</hi> it seems related to the Former part, further then by some passages in the Treatise it appears to be; whereof some few I am concern'd to Examine, and I shall shorten even that little I intend, as much as Possible.

               <p>What did these great Pretenders then for the good of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi> but share the booty, and exercise a Power themselves ten thousand times more Turkish then ever they called that they had abolished? what hindered then the Settlement of this Nation upon its <hi>legal Basis,</hi> (as they phrase it) if the good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had but had a mind to it? Who kept the King from his Parliament? —or was he ever nam'd but with relation to the Losse of <hi>Right</hi> as well of <hi>Power.</hi>

               <p>Well, but at last, these people take their turns too, and then the King's a Gracious Prince again. These Factions are of Kin to <hi>Montaignes</hi> Family, where the Son beats the Father from generation to generation. Now we come near our purpose.</p>
               <p>Look back into the <hi>Scotch</hi> defeat in 1648. Not any thing more clear sure, then that the Presbyterian party, would they but frankly


<pb n="155" facs="tcp:110404:86"/>
have closed with the Kings Tryed Friends in that Engagement; without a Miracle, they must have carried it. Those Few they had, did well nigh all that was considerable in the Action.</p>
               <p>See afterward, in 50, and 51. how dirtily upon this very accompt, the Presbyterian crew treated his Majesty: and look quite through their <hi>Interregnum</hi>; they have observ'd the same indisposition of uniting with the Kings Party, but still shaking the Head, with an <hi>Alass poor Gentleman,</hi> at the mention of our perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted Soveraign.

               <p>
                  <hi>If we can order Matters so as to get the King's</hi> Person <hi>in the head of us, and keep out his</hi> Party, <hi>Their hands are ty'd by a Principle of Duty; Our Power is enlarged upon an Interest of favour, and we can play our Game at pleasure.</hi> That is; Wee'l not forget to mind him of his RESTORERS, and now and then a Whisper, how DEBAUCHD the Gentry's grown; how unfit this man is for <hi>Trust,</hi> that for <hi>Temper,</hi> and a Third for <hi>Conduct.</hi>

               <p>Now if the Two Houses cannot <hi>Rebel,</hi> as being part of the Supreme Power; (by his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument) neither can the Presbyterians, in compliance with that Party: So that by this mis-placing of the Supreme Authority, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hath been acted by vertue of any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from the Two Houses, may be done over again, and no Rebellion.</p>

                  <hi>There is a saying, which by many hath been taken up for a Proverb,</hi> No Bishop, no King.<note place="margin">pag. 106.</note> 
                  <hi>I do not well understand the rise of this saying, and therefore dare not speak in derogation of their Judgements who were the Authors of it. But upon the matter it self, I crave to make this modest Animadversion. And first it is some degrading to the transcendent Interest of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, to affix unto it a necessity of any one partial interest for its support: for Independency and Self-subsistence, without leaning upon any Party, is a Prince his strength and glory. Also it makes that Party over-confident, and its op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite too despondent. Such sayings as import a Princes necessary dependence on any particular Party, may in the mouthes of Subjects be too presumptuous, and in the mouth of a Prince too unwary.</hi>

                  </note>If we are not yet instructed in the Weight and Reason of that saying,— <hi>NO BI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHOP, NO KING</hi>; sure we are past Learning any thing. We found the sad truth of this Judgment, in the event of the late War; but that's no Rule. By <hi>No Bishop no King,</hi> is not intended that Bishops are the props of Royalty, nor do the Episcopalians understand it so: but that both one and the other are Objects of the same Fury, onely the Church goes First: so that without <hi>presumption,</hi> a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> may <hi>affirm</hi> it; and without loss of <hi>Honor,</hi> a <hi>Prince</hi> may <hi>grant</hi> it.</p>
               <p>I might draw Arguments from the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their <hi>Original,</hi> the likeness of their <hi>Constitution,</hi> the Principles by which they are <hi>supported,</hi> and that they lye exposed to the same Enemies, and the same method of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. But this would seem to imply a more Inseverable Interest then I aim at; and raise the Clergy above the proper State and Orb of Subjects. My meaning is more clear and open.</p>
               <p>All Popular Factions take the <hi>Church</hi> in their way to the <hi>State</hi>; and I am to seek where ever any Prince quitted <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and saved <hi>Himself.</hi> That is, his <hi>Royal Dignity</hi>; for the empty name of <hi>King,</hi> is but the <hi>Carkass</hi> of Majesty. It is with the unruly Populacy, as it is with raging Tides, they press where the Bank is weakest, and in an instant over-run all. If they had either Modesty, or Conscience, they


<pb n="171" facs="tcp:110404:94"/>
would not force so far: if they have neither, will they stop There? what did the late King Grant; or rather, what Deny? till by their mean Abuse of his unlimited Concessions, he lost his Crown, and Life? Yet what assurance Words could give him, he wanted not: Words wrapt up in the most tender and Religious Forms imaginable. But what are Words where a Crown lyes at stake?</p>
               <p>In fine, <hi>Treason's a Canker; and where it seizes, that Prince must early cut off the Infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed part, if he would save the Sound.</hi>

                  <hi>They are of circumspect and regular walking, no way forward in attempting or desiring alterations in a Civil State. A Prince doth hold them in obedience under a double bond. For they know they must needs be subject not only for wrath, but for Conscience sake. Indeed we will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal, that in lawfull wayes they assert that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which is setled by the known Laws and Fundamental Constitutions, the maintaining whereof is the Prince's as much as the Peoples safety.</hi>

                  <hi>Lawfull Liberty,</hi> in <hi>Lawfull waies</hi>; but how is that I pray'e? Did they not tell us this when their Swords were at our Throats, when it was Death to assist the King, when they were forc'd to flye to the <hi>Equitable</hi> sense of the Law, and quit the <hi>Literal,</hi> and fetch their Arguments, from Inspiration, because they had none in Reason.</p>
               <p>I shall here put an End to this Discourse, which is become much longer already than I meant it, by reason of his Addition. <hi>Crofton</hi>'s ill Fortune I find hath made him <hi>wary,</hi> but not <hi>humble</hi>; for he presses the same Things in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance still, though in somewhat a differing manner of Respect, and seeming Candour.

               <p>Finally, he pretends to ayme at a Fair, and Christian Accord, and yet proceeds in a direct method of Dividing: by sharp, and scandalous Reflections upon the Kings Party.</p>
               <p>To say no more, his Reasonings are <hi>Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable</hi> to the memory of the <hi>Late</hi> King; <hi>Seditious,</hi> and <hi>Provoking</hi> to the <hi>People; Bold,</hi> and <hi>Imposing</hi> in <hi>themselves; Repugnant</hi> to the established <hi>Law,</hi> and to the main scope of the <hi>General Pardon.</hi>
