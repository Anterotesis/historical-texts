            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶ A Declaration of the General Convention of IRELAND, Expreſſing their Detestation of the unjuſt Proceedings againſt the late KING, in a pretended HIGH COURT OF IUSTICE in ENGLAND.</head>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas by the contrivances of ſome ſelf deſigning perſons, a ſinful and unexemplary force was put upon the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> in the year 1648. Thoſe perſons having cauſe to deſpair of the Parliaments com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with their horrid and deſtructive Principles, though never ſo artificially and plauſibly heldforth : VVhich ſingle act in it ſelf though it was a tranſcendent violation of that Kingdomes Birth right, yet it ſeemed too cheap &amp; vile a Sacrifice to their ambition, except they min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with it the Blood of their and our Lawful Soveraign; In Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whereunto, They preſumed to Erect A COURT called by themſelves A HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE, where, by an Ugly and Execrable Sentence they Condemned him to death, which was Executed under all the circumſtantial aggravations of Barbariſme. Since which time, the People of this Kingdome having not had opportunity of aſſembling themſelves in <hi>Ireland</hi> untill the meeting of this General Convention; And being by the bleſſing of God now met, VVe judge it our duty to Declare, and do hereby Declare to the whole VVorld Our unſained and hearty detestation of, and Our Protestation againſt thoſe moſt Inhumane, Unparalelld and Barbarous Proceedings againſt the late KING: which by true Proteſtants can be termed no other, Then the fouleſt Murther, and Higheſt Aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſination that Sacred or Profane Story hath Recorded: being perpretated by the ſaid perſons in a Kingdome where the true Reformed Religion eminently flouriſht, and being contrary to that Solemn League and Covenant which they themſelves had taken, and all this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanct under a pretext of publick Iustice.</p>
            <p>And VVe heartily beg of God, that he would ſilence the Cry of that innocent Blood, and not further puniſh theſe Nations for the ſame, by continnueing them in Confuſions and Unſettlements, but in the Riches of his Mercy Reſtore them to Peace upon the ſure Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Truth and Righteouſneſs.</p>
