            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>for himselfe:</hi> And it may be said as wel now, Let Babel plead for her self: yea let him be blessed that dasheth <note place="margin">Psalme 137. 9.</note> her little ones against the stones;
<pb facs="tcp:8247:3"/>
And let it be done to her as shee hath done to others; And let all <note place="margin">Reuel. 18. 6.</note> the people of God say Amen.</p>
            <p>Neuerthelesse, herein (if in any thing in the world) great arte and skill is to be used: For it is not for every fresh water souldier to fight against Babel. The Poet saith,</p>

            </lg>
            <p>And it is a true saying that God loues Aduerbs better then Adiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, so as if a man doe good things, and doe them not well, hee is an offender notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; so is it in this case: he that will make warre against Babel, and will not do more hurt then good, had need to bee well prouided, and aduised. <hi>Plutarch</hi> makes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb facs="tcp:8247:3"/>
of one, who vnaduisedly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting a stone at a dogge, hit and hurt his owne mother; and so many there are who ignorantly and inconsiderately contending against Babel, doe grieuously wound the Church of God, and (as your Lordship saith truly) do more wrong to their cause, then to their aduersaries: If any man be ignorant how this may be, and bee willing to learne, you haue well informed him in your last Book of the Old Religion; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you make it plaine, that though Rome bee Babel; yet so long as she is Babel, she shall haue a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">Reuel. 18. 4.</note> of God in her: so that as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>They are not all Israel that</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 6.</note> 
               <hi>are of Israel;</hi> so may wee in this case, They are not all Babel, that
<pb facs="tcp:8247:4"/>
are in Babel, and communicate with Babel. If then a man haue not a spirituall eye, to distinguish betweene Babel, and the people of God in Babel; how much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe may hee doe in quarelling with Babel? I would wee had not too much experience hereof in some, who make good your Lordships too just censure, that <hi>Zeale</hi> transports them to such a detestation of the <hi>Romane Church,</hi> as if it were all error, no Church, and so that no soule can be saued therein: A fearfull and heauie doome; of which a man may say, as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> said in another case, <hi>Solo auditu contremisco:</hi> I trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the very hearing of it.</p>
            <p>Now your Lordship (as a good Souldier of Iesus Christ, and one
<pb facs="tcp:8247:4"/>
of the Colonels of the spirituall Armie of the Lord of hoasts) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuouring amongst other errors to reforme this, and to bring all into right and perfect order; that is, to traine all the souldiers vnder your regiment according to the old discipline; which is, to entend to cure Babel, and not to destroy her before the time, (that it may truly be said of them, as well as of others, We would haue cured Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, <note place="margin">Ier. 51. 45.</note> but she would not be cured, the time of curing being not past, so long as it is called to day.) <note place="margin">Heb. 3. 13.</note> There are risen vp, I know not what hot-spurres, and bold Brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadochioes in the Campe, who mutinouslie doe turne their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons from Babel against you; as if you were therefore become
<pb facs="tcp:8247:5"/>
their enemy because you tell them <note place="margin">Gal. 4 16.</note> the truth. And amongst others, one Master, <hi>Henry Burton,</hi> hath publikely taken the quarrell vpon himselfe in the name of all the rest; who being otherwise a man of good parts (as it should seem) and hauing a good meaning to doe Gods Church some seruice, yet ouerweening himselfe, and forgetting his place, hath giuen the common aduersary too much aduantage against vs all. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing defectiue in Logick (our best engine, after the word of God) and trusting to nothing but meer sophistry, and failing in the truth, or true meaning of all his allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; he hath not onely shamed himselfe, but put vs all out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, hindred our good procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
<pb facs="tcp:8247:5"/>
weakned our owne for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by diuision, and strengthned the enemy.</p>
            <p>Whereupon (it being not any way conuenient that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship should enter into the lists with him;) vpon an incident oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of speech about this matter in the beginning of September, it pleased you to accept an offer of my seruice in this businesse; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though vpon beare-say onely at that time, and not otherwise, I had notice of his misbehauiour.</p>
            <p>Here therefore, I tender vnto your Lordship some testimony, not so much of the old innocent familiarity, which almost from the cradle hath beene betweene vs; as of my readiness to performe all parts of that Canonicall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

which being due to all my Diocesans; I am most joyfull to yeeld vnto you aboue, and before all the men in the world.</p>

Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>The second Angell poured out his viall vpon the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a, and it became as the blood of a dead man; and euery liuing soule dyed in the sea:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8247:8"/>
Ergo,</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is neyther a true Church, nor a true visible Church. To which I may say farre better then <hi>Bishop</hi> said to <hi>Perkins: Apply Iohn Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and thou shalt haue a new paire of Sizors.</hi> Whether I wrong him or no, I referre my selfe to the censure of euery iudicious Reader: And if I wrong him not, euery man may see, that hee beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth two things which no good Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine may yeeld vnto him: One is, that an Allegoricall Prophecie (such as this is) may bee laid for a good foundation, whereon to frame an Argument to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide a Controuersie in Diuinitie; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the old Maxime, <hi>Theologia symbolica non est argumentatiua:</hi> Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories in diuinitie afford no good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Especially if they be Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, whereof there may be doubt whether they be fulfilled or no: in which case the tryall is, to examine the perspicuitie thereof: for a Prophecie, as of all Scriptures it is most obscure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be fulfilled; so when it is fulfilled it is of all other most cleare, and easie: This therefore being an Allegory, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8247:9"/>
propheticall, and retaining the aenigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall darknesse which it had originally (as appeareth by the various interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Learned, euery day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed) I for my part cannot suppose it to be yet accomplished; and so (to me) it is vnfit for that vse to which hee hath imployed it.</p>
            <p>The other point of his Beggerie is, That his owne priuate interpretation of these words may be allowed as the true meaning of the holy Ghost: which is, That by the Sea we are to vnderstand the Doctrines of the Councel of <hi>Trent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> by the blood, the abominable corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions therof: by the Angel, <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> and other learned men of that time that examined it: and by the pouring out of the viall, their preachings and writings. All which hee hath borrowed from <hi>Brightman,</hi> whom notwithstanding elsewhere he forsaketh. But now what if we deny him this interpretation; and require some proofe hereof, what will he say then: Surely hee is vtterly disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and all his building falls to the ground. If he say we must shew some
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8247:9"/>
reason for our denyall; besides that we haue shewed some already, it would be knowne, why we may not as well deny, as he affirme without reason: If this course bee good, euery mans priuate fantasie (especially if he can make some shew of probability) must bee <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Reuelations Reuelation: And then why may not <hi>Bellarmines</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the ninth cap. <hi>(Oratione in Scholis habita)</hi> wherein he turnes all vpon <hi>Luther</hi> and the Lutherans) passe for current? But lest I may seeme to seeke euasions; I will doe that against him, which he cannot, or at least hath not yet done for himselfe: I will shew some reason for my denyall; and leaue it to the iudgement of the Learned: And because the ground of all is that the Councell of Trent, or the doctrines thereof, are that bloody sea: I suppose it sufficient (if I proue it to bee other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise) to turne vp all his phantasticall Cauillation.</p>
            <p>First therefore I proue it <hi>ex praecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessis;</hi> for hee granteth, that the same Sea whereof cap. 8. r. the third part
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:8247:10"/>
was turned into blood, is here wholly turned thereinto. Now <hi>Brightman,</hi> (whom in this point he followeth) will haue that third part of the Sea, to bee the doctrine of Europe, the third part of the Christian world: And then <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: the whole sea is the doctrine of the whole Christian world: But the doctrine of the Councell of Trent, is not the doctrine of the whole Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world: <hi>Ergo</hi> it is not the Sea here mentioned by S. <hi>Iohn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, vpon the powring out of this second Viall; this sea is turned into congealed and putrified blood, which (by his interpretation) signifieth that by the conclusions of the Councell of Trent, Romes doctrines are become mortall and damnable: and this puts a difference betweene the state of Romes doctrines before the Councel of Trent (while as yet they were in their grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) and after it: Before there was some fresh water, &amp;c. but after none at all. So saith he: But I say that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Trent hath not a whit corrupted Romes Doctrines more than they were
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:8247:10"/>
along time before: <hi>Ergo</hi> the Councell of Trents conclusions are not here to be vnderstood. I need not take paines in the proofe hereof; because the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned doe not accuse it of this fault; but that (whereas it promised reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that it was expected ther from) it cosened the world; and in stead of reforming confirmed the foule corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the religion and doctrine of the Church which formerly had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed: Indeed Master <hi>Crashaw</hi> (whose memory for old acquaintance is preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to me) noteth one, (and but one) point of doctrine (for the other is only for practice) wherein the Councell of Trent hath added some thing to the former corruptions, which is, the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing of the Apocrypha with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall books of Scripture: But if we consider how he interpreteth himselfe (that no Councell before had done the like) it will appeare, that hee denyeth not, but that euen that corruption also was inueterate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>efore the Councell of Trent.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I say that the Councell of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:8247:11"/>
Trent hath reformed Romes doctrine, and made it (at least in one point) bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then it was before: <hi>Ergo</hi> it is not here to be vnderstood. The point is this, that there is no naturall ability in a man, to prepare himselfe for grace, and so no merit of congruity, in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <hi>Stapleton</hi> saith, <hi>Meritum ex con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruo explosum est:</hi> a point of no small moment in these dayes.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I say that there is as much fresh water in Romes doctrines since the Councell of Trent, as there was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: <hi>Ergo</hi> it is not here to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. This I proue, by the doctrine of the Tridentine Catechisme, in euery part whereof there is sufficient quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of sauing doctrine for those that (to vse your owne words) can search and find it out: separating the good from the bad, and truth from errour: as may appeare to them that will take the paines to reade it: yea I dare bee bold to say, the Church of Rome had not for many hundred yeares before the Councell of Trent, so good a forme of doctrine, as that Catechisme contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:8247:11"/>
which I speake not to justifie the Councell, or the Catechisme, in any errour comprehended therein; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to shew the beggery of the aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: of which this shall be sufficient.</p>
            <p>His disorder shewes it selfe in three things; First, in not setting the state of the question: Secondly, in mispla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his owne arguments: Thirdly, in idle repetitions. For the first: There cannot be a greater fault in a Disputant, then either to leave the question altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnstated; or else to state it amisse; for by this meanes it ordinarily fals out, that the contention is nothing else but <hi>Andabatarum pugna,</hi> the fight at blind man buffe (as we say,) so as a man may misse ten times, before hee hit once: But of the two the former is the worse, wherein this our aduersary offendeth: If he say, he tooke it as hee found it; it will not excuse: For I dare say his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended aduersaries intended not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat; if they had, they would haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued him of the occasion of much babbling: And yet, had he not listed to be contentious, hee might haue picked
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:8247:12"/>
such a state of the question out of the defenders writings, as might haue d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the edge of his quarrelsome humor: for the state being set aright, and with perspicuity, it will easily appeare to which side the truth inclineth: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that I offend not in that wherein I finde him to be faulty; I will doe that which he hath left vnperformed. First then wee are to know, that the words whereof the question consisteth are full of ambiguity: For both the Church of Rome, and a true Church, and a Church truly visible, haue many sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and significations: The Church of Rome hath at least eight seuerall accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: For sometimes it noteth the particular Diocesse of the Romane ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory, commonly called the particular Romane Church: Sometimes (and most vsually) it comprehendeth all the national Churches which communicate with Rome in the same faith, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same head, the Pope, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called the Catholique Romane Church: Sometimes the Clergy of that Church is onely vnderstood by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:8247:12"/>
that title, commonly called the Church representatiue: Sometimes the people onely, commonly called the Laity, and of some the popular Church of Rome: Sometimes the whole body of Clergy and Laity: Sometimes the Papacy, or Apostacy in that Church, which is S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Babylon: Sometimes the Elect in that Church, still communicating with the Papacy, which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> calls Gods people: And sometimes the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Church which is in the Romane Church, and yet communicateth not with her abominations; which some call the Church in the wildernesse. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, A Church is said to bee true, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers wayes: As first materially, in that it consisteth of a people comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within the compasse of Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of life, and saluation: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, formally, in regard of frame, and constitution: Thirdly, accidentally, in regard of soundnes, and outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. Thirdly, a Church is said to be truly visible for the true markes of a Church which it hath; either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of it selfe within it selfe; in which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:8247:13"/>
respect, the Churches in persecution are truly visible, though their enemies and others which are not of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber see them not: Or in regard of the world abroad: whether Christians or Infidels which know her assemblies: And in this latter sense againe, it is said to be visible, either strictly and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when the whole Church is visible at once, and all together (which is onely true of particular Congregations) or largely and Synechdochically, when the whole cannot bee visible together, and at once, but by pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cemeale, and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession: and so the Catholique Church here on earth may truly be said to bee visible. Thus you see how great ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity there is in the sense of these few words, <hi>The Church of Rome is a true and truly visible Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in the second place, to apply all this to our present purpose. Although diuerse men doe set the state of this question diuersly, as may best serue for their owne priuate ends and purposes: yet I will take it in the largest extent, and as it may bee most fauourable for
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:8247:13"/>
the Church of Rome: Thus; <hi>Whether the Catholike Church of Rome (as it is called in opposition to the Dioces) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the whole body thereof compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of Clergy and Laity, bee still within the couenant of Gods sauing grace: and haue such markes of that couenant still a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in it, that though properly at once, and all together it cannot bee visible, yet by peece-meale, and successiuely, it may truly be said so to be.</hi> And so much for the state of the question and his first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order. His second point of disorder is in misplacing his owne arguments; which I take not as if it were done ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly, as not knowing what hee should haue done; (for hee excuseth himselfe for it, supposing it superfluous to doe it) but artificially for his best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage; It seemes hee trusted more to the gentlenesse of his aduersaries, and to his owne abilitie in opposing them; then to the strength of his owne, and his power to maintaine them; and so brings them in as it were by way of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>. But howsoeuer it hath pleased him to proceed; I may not passe them
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:8247:14"/>
ouer in this place without tryall; vnless I would incurre the same suspition: Let vs see therefore how hee proueth the negatiue.</p>
            <p>His first argument, (wherein he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth his greatest confidence) is briefly propounded pag. 24. but more at large pag. 90. of his Aduertisement, and it lyeth thus.
<q>
                  <p>That Church which denieth, yea ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curseth, the sauing faith of Iesus Christ vnto Iustification; allowing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such a faith which can neuer saue a man, but is a gracelesse faith, separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from grace, and which a man may carie with him into Hell; that is an Apostatized Church; vtterly falne away from Christ, wherein no salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be found, or hoped for:</p>
                  <p>But the Church of Rome doth all this: Ergo.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To which I answer; by denying all: I deny the proposition, because it is so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisticall: The assumption, because it is false: and I need not then doubt to deny the conclusion. The proposition is sick of that Sophisme, which the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:8247:14"/>
call <hi>secundum plures interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones,</hi> or <hi>propositiones:</hi> that is, when many Propositions are ioyned together in one, whereof some are true, some false: as here are at least three. One, that the Church (so bablingly described) is an apostatised Church: another, that it is vtterly fallen away from Christ: a third, that no saluation is to be found or hoped for therein. Of which the first onely is true, and the rest notoriously false, and against the Scripture: for first, to denie, yea to accurse sauing Faith, &amp; to allow the contrary, is not a point of totall &amp; finall Apostasie, vnles it be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with malice and obstinacie; and be the sinne against the holy Ghost, to which repentance is vtterly denyed. Else what shall wee say of <hi>S. Peter</hi> who both denyed and cursed the knowledge of Christ in himselfe. Secondly, if this be true, (as it is) then may saluation be found, and hoped for, notwithstanding that de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iall, cursing, and approbation. Thirdly, it must be remembred, that our question is of the whole body of the Church, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:8247:15"/>
part onely, nor of the represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiue onely, but of both together: if then the one part onely shall doe as he saith, and not the whole body, who can say that there is no saluation to bee found therein, or that it is vtterly falne away from Christ. So much for the Proposition.</p>
            <p>In the next place I say the Assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is euidently false, if not more then slanderous: For first the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (whether partially, or wholly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood) neuer denyed, neuer accursed sauing and iustifying Faith, nor euer allowed a gracelesse faith onely which cannot saue, &amp;c. Looke vpon all the Canons of the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> and see whether any such thing bee to bee found therein, or gathered therefrom: doth it not distinguish betweene a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and a dead faith? And doth it not say that the liuing Faith only iustifieth, and not the dead? what is it then that it denyeth and accurseth? It is this, first, the forme and manner of Iustification by Faith: when it is said to iustifie as the very forme of Iustification, and not
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:8247:15"/>
as a meere disposition thereto. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this assertion, that a dead faith sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from grace is not a true faith; though it cannot iustifie: this is that which the Counsell denyeth and accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth in this case, and no more; yet you say boldly if not impudently, <hi>pag. 25. If any dare deny this hee will but bewray his shamelesse ignorance in this point.</hi> In what point <hi>M. Burton? That the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Trent admitteth of no other faith then that which the Deuils and damned in hell haue?</hi> O mouth! O forehead! Haue they a liuing Faith; which is fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in good workes? Such a Faith as <hi>S. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ames</hi> commendeth? And doth not the Councell admit of this Faith? yea of this onely for Iustification? Reade the latter part of the seuenth Chapter of the sixt Session, and bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed. Secondly, say the Counsell had done so indeed; Doth the whole Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doe it? Doth the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular part therof doe it? By your owne words, <hi>page</hi> 25. they denie it. Yea but they beleeue as the Church beleeues. True, but with a secret condition, If
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:8247:16"/>
the Church beleeue well, and in that onely wherein it beleeueth aright: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceiued in nothing, but that they trust the Church too much; for if they could be perswaded shee beleeueth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse in any thing, therein they would not beleeue as she doth. But you will proue that <hi>Romes</hi> iustifying faith is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in kinde from the true sauing Faith of Christ. How? Can you tell? Marry thus.
<q>
                  <p>That faith which Christ commendeth for the onely true sauing faith, doth so iustifie a man that hee shall neuer come into condemnation, but passe from death vnto life:</p>
                  <p>But the onely faith which the Church of Rome alloweth doth not so.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo, Aduertisement. pag. 91.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I answere: A Papist, or Arminian would denie the Proposition; but I grant it, and deny the Assumption: for let the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> confesse what she will in her owne wrong; I say, that that faith which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> onely alloweth for iustification <hi>(viz</hi> a liuing faith fruitfull in good workes)
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:8247:16"/>
doth so saue, and iustifie a man, that hee cannot goe with it into condemnation: and dare you say the contrary? This is his first Argument.</p>
            <p>The second is this:
<q>
                  <p>That Church which cleaueth to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ as her head, whence she recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth all her spirituall life, is no true Church; nor hath any saluation to be found, or hoped for in her.</p>
                  <p>But the Church of Rome doth so.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo. Aduertisement.</hi> pag. 91. 92.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I denie the Assumption; Not for that I denie the Pope to be Antichrist, or for that I would support the church of <hi>Rome</hi> in any of her abominations: but first, because the church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not acknowledge the Pope to be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, and so cleaueth not to him as her head in that name: Secondly, because, although some Popes haue antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly said, that all spirituall grace and life is deriued from the Pope, and that some of their Parasites haue flatteringly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged it, yet neither the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatiue church of <hi>Rome</hi> by it selfe, nor the popular by it selfe, much lesse the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:8247:17"/>
whole and entire body did euer yeeld vnto it; but haue from time to time op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed themselues against it: especially if the question be of an absolute, foue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, and supreme head; and not of a subordinate and ministeriall head, as you propound it: Thirdly, because in these spiritual things there is such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of good and euill in this life, that though the one cannot be separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the other, yet the one is not confounded with the other; so as each of them receiues its life seuerally from its owne head, and not from the head of the other: As it is in the regenerate man, in whom the flesh and the spirit are alwaies companions in this life; yet so, as the flesh receiueth nothing from the holy Ghost, nor the spirit from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> transgression. And so is it in the case wee haue in hand: for in the church of <hi>Rome</hi> there is an inseparable coniunction of <hi>Babylon</hi> and the people of God, yet so as <hi>Babylon</hi> receiues no grace from Christ, nor the people of GOD apostafie from the Pope, for being members of both in diuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:8247:17"/>
they haue grace from the one, and apostasie from the other, which in them are indeed nothing but flesh and spirit: And so much for his second Argument.
<q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The third, pag. 34. hereof, is thus framed:</hi> A true visible Church hath the true markes of a true visible Church:</p>
                  <p>But the Church of Rome hath not those true markes. Ergo.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Assumption whereof being to be denyed, hee proueth it partly from the doctrine of the Church of England, and partly from <hi>Bellarmine</hi> the mouth of the Church of Rome. For the Church of England, the Homily for Whitsunday saith: <hi>The true Church of Christ hath alwayes three notes or marks whereby it is knowne: Pure and sound doctrine, &amp;c. Now if you would compare this with the Church of Rome, &amp;c.</hi> To which I answer, That these words must receiue a fauourable construction; or else they make as much against him, as against vs; and with such constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they make more for vs, then for him.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:8247:18"/>
And what is this construction? First, they must bee vnderstood of the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall truth of the Church in regard of soundnesse, (as the words doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly import) and not of essentiall truth in regard of Gods Couenant: Secondly, they must bee vnderstood euen of soundnesse comparatiuely, and not simply, that is, in regard of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, and not otherwise. Else hee must grant, that the Church of Rome hath not beene a true visible Church these nine hundred yeares: where as he allowes it to haue beene so till the Councell of Trent, as appeareth in all this Discourse.</p>

in medling in causes, and with persons too high for him, and the like? Secondly, doth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime them simply, and not onely in comparison of meere proper markes? Thirdly, may not the Church of Rome haue them as markes common to all Churches, true and false; though not as proper to the true Church? Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, doth not <hi>Bellarmine De Eccles. lib. 3. cap. 2. §. Nostra autem sententia</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting himselfe) put these three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the definition of the Church? and doth hee not by them distinguish the Church from all other sorts of men whatsoeuer? <hi>Professione verae fidei, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentorum communione, subiectione ad proprium Rastorem?</hi> Fiftly, is it not a Maxime of <hi>Bellarmines, lib. 1. de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. in genere cap. 26. §.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:8247:19"/>
The fourth you shall finde pag. 35. to this purpose:
<q>
                  <p>If the Church of Rome cannot demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate it selfe to bee a true Church, then it is no true Church:</p>
                  <p>But it cannot: Ergo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To this many things are to be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; because both propositions are to be denyed: The former, because it is inconsequent: First, because want of demonstration takes not away the truth and true being of any thing; if it did, there are infinite things in the world, which should haue no being, or not be that which they are; euen the Scripture it selfe should not be the word of God, because it cannot be demonstrated so to be, to a naturall man. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause want of ability to make demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, especially of the parties owne being, is much lesse able to doe it: for how many millions of men and women are there in the world, which should cease to be that they are, if that were true? being vtterly vnable to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate themselues so to be? The latter proposition is to be denyed, because it
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:8247:19"/>
is vntrue: for if by demonstration, you meane, the proofe of those three marks mentioned in the Homily; the church of Rome can by them demonstrate her selfe to be a true Church (according to the kinde and proportion of truth) as well as any other Church: And all that will acknowledge her to bee a true Church, will and must acknowledge her to haue the true markes of the true Church, in the same degree of truth, wherein she is acknowledged to bee a true Church.</p>
            <p>But you can proue by two argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that she cannot doe it: First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is constrained to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that all his 15. markes cannot make it euidently true, but onely eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently credible that it is a true Church: I answer, First this is not true; <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> saith no such thing: hee hath not the word <hi>Onely:</hi> but thus he speaketh; <hi>Though they make it not euidently true, yet doe they make it euidently credible:</hi> yea hee distinguisheth betweene Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens which admit not the Scriptures, and Christians which doe; and saith,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:8247:20"/>
that to them it makes them euidently credible; but to these euidently true as well as euidently credible: <hi>Lib. 4. de not is Eccles. cap. 3. §. Dicimus ergo.</hi> This therefore is not good dealing. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this is the same fallacy of arguing <hi>à dicto secundum quid, ad dictum simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer,</hi> wherein you offended afore:
<q>
                  <p>He cannot doe it by these his fifteene markes <hi>(say you:)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ergo, he cannot doe it at all.</p>
               </q>
Is this a good kinde of reasoning? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it argueth his folly, or rather mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in forsaking those markes, which can demonstrate it, and cleaning to those which cannot doe it; but it doth not proue that he cannot doe it by any other meanes.</p>
            <p>In the second place therefore you indeauour to proue it by Romes owne doctrine, and confession: about her bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, (the onely relique (say you) which some suppose is sufficient to proue her a true Church) which is this, <hi>That the efficacy of baptisme depends vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Priests intention: whereof because no man can be certaine, therefore no man
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:8247:20"/>
can bee certaine whether hee were rightly baptised; and so cannot bee certaine that he is a true member of the Church:</hi> From which confession you reason thus:
<q>
                  <p>That which no one Papist can demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, all of them put together can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not demonstrate:</p>
                  <p>But no one of them can demonstrate himselfe to be a true member of the Church: Ergo, not all together.</p>
               </q>
And what the?
<q>
                  <p>That Church whose members either se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally or together cannot demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate themselues to bee members of the true Church, cannot demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate her selfe to be a true Church:</p>
                  <p>But the members of the Church of Rome, neither seuerally, nor toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can doe it:</p>
                  <p>Ergo, She her selfe cannot doe it.</p>
               </q>
That I may giue a full and sufficient an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to this large argument, which is taken from Romes owne doctrine and confession: I must signifie vnto him; that it seemes to me that he knowes not what Romes doctrine and confession in this point is: First therefore hee must
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:8247:21"/>
know, that the Church of Rome hath not yet determined fully what the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Priest in baptising, or of the Bishop in ordaining is: They say indeed, that a virtuall intention is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, without the actuall, or habituall: But what is that virtuall intention? Some say, that the very pronouneing of the words, <hi>I baptise thee, &amp;c.</hi> are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient thereto; <hi>Nec aliud requiri ex par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te ministri,</hi> and that there is no more required on the behalfe of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster: So <hi>Thomas, Part. 3. de Sacr. qu. 64. art. 8. ad</hi> 2. and so <hi>Catharine</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Minori</hi> in the Councell of Trent, held and affirmed: And <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> himselfe though of the contrary opinion, <hi>(viz.</hi> that the inward inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Priest is required) yet is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to distinguish <hi>de perfectione Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramenti; simpliciter, &amp; absolutè; &amp; de perfectione eiusdem coram hominibus:</hi> and so agreeth, that if wee respect the perfection of the Sacrament before men, the outward prolation of the words is sufficient. <hi>Lib. 1. de Sacr. in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere, cap. 28. §. Ad locum obiectum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:8247:21"/>
Secondly, hee must know what cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty it is which the Church of Rome meaneth, when she confesseth that no man can be certaine of the intention of the Priest: for shee distinguisheth of certainty in this case: One is certainty of faith, which is infallible; another humane, and morall; the former shee confesseth cannot ordinarily bee had: but the latter may: which she accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to be sufficient; and this comes full to <hi>Vega;</hi> who denieth infallible certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of saluation; because no man can haue infallible certainty of the truth of his baptisme, for want of the like cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Priests intention: but on the contrary, for morall and coniectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall certainty, he acknowledgeth that a man may and ought to haue it of the Priests intention, (vnlesse hee declare his naughty minde by some outward signe) and so of the truth of his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme; and lastly of his owne saluation. For which distinction see <hi>Bellarmine vbi supra. §. Respondeo, non debere ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These things premised, his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8247:22"/>
are easily answered. First there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Assumption of the last is deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for they professe themselues able to demonstrate both seuerally and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that they are true members of the true Church; because they haue suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent certaintie of the truth of their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme; because they haue a like suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent certaintie of the Priests intent on; leaning secrets vnto God; and so all that is builded hereon, that the Church cannot demonstrate her selfe to bee a true Church, falls flat to the ground; which may also be said of the intention of the Bishop in ordaining. Secondly, how can hee proue the Assumption, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he goe through all the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from man to man, and from wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to woman, and examine what they can say for the truth of their Baptisme. It is twenty to one, but some one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can shew a Reuelation, that the Priest had an actuall intention to doe as the Church doth in baptising him: Thirdly, they say they can say as much to assure them of the Priests intention in their Baptisme, as we which are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:8247:22"/>
in our infancie, can say to assure vs that we were baptised: which is onely the Church booke, and testimonie of our Parents, Godfathers, Godmothers and other friends, which is onely hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, morall &amp; coniecturall assurance, and not diuine and infallible, <hi>See Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine vbi supra. § Et Nota.</hi> So much for the fourth.</p>
            <p>The last Argument <hi>pag.</hi> 32. is this:
<q>
                  <p>That Church which wants the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meanes of saluation, is no true Church:</p>
                  <p>But the Church of Rome wants the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meanes of saluation, the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and hearing of the Gospell: yea it teacheth hers, to hate and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre it, and to call it heresie.</p>
                  <p>Ergo.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I answer they want it, &amp; they want it not: They hate it, and they hate it not: They want and hate the soundnes, and puritie thereof, as it is enioyed in the Reformed Churches; but they neither want nor hate it, as it is corrupted by their owne traditions; which cannot wholly depriue it of all sauing vertue,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:8247:23"/>
as hath been already prooued. And why (I pray) should wee not bee content in common commiseration to beare with them in this case; as we doe with those people which dwell in fenny, foggy &amp; marish grounds, and countries, who comming into places of fresh ayre, and healthy dyet, doe complaine that it is not good nor wholsome, because it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees not with their more grosse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution? If another man liue by poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned meates, I will not enuie him, so long as I feede on that which is sound, and mans meate (as wee say.) And so much for his Arguments.</p>
            <p>Thus haue I shewed <hi>Mr. Burtons</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond point of disorder in misplacing his Arguments; and haue (as well as I can) righted it, and answered them. The third and last followes, which are his idle Repetitions, and Tautologies; which if they were taken out of his booke, it would bee by the one halfe, lesse then it is: as will appeare by the answer to the particulars.</p>
            <p>Now here I must craue fauor of the Christian Reader, that (being constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:8247:23"/>
by the misbehauiour of our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, to lay open his foule ouer-sights, in charging the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> with vntruths, which hee ought not to haue done) hee would not suppose me to be any whit inclining or addicted to Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie (as the manner of the world is now<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a dayes.) No: I praise God I am as farr from Popery, as <hi>M. Burton</hi> himselfe is or can be. But I would not haue men eyther to maintaine bad causes against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or to maintaine good causes with bad arguments, and least of all to maintaine bad causes with worse arguments, (as I know too many haue done to our no little disaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage). It is an excellent point of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to let the enemy haue his vtmost due; and not to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eelie to ouercome him by base and cowardly meanes. This I desire, and haue alwayes endeoured; and this is all which hitherto I haue done in this Treatise, or purpose to doe hereafter. And if the good Reader will be placed to beleeue mee, and to grant me this reasonable motion; I hope hee
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:8247:24"/>
shall perceiue that I haue not abused ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him, or mine aduersary, or my cause, or my <hi>Lord,</hi> (whose cause I haue vndertaken) or my selfe in vndertaking it: and so I proceede.</p>

                  <hi>Before wee proceede to the third Viall, for the fuller confirmation of what hath beene said of the estate of the church of Rome, whose Sea of doctrines is all turned into mortall blood in the second viall: it will bee very requisite here to discusse one question:</hi>

The condition of his owne person, The question affords him two fauourable arguments: One, for that it is requisite to be discussed in this place: Another, for that it is waightie and of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The necessitie of the discussion is for the fuller confirmation of that hee hath said of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And indeede it is very necessary that hee proue, and that very substantially and soundly (as hee saith in the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing) <hi>That the Church of Rome is ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a true, nor a true visible Church;</hi> or else all hee hath said is nor worth a rush.

But marke here (I pray) his Circulation: Before, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to bee no true Church, because all her doctrines are mortall: and now hee proues all her do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines to be mortall, because <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>First, here is a good beginning with a notable point of sophistrie, <hi>ex compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitione dividendorum:</hi> for he confounds two kindes of ignorance, which are as different one from another, as <hi>membra diuidentia</hi> can be: for better vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding whereof, we are to remember, that there are two kindes of ignorance: one negatiue, another priuatiue, (as the Schoolemen speake) The former is the ignorance of that which was neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed; or not reuealed sufficiently to procure distinct knowledge: The latter is the ignorance of that which a man might haue knowne distinctly if hee
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:8247:36"/>
would. These two are commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led simple, &amp; affected ignorance: Simple because a man is alwaies readie to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the knowledge of the truth, when it shall please God to reueale it: Affected, because a man delights in darknesse more then light, that his euill deeds may not be reproued: and both of these may befall the learnedest man in the world: As the former did Saint <hi>Paul</hi> before his conuersion; and some of the Rulers of the Iewes, as Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> testifieth, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 17. and as the latter did other of those Rulers who closed their eyes that they might not see, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 15. Now of these, the Author means the former onely, which is protestant ignorance as well as popish; and the Answerer abuseth him in vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him of the latter; which indeed is true popish ignorance, and no other; for then a man is popishly ignorant, when he pleaseth himselfe in his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and is taught so to doe; and not when hee is willing to know, if hee had the meanes: and who doubteth but there are many millions of such in the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:8247:37"/>
Church of Rome, which are those ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, hee changeth the state of the question; for whereas the Author saith such ignorants may bee saued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong any part of mankind that profess the foundation Christ; that is, in any Christian Church; he turnes it into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Religion professing Christ; which is not the question: for the question is of the Church, and not of the Religion: and from hence he proceeds cunningly to his first question: <hi>Whether any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Here hee diuideth one question into two, and maketh two Authors differ in opinion, which agree in one: And for the first question, it was neuer moued by any thing I can perceiue from his Authors. The question is, Whether any man liuing and dying a Papist, or member of the Church of Rome may be saued; and not, Whether any Papist may be saued by his religion.

                  <p>Loc here is the vpshot of all; this is his strong hold, wherein hee puts his whole trust in this question: And yet (God knowes) it is but a meere starting hole; as poore a shift, and euasion, as euer man can vse. Here then let it be

obserued, that hee vseth two points of Sophistry, and one of Folly: of Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, first in the word <hi>Papist;</hi> secondly, in the word <hi>renouncing.</hi> The word <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist</hi> is ambiguous, sometime it is vsed <hi>sensu composito,</hi> (as the Schoolemen speake) or largely: sometimes <hi>sensu di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viso,</hi> or strictly. In the compound sense it signifieth (to inuert the words of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins)</hi> an vnreformed Catholike, that is, one that holds the same necessary heads of Religion with the Protestant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; yet so as he retaines all errours in doctrine, whereby the said religion is corrupted in the Church of Rome, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly supposing them to bee the truth of God. In the diuided sense it fignifies one that holds the errours of the Church of Rome, without respect to the orthodoxe truth maintained therein. Now to apply this to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; when wee say a papist may bee saued, wee vnderstand it in the former &amp; more large sense. And when the saith; a papist cannot be faued, he vnderstands it in the latter, and more strict sense, and so we are all agreed: for as a theefe,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:8247:43"/>
or a murderer, or any other malefactor cannot be saued, as he is such a one; no more can a Papist as hee holdeth his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours: for no vncleane thing shall enter into the kingdome of heauen: this is the former point of his sophistrie.</p>
                  <p>The other is in the word <hi>renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing:</hi> For there are two kindes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing: One actuall and expresse; another virtuall, and infolded. The actuall is when a man doth both in word and practice separate himselfe from the religion of the Church of Rome. The virtuall is, when in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of minde, a man is ready to doc it, so soone as it shall appeare to him to be sinfull and damnable: when there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he requireth that a Papist that must be saued should renounce his popery; if he vnderstand the actuall renouncing thereof, we acknowledge that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary so soone as hee shall know, and be conuicted of the euill of Popery: but if he neuer be conuicted thereof so long as he liueth; then we say the virtuall is sufficient, which is included in generall repentance: otherwise, wee must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:8247:44"/>
sinnes knowne with vnknowne, and generall repentance with particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: This being considered, a man may easily perceiue how a simple ignorant Papist, whether learned or vnlearned, may bee said to renounce his poperie, and to be saued; though he liue and die in the communion of that faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. So much for Sophistry.</p>
                  <p>Now his folly appeareth in this, that he would haue us to hold, that a Papist (which we say, may be iaued by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall faith and repentance) is saued as a Papist by vertue of his Popish igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, idolatry, and other trumpery, and not as a true beleeuer by faith in Christs merits: And that wee would haue some Godamercy to be giuen to Popery, or silly ignorance for his salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which ought to be so farre from the conceit of any well disposed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, that all of vs must acknowledge, that no Protestant, as a Protestant (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with the corruptions of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Churches, Dutch, French, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, or the rest; none of which are free from some enormities) No Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:8247:44"/>
(I say) as a Protestant, can bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, without this generall faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, so as there can be no God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercy giuen to our Protestancy, but onely to faith in Christs merits, by which we come to be saued, not as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, but as true beleeuers, renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the corruptions of seuerall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: And so a Protestant liuing and dying a Protestant, may bee damned; and a Papist liuing and dying a Papist may be saued.</p>

And this diuorce on Christs part, came to bee of force vpon the Councell of Trent; when the Church of Romes se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond mariage was solemnly concluded, and Christ excluded: what need be said more; to proue this Diuorce, and that on both sides?</hi>

                  <p>What need bee said more? (quoth you?) marry much more then either you haue said yet, or euer will bee able to say, I trow: what is it (I pray) you haue said now, that you need to say no more? Is it this? That Rome, and the Romane Church is the whore of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon? Wee allow it: Or that Christ would haue his people to separate from her? we grant it: But that the Church of Rome was maried to a second hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in the Councel of Trent, &amp; Christ excluded; or that those words, <hi>Come out of her my people,</hi> are a bill of diuorce; or that Christ by them separateth his
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:8247:53"/>
Spouse from her, we vtterly deny. To the first enough hath beene said in the last answer. To the second wee say, first that (if <hi>Brightman</hi> your best master say true,) this place must not be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood spiritually, but literally, of the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call departure of Gods people out of Rome, and Gods calling them thereto at the last ouerthrow and destruction thereof, as he called <hi>Lot</hi> out of Sodom, and the Iewes out of the Easterne Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon in the same words, &amp; the Church out of Ierusalem when it was to be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly destroyed; so that as Mice (I vse his owne similitude) perceiuing the house will fall, doe leaue it, and runne away; so the people of God warned by the Angell will leaue Rome, and shift for themselues: which being so, this Prophesie is not yet fulfilled. Secondly, if it be taken spiritually, it is so far from prouing a diuorce, that it proueth the quite contrary: for first, so long as Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon hath a being, this euocation will bee of vse and force, because so long God shall haue a people in Babylon; and so long there can bee no diuorce,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:8247:53"/>
because God begets not children of any, but of his Spouse the Church: Secondly, these words declare not what Christ himselfe either doth or will doe, but what hee would haue his people to doe: Now a Diuorce is not a separation of the Familie from the Mother, or Mistris, but of the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band from the wife; Ergo, here is no Diuorce intended. To the third, we say, that seeing the wife is the whore, and the whore is Babylon; Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth not here to separate his Wife or Spouse from Babylon; because in so doing he should separate his wife from his wife, and Babylon from Babylon, which implies a contradiction.</p>

                  <p>You abuse your selfe and the Reader too bad, and that in two things: First, in blaming the distinction: Secondly, in scandalizing your Author. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction (you say) comes too late, and is not vseful to ioyne vs together again

The latter dependeth vpon the scandals of the Author; for the better vnderstanding whereof wee are to know, That the reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches neuer made a full, and totall sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the Church of Rome; but onely partiall, from her corruptions; <hi>Non tam ab ea, quam ab eius erroribus discessimus,</hi> saith <hi>Iewel</hi> in his Apologie, which is the common voice of all, euen of <hi>Perkins</hi> himselfe in his <hi>Reformed Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike,</hi> who sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:8247:55"/>
to endeuour it by this distinction. For it would be all one as if hee should say, <hi>As she is a visible Church, wee may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with her in her corruptions; But as she is Babylon we may not.</hi> Which is indeede the folly which hee illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth by his two similitudes of societie with a strumpet and the deuill.

                  <p>You said so indeed, but you shewed it not: yet if they haue the shell, that is the outward profession of the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion directly, it is enough to make them be said to hold the foundation directly.</p>

                  <p>They doe, if your selfe say true: for you say, that <hi>To hold the foundation di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, is to hold Iesus Christ so to be come in the slesh, as therein to suffer and satisfie for our saluation; becomming our Christ, our Iesus, redeeming vs from our sinnes by imputing his merits to vs, that our sins might not be imputed to vs which were imputed to him: by whose stripes wee are healed, by whose righteousnesse imputed wee are perfectly iustified in the sight of God:</hi> And all, and euery point of this, the Church of Rome directly holdeth.</p>

                  <p>I might here challenge you for alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and changing the words of the Councell; but I will not take all aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages: I answer therefore, that it seems you know not the true meaning of the Councell; for taking the word <hi>Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> in the Councels owne sense, this Canon containes very sound and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian doctrine. What then doth it mean by Iustification? A compound of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Iustification, and Sanctification: for so it defines Iustification, <hi>cap.</hi> 7. of this Session in the first words: <hi>Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia est, non sola peccatorum remissio, sed &amp; sanctificatio, &amp; renouatio interioris ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis per voluntariam susceptionem gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae &amp; donorum:</hi> and so the true sense and meaning of the Canon is this: <hi>If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man shall say, that men are so iustified by the sole imputation of Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, or by sole remission of sinnes, that they are also sanctified thereby without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent grace and charity; or also that the grace whereby wee are so iustified is onely the fauour of God, Let him bee accursed:</hi> and let him be so indeed for me. You

will say this is nothing but meere iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: I grant it; but it is not direct de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall of the foundation: for here (as <hi>Chemnitius</hi> acknowledgeth) is both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes, and imputation of Christs righteousnesse included; which though it be sufficient to iustification in the Protestant sense, yet in the popish sense (wherein sanctification is also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired) it is not sufficient.</p>
