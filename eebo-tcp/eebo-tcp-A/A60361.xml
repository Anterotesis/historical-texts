         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>It is objected out of that saying, This day thou shalt be with me in Paradise, spoken to the thiefe on the Crosse, that therefore he was not in hell: But the answer most plaine, both that of Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> that he filleth all places, Heaven, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, and hell, and no place free from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, as before, and so, as he was God, with him in Paradise, or Heaven, in regard of his divinity, as in his Epistle, 57. <hi>ad Dardanum.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. That the faith and obedience of men may hereby be exercised more particularly in setting themselves apart from worldly businesse, what haste soever, and dedicate themselves, and this time holy to the Lord.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. That love and charity, and all graces were encreased by publicke teaching the duties requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and reproving the vices as it is done by Gods word preached, then whereby the good and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous encouraged, the vitious shamed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That Gods service and publicke worship may be thus upheld, that else were like to decay, if men left to private devotions had not such pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke meetings, some forgetting, others nelecting all duty, and most that did not, ignorantly or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitiously performing the same.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That more acceptable service to God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, when prayer, and holy duties so pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickely exercised by all, as many brands making a great flame, so the prayers of many with greater fervency ascending up to God, and every good servant of his more enflamed by joyning with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in these holy duties.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That it may be for rest to the very servants and cattle, that else groning under their yoake may be too much grieved by unmercifull minded masters, without relaxation.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That it may be a difference between Gods servants, and the heathen that know not God, by such sanctifying the Sabbath, and so be a signe to us of that eternall Sabbath, and rest in Heaven, wherein as we are taught we may meditate, how with Saints and Angels, we all doe enjoy Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath

our hearts to the keeping of it, added to the end of it, as well as of the other Commandements, if it be not punctually in all respects as they to bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood? The answer is plaine, from that before taught, that it is so added, for that part of it, that it agreeth in with them, for the morality of it, so far as that extends, which is, as it is now by the Church enjoyned, it being as we see in all points so fully by the Church delivered, demonstrated, and explained, how farre it is morall, and how and in what manner it is in force, and by us to be observed. Nor boots it them to say, Why was the time so punctually commanded, and determined, more then the place, (both circumstances being equally materiall to the worship) if not wholly morall, in the Commandement, and so, precisely and punctually to be observed; for that it appeares the time was present, and in their power to observe it, and so determined, (besides that, that it was a signe to difference them from other nations, then appointed) whereas the place that was to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, was not yet attained unto, as appeares by that so often repeated in the Law, When you shall come to the place which the Lord your God shall chuse, to put his name there, <hi>viz.</hi> the Temple at Jerusalem, in Canaan, they being then in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse, or at most, the plaines of Moab: but had the Temple as well as the Sabbath beene there expresly mentioned, and determined, yet both Temple and Sabbath being in effect for that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular but types and shadowes of better things to come, with other ceremonies of servitude, and legall observances, then and there to be performed, were to expire in the Messias, so farre as they were

types and shadowes, and so have already had their solemne funerals and obsequies, as dead and buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and new in their roomes substituted; but as the appointing other feasts and Sabbaths, both by God himselfe, as well as the Iewes Church, besides this seventh the Lords Sabbath, and other houses of prayer, their Synagogues, besides the Temple, even whiles the Temple stood, as well as since, were held no breach of the Commandements, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, rather inlargement, and illustration of either, in making the worship and duties more publique and generall, or for satisfaction and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of the neglects in the due observation, visiting, and sanctification of them, that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; so the Christian Sabbath, and Churches, thus substituted, and succeeding the former, and in place of them, might well bee accounted no breach, but enlargement of the Commandements, with the dispensation and illustration of Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in more ample manner and measure, shewed and bestowed on the whole world, the duties made more publique, and illustrations, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality more illustrated by it.</p>

And thus we see how the strict observances, servitude, and legall types, doe not concerne us, or our Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, nor in all respects, and circumstances to bee pressed on us, as some prone to Judaizing, have done; yet, though not the ceremony, the morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to us fully extended, and the Commandement, though not literally and punctually in all points by us to be observed, nor our Christians Sabbath so in it expressed, yet expresly included, for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and all due observance, virtually intended; whence what is done, is so done, and on so good grounds, by the Church, that were it to doe again, the order and change of what is therein changed, the Church could well doe no other then as is therein already established; so little reason have our Novellists in their clamours raised against it, and study of contradiction: and thus much of the scruples cast in the way concerning the same; it followes how wee Christianly ought to celebrate it, and conceive of it in the rest, and true sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it.</p>

                  <p>For that it is defined by some to be an holy Coloquy, or Dialogue betweene God and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout soule, yea Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> tearmes prayer <hi>animam animae,</hi> the soule of a Christian soule, for as the soule is most essentiall part of man, so is prayer of a Christian, and as the reasonable soule puts a difference betweene a man and a brute beast, so doth prayer betweene a true Christian and a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:106287:389"/>
and Saint <hi>Bafil</hi> fitly resembles prayer to a chaine of gold, where with the care of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe is as it were tyed to the tongue of man; for whereas Gods seat is in heaven, whence all grace and goodnesse distills, and mans upon earth which is but a sinke of sinne, and valley of tears, there is no other chaine to linke God and man to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether more closely then this of prayer.</p>
                  <p>And that this combines them it is plaine, as a Christian in the 9. of the <hi>Acts</hi> is described by this periphrasis, that he call upon the name of the Lord, so God himselfe (in the 65. Psalme) is des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed by another equivalent unto it, for he is still the hearer of prayers, <hi>O thou that art the hearer of praiers to thee shall all flesh come.</hi> Secondly, we read in 141. <hi>Psal.</hi> is called a sacrifice, and that of incense, <hi>Let my prayers come before thee as incense, and the lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of my hands as an evening sacrifice.</hi> The sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of incense being as well pleasing unto God under the law, and therefore called the sweet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense in <hi>Numb.</hi> 4. and there was appointed an altar of gold for it in <hi>Exod.</hi> 40. and this is mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized in prayer, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. where we see an Angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, and there was given unto him much incense that he should offer it with the prayers of all Saints upon the golden Altar which was before the Throne; marke how for the sweet incense of prayer there was provided a golden censer and a golden Altar, and an Angell to offer it, what greater honour can a mortall man, who is but dust and ashes, as <hi>Abraham</hi> himselfe acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, attaine unto then to be admitted to friendly and familiar conference even with God himselfe
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:106287:390"/>
thus obtained by prayer? And thirdly, if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Kingdome of Heaven to a Palace or Princely Mansion house, as our Saviour doth, <hi>John</hi> 14. then is Christ himselfe the only ready way conducting to this Palace, so he calls himselfe in the 6. verse of that Chapter, where he saith, <hi>Ego sum via &amp;c.</hi> I am the way, and as Christ is the right way that leads to life, so faith (apprehending him) is as it were the doore opening to this way, and so called <hi>Acts</hi> 14. <hi>Ostium fidei,</hi> the doore of faith, and as faith is the doore, so the word of God, and the knowledge of the same, is as it were the key that opens this doore so named, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. <hi>cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus scientiae,</hi> the key of knowledge, and as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is the key, so is prayer as it were the ring or hammer wherewith we knocke, the very terme being used <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. where our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our exhorting unto prayer, saith, <hi>pulsate,</hi> knock and it shall be opened; which may teach all Christians to take this hammer of prayer, and therewith knocke, and call upon God that he would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with the key of knowledge to open the doore of faith, that so they may have entrance by the way of life into the Palace and Paradise of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.

prayer as a conduit pipe to conveigh the sweete and saving streames thereof unto your souls.

                  <head>How then more shown the force and efficacie of praier?</head>
                  <p>Many excellent things are spoken in Scripture to set forth the power of prayer, as that it both shuts &amp; opens heaven; for <hi>Elizeus</hi> was a man sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to like passions, saith <hi>James,</hi> as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not raine, and it rained not on the earth for the space of three yeares and six monthes, and he prayed again, and the heaven gave raine, &amp;c. yea prayer commands the whole host of heaven, for at <hi>Josuahs</hi> prayer the Sunne stood still in the valley of Gibeon, and the Moone in the valley of Ajalon; prayer hath staid the fury of fire, and hath made iron swim upon the water; prayer hath made the barren wombe fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as in <hi>Luke</hi> 1. <hi>Zacharie</hi> thy prayer is heard, and thy wise <hi>Elizabeth</hi> shall conceive and beare a sonne; prayer cures the sicknesse of the body, as <hi>James</hi> 5. <hi>Is any man sicke let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray for him, and the prayer of faith shall save the sicke;</hi> and prayer cures the sins of the soule too, as <hi>David,</hi> the publican, the theefe
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:106287:391"/>
upon the Crosse, and many others, who as soone as they prayed were pardoned; to passe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a world of instances, the singular power of prayer may be discovered to the full, if you will ascend but these three degrees, first, that which subdues all slesh living, <hi>viz.</hi> death, yeelds notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to the force of prayer, seen in the Shuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites childe, <hi>Lazarus,</hi> the widowes sonne of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repta, the Rulers daughter, and some others, who by the vertue of prayer have beene raised from death, and restored to life. Secondly, the Divell who in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. is said to have the power of death, is not withstanding vanquished, sometimes by the power of prayer, as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. where our Saviour saith expresly, this kinde of Divells goe not out save by prayer and fasting, not by fasting alone, for fasting without prayer is but an image of holinesse, and picture of hunger, but it is prayer quickned with fasting that must do it. Thirdly, and lastly, God himselfe (who hath power over death and the Divell) is after a sort overcome by prayer else why doth he call to <hi>Moses Exod.</hi> 32. to let him alone, it seems that the fervent praier of <hi>Moses</hi> at that time did not only <hi>vincere</hi> but <hi>vincire,</hi> after a manner bind Gods hands, and so hinder him from pouring the viols of his wrath upon the people; so in <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. the Patriarch <hi>Jacob</hi> by wrestling pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed against an Angel, which the Prophet <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sea</hi> expounds of the power of prayer, not to think that his bodily strength could prevaile, but the truth is, as the Prophet speakes, by prayers and tears he had power over the Angel, and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called Israel, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> aluding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto in <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. useth the very phrase, <hi>Now I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech</hi>
