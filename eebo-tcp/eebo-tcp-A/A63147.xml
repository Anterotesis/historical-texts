            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
Tryal and Condemnation
OF
Mr. Will. Staley
A
PAPIST.</head>
            <p>THis Perſon that now received
Tryal, was by Trade a Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith,
and by Profeſſion, as to
Religion, a <hi>Papiſt.</hi> He had
been bred a conſiderable part of his time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Seas, and there, 'tis fear'd, by too
much familiarity with the Jeſuits, had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bib'd
ſome of their deſperate <hi>Principles.</hi> The
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54621:3"/>
Sum of the matter upon proof againſt him,
appeared to be thus:</p>
            <p>Three Gentlemen that by their Garb,
Behaviour, and teſtimony of divers that
knew them, appeared to be Perſons of
Worth and unreproachable Credit, gave E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
againſt him, That upon the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
day of this inſtant <hi>November,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at a Cooks ſhop in the Pariſh of St.
<hi>Gileſes,</hi> the Priſoner at Bar was with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man in a Room oppoſite to that they
were in; and the door being open, they
had a perfect ſight of the Priſoner, and were
not above eight foot or thereabouts diſtant
from him, when they ſtood at their door:
And that the Priſoner being diſcourſing with
the old man that was with him, the old man
ſaid in <hi>French,</hi> That the King of <hi>England</hi>
was a great Perſecutor or Tormentor of the
people of God (meaning, as we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
<hi>Papiſts).</hi> In anſwer to which,
the Priſoner at Bar, ſtamping with his
foot ſeveral times, and appearing to be in
paſſion, ſaid (likewiſe in <hi>French)</hi> words too
inſolent and malicious to be repeated and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54621:3"/>
tranſlated. <hi>And</hi> (ſtretching forth his Arm,
and then clapping his Hand on his Breaſt)
ſpeaking of His Sacred Majeſty, ſaid, <hi>I my ſelf
will kill him.</hi> And that afterwards they heard
him ſay, <hi>That the King and Parliament thought
the buſineſs</hi> (meaning the Plot) <hi>was over,
but the Rogues</hi> (ſo this Villain was pleaſed
to call them) <hi>were miſtaken.</hi> Two of theſe
three Gentlemen well underſtood <hi>French,</hi>
but the third did not: however, the other
two at the ſame inſtant expreſs'd their Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
by telling him, with much commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Zeal, that the perſon in the next Room
ſpoke moſt deteſtable <hi>Treaſon,</hi> and that they
could not endure to hear it, repeating the
ſenſe of their words in Engliſh: And as for
the words <hi>Le Roy d'Angleterre,</hi> though he
underſtood not the Language, now depoſed,
he perfectly heard as well as they. But none
of the three at that time knowing the now
Priſoner, nor having to their knowledg ever
ſeen him before, and he with his Companion
juſt upon ſpeaking the aforeſaid words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about going, one of the Witneſſes watcht
him to the place where he went unto, being
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54621:4"/>
his Father's Houſe, and upon enquiry learn'd
his name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That next morning they
came thither, and upon colour of buying
ſomething, carried him to the Croſs-keys Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
over againſt his Dwelling; where they
ſtaid three hours or thereabouts, whilſt one
of them went to ſeek, and could not in all
that time procure a Conſtable, becauſe he
had no Warrant from a Juſtice. But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
at laſt got ſome from the Guard at
<hi>White-hall,</hi> and a Conſtable, they ſeiz'd
him; and after Examination, he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
firſt to the Gatehouſe, and afterwards
ſent to Newgate; from whence he was now
with a ſtrong Guard conducted, having on
the day before been Arraigned.</p>
            <p>He had the honour to have a moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Jury, moſt of them Knights and Squires,
all Gentlemen of Quality: Nor had ever
man a more fair and equal Hearing; but the
Defence that he made was frivolous; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
alledging that the diſtance between
him and the Witneſſes was greater, yet own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that the Door was not ſhut. He alſo
much inſiſted that they miſtook the <hi>French</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:54621:4"/>
words he ſpoke; and whereas they rendred
it in Engliſh, <hi>I my ſelf would kill him,</hi> he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
that he meant and ſaid, <hi>I would kill
my ſelf.</hi> But as well the Witneſſes teſtimony,
as the ſenſe of the foregoing and ſubſequent
Diſcourſe took off that evaſion. He further
pretended that the Old man (whom he ſaid
was one of his Workmen) did not ſpeak
<hi>French,</hi> but a <hi>Jargon,</hi> or kind of <hi>Italian;</hi> but
the two Witneſſes being queſtioned to that,
abſolutely diſproved it, affirming what was
then ſpoken was <hi>French,</hi> and that they well
underſtood it; and ſeveral times repeated
the very words both <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
thereof in Court. And beſides, though it
was aſſerted that the Priſoner was offered to
have what perſon he had occaſion for ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
to attend at his Tryal; and that a
Gentleman was ſo kind, as to go to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
Fathers Houſe with a note of ſeveral
perſons names that he <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

Old man that was with him at the time
of ſpeaking the Words, and notice was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
thereof to one of their Agents; yet the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54621:5"/>
aforeſaid Old man, who it ſeems was a kind
of <hi>Italian,</hi> did not think fit to appear; ſo
that upon a full diſcuſſion of all that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
had to ſay, the Crime appeared ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently
proved, upon the Statute made in
the Reign of our preſent Soveraign for the
preſervation of his Royal Perſon, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
withdrawing from the Bar, the Jury
