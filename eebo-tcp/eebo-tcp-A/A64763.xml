            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Look on this life as

Heaven</hi> hath <hi>in</hi>
it a Scaene of <hi>Earth;</hi>
and had she bin contented with <hi>Ideas,</hi>
she had not travelled beyond the <hi>Map.</hi>
But <hi>excellent patterns</hi> commend their
<hi>Mimes: Nature</hi> that was <hi>so fair</hi> in the
<hi>type,</hi> could not be a <hi>slut</hi> in the <hi>Ann<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyph.</hi>
This makes her <hi>ramble</hi> hither to
examine the <hi>Medall</hi> by the <hi>Flask,</hi> but
whiles she <hi>scanns</hi> their <hi>Symmetrie,</hi> she
<hi>formes it.</hi> Thus her <hi>descent</hi> speaks her
<hi>Original</hi>: God in <hi>love</hi> with his <hi>own
beauty</hi> frames a <hi>Glasse</hi> to view it by <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection;</hi>
but the <hi>frailety</hi> of the matter
<pb facs="tcp:115878:5"/>
excluding <hi>Eternity,</hi> the <hi>composure</hi> was
subject to <hi>dissolution.</hi> Ignorance gave
this <hi>release</hi> the Name of <hi>Death,</hi> but
properly it is the <hi>Soules Birth,</hi> and a
<hi>Charter</hi> that makes for her <hi>Liberty</hi>;
she hath severall wayes to <hi>break up
house,</hi> but her <hi>best</hi> is <hi>without a disease.</hi>
This is her <hi>mysticall walk,</hi> an <hi>Exit</hi> only
to <hi>return.</hi> When she takes <hi>air</hi> at this
<hi>door,</hi> it is without <hi>prejudice</hi> to her <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement.</hi>
The <hi>Magicians</hi> tell me, <hi>Anima
unius Entis egreditur, &amp; aliud ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi>
Some have examin'd <hi>this,</hi> and <hi>state</hi>
it an <hi>Expence of Influences,</hi> as if the
<hi>Soul</hi> exercised her <hi>Royalty</hi> at the <hi>eye,</hi> or
had some <hi>blinde Jurisdiction</hi> in <hi>the
pores.</hi> But this is to <hi>measure Magicall
Positions</hi> by the <hi>slight, superficial stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures</hi>
of <hi>the common Philosophy.</hi> It is an
<hi>age</hi> of <hi>Intellectuall slaveries</hi>; If they
meet any thing <hi>extraordinary,</hi> they
<hi>prune</hi> it commonly with <hi>distinctions,</hi> or
<hi>dawb</hi> it with <hi>false Glosses,</hi> till it looks

               <hi>followers</hi> are so <hi>confident</hi> of his <hi>principles</hi>
they seek not to <hi>understand</hi> what <hi>others

tells us of <hi>leaving the first prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of the Doctrine of Christ, and going
on to perfection: Not laying again the
foundation of Repentance from dead
works, and of faith towards God; of the
Doctrine of Baptism, and laying on of
Hands, of Resurrection, and the eternall
Judgement</hi>; Then he speaks of <hi>Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
of <hi>Tasting of the Heavenly gift,
of being partakers of the Holy Ghost, of
Tasting of the good word of God, and tho
powers of the world to come.</hi> Now if I

            <p>WHEN I found out this
<hi>Trueth,</hi> That <hi>Man in
his Originall was a
Branch planted in God</hi>
and that there was a
continuall <hi>Influxe</hi> from
the <hi>Stock</hi> to the <hi>Sion,</hi> I
was much troubl'd at his
<hi>Corruptions,</hi> and wonder'd his <hi>Fruits</hi> were not
<hi>correspondent</hi> to his <hi>Roote.</hi> But when I was told
he had tasted of an other <hi>Tree,</hi> my admiration
was quickly off, it being my chiefe care to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce</hi>
him to his <hi>first Simplicitie,</hi> and separate
his <hi>Mixtures</hi> of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evill.</hi> But his <hi>Fall</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:115878:10"/>
had so bruised him in his <hi>best part.</hi> that his
Soule had no knowledge left to study him a
<hi>Cure,</hi> his Punishment presently followed his
<note place="margin">C. Agrip. de vanit. Scient.</note>Trespasse: <hi>Velata sunt omnia, intra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitq
oblivio mater ignorantiae.</hi> This
<hi>Lethe</hi> remained not, in his body, but
<hi>passing</hi> together with his <hi>Nature,</hi>
made his Posterity her <hi>Channell. Imperfection's</hi>
an easy <hi>inheritance,</hi> but Vertue seldome finds
any Heires. <hi>Man</hi> had at the first, and so have
all Souls before their Intrance into the body, an
<hi>Explicite methodicall knowledge,</hi> but they are
no sooner <hi>Vessel'd</hi> but that Liberty is lost, and
nothing remaines but a Vast confused <hi>Notion</hi>
of the <hi>Creature,</hi> Thus had I only left a Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
without Power, and a Will to doe that,
which was far enough above me. In this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity
I studied severall <hi>Arts,</hi> and ramel'd
over all those <hi>Inventions</hi> which the folly of
man call'd <hi>Sciences;</hi> But these endeavours sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
not to my purpose, I quitted this <hi>Booke-bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse,</hi>
and thought it a better course to study
<hi>Nature</hi> then <hi>Opinion.</hi> Hereupon I considered
with my selfe, that man was not the <hi>Primitive
immediate worke of God,</hi> but the <hi>World,</hi> out of
which he was made. And to regulate my stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
in point of <hi>Methode,</hi> I judg'd it conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to examine his <hi>Principles</hi> first, and not <hi>him.</hi>
But the World in generall being too large for
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115878:10"/>
               <hi>Inquisition,</hi> I resolv'd to take Part for the
Whole, and to give a guesse at the <hi>Frame</hi> by
<hi>Proportion.</hi> To perfect this my <hi>Essay,</hi> I tooke
to task the Fruits of one Spring: Here I obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a great many <hi>Vegetables fresh</hi> and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in their <hi>Time,</hi> but when I looked back on
their <hi>Original,</hi> they were no such things as <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables.</hi>
This <hi>Observation</hi> I apply'd to the
<hi>World,</hi> and gained by it this <hi>Inference:</hi> That
<hi>the World in the beginning was no such thing
as it is,</hi> but <hi>some other seed</hi> or <hi>matter</hi> out of
which that <hi>Fabrick</hi> which I now behold, did
arise. But resting not here, I drove my <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
further;</hi> I conceav'd those seeds whereof
<hi>Vegetables</hi> did spring, must be something else at
first then <hi>Seeds,</hi> as having some <hi>praeexistent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
wherof they were made, but what that <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
should be I could not guesse. Here was I
forc'd to leave off <hi>Speculation,</hi> and come up to
<hi>Experience.</hi> Whiles I sought the World, I
went beyond it, and I was now in Quest of a
<hi>Substance,</hi> which without Art I could not see.
Nature wrapps this most strangly in her very
bosome, neither doth she expose it to any thing
but her <hi>own Vitall Caelestiall Breath.</hi> But in
respect that God Almighty is the onely proper
immediate. <hi>Agent</hi> which actuates this <hi>matter,</hi>
as well in the work of <hi>Generation,</hi> as formerly
in his <hi>Creation,</hi> it will not be amisse to speak
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115878:11"/>
something of Him, that we may know the
<hi>Cause</hi> by his <hi>Creatures,</hi> and the <hi>Creatures</hi>
by their <hi>Cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <l>My <hi>God,</hi> my <hi>Life!</hi> whose <hi>Essence</hi> man</l>

            </l>
            <p>It is Gods own positive truth: <hi>In the
Beginning</hi> That is, In that <hi>dead silence,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esdr.</note>
In that <hi>horrible &amp; empty Darknes</hi> when
<hi>as yet</hi> nothing was <hi>fashioned,</hi> then (saith the lord)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115878:11"/>
               <hi>did I consider those things, and they all were
made through me alone, and through non other,
By me also shall they be ended and by none other.</hi>
That <hi>Meditation</hi> forerunns every Solemne
Worke, is a thing so well knowne to man, that
he needs no further Demonstration of it then
his owne <hi>Practice:</hi> That there is also in God
something <hi>Analogicall</hi> to <hi>it</hi> from <hi>whence</hi> Man
derived this Customary Notion of his; As it is
most agreeable to Reason, so withall is it very
sutable to Providence.<hi>Dij</hi> (saith <hi>I amblicus</hi>)
<hi>concipiunt in se totum opus, antequam parturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt.</hi>
And the Spirit here to <hi>Esdras, Then did
I consider these things, He consider'd them
first and made them afterwards.</hi> God in his AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<hi>Idea,</hi> foresaw <hi>That</hi> whereof as yet
there was no <hi>Materiall Copy:</hi> The goodnes and
Beauty of the one, mov'd him to create the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and truly the Image of this <hi>Prototype</hi>
being imbosom'd in the <hi>Second</hi> made Him so
much in love with his <hi>Creature,</hi> that when
Sin had defac'd it, He restor'd it by the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that <hi>Patterne</hi> by which at first it was
made. <hi>Dyonisius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite,</hi> who liv'd in
the Primitive Times, and received the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Divinity immediately from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
stiles God the Father, sometimes <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
Divinitatis,</hi> somtimes <hi>Occultum illud Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
substantiale</hi> and elsewhere he compares him
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115878:12"/>
to a <hi>Roote,</hi> whose <hi>Flowers</hi> are the <hi>Second</hi> and
<hi>Third Person.</hi> This is true; For God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is the <hi>Basis</hi> or supernaturall Foundation of
his <hi>Creatures.</hi> God the Son, is the <hi>Patterne</hi> in
whose expresse Image they were made: And
God the Holy Ghost is <hi>Spiritus Opifea,</hi> or the
Agent, who fram'd the <hi>creature</hi> in a just <hi>sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrie</hi>
to his <hi>Type.</hi> This Consideration or <hi>type</hi>
God hath since used in the performance of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
works.</hi> Thus in the Institution of his
Temple he commands <hi>Moses</hi> to the <hi>Mount,</hi>
where the Divine Spirit shews him the <hi>Idea</hi>
of the future <hi>Fabrick; And let them</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod.</note>
               <hi>make me a Sanctuary that I may dwell
amongst them, according to all that I
shew thee, after the patterne of the Tabernacle, &amp;
the pattern of all the Instruments thereof, even
so shall you make it.</hi> Thus the <hi>Divine mind</hi> doth
instruct us <hi>porrigendo Ideas quadam extensione
fui extra se,</hi> and sometimes more particularly
in <hi>dreames.</hi> To <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> he presents a
<hi>Tree strong and high, reaching to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
and the sight thereof to the ends of the
Earth.</hi> To <hi>Pharaoh</hi> he shews <hi>seven Ears of
Corne.</hi> To <hi>Joseph</hi> he appears in <hi>sheafes,</hi> and then
resembles the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars.</hi> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
he may expresse himselfe by what he will,
for in him are <hi>innumerable, eternall Prototypes,</hi>
and he is the true Fountaine. and Treasure of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115878:12"/>
               <hi>Forms.</hi> But that we may come at last to the
scope proposed: <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> is the <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physicall,
supercelestiall Sun,</hi> The <hi>second Person</hi>
is the <hi>light,</hi> and the <hi>Third</hi> is <hi>Amor igneus,</hi> or a
<hi>Divine heate</hi> proceeding from <hi>Both.</hi> Now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the <hi>presence</hi> of this <hi>Heate</hi> there is no <hi>Rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi>
of the <hi>Light,</hi> and by Consequence no <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux</hi>
from the Father of <hi>Lights.</hi> For this <hi>Amor</hi>
is the <hi>Medium</hi> which <hi>unites</hi> the <hi>Lover</hi> to that
which is <hi>beloved,</hi> &amp; probably tis the <hi>Platonicks

and the <hi>first Emanation</hi> was that of the

we read that <hi>Darknesse was upon the sace

upon the face of the waters.</hi> Here you are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<hi>that notwithstanding</hi> this <hi>processe of the

on the <hi>face</hi> of the <hi>deep, Illumination</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
being the <hi>Office</hi> of the <hi>second.</hi> wherefore
<hi>God</hi> also, when the matter was prepared by
<hi>Love</hi> for <hi>Light,</hi> gives out his <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> which
was no <hi>Creation</hi> as most think, but an <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
of the <hi>Word,</hi> in whom was <hi>life,</hi> and that
<hi>life</hi> is the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>Men.</hi> This is that <hi>light</hi>
whereof Saint <hi>John</hi> speaks, <hi>that it shines in the
darknesse, and the darknesse comprehended it
not.</hi> But lest I seem to be singular in this point,
I will give you more evidence. <hi>Pimandras</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
<hi>Trismegistus</hi> in the <hi>work</hi> of the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
tells him the self-same thing. <hi>Lumen illud

but the <hi>Idea,</hi> or Pattern of the whole Material
World appeared in those <hi>primitive waters like</hi>
an <hi>Image</hi> in a <hi>Glasse:</hi> by this Pattern it was
that the Holy Ghost fram'd and modelled the
Universal Structure. This Mystery or appearance
of the <hi>Idea</hi> is excellently manifested in the
<hi>Magicall Analysis</hi> of Bodies; (For he that
knows how to imitate the <hi>Proto-Chymistrie</hi> of
the Spirit by Separation of the Principles where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Life is Imprisoned, may see the Impresse

there is a twofold <hi>Idea:</hi> Divine, and
Naturall. The Naturall is a fiery, invisible, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
Spirit, and properly a meer Inclosure, or

called it <hi>Nimbus Numinis Descendentis. Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roaster,</hi>

<hi>Anima Mundi,</hi> but by their leave they are

and <hi>Spiritus.</hi> But the <hi>Idea</hi> I speak of here,
is the true primitive exemplar one, and a pure
Influence of the Almighty. This <hi>Idea</hi> before the
<hi>Coagulation</hi> of the <hi>seminall principles</hi> to a

<hi>Generation,</hi> impresseth in the Vitall Ethereall
Principles a Modell, or Pattern after which the
<hi>Body</hi> is to be framed, and this is the first inward
production, or Draught of the Creature. This
is it which the <hi>Divine Spirit</hi> intimates to us in
that Scripture where he saith, <hi>That God</hi>

               <hi>Created every plant of the field before it

part</hi> of the <hi>Creation.</hi> I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
it is but short in respect of that which may
be spoken but I am confident it is more then
formerly hath been discovered: Some Authors
having not searched so deeply into the Centre
of Nature &amp; others not willing to publish such
<hi>Spiritual mysteries.</hi> I am now come to the <hi>gross

of severall <hi>substances</hi> from the same
<hi>Masse:</hi> but in the first place I shal examine that
<hi>Lymbus</hi> or <hi>Huddle</hi> of <hi>Matter</hi> wherein all
things were so strangely contained. It is
the opinion of some men. and those learned,
That this <hi>sluggish empty Rudement</hi> of the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
was noe <hi>created thing.</hi> I must confesse the
Point is obscure as the thing it selfe, and to
state it with Sobriety except a man were illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
with the same <hi>Light</hi> that this <hi>Chaos</hi>
was at first, is altogether impossible, For how
can wee judge of a <hi>Nature</hi> differrent from our
owne, whose <hi>Species</hi> also was so remote from
any thing <hi>now existent,</hi> that it is impossible for
Fancy to apprehend, much more for Reason to
define it. If it be created, I conceive it the Effect
of the <hi>Divine imagination</hi> acting beyond it
selfe in <hi>Contemplation</hi> of that which was to
come, and producing this <hi>Passive darkenesse</hi>
for a Subject to worke upon in the <hi>Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115878:15"/>
Trismegistus</hi> having first exprest his
<hi>Vision of Light,</hi> describes the Matter in its
<hi>primitive state</hi> thus <hi>Et paulo post</hi> (saith he)
<hi>Tenebrae deor sum ferebantur, partim trepidan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dae,
ac tristes effectae tortuosae terminatae: ut ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginarer
me vidisse commutatas Tenebras in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midam
quandam Naturam ultra quam dici
potest agitatam, &amp; velut ab igne fumum evome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
ac sonum aliquem edere inenunciabilem, &amp;
lugubrem.</hi> Certainly these <hi>Tenebrae</hi> he speakes
of or <hi>Fuliginous spawne</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> were the
first created <hi>Matter,</hi> for that Water we read of
in <hi>Genesis</hi> was a Product or secondary. Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
Here also he seemes to agree further
with the <hi>Mosaicall Tradition;</hi> For this <hi>Fumus</hi>
which ascended after the Transmutation can
be nothing else but that <hi>Darknesse</hi> which was
upon the Face of the Deepe; But to expresse the
particular Mode or way of the <hi>Creation,</hi> you
are to understand that in the <hi>Matter</hi> there was
a <hi>horrible confused Qualme,</hi> or stupifying spirit
of Moysture, Cold and Darknesse; In the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
Principle of <hi>Light</hi> there was <hi>Heate</hi> and
the Effect of it <hi>Siccitie;</hi> For these two are noe
Elementall qualities as the <hi>Galenists</hi> and my
<hi>Peripateticks</hi> suppose: But they are (if I may
say so) the Hands of the divine Spirit by which
He did worke upon the <hi>Matter,</hi> applying eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Agent to his proper Patient. These two are
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115878:15"/>
               <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Masculine,</hi> Those of Moysture and
Cold are <hi>Passive</hi> and <hi>Faeminine,</hi> Now assoone
as the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> and the <hi>Word</hi> (for it was not
the one nor the other, but both, <hi>Mens opifex una
cum Verbo,</hi> as <hi>Trismegistus</hi> hath it; I omit
that Speech, <hi>Let us make man,</hi> which
effectually prooves their <hi>Union</hi> in the<note place="margin">Gen.</note>
Worke) had applyed themselves to the
<hi>Matter,</hi> there was extracted from the Bosome
of it a <hi>thinne Spiritualt Caelestiall substance,</hi>
which receiving a Tincture of <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Light</hi>
proceeding from the Divine Treasuries, became
a <hi>pure sincere innoxious Fire.</hi> Of this the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes
of Angells consist, as also the <hi>Empyraeall
Heaven,</hi> where Intellectuall Essences have
their Residence. This was <hi>primum Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium
Dei, &amp; Naturae,</hi> the First and best of
Compositions. This <hi>Extract</hi> being thus soiled
above, and separated from the <hi>Masse,</hi> retaind
in it a <hi>vast portion of Light,</hi> and made the first
Day without a Sun. But the <hi>Splendour</hi> of the
<hi>Word,</hi> expelling the <hi>Darkenes</hi> downwards it
became more setl'd, and compact towards the
<hi>Centre,</hi> and made a <hi>Horrible thick Night.</hi>
Thus God (as the Hebrew hath it) was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the <hi>Light</hi> and the <hi>Darknesse,</hi> for the
<hi>Spirit</hi> remained still on the Face of the <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
portion</hi> to <hi>extract</hi> more from it. In the
<hi>second separation</hi> was educed <hi>Aer agilis,</hi> as
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115878:16"/>
               <hi>Trismegistus</hi> calls it a Spirit not so refined as
the former, but vitall, and in the next degree to
it. This was extracted in such abundance that
it fill'd all the space from the <hi>Masse</hi> to the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyraeall
heaven,</hi> under which it was condens'd
to a water, but of a different constitution from
the Elementall, and this is the Body of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-stellar
skie.</hi> But my <hi>Peripatericks</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Principles of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Ptolomie,</hi>
have imagin'd so many wheeles there with their
smal diminutive <hi>Epicycles</hi> that they have turn'd
that regular <hi>Fabrick</hi> to a rumbling Confused
<hi>Labyrinth.</hi> The Inferior portion of this second
Extract from the <hi>Moon</hi> to the <hi>Earth</hi> remained
<hi>Air</hi> still, partly to divide the inferior and supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
waters, but chiefly for the Respiration, and
Nourishment of the Creatures. This is that
which is properly called the Firmament, as it is
plain out of <hi>Esdras; On the Second Day thou
diddst create the Spirit of the Firmament:</hi> for
it is <hi>Ligamentum totius Naturae,</hi> and in the
<hi>outward Geometricall Composure</hi> it answers to
<hi>Natura media,</hi> for, it is spread through all
Things, hinders Vacuity, and keeps all the parts
of nature in a firm, invincible <hi>union.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is <hi>Cribrum Naturae,</hi> as one,
wittily calls it,<note place="margin">Auth. Philos. Rest it.</note> a thing appointed for
most secret and mysterious offices, but
we shall speake further of it, when we
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115878:16"/>
come to handle the Elements particularly. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
now remained but the Two inferior prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
as we commonly cal them, Earth and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The <hi>Earth</hi> was an impure, Sulphureous
<hi>subsidence,</hi> or <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> of the Creation.
The water also was Phlegmatick, crude, and
raco, not so vitall as the former Extractions
But the <hi>Divine Spirit</hi> to make his work per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
moving also upon These, imparted to them
Life, and Heate, and made them fit for future
Productions. The Earth was so overcast, and
Mantl'd with the Water, that no part thereof
was to be seen: But that it might be the more
immediatly exposed to the <hi>Coelestiall Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
which are the Cause of <hi>Vegetation,</hi> the
Spirit orders a Retreat of the Waters,
<hi>breaks up for them his decreed place, and
sets them Bars and Doors.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job.</note> The Light as yet
was not confined, but reteining his vast Flux,
and primitive <hi>liberty,</hi> equally possest the whole
Creature. On the Fourth Day it was collected
to a Sun, and taught to know his Fountain.
The darknesse, whence proceed the Corruptions,
and consequently the death of the Creature,
was imprisoned in the <hi>Centre,</hi> but breaks out
still when the <hi>Day</hi> gives it Leave, and like a
baffl'd <hi>Gyant</hi> thrusts his head out of doors in the
<hi>Absence</hi> of his <hi>Adversary.</hi> Thus <hi>Nature</hi> is a
<hi>Lady</hi> whose face is <hi>beauteous,</hi> but not without
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115878:17"/>
a <hi>Black-bag.</hi> Howsoever when it shall please
God more perfectly to <hi>refine</hi> his <hi>Creatures,</hi>
this Tincture shall be expelled quite beyond them,
and then it will be an <hi>Outward darknesse</hi> from
which <hi>Good Lord deliver us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have I given you a Cursorie, and short
<hi>Expresse</hi> of the <hi>Creation</hi> in generall: I shall
now descend to a more particular Examination
of <hi>Nature</hi> and especially her <hi>Inferior, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
parts,</hi> through which <hi>Man</hi> passeth
daily, and from which he cannot be separated.
I was about to desist in this place to prevent all
future Acclamations; for when a <hi>Peripatetick</hi>
findes here but <hi>Three,</hi> nay but <hi>two genuine Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
Earth,</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> for the <hi>Air</hi> is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more: will he not cry out I have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Sacrilege</hi> against <hi>Nature,</hi> and stole the fire
from her <hi>Altar?</hi> This is Noise indeed: but
till They take Coach in a Cloud, and discover that
<hi>Idol</hi> they prefer next to the <hi>Moon,</hi> I am resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to continue in my <hi>Heresie.</hi> I am not onely
of <hi>Opinion,</hi> but I am <hi>sure</hi> there is no such <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi>
in <hi>Nature,</hi> The <hi>Fire</hi> which she useth, is
<hi>Horizon Corporeorum, &amp; Incorporeorum,
Nexus utrinsque Mundi, &amp; Sigillum Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
sancti.</hi> It is no <hi>Chymaera, Commentitious
Quirck</hi> like that of the School-men. I shall
therefore Request my Friends the <hi>Peripateticks</hi>
to return their fourth Element to <hi>Aristole,</hi> that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115878:17"/>
he may present it to <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> as
the <hi>first part</hi> of a <hi>new world,</hi> for there is no such
Thing in the <hi>Old.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To proceed then: The <hi>Earth</hi> (as you were
told before) being the <hi>Subsidence,</hi> or <hi>Remaines</hi>
of that <hi>Primitive Masse,</hi> which God formed
out of <hi>Darknesse,</hi> must needs be a <hi>faeculent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
Body:</hi> for the <hi>Extractions</hi> which the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

humors settled</hi> like <hi>Lees</hi> towards the
<hi>Centre.</hi> The <hi>Earth</hi> is <hi>spungie, porous, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neticall,</hi>
of Composition <hi>loose,</hi> the better to take
in the severall <hi>Influences</hi> of <hi>Heat, Rains,</hi> and

of all <hi>things</hi> it is <hi>volatil, crude,</hi> and <hi>raco.</hi>
For this very Cause <hi>Nature</hi> makes it no part of

up with her <hi>Heat,</hi> and then <hi>condensing</hi> it to
<hi>Rains</hi> and <hi>Dews,</hi> in which <hi>State</hi> she makes <hi>use</hi>
of it for Nourishment. Some where it is Interior,

Them both in the same Bed, will confesse that

Common Elemental water. It is not altogether
Contemptible, there are hidden Treasures in
it, but so inchanted we can not see them, for all
the Chest is transparent. <hi>Spiritus Aquae Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilis

this Traine of Fire attends Him. Thus he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to <hi>Moses</hi> in the Bush, but it was in <hi>Fire.</hi>
The Prophet sees him break out at the North,
but like a Fire catching it self. At <hi>Horeb</hi> he is
attended with a mighty strong winde rending
the Rocks to pieces, but after this comes the
Fire, and with it a still small voice. <hi>Esdras</hi> also
defines Him a God, whose Service is Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
in Winde, and Fire. This Fire is the <hi>vesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of the Divine Majesty, his Back-parts
which he shewed to <hi>Moses,</hi> but his naked, Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Essence none can see, and Live; The Glory
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115878:19"/>
of his presence would swallow up the <hi>Naturall
man,</hi> and make him altogether <hi>spirituall.</hi> Thus
<hi>Moses his</hi> Face, after conference with him,
<hi>shines,</hi> and from this <hi>small Tincture</hi> we may
guesse at our Future Estate in the <hi>Regeneration.</hi>
But I have touch'd the <hi>Veyle,</hi> and must returne
to the <hi>outer Court</hi> of the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now in some measure performed that
which at first I promised, an Exposition of the
world and the parts therof; But in respect of my
affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to <hi>Truth</hi> and the dominion I wish <hi>Her,</hi>
I shallbe somwhat more particular in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
of <hi>Nature,</hi> and proceed to a further
Discovery of her Riches. I advise the Reader to
be diligent, and curious in this <hi>subsequent part</hi> of
the Discourse, That having once attained to the
<hi>Fundamentalls</hi> of <hi>Science,</hi> he may the better
understand her <hi>superstructures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Know then, that every Element is <hi>threefold,</hi>
this <hi>Triplicity</hi> being the expresse Image of their
<hi>Author,</hi> and a Seale he hath laid upon his <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
There is nothing on Earth though never
so simple, so vile, and abject in the sight of man,
but it beares witnesse of God even to that <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse
Mystery,</hi> his <hi>Vnity</hi> and <hi>Trinity.</hi> Every
Compound whatsoever is Three in One and
One in Three. The basest <hi>Reptill</hi> even in his
outward Symmetrie testifies of his <hi>Author,</hi> his
severall proportions answering to their aeternall
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115878:20"/>
superior <hi>Prototype.</hi> Now Man hath the use of
all these Creatures, God having furnished him
with a <hi>living Library</hi> wherein to imploy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe;
But he neglecting the works of his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,
prosecutes the Inventions of the Creature;
Laps up the <hi>Vomits</hi> of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and other <hi>il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate
Ethnicks,</hi> Men as concerning the Faith,
<hi>Reprobate,</hi> and in the Law of Nature alltoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unskillful, Scribling Blasphemous <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists,
Quorum Animas</hi> (as <hi>Agrippa</hi> hath it)

He is much troubled at those Mysteries of the
<hi>Trinity</hi> and the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> one Denies, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Grants them: But if they did once see the
<hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> they might find those Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
by Reason, which are now above their
<hi>Faith.</hi> When I speake of a <hi>Naturall Tripli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,</hi>
I speake not of <hi>Kitchen-stuffe,</hi> those three
Pot - Principles <hi>Water, Oyle</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi>
But I speake of <hi>Caelestiall hidden Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
knowne only to absolute <hi>Magicians,</hi>
whose eyes are in the <hi>Center,</hi> not in the <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,</hi>
and in this sence every Element is
Threefold. For example, there is a threefold
Earth, first there is <hi>terra Elementaris,</hi> then there
is <hi>terra C aelestis,</hi> and lastly, <hi>terra spiritualis,</hi>
The Influences of the <hi>spirituall Earth</hi> by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation
of the <hi>caelestiall</hi> are united to the <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restiall,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:115878:20"/>
and are the true Cause of Life and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation.
These Three are the Fundamentalls
of Art and Nature. The First is a visible, <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible</hi>
substance, pure, fixed, and Incorruptible: of
Quality Cold, but by Application of a Superior
Agent, Drie, and by Consequence a fit Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle
of Moysture. This is <hi>Aleph Creatum,</hi>
the true <hi>Terra Adama,</hi> the <hi>Basis</hi> of every
Building in Heaven, and Earth. It answers to
God the Father, being the Naturall Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Creature, as He is the Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall:
without this Nothing can be perfected
in <hi>Magick.</hi> The Second Principle is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
<hi>Magnet,</hi> the Mystery of Union. By
this all Things may be attracted whether Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall,
or Metaphysicall, be the distance never
so great. This is <hi>Jacobs Ladder:</hi> without this
there is no Ascent, or Descent either Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall,
or Personall. The Absence of This I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
to be that <hi>Gulph</hi> between <hi>Abraham,</hi> and
<hi>Dives.</hi> This answers to God the Son, for it is
That which mediates between Extremes, and
makes Inferiors and Superiors communicate.
But there is not One in ten thousand knows ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Substance, or the use of this Nature.
The third Principle is properly no Principle, It
is not <hi>Ex Quo,</hi> but <hi>per Quod omnia.</hi> This can
do all in all, and the Faculties thereof are not
to be exprest. It answers to the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> for
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115878:21"/>
amongst Naturalls it is the onely Agent, and
Artificer. Now He that knows these three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
with their severall Graduations, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
Links, which differ not in Substance, but
Complexion: He that can reduce their impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to one sincere Consistence, and their Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicities
to a Spirituall. Essentiall simplicity, he
is an absolute compleat <hi>Magician,</hi> and in full
possibility to all strange, miraculous Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.
In the second place you are to learn,
that Every Element is two fold. This Duplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or Confusion is that <hi>Binarius</hi> whereof <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa
in Scalis Numerorum,</hi> as also both
himself and <hi>Trithemius</hi> in their Epistles. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Authors who dealt in this Science, were
<hi>Pragmaticall Scriblers,</hi> and understood not
this <hi>Secretum Tenebrarum.</hi> This is it in which
the Creature <hi>praevaricates,</hi> and falls from his
first Harmonicall Vnity. You must therefore
<hi>subtrahere Binarium,</hi> and then the Magicians
<hi>Ternarius</hi> may be reduced <hi>per Quaternarium
in Monaden Simplicissimam,</hi> and by Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<hi>in Metaphysicam cum supremâ Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nade
vnionem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Sun, and Moon, are two Magicall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
the One active, the other passive, this
<hi>Masculine,</hi> that <hi>Eoeminine.</hi> As they move, so
move the wheeles of <hi>Corruption,</hi> and Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion:
They mutually dissolve, and compound
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115878:21"/>
but properly the moon is <hi>Organum Transmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationis
inferioris materiae.</hi> These <hi>Two Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries</hi>
are multiplied and fructifie in every one
particular Generation. There is not a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
in all Nature but hath in it a little Sun,
and a little Moon. The little Sun is <hi>Filius solis
Coelestis,</hi> The little Moon is <hi>Filia Lunae Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis.</hi>
What offices soever the two great <hi>Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries</hi>
perform for the Conservation of the
great world in Generall, These two little <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries</hi>
perform the like for the <hi>Conservation</hi>
of their small <hi>Cask,</hi> or <hi>Microcosm</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
They are <hi>Mimulae Majoris Animalis,</hi>
Heaven and Earth in a lesser <hi>Character.</hi> God
like a wise <hi>Architect,</hi> sits in the <hi>Center</hi> of All,
repaires the Ruines of his Building, composeth
all Disorders, and continues his Creature in his
first, primitive <hi>Harmony.</hi> The Invisible, Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trall
<hi>Moon</hi> is <hi>Iela illa rivosa, &amp; Multifontana,</hi>
at whose top sit <hi>Iove,</hi> and <hi>Iuno</hi> In a Throne of
<hi>Gold, Juno</hi> is an incombustible, Eriternall <hi>Oyl,</hi>
and therefore a fit Receptacle of <hi>Fire.</hi> This
<hi>Fire</hi> is her <hi>Jove,</hi> the little Sun we spoke of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.
These are the true Principles of the
stone, these are the Philosophers <hi>Sol &amp; Luna,</hi>
not Gold and Silver, as some <hi>Mountebanks,</hi>
and <hi>Carbonadoes</hi> would have it. But in respect

            <p>It is a strange thing to consider, That there
are in Nature <hi>incorruptible, immortall princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi>
Our ordinary <hi>Kitchin Fire,</hi> which in some
measure is an Enemy to all compositions, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
doth not so much destroy, as pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
some parts. This is clear out of the <hi>Ashes</hi>
of <hi>Vegetables,</hi> for although their weaker exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Elements expire by violence of the <hi>fire,</hi> yet
their Earth cannot be destroyed, but Vitrified.
The Fusion, and Transparency of this substance
is occasioned by the <hi>Radicall moysture</hi> or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall
water of the Compound. This water
resists the fury of the Fire, and cannot possibly be
vanquished. <hi>In huo Aquâ</hi> (sayth the learned
<hi>Severino</hi>) <hi>Rosa latet in Hiemo.</hi> These two
principles are never separated for <hi>Nature</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes
not so <hi>far</hi> in her Dissolutions. When
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115878:22"/>
Death hath done her worst, there is an <hi>Vnion</hi>
between these two, and out of them shall God
rise us at the last day, and restore us to a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
constitution. Besides there remaines in them
that primitive, universall Tincture of the Fire:
this is still busie after Death, brings nature again
into Play, produceth wormes, and other inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Generations. I do not conceive there shall
be a Resurrection of every <hi>Species,</hi> but rather
their <hi>Terrestiall</hi> parts together with the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Water (<hi>for there shall be no
more Sea</hi>)
shall be united in one mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with the Earth and fix'd to a pure,<note place="margin">Revel.</note> Diapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
substance. This is Saint <hi>Johns</hi> Chrystall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gold,
a <hi>Fundamentall</hi> of the new Jerusalem, so
called not in respect of Colour, but constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Their <hi>Spirits</hi> I suppose, shall be reduced
to their first <hi>Limbus,</hi> a <hi>sphaene</hi> of pure, ethereall
<hi>fire</hi> like rich Eternall Tapestry spread under the
Throne of God. Thus Reader, have I made a
plenary, but short Inquisition into the Mysteries
of Nature. It is more then hitherto hath been
discovered, and therefore I expect the <hi>more Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</hi>
I know my Reward is Calumnie, but
he that hath already condemn'd the Vanity of
Opinion, is not like to respect that of Censure. I
shal now put the Creatures to their just use, and
from this shallow Contemplation ascend to
Mine, and their Author.</p>

refer the Reader to the former part
of this Discourse, where if things be rightly

Frame,</hi> or <hi>Composure.</hi> We read in <hi>Genesis</hi>
that God made him out of the <hi>Earth;</hi> This is a
great <hi>Mystery</hi>: For it was not the common
<hi>`Pot-clay,</hi> but an other thing and that of a far
better nature. He that knowes this, knowes the
subject of the <hi>Philosophicall medicine,</hi> and by
consequence what destroyes or preserves the

<hi>homogeneall</hi> with his life, such as can restore

They that are ignorant in this point, are

<hi>Quacks</hi> and <hi>Piss-pot Doctors.</hi> The learned <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias

Out of this and some former passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
the understanding Reader may learn, That
Marriage is a Comment on <hi>Life,</hi> a meer <hi>Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphick,</hi>
or outward representation of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
vitall Composition. For <hi>Life</hi> is nothing
els but an Vnion of <hi>Male and Foemale Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
and he that perfectly knowes this secret,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115878:25"/>
knowes the Mysteries of Marriage, both <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall</hi>
and <hi>Naturall,</hi> and how he ought to
use a Wife. Matrimony is no ordinary triviall
busines, but in a moderate sence <hi>Sacramentall.</hi>
It is a visible signe of our invisible <hi>Vnion</hi> to
<hi>Christ,</hi> which S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls a <hi>Great mystery,</hi>
and if the thing signified be so Reverend, the
<hi>signature</hi> is no <hi>ex tempore,</hi> contemptible A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend.
But of this elsewhere. When God had
thus finished his last, and most excellent <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
he appointed his Residence in <hi>Eden,</hi> made
him his <hi>Vice-Roy,</hi> and gave him a full juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
over all his <hi>Works</hi>; That as the whole
man consisted of <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> so the <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Earthly Creatures</hi> might be subject to the
one, and the <hi>superiour intellectuall Essences</hi>
might minister to the other. But this Royalty
continued not long for presently upon his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment
there was a <hi>Faction</hi> in the Heavenly
<hi>Court,</hi> and the Angels scorning to attend this
piece of <hi>Clay,</hi> contrived how to supplant him.
The first in this plot was <hi>Lucifer, Montanus</hi> tells
me his name was <hi>Hilel.</hi> He casts about to Nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
that which God had Inacted, that so at once
he might overreach him and his Creature. This
Pollicy he imparts to some others of the <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy,</hi>
and strengthens himself with Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators.
<hi>But there is no Counsel against God.</hi>
The mischief is no sooner hatched but he and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115878:26"/>
his Confederates are expell'd from <hi>Light</hi> to
<hi>Darknesse,</hi> and thus Rebellion is as the sinne of
<hi>Witchcraft,</hi> a Witch is it Rebel in Physicks, and
a Rebell is a Witch in Polliticks: The one acts
against <hi>Nature,</hi> the other against <hi>Order,</hi> the
Rule of it: But both are in League with the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel</hi>
as the first Father of <hi>discord</hi> and <hi>sorcerie. Satan</hi>
being thus ejected, as the condition of
Reprobates is, became more hardned in his
<hi>Resolutions,</hi> and to bring his malice about, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives
by permission at <hi>Eden.</hi> Here he makes
<hi>Woman</hi> his Instrument to tempt <hi>Man,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowes
him by the same Meanes that God
made for an help to him. <hi>Adam</hi> having thus
transgrest the Commandement, was exposed to
the Lash, and in him his Posterity. But here
lyes the Knot: How can we possibly learn his
Disease, if we know not the immediate <hi>Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi>
of it? If I question our <hi>Divines</hi> what the
Forbidden <hi>Fruit</hi> was, I may be long enough
without an answer, Search all the School-men
from <hi>Ramus</hi> to <hi>Peter Hispan,</hi> and they have no
<hi>Logick</hi> in the point. What shall we do in this
case? To speak any thing contrary to the <hi>sling</hi>
of <hi>Aristotle</hi> (though perhaps we hit the <hi>mark</hi>)
is to expose our selves to the common Hue;
But in respect I prefer a <hi>private Trueth</hi> to a
<hi>publick Errour,</hi> I will proceed. And now Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Arrige Aures,</hi> come on without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115878:26"/>
and I will tell thee that which never
hitherto hath been discovered.</p>
            <p>That which I now write must needs appeare
very strange, and Incredible to the common
man, whose knowledg sticks in the Barke of
<hi>Allegories,</hi> and Mysticall speeches, never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
that which is signified by them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us. This I say must needs sound strange,
with such as understand the Scriptures in the
Litterall plaine sence, considering not the <hi>scope</hi>
and <hi>Intention</hi> of the <hi>Divine spirit,</hi> by whom
they were first penned and delivered. Howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<hi>Origen</hi> being <hi>Vnus de multis,</hi> and in the
judgement of many wise men, the most learned
of the Fathers, durst never trust himselfe in this
point, But alwaies in those Scriptures
where his Reason could not satisfie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
a <hi>Mystery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly if it be once granted (as some
stick not to affirm) that the <hi>Tree of knowledge</hi>
was a <hi>Vegetable,</hi> and <hi>Eden</hi> a <hi>Garden;</hi> it may be
very well inferred, that the <hi>tree</hi> of <hi>life</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
<hi>in eodem Genere,</hi> as the School-men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
it, was a <hi>Vegetable</hi> also. But how dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
this is to the power of <hi>God,</hi> to the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi>
and Passion of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> whose Gift
<hi>eternall life is,</hi> let any indifferent <hi>Christian</hi>
judge. Here then we have a certain intrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Paradise,</hi> where we may search out this <hi>tree</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:115878:27"/>
of <hi>knowledge,</hi> and (happily) learn what it is.
For seeing it must be granted, that by the <hi>tree</hi> if
<hi>life</hi> is figured the <hi>Divine Spirit</hi> (for <hi>it is the
Spirit that quickeneth,</hi> and shall one Day tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate
us from <hi>Corruption</hi> to <hi>Incorruption</hi>) it will
be no indiscreet <hi>Inference</hi> on the <hi>Contrary,</hi> that
by the <hi>tree</hi> of <hi>knowledge</hi> is signified some <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall
Nature</hi> repugnant to the <hi>Spirituall,</hi>
wherein our worldly sinfull <hi>Affections,</hi> as <hi>lust,
anger,</hi> and the rest have their <hi>seat,</hi> and <hi>predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will now digresse a while, but not much
from the purpose, whereby it may appear unto
the Reader that the <hi>letter</hi> is no sufficient <hi>Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitor</hi>
of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and that there is a great deal
of difference between the <hi>sound</hi> and the sense of
the <hi>Text Dionysius</hi> the <hi>Areopagit</hi> in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
to <hi>Titus</hi> gives him this Caveat. <hi>Et hoc
praeterea Operae &amp; pretium est cognoscere, Duplicem
esse Theologorum Traditionem, Arcanam Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teram,
ac mysticam: Alteram vero manifestaem.
&amp; notiorem.</hi> And in his Book of the <hi>Eclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Hierarchie</hi> written to <hi>Timotheus,</hi> he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
that in the <hi>primitive, Apostolicall times,</hi>
wherein he also lived, the mysteries of Divinity
were delivered <hi>partim scriptis, partim non scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptis
Institutionibus.</hi> Some things he confesseth
were written in the <hi>Theologicall Books,</hi> and such
are the Common <hi>Doctrinals</hi> of the Church
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115878:27"/>
now; in which notwithstanding (as Saint <hi>Peter</hi>
saith) <hi>there are many things hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</hi>
Some things again <hi>Ex Animo in Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
medio quidem intercurrente verbo corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rali,
sed quod Carnis penitus excederat sensum,
Sine literis transfusa sunt.</hi> And certainly this
<hi>Orall Tradition</hi> was the <hi>Cause</hi> that in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
<hi>Ages</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> all the <hi>mysteries</hi>
of <hi>Divinity</hi> were lost. Nay, this very day there is
not one amongst all our <hi>School-Doctors,</hi> or late
<hi>Ex-Temporaries</hi> that knows what is represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto us by the outward Element of <hi>Water</hi>
in <hi>Baptism.</hi> True indeed: They tell us it beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
the <hi>washing away</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> which we grant
them, but this is not the <hi>full signification</hi> for
which it was <hi>ordained.</hi> It hath been the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
errour of all times to mistake <hi>signum</hi> for
<hi>signatum,</hi> the <hi>shell</hi> for the <hi>Kernell</hi>; yet to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
this, it was that <hi>Dionysius</hi> wrot his book of
the <hi>Caelestiall Hierarchie,</hi> and especially his
<hi>Theologia significativa,</hi> of which there is such
frequent mention made in his works. Verely
our <hi>Saviour</hi> Himself who is blessed for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
did sometimes speak in <hi>parables,</hi> and
commanded further <hi>that Pearles should not be
cast forth unto swine,</hi> for <hi>it is not given to all
men to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of
Heaven.</hi> Supposing then (as it is most true)
that amongst other <hi>mysticall speeches</hi> contained
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115878:28"/>
in <hi>Scripture,</hi> this of the <hi>Garden of Eden,</hi> and the
<hi>Trees</hi> in it, is <hi>one</hi>: I shall proceede to the Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of it in some measure, concealing the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars notwithstanding.</p>
            <p>Man in the beginning (I mean the substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
inward Man) both in, and after his <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
for some short time, was a pure <hi>intellectual
Essence,</hi> free from all fleshly, sensuall <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
In this state the <hi>Anima,</hi> or <hi>sensitive Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
did not prevail over the <hi>spiritual,</hi> as it doth
now in us. For the superior <hi>Mentall</hi> part of
<hi>Man</hi> was united to <hi>God per Contactum Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialem,</hi>
and the <hi>Divine light</hi> being received in,
and conveyed to the inferiour portions of the
<hi>Soul</hi> did mortifie all carnall desires, insomuch
that in <hi>Adam</hi> the sensitive <hi>Faculties</hi> were
scarce at all imployed, the <hi>spirituall</hi> prevailing
over them in him, as they do over the Spirituall
now in us. Hence we read in Scripture, that
during the state of Innocence <hi>he did not know
that he was naked:</hi> but no sooner eats he of the
<hi>tree of knowledge</hi> but he <hi>saw</hi> his <hi>nakednesse,</hi> and
<hi>was ashamed</hi> of it; Wherefore also he hides
himself amongst the Trees of the Garden, and
when God calls to him, he replies; <hi>I
heard thy voice in the Garden, and I was
afraid because I was naked, and I hid my self.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen.</note>
But God knowing his former state, answers him
with a <hi>Question. Who told thee that Thou wast
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115878:28"/>
naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I
commanded thee thou shouldest not eat?</hi> Here
we see a Twofold state of Man: his first, and
best in the spiritual substantiall union of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall
parts to God, and the Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of his <hi>aethereall, sensitive Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
wherein the fleshly sinfull <hi>Affections</hi>
had their <hi>Residence.</hi> His <hi>second,</hi> or his <hi>Fall</hi> in
the eating of the <hi>forbidden fruit</hi> which did cast
<hi>asleep</hi> his Intellectuall <hi>Faculties</hi> but did <hi>stir</hi> up,
and <hi>exalt</hi> the Sensuall. For (sayth the
<hi>Serpent</hi>) <hi>God doth know that in the Day
you eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and
you shall be as Gods knowing Good, and Evill.
And when the woman saw that the Tree was
good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes
and a tree to be desired to make one wise: Shee,
took of the Fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave
also unto her husband, with her, and he did eat;
And the Eyes of them both were opened, and they
knew that they were naked.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen.</note> Thus we see the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall
faculties revived in our first Parents, and
brought <hi>de potentia in actum</hi> as the <hi>School-men</hi>
speak, by vertue of this forbidden Fruit. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did this Eating suppresse the Intellectuall
powers in <hi>Adam</hi> onely, but in all his Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
after him, for the Influence of this Fruit
past together with his <hi>Nature</hi> into his posterity.
We are all born like <hi>Moses</hi> with a Veil over the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115878:29"/>
Face: This is it, which hinders the prospect of
that Intellectuall shining Light, which God hath
placed in us; And to tell you a Trueth that
concernes all Mankinde, the greatest Mystery
both in <hi>Divinity</hi> and <hi>Philosophie</hi> is, <hi>How to
remove it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will not be amisse to speake something in
this place of the Nature and Constitution of
Man, to make that more plaine which already
hath been spoken.</p>
            <p>As the great World consists of Three parts.
the <hi>Elementall</hi> the <hi>Coelestiall</hi> and the <hi>Spirituall</hi>
above all which God himselfe is seated in that
Infinite, inaccessible <hi>Light,</hi> which streames
from his own <hi>Nature;</hi> Even so man hath in
him his Earthly, Elemental parts, together with
the <hi>Coelestiall, &amp; Angelical natures,</hi> in the
<hi>Center</hi> of all which moves, and shines the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Spirit.</hi> The sensuall, <hi>Coelestiall, aethereall
part</hi> of Man is that whereby we do move, see,
feel, taste, and smell, and have a Commerce
with all <hi>materiall Objects</hi> whatsoever. It is the
same in <hi>us</hi> as in <hi>Beasts,</hi> and it is derived from
Heaven, where it is predominant, to all the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Earthly Creatures. In plain Terms it is
part of <hi>Anima Mundi,</hi> commonly called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima
media,</hi> because the Influences of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature</hi> are conveyed thorough <hi>it</hi> to the
more material parts of the Creature, with which
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115878:29"/>
of themselves they have no proportion. By
meanes of this <hi>Anima Media,</hi> or the <hi>aethereal
Nature: Man</hi> is made subject to the Influence
of Stars, and is partly dispos'd of by the <hi>Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial
harmony.</hi> For this middle spirit (middle I
mean between both Extreames, and not that
which actually unites the whole together) as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
that which is in the outward Heaven, as
that which is in Man, is of a fruitfull insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
nature, and carried with a strong desire to
multiply it self, so that the <hi>Coelestiall Form stirs
up,</hi> and excites the Elementall. For this Spirit
is in Man, in Beasts, in Vegetables, in Minerals:
and in every thing it is the <hi>mediate Cause</hi> of
Composition and Multiplication. Neither
should any wonder that I affirm this spirit to be
in Minerals, because the Operations of it are not
discerned there. For shall we conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that there is no inward Agent that actuats,
and specifies those <hi>passive, indefinite Principles</hi>
whereof they are <hi>Compounded?</hi> Tell me not now
of blind <hi>Peripateticall Formes,</hi> and Qualities.
A Form is that which <hi>Aristotle</hi> could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
substantially, nor any of his followers after
Him, and therefore they are not competent
<hi>Judges</hi> of it. But I beseech you, are not the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
of this Spirit supprest in Man also, when
the <hi>Organs</hi> are <hi>Corrupted,</hi> as it appeareth in
those that are blind? But notwithstanding the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115878:30"/>
               <hi>Eye</hi> onely is destroyed, and not the Visible
power, for that remaines, as it is plain in their
<hi>dreams.</hi> Now this vision is performed by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
of the <hi>Visuall Radii</hi> in their inward,
proper <hi>Cell:</hi> For Nature imployes her gifts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
where she findes a <hi>Conveniencie,</hi> and fit <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposition</hi>
of <hi>Organs,</hi> which being not in <hi>Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals</hi>
we may not expect so clear an <hi>Expression</hi>
of the naturall <hi>powers</hi> in them. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Flowers of severall <hi>vegetables</hi> (which
in some sort represent the <hi>Eyes</hi>) there is a more
Subtile, acute perception of heat and cold, and
other <hi>Coelestiall</hi> Influences then in any other
part. This is manifest in those <hi>Herbs</hi> which
open at the Rising, and shut towards the <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set:</hi>
which motion is caused by the spirit being
sensible of the Approach and departure of the
<hi>Sun;</hi> For indeed the Flowers are (as it were)
the spring of the Spirit, where it breaks forth,
and streames, as it appears by the Odours that
are more <hi>Coelestiall,</hi> and Comfortable there. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
this is more evident in the <hi>Plantanimals,</hi>
as the <hi>Vegetable Lamb,</hi> the <hi>Arbor Casta,</hi> and
severall others. But this will not sink with any,
but such as have seen this Spirit separated from
his Elements, where I leave it for this time.</p>
            <p>Next to this <hi>Sensuall Nature</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> is the
<hi>Angelicall,</hi> or <hi>rationall Spirit.</hi> This <hi>Spirit</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres
somtimes to the <hi>Mens</hi> or <hi>superior portion</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:115878:30"/>
of the <hi>Soul,</hi> and then it is filled with the <hi>Divine
light,</hi> but most commonly it descends into the
<hi>aethereal inferior portion,</hi> which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls
<hi>Homo animalis,</hi> where it is altered by the <hi>Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
influences,</hi> and diversly distracted with the
irregular <hi>Affections,</hi> and passions of the <hi>sensuall
Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, above the <hi>Rationall Spirit</hi> is the
<hi>Mens,</hi> or <hi>Intelligentia abscondita,</hi> commonly
called <hi>Intellectus illustratus,</hi> and of <hi>Moses spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculum
Vitarum.</hi> This is that Spirit which
God himself breathed into Man, and by which
Man is united again to God Now as the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
light</hi> flowing into the <hi>Mens,</hi> did assimilate
and convert the inferiour portions of the soul to
God; so on the Contrary the Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
did obscure, and darken the superiour por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but awak'd and stir'd up the <hi>Animal sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Nature.</hi> The sum of all is this. Man as
long as he continued in his union to God knew
the Good onely, that is, the Things that were
of God: but assoon as he stretched forth his
hand, and did Eat of the forbidden fruit that is,
the <hi>Anima media,</hi> or Spirit of the greater
world, presently upon his disobedience and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
of the Commandment, his Vnion to the
Divine Nature was dissolved, and his Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
united to the Spirit of the world, he knew
the Evil onely, that is the things that were of the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115878:31"/>
world. True it is, he knew the Good and the
Evil, but the Evil in a far greater measure then
the Good.</p>
            <p>Some sparks of <hi>Grace</hi> were left, and though
the perfection of Innocence was lost upon his
Fall from the Divine Light, yet Conscience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
still with him, partly to direct, partly to
punish. Thus you see that this <hi>Anima Media</hi>
or middle Spirit is figured by the Tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
but he that knows why the Tree of Life
is sayd to be in the middest of the Garden, and
to grow out of the Ground, will more fully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
that which we have spoken. We see
moreover that the Faculties ascribed to the
Tree of Knowledge are to be found onely in
Middle Nature. First, it is said to be a Tree to
<hi>be desired to make one wise,</hi> but it was Fleshly
sensuall Wisdom, the Wisdom of this world, and
not of God. Secondly it is sayd to <hi>be good for
Food, and pleasant to the Eyes:</hi> So is the Middle
Nature also; For it is the onely <hi>Medicine</hi> to
repair the Decayes of the Natural Man, and to
continue our Bodies in their primitive strength,
and Integrity.</p>
            <p>Lastly, that I may speak something for my
self: This is no new unheard of fansie, as the
understanding Reader may gather out of <hi>Tris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megistus.</hi>
Nay, I am verily of opinion, that the
<hi>Egyptians</hi> received this knowledge from the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115878:31"/>
               <hi>Hebrews</hi> who lived a long time amongst them,
as it appears out of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
it over to the <hi>Graecians.</hi> This is plain
out of <hi>Iamblichus</hi> in his Book <hi>de Mysteriis,</hi>
where he hath these words. <hi>Contemplabilis in se
Intellectus Homo, erat quondam Deorum Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templationi
conjunctus: deinde vero alteram in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressus
est Animam, circa humanam Formae
Speciem contemperatam, atq, propterea in ipso
Necessitaetis, Fatique Vinculo est alligatus.</hi> And
what els I beseech you, is signified unto us in
that poeticall Table of <hi>Prometheus?</hi> That he
should steal a certain fire from Heaven, for
which Trespasse afterwards, God punished
the World with a great many Diseases, and
Mortality.</p>
            <p>But some body may reply: Seeing that God
made all Things very Good, as it appears in
his <hi>Review</hi> of the Creatures on the sixth day;
how could it be a sin in <hi>Adam</hi> to eat that
which in it self was good? Verily the sin was
not grounded in the Nature of that which he
did eate, but it was the Inference of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
in as much as he was forbidden to
eate it. And this is that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells
us, That he had not known sin, had it not been
for the law; And again in another place, The
strength of sin is the law. But presently upon
the Disobedience of the first Man, and his
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115878:32"/>
               <hi>Transgression</hi> of the Commandement the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was made subject to Vanity: For the curse
followed, and the impure seedes were joyned
with the pure, and they reigne to this hour in
our bodies, and not in us alone, but in every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Naturall Thing. Hence it is we reade in
scripture, <hi>That the Heavens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are not clean in his sight.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job.</note> And to
this alludes the Apostle in that speech
of his to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> That it pleased the Father
to reconcile all things to himself by Christ, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be things in Earth or Things in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
And here you are to observe that <hi>Cornelius
Agrippa</hi> mistook the act of Generation for O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
sin, which indeed was the Effect of it, and
this is the onely point wherein he hath miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</p>
            <p>I have now done, onely a word more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Situation of Paradise, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
because of the diversity of Opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
that solace and the Absurdity of them.
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his second Epistle to th <hi>Cori<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
discovers it in these words. I knew a Man
in Christ above fourteen years ago (whether in
the Body, or out of the Body I cannot tell, God
knoweth:) such an One caught up to the
Third Heaven. And I knew such a Man (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the body, or out of the body I cannot
tell, God knoweth) how that he was caught up
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115878:32"/>
               <hi>into Paradise.</hi> Here you see that Paradise and
the third Heaven are convertible Terms, so that
the one discovers the other. Much more I could
have sayd concerning the Tree of knowledge,
being in it self a large, and very mysticall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
but for my part I rest contented with my
own particular apprehension, and desire not to
inlarge it any further: Neither had I commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this much to paper, but out of my love to
the trueth and that I would not have these
thoughts altogether to perish.</p>
            <p>You see now, if you be not <hi>durissimae Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicis
Homines,</hi> how man fell, and by Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
you may guesse by what means he is to
rise. He must be united to the Divine light from
whence by disobedience he was separated. A
Flash, or Tincture of this must come, or he can
no more discern things spiritually, then he can
distinguish Colours naturally without the light
of the Sun. This light descends, and is united
to him by the same Meanes as his Soul was at
first. I speak not here of the Symbolicall exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Descent from the <hi>Prototypicall-planets</hi> to
the Created spheres and thence <hi>in Noctem
Corporis</hi>: but I speak of that most secret and
silent Laps of the <hi>Spirit per Formarum natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium
Seriem,</hi> and this is a mystery not easily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.
It is a <hi>Cabalisticall maxime, Nulla
res spiritualis descondens inferius operatur sine
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115878:33"/>
Indumento.</hi> Consider well of it with your
selves, and take heed you wander not in the
Circumference. The Soul of Man whiles she is
in the <hi>Body,</hi> is like a <hi>Candle</hi> shut up in a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Lanthorn,
or a Fire that is almost stifl'd for want
of Aire. Spirits (say the <hi>Platonicks</hi>)
when they are <hi>in sua patriâ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Procl. de. Ani.</note> are like
the Inhabitants of green Fields, who
live perpetually amongst <hi>Flowers,</hi> in a
<hi>Spicie oderous Aire</hi>: but here <hi>below, in Sphaerâ
Generationis,</hi> They mourn because of darknesse,
and solitude, like people lock'd up in a <hi>Pest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house.
Hinc metuunt, cupiuntque dolent, &amp;c.</hi>
This is it makes the Soul subject to so many
Passions, to such a <hi>Proteus</hi> of humors. Now
she flourishes, now she withers, now a smile,
now a tear: And when she hath play'd out
her stock, then comes a Repetition of the same
fancies, till at last she cries out with <hi>Seneca,
Quousque eadem?</hi> This is occasioned by her
vast, and infinite Capacity, which is satisfied
with nothing but God, from whom at first she
descended. It is miraculous to consider how
she struggles with her Chaines when Man is in
Extremity, how she falsisies with Fortune;
what pomp, what pleasure, what a Paradise
doth she propose to her self? she spans King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
in a Thought, and injoyes all that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
which she misseth outwardly, In her
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115878:33"/>
are patterns and Notions of all things in the
world. If she but fancies her self in the midst of
the Sea, presently she is there, and hears the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
of the Billowes: she makes an Invisible
voyage from one place to another, and presents
to her self things absent, as if they were present.
The dead live to her, there is no grave can hide
them from her thoughts. Now she is here in dirt
and mire, and in a trice above the Moon:</p>
            <q>
               <l>Celsior exurgir pluviis, auditque ruentes</l>
               <l>Sub pedibus Nimbos, &amp; caeca Tonitrua calcat.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But this is Nothing. If she were once out of
the Body, she could act all that, which she ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
<hi>in momento</hi> (saith <hi>Agrippa</hi>) <hi>quicquid eupit,
assequeretur.</hi> In this state she can <hi>movere Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores
majoris Animalis,</hi> make general Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions
in the <hi>Two sphaeres</hi> of Aire, and water,
and alter the Complexions of Times. Neither is
this a Fable, but the unanimous Tenent of the
<hi>Arabians,</hi> with the two princes <hi>Avicebron,</hi> and
<hi>Avicen.</hi> She hath then an absolute power in
miraculous, and more then naturall Transmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
She can in an Instant transfer her own,
vessell from one place to another, She can <hi>(per
unionem cum virtute. universali)</hi> infuse, and
communicate her thoughts to the Absent, be
the distance never so great; Neither is there any

remaining onely in one place, she can acquaint
her self with the Actions of all places whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.

which in a manner makes God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Contraries, hath so weakened our Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
towards Heaven, that we look upon all
Receptions from thence, as Impossibilities. But
if things were well weighed, and this Cloud of
Tradition remov'd, we should quickly finde
that God is more ready to give, then we are to
receive. For He made Man (as it were) for his
Play-fellow, that he might survey and examin
his works. The inferior Creatures he made not
for themselves, but his own Glory: which glory
he could not receive from any thing so perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as from Man, who having in him the Spirit
of discretion, might judge of the Beauty of
the Creature, and consequently praise the
Creatour. Wherefore also God gave him the
the use of all his works, and in Paradise how
familiar is He, or rather how doth he play with
<hi>Adam?</hi> Out of the Ground (sayth
the Scripture) the Lord God formed
every Beast of the Field,<note place="margin">Gen.</note> and every fowl
of the air, and brought them unto <hi>Adam</hi> to
see what he would call them, and whatsoever
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115878:35"/>
               <hi>Adam</hi> called every living Creature, that was
the Name thereof. These were the Books which
God ordained for <hi>Adam,</hi> and for us his Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
not the Quintessence of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> nor the
Temperament of <hi>Galen</hi> the <hi>Anti-Christ.</hi> But

and Royalty of Man, I shall now speake
something of his <hi>Dissolution,</hi> and close up my
Discourse, as he doth his Life, with <hi>Death.</hi>
Death is <hi>Recessus vitae in Absconditum:</hi> not
the Annihilation, of any one Particle but a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
of hidden Natures to the same State they
were in, before they were Manifested. This is
occasioned by the Disproportion and inequality
of the Matter: For when the <hi>Harmony</hi> is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by the Excesse of any one Principle, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
<hi>Twist</hi> (without a timely Reduction of the
first <hi>Vnity</hi>) Disbands and unravells. In this
<hi>Recesse</hi> the severall Ingredients of Man returne
to those severall Elements, from whence they
came at first in their Accesse to a <hi>Compound;</hi>
For to thinke that God creates any thing <hi>ex
nihilo</hi> in the worke of Generation, is a pure
<hi>Metaphysicall Whymsey.</hi> Thus the <hi>Earthly
parts,</hi> as we see by experience, returne to the
<hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>Coelestiall</hi> to a Superiour heavenly
<hi>Limbus,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> to God that gave it.
Neither should any wonder that I affirme the
Spirit of the living God to be in Man, when
God himselfe doth acknowledge it for his own.
<hi>My spirit</hi> (saith he) <hi>shall not alwaies be shea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed</hi>

(for so the Hebrew signifies) <hi>in man, for
that he also is flesh, yet his dayes shall be an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and twenty yeares.</hi> Besides, the breathing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115878:38"/>
of it into <hi>Adam</hi> proves it proceeded from God,
and therefore the Spirit of God. Thus Christ
breathed on his Apostles, and they received
the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> In <hi>Ezechiel</hi> the Spirit comes
from the <hi>Foure Winds,</hi> and Breathes upon the
Slaine, that they might live. Now this Spirit
was the Spirit of Life, the same with that
Breath of Life which was breathed into the
<hi>First Man,</hi> and he became a <hi>Living Soule:</hi>
but without doubt the Breath or Spirit of Life
is the <hi>Spirit of God.</hi> Neither is this Spirit in
Man alone, but in all the <hi>Great World</hi> though

            <p>I am now to speak of Man as he is subject to
a Supernatural Judgement: And to be short, my
Sentiment is this. I conceive there are besides
the Empyraeall Heaven, two inferior Mansions,

ascent of the Soul according to the process

in the Moon. But let it be where it will, my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
is, That this middlemost mansion is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for such Soules, whose whole man hath
not perfectly repent in this world: But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
they are <hi>de Salvandorum numero,</hi> and
reserved in this place to a further Repentance in
the spirit, for those <hi>Offences</hi> they committed in
the Flesh. I do not here maintain that <hi>I gnis Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuus</hi>
of Purgatory, or any such painted, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<hi>Tophet,</hi> but that which I speak of (if I am
not much mistaken) I have a strong Scripture
for. It is that of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> where he speaks
of Christ being <hi>put to Death in the Flesh, but
Quickened by the spirit; By which also he
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:115878:40"/>
went, and preached unto the spirits that were in
Prison: which sometimes were disobedient when
once the long-suffering of God waited in the
Dayes of Noah, while the Ark was a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
wherein Few, that is, eight Souls were sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by Water.</hi> These spirits were the souls of
those who perished in the Floud, and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in this place till Christ should come, and
preach Repentance unto them. I know <hi>Scaliger</hi>
thinks to evade this Construction with his <hi>Qui Tunc,</hi>
That they were then alive namely before
the Floud, when they were preached unto. But
I shall overthrow this single Non-sense with
Three solid Reasons drawn out of the Body of
the Text. First, it is not sayd that the spirit it self
precisely preached unto them, but He who went
thither by the Spirit, namely Christ in the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postaticall
union of his Soul and Godhead,
which union was not before the Floud, when
these Dead did live. Secondly, it is written that
he preached unto spirits, not to Men: to those
which were in Prison, not to those which were
<hi>in vivis,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is quite
contary to <hi>Scaliger</hi>; and this Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the Apostle confirms in another
place,<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Dead
were preached to, not the living.<note place="margin">Cap. 4. ver. 6.</note>
Thirdly, the Apostle sayes. These spirits were
but sometimes disobedient, and withall tells us
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115878:41"/>
when, namely in the Dayes of <hi>Noah:</hi> whence
I gather they were not disobedient at this time
of preaching and this is plain out of the subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Chapter.</p>
            <p>For this Cause (sayth the Apostle) <hi>was the
Gospell preached also to them that are dead, that
they might be judged according to men in the
flesh, but live according to God in the Spirit.</hi>
Now this Judgement in the Flesh was grounded
on their Disobedience in the Dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> for
which also they were drowned, but <hi>Salvation</hi>
according to <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Spirit</hi> proceeded from
their <hi>Repentance</hi> at the preaching of Christ;
which was after death. I do not impose this on
the Reader, as if I sate in the infallible Chaire,
but I am confident the Text of it self will speak
no other sense. As for the Doctrine it is no way
hurtfull, but in my Opinion as it detracts not
from the Mercy of God so it addes much to the
Comfort of Man.</p>
            <p>I shall now speake a word more concerning
my self, and another concerning the Common
Philosophy, and then I have done. It will be
question'd perhaps what I am, and especially
what my Religion is? Take this short answer.
I am neither Papist, nor Sectary but a true, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Protestant in the best sense of the Church
of England. For Philosophy as it now stands,
it is altogether imperfect, and withall false. A
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:115878:41"/>
meer Apothecaries Drug, a mixture of inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent,
Contrary Principles, which no way agree
with the Harmony, and Method of Nature. In
a word, the whole <hi>Encyclopaedia</hi> (as they call
it) bateing the Demonstrative Mathematicall
part, is built on meer Imagination without the
least Light of Experience. I wish therefore all
the true sons of my <hi>famous Oxford Mother</hi> to
looke beyond <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and not confine their
Intellect to the narrow, and cloudy <hi>Horizon</hi>
of his Text, for he is as short of Nature, as the
<hi>Grammarians</hi> are of <hi>Steganography.</hi> I expect
not their Thanks for this my <hi>Advice,</hi> or <hi>Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,</hi>
but verily the Time will come when this
Trueth shall be more perfectly manifested, and
especially that great, and glorious mystery,
whereof there is little spoken in this Book,
<hi>Solus Rex Messias, Verbum Patris Caro fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum,
Arcanum hoc revelavit, Aliqua Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris plenitudine apertius manifestaturus. It is
Cornelius Agrippa's</hi> owne prediction, and I am

               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:115878:44"/>I have two Admonitions more to
the <hi>Ingenuous,</hi> and <hi>well-disposed Reader.</hi>
First, That he would not <hi>slight</hi> my <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours</hi>
because of <hi>my yeers,</hi> which are
but <hi>few.</hi> It is the Custom of most men
to measure <hi>knowledge</hi> by the <hi>Beard,</hi> but
look Thou rather on the <hi>Soul,</hi> an <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi>
of that <hi>Nature, quae ad per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionem
suam Curricula Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris non desiderat.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Procl.</note> Secondly,
that He would not conclude any thing
<hi>rashly</hi> concerning the <hi>subject</hi> of this <hi>art,</hi>
for it is a <hi>Principle</hi> not <hi>easily apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi>
It is neither <hi>Earth,</hi> nor <hi>water, air,</hi> nor <hi>Fire.</hi> It is not <hi>Gold, Silver, Saturn,
Antimonie,</hi> or <hi>Vitriol,</hi> nor any kind of
<hi>Minerall</hi> whatsoever. It is not <hi>Bloud,</hi>
nor the <hi>Seed</hi> of any <hi>Individual,</hi> as some
unnaturall, Obscene Authors have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agin'd.
In a word, it is no <hi>Mineral,</hi> no
<hi>Vegetable,</hi> no <hi>Animal,</hi> but a <hi>system</hi> as it
were, of <hi>all Three.</hi> In plain Terms, it is
<hi>Sperma Majoris Animalis,</hi> The <hi>seed</hi> of
<hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> our most <hi>secret,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115878:45"/>
miraculous Hermaphrodite.</hi> If you know
<hi>this,</hi> and with it the <hi>Hydro-pyro-magical
Art,</hi> you may with some security at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
the <hi>work,</hi> if not, <hi>practice</hi> is the
way to <hi>Poverty.</hi> Assay nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Science,</hi> but confine your selves to
those <hi>Bounds,</hi> which <hi>Nature</hi> hath <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd</hi> you.</p>
