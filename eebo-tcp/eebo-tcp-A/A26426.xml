            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing much afflicted with the ſight of ſome Printed Papers, or
<hi>Sermons,</hi> to which the name of my Worthy Husband (now
with the Lord) is prefixed, by theſe that have publiſhed them,
becauſe I found many things therein injurious, not onlie to
his memorie, but to the Truth: I was therefore at the pains
to cauſe compare them with his Notes I have beſide me;
And likewiſe to Interrogate ſome of his moſt Judicious and
Conſcientious ordinarie Hearers, yet living, anent the ſame:
And after due and ſerious conſideration of the whole, I dare
verie confidently declare, that they are not the genuine <hi>Works</hi>
and <hi>Sermons</hi> of my foreſaid Husband; which may be very evident to all that knew
him, conſidering the perplexed ſtile, the confuſion, and want of connexion, and a
multitude of vain repetitions that are oft-times to be found therein; as alſo want of
that clear method familiar to him, together with the un ſoundneſs ſometimes of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which was known to be farr from him, being well inſtructed in the form of ſound
words, which in all his diſcourſes to the people he held faſt. Moreover there be many
things therein clear non-ſenſe, and not intelligible by the Reader a fault very farr from
his way in Preaching. And this is to be the leſs wondred, at ſeeing, that when he was
yet alive, ſome made bold to Print ſome Sermons of his without his knowledge, which
he would not own, and therefore was neceſſitate to emit theſe <hi>few Sermons</hi> himſelf,
Intituled, <hi>The tryall of a Saving Intereſt in Chriſt,</hi> to the advantage of the truth,
which had been otherwiſe wronged.</p>
            <p>IT IS hoped therefore that every conſcientious perſon will be ſo farr tender of the
Truth, and of the Fame of ſuch a faithful Miniſter of the Goſpel, who is not now to
ſpeak for himſelf, that they will not look upon theſe Printed <hi>Sermons</hi> as his <hi>Workes,</hi>
ſeing they have been put forth to the publict viewe, without the knowledge or conſent of
any of his Relations or Brethren of the Miniſtry, who were particularly acquaint with
him, and his way of Doctrine, and to whom, if he had minded any thing for the
Preſs, he would have left the charge or the overſight thereof. The World hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
had a taſte of his gift, and of the Spirit that appeared in him in the foreſaid uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
litle Book publiſhed by himſelf, and bleſſed of God to the Edification of many,
which I hope will eaſily move the obſerving and Judicious Reader to have theſe lately
Printed under his name in ſuſpition. I ſhall add no more, but for the future intreat that
nothing bearing his name may be looked upon as his, that is not atteſted by his neareſt
Relations, and his Brethren of the Miniſtrie.</p>
