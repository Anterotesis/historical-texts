            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas ſome have given out, that by the Act of Councell, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth the Confeſſion of Faith lately commanded to be ſworne by his Majeſty, to be underſtood of the Confeſſion of faith, as it was then profeſſed and received, when it was made, and that in that Confeſſion, defence both of the doctrine &amp; diſcipline then eſtabliſhed is ſworn, at which time epiſcopall government being (as they ſay) aboliſhed, it muſt needs follow, that the ſame government is by this late oath abjured.</p>
            <p>And underſtanding that even amongſt thoſe who continue together ſtill at Glaſgow, under the name of a generall Aſſembly, though but a pretended and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull one, this objection is held to be of ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and uſed by them to the great diſturbance of the peace of this church and kingdome, and to the great diſquieting of the mindes of ſuch his Majeſties good ſubjects as have taken the ſaid oath, and yet never meaned nor do mean to abjure epiſcopall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; And to perſwade others, that if they ſhall take the ſame oath thus explained by the ſaid Act of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, by ſo doing they muſt likewaies abjure the ſaid government:</p>
            <p>We <hi>James</hi> Marqueſſe of Hamiltoun, his Majeſties high Commiſſioner, wondring that any ſuch ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous miſconſtruction ſhould be made of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties gracious and pious intentions, and being deſirous to remove all doubts from the minds of his Majeſties good ſubjects, and to keep them from being poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:158:3"/>
by ſuch as by forced and forged inferences would make them beleeve, that they had actually by taking that oath ſworn that which neither virtually nor verely they have ſworn, or ever intended to ſwear, or was required by authority to be ſworn by them, either directly or indirectly: Conſidering that all oathes muſt be taken according to the minde, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and commandement of that authority, which exacteth the oath; and that we, by ſpeciall commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from his ſacred Maieſtie, commanded the ſaid oath to be adminiſtred, we do hereby freely and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly profeſſe and declare our mind and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herein, as we have conſtantly heretofore done ſince our coming into this kingdome about this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; <hi>viz.</hi> That by any ſuch words or act of councell we never meaned or intended that epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall government ſhould be abiured, nor any thing elſe which was eſtabliſhed by acts of parliament, or acts of the church of this kingdome, which are now in force, and were ſo at the time of the taking of the ſaid oath.</p>
            <p>Nor indeed could we have any other intention or meaning, being clearly warranted and expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by his Maieſties inſtructions, to exact the ſaid oath, and take order that it ſhould be ſworn through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the kingdome in that faire and lawfull ſenſe, and none other. Neither in this point did we deliver our own words, or his Maieſties minde ambiguouſly or doubtfully, ſo as any other ſenſe, to our thinking, could be picked or wrung out of either the one or the other; for we do atteſt the Lords of the Councell, whether we did not to many, or all of them upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall occaſions in conference with them ever ſince
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:158:3"/>
our coming into this kingdom, conſtantly declare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that his Maieſties reſolution was not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer epiſcopall government to be aboliſhed: We atteſt all the Lords of Seſſion, whether before our tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of that oath to them, or their Lordſhips taking of it, we did not fully and freely declare to them, that his Maieſties minde in commanding us to ſee this oath taken, and our own minde in requiring them to take it, was onely to ſettle and ſecure the religion and faith profeſſed in this kingdome, but was not to be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the abiuring of epiſcopall government, or any other thing now in force by the laws of this church and ſtate at the time of adminiſtring this oath, which their Lordſhips, being the reverend and learned Judges of the lawes, knew well could not be abiured; after which perſpicuous predeclaration of our minde, their Lordſhips undoubtedly in that ſame ſenſe and none other took the ſaid oath.</p>
            <p>And now, good Reader, having heard his Maieſties minde and intention, and in purſuance of them, the mind of his Maieſties high Commiſſioner concerning this oath, though reaſons to repell the former obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeem to be needleſſe (the known minde of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Magiſtrate who urgeth an oath, being to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the undoubted ſenſe of it) yet foraſmuch as that obiection hath of late bin mainly urged for alienating the mindes of many of his Maieſties good ſubiects, and well affected to that government, from adhering unto it, be pleaſed to know, that the former obiection hath neither ſhow nor force of reaſon in it, and that by the ſaid oath and that explanation ſet down in the act of councell, epiſcopall government neither was nor poſſibly could be abiured, and that for many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:158:4"/>
but eſpecially theſe five, which we having ſeen and approved, have cauſed to be here inſerted, and leave them to thine impartiall conſideration.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, God forbid it ſhould be imagined that his Majeſty ſhould command his ſubjects to take an oath which in it ſelf is abſolutely unlawfull: But for a man to ſwear againſt a thing which is eſtabliſhed by the laws of the church and kingdome in which he liveth (unleſſe that thing be repugnant to the law of God) is abſolutely unlawfull, untill ſuch time as that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and church do firſt repeal theſe laws: And therefore epiſcopall government not being repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the law of God, nay being conſonant unto it, as being of apoſtolicall inſtitution (which ſhall be demonſtrated if any man pleaſe to argue it) and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully eſtabliſhed, both by acts of parliament, and acts of generall aſſembly at the time when this oath was adminiſtred; to abjure it before theſe acts be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, is abſolutely unlawfull, and againſt the word of God: and it is to be hoped no man will conceive that his Majeſtie meaned to command a thing abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely unlawfull. And if it ſhould be ſaid, as it is ſaid by ſome, (who not being able to avoid the force of reaſon, do betake themſelves to pitifull ſhifts and evaſions) that theſe acts of parliament and aſſembly eſtabliſhing epiſcopall government, were unlawfully and unduely obtained: certainly if they have any reaſons for this their bold aſſertion, which is of a more dangerous conſequence then that it ought to be endured in any well ſetled church or common-wealth; theſe reaſons may be preſented lawfully to theſe judicatories to entreat them to reduce the ſaids acts, if there ſhall be ſtrength and validity found in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:158:4"/>
them. But to hold, that untill ſuch time as theſe judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories ſhall repeal the ſaids laws, they either ought to be, or can poſſibly be abjured, is a wicked poſition, and deſtructive of the very foundation of juſtice both in church and common-wealth.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, it cannot be imagined that this oathſhould oblige the now takers of it farther then it did oblige the takers of it at firſt: for doctrine and points of faith it did oblige them then, and ſo doth it us now, perpetually, becauſe theſe points in themſelves are perpetuall, immutable and eternall: But for points of diſcipline and government, and policie of the Church, that oath could binde the firſt takers of it no longer then that diſcipline and government ſhould ſtand in force by the laws of this Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which our Church in her poſitive confeſſion of faith printed amongſt the acts of Parliament, artic. 20.21. declareth to be alterable at the will of the Church it ſelf, and ſo repealable by ſucceeding acts, if the Church ſhall ſee cauſe. When a king at his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation taketh an oath to rule according to the laws of his kingdome, or a judge at his admiſſion ſweareth to give judgement according to theſe laws, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their oaths cannot be that they ſhall rule or judge according to them longer then they continue to be laws: But if any of them ſhall come afterwards to be lawfully repealed, both king and judge are free from ruling and judging according to ſuch of them as are thus lawfully repealed, notwithſtanding their originall oath. Since therfore if the firſt takers of that oath were now alive, they could not be ſaid to have abjured epiſcopall government, which hath been ſince eſtabliſhed by the lawes of this church and kingdome,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:158:5"/>
eſpecially conſidering that this church in her confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion holdeth church government to be alterable at the will of the church: certainly we repeating but their oath, cannot be ſaid to abiure that government now, more then they could be ſaid to do it if they were now alive and repeating the ſame oath.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, how can it be thought that the very act of his Maieſties commanding this oath ſhould make epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall government to be abiured by it, more then the covenanters requiring it of their aſſociats, in both co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants the words and ſyllables of the confeſſion of faith being the ſame? Now it is wel known that many were brought in to ſubſcribe their covenant, by the ſolemn proteſtations of the contrivers &amp; urgers of it, that they might ſubſcribe it without abiuring of epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacie, and other ſuch things as were eſtabliſhed by law, ſince the time that this oath was firſt invented and made; and the three Miniſters in their firſt anſwers to the Aberdene Quaeres have fully and clearly expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves to that ſenſe, holding theſe things for the preſent not to be abiured, but only referred to the triall of a free generall Aſſembly: and likewaies the adherers to the laſt proteſtation againſt his Majeſties proclamation, bearing date the 9. of September, in their ninth reaſon againſt the ſubſcription urged by his Maieſty, do plainly averre, that this oath urged by his Maieſty doth oblige the takers of it, <hi>to maintain Perth articles, and to maintain epiſcopacy.</hi> Why therefore ſome men ſwearing the ſame words &amp; ſyllables ſhould have their words taken to another ſenſe, &amp; be thought to abiure epiſcopall government, more then others who have taken the ſame oath in the ſame words, muſt needs paſſe the capacity of an ordinary under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:158:5"/>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, it is a received maxime, and <hi>it cannot bedenied, but that oaths miniſtred unto us muſt either be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, or elſe taken according to the known mind, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed intention, and expreſſe command of authority urging the ſame:</hi> A propoſition, not onely received in all ſchools, but poſitively ſet down by the adherers to the ſaid proteſtation <hi>totidem verbis</hi> in the place above cited. But it is notoriouſly known even unto thoſe who ſubſcribed the confeſſion of faith by his Majeſties commandment, that his Majeſtie not only in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of England and Ireland, is a maintainer and upholder of epiſcopall government according to the laws of the ſaid Churches and Kingdomes, but that likewaies he is a defender, and intends to continue a defender of the ſame government in his kingdome of Scotland, both before the time, and at the time when he urged this oath, as is evident by that which is in my Lord Commiſſioner his preface, both concerning his Majeſties inſtructions to his Grace, and his Graces expreſſing his Majeſties mind, both to the Lords of Councell, and to the Lords of Seſſion; and the ſame likewaies is plainly expreſſed and acknowledged by the adherers to the ſaid proteſtation in the place above cited: their words being theſe; <hi>And it is moſt manifeſt that his Majeſties mind, intention, and commandment, is no other but that the confeſsion be ſworn, for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of religion as it is already or preſently profeſſed (theſe two being co-incident altogether one and the ſame, not only in our common form of ſpeaking, but in all his Majeſties proclamations) and thus as it includeth, and continueth within the compaſſe thereof, the foreſaids no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations and epiſcopacie, which under that name were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ratified, in the firſt parliament holden by his Majeſty.</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:158:6"/>
From whence it is plaine, that epiſcopacie not being taken away or ſuſpended by any of his Majeſties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, as theſe other things were which they call novations, it muſt needs both in deed, and in the judgment of the ſaid proteſters no waies be intended by his Majeſtie to be abjured by the ſaid oath. Now both the <hi>major</hi> and that part of the <hi>minor</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth epiſcopall government in the Church of Scotland, being cleerly acknowledged by the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and the other part of the <hi>minor</hi> concerning that government in his other two kingdomes being noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly known, not only to them, but to all others who know his Majeſty, how it can be imagined that his Majeſty by that oath ſhould command epiſcopacy to be abjured, or how any one to whom his Majeſties mind concerning epiſcopall government was known, could honeſtly or ſafely abjure it, let it be left to the whole world to judge, eſpecially conſidering that the proteſters themſelves in that place above cited, by a <hi>dilemma,</hi> which we leave to themſelves to anſwer, have averred, that when that act of councell ſhould come out, yet that it could not be inferred from thence that any ſuch thing was abjured.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly and laſtly, if the explanation in that act of councell be taken in that not only rigid but unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and ſenſeleſſe ſenſe which they urge, yet they can never make it appear, that epiſcopall government at the firſt time of the adminiſtring of that oath was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed: The very words of that confeſſion of faith, immediately after the beginning of it, being theſe, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, beleeved, defended by many and ſundry notable kirks and Realms, but chiefly by the kirk of Scotland, the Kings Majeſtie and three Eſtates of this realme, as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:158:6"/>
Gods eternall truth &amp; only ground of our ſalvation, &amp;c.</hi> By which it is evident, that the ſubſcription to this confeſſion of faith is to be urged in no other ſenſe then as it was then beleeved and received by the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, and the three Eſtates of this realme at that time in being; and it is well known, that at that time Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Abbots and Priors made up a third eſtate of this realm, which gave approbation to this confeſſion of faith: and therefore it is not to be conceived, that this third eſtate did then abjure epiſcopacie, or that epiſcopacie was at the firſt ſwearing of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion aboliſhed. But ſay that at that time it was abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by acts of generall Aſſembly, yet was it not ſo by any act of Parliament, nay by many acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it was in force, becauſe none of them was repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſome whereof are annexed in the ſheet immediatly after theſe reaſons, which we pray the reader care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to peruſe and ponder: and at the very time of the taking of this oath and after, biſhops, whoſe names are well known, were in being. Now it is to be hoped that in a Monarchy or any other well conſtituted repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, that damnable Jeſuiticall poſition ſhall never take place, That what is once enacted by a Monarch &amp; his three eſtates in Parliament, ſhall ever be held repealed or repealable by any eccleſiaſticall nationall Synod.</p>
            <p>By all which it is evident, that the explanation of that act of councell ſo groundleſly urged, can induce no man to imagine that by the confeſſion of faith late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſworn by his Majeſties commandment, epiſcopall government, which then did, and yet doth ſtand eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by acts of this Church and Kingdome, either was, or poſſibly could be abjured.</p>
            <p>And having now (good Reader) heard his Majeſties
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:158:7"/>
minde in his inſtructions to us, our minde in requiring in his Majeſties name this oath to be taken, and theſe few reaſons of many which do evidently evince the inconſequence of that ſenſe which without any ſhow of inference is put upon it by thoſe, who would go on in making men ſtill beleeve, that all which they do or ſay is grounded upon authority, though they themſelvs do well know the contrary; we ſuppoſe that all they who have taken this oath will reſt ſatisfied that they have not abjured epiſcopal government, and that they who ſhall take it, will take it in no other ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Which timely warning of ours, we are the more willing to give, becauſe we are given to underſtand, that even they who were wont to call the takers of this oath (notwithſtanding of that explanation by act of councell) perjured and damned perſons, and in their pulpits called the urging of it the depth of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, do now mean to take it themſelves, and urge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to take it in that ſenſe which they make men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve (though wrongfully) that act of councell makes advantageous to their ends.</p>
            <p>But we do in his Majeſties name require that none preſume to take the ſaid oath, unleſſe they be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo to do by ſuch as ſhall have lawfull authority from his Majeſtie to adminiſter it unto them: being confident, that none either will or can take the ſaid oath or any other oath in any ſenſe, which may not conſiſt with epiſcopall government, having his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties ſenſe, and ſo the ſenſe of all lawfull authority fully explained to them.</p>

ratified in the parliament 1579. cap. 68. whereby it is declared, <hi>That the miniſters of the bleſſed Evangel of Jeſus Chriſt, whom God of his mercie hath now raiſed up amongſt us, or hereafter ſhall raiſe, agreeing with them that now live in doctrine or adminiſtration of the ſacraments, and the people of this realme that profeſſe Chriſt as he is now offered in his Evangel, and do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the holy ſacraments, as in the reformed kirks of this realme they are publickly adminiſtrate, according to the confeſsion of the faith, to be the only true and holy kirk of Jeſus Chriſt within this realme;</hi> without any exception by reaſon of policy and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, declaring only ſuch as either gain-ſay the word of the Evangel according to the heads of the ſaid confeſſion, or refuſe the participation of the holy ſacraments as they are now miniſtrate, to be no members of the ſaid kirk ſo long as they keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo divided from the ſociety of Chriſts body.

               <p>This is likewaies evident by the oath to be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to the king at his coronation, by the eighth act of the ſaid parliament, wherby he is to ſwear <hi>to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the true religion of Jeſus Chriſt, the preaching of his holy word, and due and right miniſtration of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments now received and preached within this realm, and ſhall aboliſh and gain-ſtand all falſe religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſame;</hi> without ſwearing to any innovation of policie and diſcipline of the kirk.</p>
