            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE REPRESENTATION OR DEFENCE OF Collonel <hi>Nathaniell Barton</hi> (a Member of this preſent Parliament.) Occaſioned by the Petition of Sir <hi>SAM<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>EL SLEIGH</hi> Knight, Which Repreſentation is humbly tendered to the Conſideration of this Honourable Aſſembly of PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <p>THere are three things by the Petitioner ſuggeſted, as the grounds why I ſhould be diſabled from ſitting in this Parliament, though freely and clearly elected by the County of <hi>Derby,</hi> and approved by his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Councill.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There is a complaint of ſome undue proceedings in the Election.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That I Preach publiquely in <hi>Derby,</hi> and receive ſome benefit thereby.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That I am a Miniſter now in Orders.</p>
            <p>As to undue proceedings in the Election, were it not that I conſider before whom I ſpeak it, my anſwer to this ſhould be in ſuch an expreſſion, as the ſuggeſtion doth deſerve: But it is well known, that the generality of the Electors of this County, were pleaſed to make choice of me, in the firſt place, and accordingly by the Sheriff I was returned: And in my Election, as alſo in the Election of two other perſons (more worthy then my ſelf) there was none that ſo much as openly demanded the Pole at all, in relation to Sir <hi>Samuel Sleigh</hi>; And for this, let the Country ſpeak, I beleeve there were
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58101:2"/>
               <hi>Mille teſtes.</hi> Indeed when the firſt Three were choſen, and publiquely aſſented to without queſtion, Sir <hi>Samuel Sleigh</hi> came into Nomination with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Gell,</hi> which of them ſhould be the Fourth. Diviſion of the Electors being made in the Market-place, the Majority appeared to be ſo clearly on M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Gell</hi>'s ſide, that both the Sheriff and other indifferent ſpectators were fully ſatisfied; yet the Pole being deſired, was by the Sheriff forthwith yielded to, and proceeded upon. The Petitioner loſt it (as I do remember) by about fourty voices, and had loſt it by many more, had he not been well befriended by the Town of <hi>Derby,</hi> many of whom came in at laſt to help: And therefore I wonder that this Gentleman, the Petitioner, ſhould ſo publiquely make that his allegation, which is ſo obvious to contradiction.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond, That I Preach publiquely in <hi>Derby,</hi> and receive ſome benefit thereby. 'Tis true, I do Preach pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely in <hi>Derby:</hi> But is publique Preaching become a crime in the Petitioners ſenſe? I do believe that many others as well as my ſelf, both in Civil and Military capacities, have Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed publiquely, which will not upon that account be the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er diſenabled to do their Country ſervice. But it is alleadged that I have ſome benefit thereby: In anſwer to this, I crave leave to ſay thus much, That my eſtate (though mean e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, yet it) is not ſo mean, that I am neceſſitated to Preach for Twenty pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> neither is my conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo obſcure, and intereſt ſo weak, but that, if I would have Preacht for advantage, I might have had long ſince a fairer in-come by Preaching, then ſuch a Salary. When as I was in motion as a Souldier in <hi>Englands</hi> ſervice, I have preacht in very many, if not moſt Counties in <hi>England</hi> (and freely too) and this not to oppoſe, but to ſecond the faithfull Miniſters of the Goſpel where ere I came. And this County knows, how often for this Dozen years I have Preacht without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; and therefore, with farre better ground then it can be objected againſt me, I can (yet in much ſincerity) averre it, that the ground why I undertook the Lecture at <hi>Derby,</hi> is that I might have a publique place to Preach in for a farre better end then outward gain: This Objection may indeed bring a blot upon me (whether in the Petitioners de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign or no I will not ſay) among carnal men, and ſuch as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58101:2"/>
ſcorn the Goſpel; but I am confident, it cannot in the leaſt degree prejudice me before this Honourable Aſſembly: And I am ſure, the Inſtrument of Government which laies down qualifications of being elected, doth not not exempt a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from being choſen to ſerve in Parliament.</p>
            <p>But the main thing Objected is, that I am in holy Orders and ſo diſabled by an Act of Parliament 17<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
               <hi>Caroli.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I ſhall in all humility crave leave to offer divers things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I count it a comfort (I ſhall not preſume to call it an honour) to me, that in all the difficulties, dangers and temptations that have attended <hi>Englands</hi> ſervice for theſe many years; at laſt my Charge, and that before a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is, that I am in holy Orders. The proof of this Charge it ſeems is put upon my ſelf: for it is ſtrongly affirmed, that it hath been mine own Confeſſion and Acknowledgement, that I am in Orders: Whether this <hi>in foro publico,</hi> be proof enough to ground a judgement on, I leave it to the learned to determine: or whether (in caſe that holy Orders be a Crime) to put the Delinquent upon Confeſſion, be not ſomething hard, I ſhall onely query, not conclude; And did I think, that holy Orders were a Crime, I ſhould hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deſire, that a fuller proof might be made by the Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, then yet I underſtand hath been produced. But I never did, nor for ought I can ſee as yet, ever ſhall, count Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, even by Biſhops, as to the ſubſtance of it (ſetting aſide ſome groundleſs and frivolous Circumſtances) to be a Crime. And yet almoſt <hi>a cunabulis,</hi> I have been principled againſt Epiſcopacy, as it was ſtated and exerciſed in this Nation: For I have not forgotten ſince I was a childe, that I then was ſenſible of my Fathers ſeveral times ſuffering un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Epiſcopal tyranny. And becauſe my own occaſional and in private Confeſſion, is urged againſt me, I humbly beg par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for ſaying a word, as to the Petitioners confeſſion too, that I have heard this Gentleman that now petitions againſt me, ſomething publiquely to confeſſe, or rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe his judgement for Epiſcopacy and Common-prayer Book.</p>
            <p>Upon the ground above-mentioned, I ſhall not forbear freely to acknowledge and own it, before this Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58101:3"/>
Aſſembly of Parliament, that not long before the Warres broke forth in <hi>England,</hi> I was Ordained by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Wright</hi> at <hi>Lichfield,</hi> yet happily it deſerves enquiry. And that</p>
            <p>Firſt, Whether I am within the Letter of that Act of 17. <hi>Caroli.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſecondly, it is more to be queſtioned, Whether I am or no within the grounds deſign and ſcope of that Act.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, If I were within the compaſs of one or both, yet through Gods good providence, and mercy to me, in the ſervice of my Countrey, I am cloath'd with ſuch Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations that I ſee no Cauſe to fear to appear in Parliament, or to plead my Cauſe againſt this Petitioner, in the greateſt preſence in this world. All which I humbly crave leave to produce, and then with all due reverence, I ſhall ſubmit to the juſt determination of this Honourable Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>And firſt, I crave leave to query, How far? and whether I am at all within the Letter of that Act? I conceive, it is obvious, that the Act of the 17. <hi>Caroli</hi> was made againſt Arch-biſhops and Biſhops principally, who ſate then in, and as Members of the Houſe of Lords: and they muſt ſit there, either upon a ſingle ſcore, as Peers, or repreſenting the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of this Nation, and none elſe. But for ought I could ever learn, that neither Biſhops ſate then in the Houſe of Lords as Repreſenters of the people; neither did any Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter at all ſit in the Houſe of Commons, as choſen by, and a Repreſenter of the people: For a man in holy Orders, to be choſen by his Countrey to ſit in the Houſe of Commons, I do beleeve (when that Act was made) was not <hi>in rerum Natura:</hi> And it cannot be imagined that an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhould be directed againſt a <hi>Non Ens; Ex malis mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus naſcuntur leges:</hi> If I be not miſtaken, Acts of Parliament are made to ſuppreſs appearing evils; they are not Prophetick, not directed againſt that which is not in view, but only <hi>in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiâ remotâ</hi> or <hi>eſſe poſſibili,</hi> and therefore not under debate. But further, let me humbly offer, that ſince that Act, Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy it ſelf, with all its pomp and intereſt, is root and branch diſanulled, and that by Law: Now the Act in queſtion is believed to be a Parliamentary ſuperſtructure impoſed upon Epiſcopacy, and intended as a clog, to keep down
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58101:3"/>
Epiſcopal power from ſoaring higher, as to draw it down ſome pins lower. In that therefore Epiſcopacy it ſelf is thrown out of doors (to which that Act doth relate) and not ſo much as a Toleration granted in the Government; whether the Act it ſelf <hi>ex conſequenti</hi> doth not ceaſe in its operation, I humbly do ſubmit it.</p>
            <p>One thing more I would preſent in this place, that when that Act was made, Church-Government and holy Orders were in force and power: But ſince, Ordination it ſelf by Biſhops, to be practiſed <hi>de novo,</hi> is diſallowed, yea Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Miniſters of the Goſpel alone, is much impugned: I might adde the Paſtoral Care of ſouls is frequently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by thoſe that will not own Ordination, neither in the former nor in the later ſenſe, and this undertaken by ſome (as I have heard) who do openly renounce (at leaſt Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal) Ordination in themſelves: Holy Orders then was a Law and binding, and the Act in queſtion I do believe doth ſuppoſe them ſo: But now I do not know any Law in force, at leaſt ſo put in execution, as to require thoſe that take the Charge of ſouls upon them to be Ordained: (I ſpeak in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to humane Laws only) for as to Ordination its Law and force upon a higher account, it is not my work here to ſpeak; yet I ſay, Ordination-Law was then in force; And if Ordination be not now in force as it was when the Act was made (for uſual practiſe ſpeaks the contrary,) but doth ſeem to ſuffer much in the main concernments of it; I know not how my Caſe can directly fall within the Letter of that Act: For Ordination as it was a required-introduction to a Paſtorall Charge, is either null in Law, or binding and not null. If it be not in force by preſent Laws and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but in ſome ſort null, how can uſe be made of Orders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, in the Caſe in queſtion? If Orders be not null, but by Law in force properly, then, Orders are binding to all in <hi>England</hi> that are or are to be Preachers as well as my ſelf; ſo as not to be permitted uſually and in publike to preach with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it: And thus, it is confeſt, that this Act relating to Orders eſtabliſhed by Law, doth ſeem litterally to take place. But when the preſent ſtate of things in <hi>England,</hi> doth ſeem to let Ordination fall, or but admit it under toleration, that at this time Holy-Orders ſhould be kept alive, or have life put into
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58101:4"/>
them to ſtrike me dead as to the ſervice of my Country in any politick conſideration, doth (and yet I deſire to ſpeak it with ſubmiſſion) to me ſeem ſomething, if not very ſtrange.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, That I am not within the compaſſe of the grounds, deſign, and ſcope of that Act, may happily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to this honourable Aſſembly, by obſerving ſome of the grounds themſelves; And to make a little way to this, I beg leave to offer it, that even in Courts of Juſtice I have ſometimes obſerved Acts to be interpreted principally accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their grounds, <hi>Summum jus ſumma injuria</hi>; To go by exact letter of the Law doth ſometimes ſtrike too hard upon the innocent; And hence I humbly do conceive that in prudent reaſon and originally was founded the Court of Chancery; and when the Letter ſtrikes and the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth not reach, the caſe then affords a naturall occaſion for a Freeborn Engliſhman to appeal to the higheſt Court of Chancery on earth (I mean the Parliament:) I do remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that in the Biſhops times, whereas there was a Law made againſt Recuſants for not coming to Church, though the ſcope and deſign of that Law was intended againſt Papiſts, and not againſt godly and conſciencious Proteſtants, yet the Biſhops and others finding theſe within the Letter of that Law, did bring divers of them within the penalty thereof for abſenting from their Pariſh Church, though ſometimes there was nothing there but Common-Praier Book Service; read by ſome ignorant, ſottiſh, and drunken fellows (for Miniſters I cannot call them.) This was <hi>Englands</hi> grievance, that whereas a Law was made againſt Popiſh Recuſants, the edge thereof was turned againſt Conſciencious Proteſtants: How farre this inſtance is applicable to, doth illuſtrate and help the caſe in hand; I lay it at the feet of this Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Aſſembly. And this Act it ſelf doth encourage me to expect that in my caſe it ſhall be interpreted according to the meaning, more then according to the Letter of it, For in the cloſe thereof it doth declare, that any thing done by perſons in holy Orders ſhall be made void, but it is only of thoſe things [<hi>that are contrary to the purport and true meaning of this preſent Act.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Now for the purport and meaning of this Act; In read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58101:4"/>
of it I do obſerve firſt that this Act was grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on [<hi>his</hi> (late) <hi>Majeſties religious care of the Church and the ſouls of his people</hi>] His late Majeſties care of ſouls was well known; And the then Parliaments care of ſouls is not to be queſtioned by me. But it was at leaſt profeſſed care of ſouls, that did produce this Act, that ſo the good of ſouls ſhould not be hindered, it was enacted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But what is this to the caſe in queſtion? It's true, I have ſome ſpeciall care of ſouls as a Maſter of a Family, and as a Chriſtian neighbour ſhould have ſome watch over my brother; And if this care of ſouls doth diſenable me from ſitting, I beleeve there would be very few found to ſit in Parliament; For other cure of ſouls I have none, and for prejudice to ſouls, which the Act doth ſeem to hint, I know none occaſioned by my ſelf at all, which will appear the better in conſidering of the ſecond ground. And in the Act it is expreſſed thus, [<hi>The Office of the Miniſtry being of ſuch great importance that it will take up the whole man</hi>;] Which I fully grant: And I well remember what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, ſpeaking of this Office, <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> yet I finde <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, and that without ſcandal or prejudice of ſouls, in caſe of neceſſity, labouring in that craft of Tent-making: That <hi>Englands</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and this Counties neceſſity did put a ſword into my hands, and called me at firſt to act in ſome civill capacities, will afterwards appear. I do obſerve, that the Act ſtiles the Miniſtry an Office, and I pray that alwaies in <hi>England</hi> and In the Church of Chriſt it may be owned ſo: This Office is of ſuch great importance that it will take up the whole man: But this Office, unleſſe there be <hi>materia ſubſtrata,</hi> a preſent charge to apply it ſelf unto, cannot be ſaid ſo properly, to take up the whole man; The Office of a Miniſter I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is of a relative conſideration, and being taken in <hi>actu exercito,</hi> as having relation to a paſtorall charge, or that which is uſually called cure of ſouls, ſo it will take up the whole man. I never was inveſted either with Parſonage, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carage, or Donative, and am not at this hour inveſted with either, neither have I ever undertaken the charge of any of thoſe (which are called) ſelect Congregations, but am at this very time a private member of a Congregation in <hi>Derby.</hi> It hath alwaies been againſt my principle <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58101:5"/>
meddle in other mens Cures; I have none of mine own, but the deſign of the Act is evident, that thoſe in holy Orders were to be diſenabled to ſit in Parliament, that ſouls might not be neglected, that Miniſters might not be taken off from that great important duty of watching over thoſe ſouls com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their charge.</p>
            <p>A third ground of the Act is [<hi>for that it is found by long experience that their intermedling with ſecular juriſdictions hath occaſioned great miſchief both to Church and State.</hi>] It is not my work to rip up the miſchiefs that Epiſcopal men did to Church and State by medling with ſecular juriſdiction; I beleeve they did as much miſchief in their ſpirituall as in their ſecular juriſdiction, and therefore were juſtly deprived of both, yet I do beleeve if they had not been obſerved to do miſchief, but to have emploied their power ſpirituall and ſecular to the benefit of Church and State, the Parliament would have ſuffered their double power to this day. What prejudice either to Church or State hath my intermedling with ſecular juriſdiction brought forth? If hazarding life, if loſing bloud, if endeavouring in my Countrey as a Juſtice to be in ſome meaſure to the praiſe of them that do well, and to the puniſhment of evil doers; If in the laſt Parliament oppoſing thoſe wilde and dangerous principles (ſo much ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of) be prejudicial to Church and State, then am I guilty: And if I had been in any ſecular employment prejudiciall to Church or State, I make no queſtion but it would have been inſerted in the Petition preferred againſt me.</p>
            <p>But the Act ſaith, <hi>That Biſhops and other perſons ought not to be entangled with ſecular juriſdiction</hi>; What an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſpeaks hath great influence upon me to command my outward man, and to leade, though not altogether compell my judgement, yet upon this occaſion; If I thought this Honourable Parliament would indulge an unworthy member ſo far; I would offer to conſideration that inſtance of <hi>Aaron,</hi> Exo. 24.14. where <hi>Moſes</hi> going up into the Mount to remain fourty daies, he ſaith unto the Elders [<hi>Tarry ye here for us until we come again unto you, and behold Aaron and Hur are with you; if any man have any matters to do let him come unto them</hi>;] Whether <hi>Aaron</hi> as well as <hi>Hur</hi> be not here delegated to take cognizance of civil cauſes, I leave it <hi>ſub judice</hi>; And
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58101:5"/>
whether <hi>Aaron</hi> at leaſt as a deputed Magiſtrate <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. was not concern'd to have hindred the golden Calf, I'le not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine; And when <hi>Moſes</hi> makes uſe of the Levites only, to put three thouſand to the Sword who had had an hand in that Idolatry, the queſtion is, whether this was the fruit of an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall or a civil cenſure. We reade of <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 Sam. 3.20. that he was eſtabliſhed to be a Prophet of the Lord, yet in <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.15. we finde that he judged <hi>Iſrael all the dayes of his life,</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>he went from year to year, in circuit to Bethel and Gilgal, and Mizpah, and judged Iſrael in all thoſe places</hi>;] If it be objected that there are no inſtances in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, It might be anſwered, that Magiſtracy it ſelf was not then in Chriſtian hands; But ſuppoſe there had been civil power in ſuch hands in <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothys</hi> time, and there had been a Councel or Parliament held, where Church as well as State affairs had been to be tranſacted, The Queſtion would be, Whether in caſe that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> had been choſen, whether the one or other ought not to have attended the truſt repoſed, or whether Chriſtian members would have rejected them?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If it were granted, that I am within the letter of this Act, yea, in ſome ſort within the ground and meaning of it, yet I have ſomething further, and that with ſuch advantage to offer, that I think I need not fear to pleade my caſe againſt the Petitioner, before this Honourable Aſſembly, or in any preſence in this world; And here firſt I ſhall referre my ſelf unto the Inſtrument which is ſtiled, <hi>The Government of the Common-wealth of England</hi>; Which Goveroment in the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Articles laies down the rules, who ſhall not be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being elected, and makes no exception of any in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Orders. That I come within the compaſſe of the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle I ſhall eaſily put the buſineſs to that iſſue; And in the 21<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article I finde theſe very words, <hi>That every perſon and perſons being ſo duely elected, and being approved of by the major part of the Councel, to be perſons not diſabled but qualified as aforeſaid, ſhall be eſteemed a Member of Parliament, and be admitted to ſit in Parliament, and not otherwiſe.</hi>] And accordingly I did paſſe with the approbation of the Councel: As the Government makes no exception as to any in Orders, ſo it makes proviſion for ſome to be capable of being elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58101:6"/>
to ſerve in this Parliament, notwithſtanding [<hi>they have aided, adviſed, aſſiſted, or abetted in any war againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſince</hi> Jan. 1. 1641. <hi>In caſe they have been ſince in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Parliament, and have given ſignal Teſtimony of their affection thereunto</hi>;] and this notwithſtanding former Acts or Ordinances of Parliament to the contrary. And hereupon I cannot but take leave yet in all humility to proſtrate this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Honourable Aſſembly; In that the Government is ſo tender of the ſervice of any done to the Parliament, in any, though a later ſeaſon, as that it doth not exempt thoſe from being choſen that haply formerly have ſhed bloud a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Parliament, and haply have ſhed the bloud of ſome of the Parliaments faithful Friends and ſervants; May not now my conſtant expres affections, and real hazards of my deareſt bloud againſt the common Enemy, from the beginning to the end, and this for the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> in equity and with much advantage (notwithſtanding that Act in reference to holy Orders) crave that the Parliament-dore may be open to me as well as to ſome others?</p>
            <p>And to ſhew that I have ſome little reaſon to preſent this laſt conſideration before this Honourable Aſſemby, I humbly beg the leave in the laſt place to offer ſome few particulars of that ſervice, that Providence hath cal'd me to, and Gods mercy hath carried me through, in the Service of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; And the rather becauſe now it is attempted, that I ſhould not be in a further capacity of ſerving of my Countrey; And I never thought that I ſhould thus have been (upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count) conſtrained to trouble this Parliament in ſpeaking for my ſelf: But I finde a patient <hi>Job</hi> making his defence, I finde alſo an holy ſelf-denying <hi>Paul</hi> forced to reckon up what he had done, therein pleading for himſelf; Sometimes the tongu-ſtrings of the dumb have been looſed, and I appeal to every perſon of honour and Engliſh Gentleman within thoſe Wals, whether it would not trouble an ingenuous ſpirit, after ſo many years faithful endeavours in his Countreys ſervice, to which he hath been called, and no intruder (as by and by will appear) to be now at laſt under an attempt to move this Parliament (whereof I am a member) to adjudge me in ſome ſort a Delinquent, and to deny me the priviledge and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of aſſerting that which according to my weak ability
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58101:6"/>
I have with thouſands better then my ſelf ſo long ſtrugled for: What I have therefore now to ſay is not without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy, and forced from me by that Gentleman who would Petition me out of Parliament, that he might be admitted, whether he or I have in times of danger done this Countrey and <hi>England</hi> better ſervice, let all that know us ſpeak; yea, this County hath ſpoken its apprehenſions in this ſufficiently by the late Election; And in ſpeaking this, whatever I may ſeem to ſome, yet I hope that in the ſight of God my heart doth not give way to any arrogance at all.</p>
            <p>Even before the Standard was ſet up at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> I was ſo farre obſerved to own and declare for the Parliament, that I had notice given me, that ſome of the then intended Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, in theſe parts did threaten to hew me in pieces: It is well known, how induſtrious I was, both to procure Moneys, to be lent on the Propoſitions, and encourage men, to engage in the ſervice at the very firſt. And in 1643. removing from <hi>Derby,</hi> with (then Lievetenant Collonel <hi>Sanders)</hi> to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon at <hi>Burton</hi> upon <hi>Trent</hi>; ſoon after with Collonel <hi>Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> (now S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Richard Haughton)</hi> Lievtenant Col. <hi>Sanders</hi> and many others in that Garriſon, we were by aſſault taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, and my ſelf not only wounded but ſtript of all I had, yea almoſt to nakedneſſe. The enemy ſoon knowing what I was, did make me a publike ſcorn in the Queens Army (parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars too long to be related,) but by the good providence of God, I was again at liberty; and not long after, when this County was at loweſt, the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtles</hi> Army prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every where in the North; and being in the bowels of this County; Collonel <hi>Sanders</hi> (a worthy member of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) being about to raiſe a Regiment of Horſe in and about the Garriſon of <hi>Derby,</hi> was pleaſed (without deſire of mine) to offer me a Commiſſion for a Troop of Horſe, a ſervice and truſt then, I was very unfit for: But being encouraged to take a Commiſſion, I preſently found divers honeſt men willing to engage under my Command: Divers brought in their Horſes and Arms with them; divers well-affected perſons that knew me did lend, and others did ſend in their Horſes to me; ſo that ſuddenly I had a conſiderable foundation of that, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards became a full Troop; and had no other Recruits af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, either of Horſe or Arms, then what my Men with
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58101:7"/>
my ſelf could get from the enemy. What ſervice and often ſervice my Troop did in this Country, with other Troops, and this when <hi>Derby</hi> was ſurrounded with Garriſons of the enemy, is well known. I wear the Marks of the ſervice of this County upon me: and when <hi>England</hi> was low and this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was almoſt overrun, the Gentleman that now petitioneth againſt me, would never deſire me to forbear, or petition againſt my intermedling with ſecular affairs, becauſe I was in holy Orders: Once, God, was pleaſed to give me that ſucceſſe againſt the enemy, cloſe by the petitioners own door, that might have deſerved his reſpect, and not ſuch an Attempt againſt me: Sure he hath forgotten his then backwardneſſe to ſerve his Country, and that, he who would now ſequeſter me from this Countries ſervice, was himſelf once under an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of being ſequeſtred for ſomething elſe: what ground there was, he beſt knowes.</p>
            <p>When this County was cleared of the enemies Garriſons, from ſome hard meaſure of ſome in power of our own ſide, I was forced (with the licenſe and recommendation of Collonel <hi>Sanders,</hi> from whom I had my Commiſſion) with my Troop in 1645. to repair to the ſtanding Army; where, by the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> the then Lord Generall, through the favourable mediation of my Lord Protector that now is, I with my Troop was entertained. For my perſonal carriage and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of my Troop, and endeavours as to the Regiment, when I was called to be Major of it, under Collonel <hi>Scroop</hi>; it is well known, to perſons of Honour in the Houſe? This I found, that my ſervice in the Army, was to me a kind of recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, in compariſon of hardſhip endured before. Yet in the Army (not to mention other things) I was perſonally em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in two ſervices of concernment to this Nation in the ſecond Warre: The firſt was in <hi>Wales,</hi> when <hi>Laughorns</hi> Army was routed by an handfull of men: my Lord Protector, then Lievtenant Generall, when he came up to <hi>Pembrooke,</hi> was ſo farre ſenſible of my ſhare in that ſervice, as that when he firſt ſaw me, he told me, That he was as glad to ſee me, as if I had been his brother. The ſecond ſervice was in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Hambletons</hi> numerous Army: It is well known when Collonel <hi>Thorney</hi> was ſlain (and upon that, the Vanne ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſordered) who came in, and with his Troop charged
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58101:7"/>
the enemies Rear-guard and put him to a retreat to the body of their remaining Army then not farre off. And upon Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday following at <hi>Winwicke,</hi> in the hot diſpute about that paſs, when Major <hi>Cholmely</hi> was mortally wounded (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the forlorn:) it is not forgotten, who with thoſe men under his command, and in the head of them, did receive the enemies ſhot for an hour together, in which ſervice near Twenty (as I do remember) of my own Troop were woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, of which wounds ſome died, and ſome are maimed to this day. I need not mention, how I was hated and endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered by the Levelling party, which was ſeaſonably ſuppreſt at <hi>Burford.</hi> Though I was in Orders, then as much as now, yet my Lord Protector was pleaſed to honour me, with the Command of a Regiment of Horſe, for <hi>Ireland</hi>; and being not capable of going at that time, the late Lord Deputy <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> took that Regiment to himſelf; and there is a worthy Gentleman now in the Houſe, was pleaſed for a ſhort time, in relation to that Regiment, to own me as his Collonel.</p>
            <p>Having for that time laid down Arms, I was put into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Peace in this County; to which ſervice that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured late Lord Deputy <hi>Ireton</hi> himſelf was pleaſed to move me a year before, yet for a time I waved it, and had not underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to act in that capacity, had there not been very few (though in Commiſſion) who then would act as Juſtices in this County: and how forward the Petitioner himſelf was, even then, to do his Country ſervice is well known.</p>
            <p>Though I was in Orders, yet I was by the Gentlemen of this Country nominated to the Councel of State, to have the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Militia; and accordingly by Commiſſion from the Councel of State, was in the year 1650, conſtituted Commander in chief of the Militia-Horſe and Foot of this County of <hi>Derby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Worceſter</hi>-fight, though I was in Orders, my Lord Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor under his own hand, did intruſt me, for a time, with the Command of 1500 Horſe and Dragoons, to ſecure the paſs at <hi>Bewdley,</hi> beſides the intended addition of <hi>Shropſhire</hi> and <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire</hi>-forces: What ſervice was done by theſe, the Act for the day of Thankſgiving for that glorious Victory doth mention. The ſervice being over, I returned home, and was disbanded, and did apply my ſelf to ſerve my Country in what I could. Not long after this, as I was informed, there was two of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58101:8"/>
that at <hi>London</hi> did make an attempt againſt me in this Caſe of Orders: the one was ſince arraigned for poyſoning of a man, the other hath been indited, and I think I may ſay convicted for Barretry, both notorious to thoſe that know them: But their attempt came to nothing: For my Lord Protector by Collonel <hi>Sanders</hi> was acquainted with it; who was pleaſed (as I heard) to declare his opinion, That, that Act was intended againſt Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, and that it did not comprehend me, or to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>When the long Parliament was diſſolved, and my Lord Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector and his Councel of Officers, were upon the nomination of perſons to be called to the late Aſſembly or Parliament; my Lord Protector (notwithſtanding my being in Orders,) was pleaſed himſelf to nominate me, as one to appear for this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Derby,</hi> and under his Hand and Seal, did ſummon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire my perſonal appearance, to take upon me my ſhare in that ſecular imployment: And being in that Parliament, I have many worthy witneſſes now in the Houſe, of my conſtant and reſolute oppoſing thoſe dangerous principles that were then in working. It is well known, that when the Vote for the new body of the Law was paſſed in the affirmative, I could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but (though ſomething irregularly) did make an open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt againſt it. When that Aſſembly was diſſolved, I came home to live privately amongſt my neighbours, untill a Writ came down into this County, for an election of Members to ſerve in this Parliament: after which divers came to me to know whether I would ſtand; I anſwered I would not ſtand for it; there were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations given from all parts of the Country, of a deſire, that I ſhould be one: I am ſure, I told divers that wiſht me well, that I would not thank them for it; yet I ſhall not forget their favour and good opinion of me while I breathe.</p>
            <p>I was not choſen, becauſe I was in Orders or a Miniſter, for upon that account there was farre more able then my ſelf: But this County choſe me upon the grounds above-mentioned: And there is ſomething in it, that whereas the Petitioner is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to give me no other ſtile then <hi>Nathaniel Barton</hi> Clerk (ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing even that Military title, that the ſervice and unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable authority hath formerly confer'd upon me,) Yet the Clerk (in the Petitioners ſenſe) was with much affection expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Electors, choſen to ſerve as a Knight for the County of <hi>Derby:</hi> And yet if ever I be ſo happy, as to ſee a Church-government
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58101:8"/>
according to the word of God ſetled in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I hope I ſhall then ſoon diſcover which ſervice I moſt eſteem and preferre.</p>
            <p>Shall I preſume with the pardon of this Grave Aſſembly to ſpeak but once more in way of alluſion: I read of <hi>Eſther,</hi> though ſhe was an Alien, yet, out of her affection to her peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, did amongſt Heathens adventure upon the breach of a known Law, and caſt her ſelf upon the favour of an Heathen King, ſaying before-hand, <hi>If I periſh: I periſh:</hi> I confeſs my caſe in degree doth come ſhort of this, <hi>Mille-paraſangis,</hi> yet in the kind, it may admit a parallel.</p>
            <p>I bleſs the Lord, I can ſay it, and ſay it from my heart, That out of my affection to my native Country, and to the wellfare of Gods people in this Nation, I have worn a ſword, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered divers calls to ſecular employments; and have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be aſhamed of either. Out of my well-wiſhes to the good people of this Nation, I came unto this Parliament, and finde a Law objected againſt me: I come before you with better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage then <hi>Eſther</hi> could come before <hi>Ahaſuerus.</hi> I look upon you as, and know you to be, a Chriſtian Parliament; And I am confident you will look upon me not as an alien or captive, but as a Free-born Engliſhman, and one that hath proved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf no leſſe, and therefore I hope I need no naturalization that may make me capable of having my ſhare in <hi>Englands</hi> immunities and freedoms, and of wearing the favour of my Countreys confidence in, and good affections to me; If I am a tranſgreſſor it is for and not againſt the publike Intereſt of this Nation; If <hi>Eſther</hi> found the Scepter of favour to be held forth unto her; why may not I be confident of it from a Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, many of whoſe worthy Members do ſo well know me.</p>
            <p>The common Enemy hath a good while ſince had an Act of Oblivion for what he hath done againſt this Nation; I cannot but be confident that this Honourable Aſſembly will never ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate me to crave an Act of Indempnity for what I have done for this Nation, whereas others have their rewards and finde acceptance; If notwithſtanding this my defence againſt that Petition, you proceed to vote, and your vote ſhould paſs againſt me: Would not thoſe that are mine enemies for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ſake; Would not thoſe that envy me for that favour this County hath caſt upon me, be gratified? Would not Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58101:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Drunkards and prophane perſons; who have in ſome meaſure been diſcountenanced, take occaſion to inſult and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce? Would not many of <hi>Englands</hi> faithfull friends, that choſe me and thoſe that know me, be diſcouraged? Would it not put a temptation upon mine own heart, to be wounded in the houſe of my Friends, and forſaken there: Yet if it ſhould be ſo (which I cannot ſee any cauſe to ſuſpect,) then, I hope my God would take me up, and he that hath given me an heart in ſome poor meaſure to act for him and his cauſe, will bear up my ſpirit and refreſh me with his comforts. Should I at laſt ſuffer in expreſſing my affections to the land of my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; I ſhall ſay no more, but having in the firſt place com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted my perſon and my cauſe unto the Lord Jehovah, who knows my heart in what I have ſaid, is the God of ſpirits, and judgeth among the gods. In the next place, with all humility I ſubmit my ſelf, and what I have been neceſſitated to plead in my own defence, unto the wiſe, juſt and equitable cenſure of this Honourable Aſſembly.</p>
