         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>IT is not that this little Piece is thought
to deſerve ſo Great a Patron, that it
preſumes to wear your Lordſhips Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very:
But as <hi>Epicurus</hi> neither Worſhip'd
the Gods for any good he expected from
them, nor feared them for any harm they
could do him, but Ador'd them for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency

Troubleſom: And relating to Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs

to apply it ſelf, as to your Lordſhip,
whoſe ſteddy Maxims, and direct Counſels,
have in a ſhort time put out of breath, a
Head-ſtrong, Pamper'd, and unruly Faction,
more then all the Doublings, Windings and
Turnings of ſome Apiſh Politicians could
have done in an Age. Your Services to the
Crown, and Merits from the Nation are ſo
great, that Time and the Memory of them
muſt be of equal Durance: And but to
mention them here, would appear groſs Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery;
a Crime, which could the Dedicator
be guilty of, it muſt be meerly for guilt
ſake; ſince Fortune has placed him below
Hope, and his ſmall Philoſophy beyond
Fear: But your Lordſhip's Admirers being

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>IT ſeems to be a kind of Law of our Natures, that
our Minds ſhould be often buſied about things, which
do not immediately, or perhaps not at all, relate to
our own proper Happineſs, which is an Extravagancy we
find nothing but Man infected with; Other Creatures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
and indeavours being confin'd to their Neceſſities or
Pleaſures: But this afflicting quality of ours, never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
ſo much a Diſeaſe amongst us, as when it is imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unſeaſonably in matters of Government; nor never, I
believe, was more Infectious in one Nation, then it hath
been lately in ours. To ſearch for the Cauſe, or preſcribe
a Remedy, would in a Man of my Station only prove it
Epidemical, and my ſelf full of the Tokens: But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
being one of theſe thinking things, I have followed
the Dictates of my Being. And meeting with this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in <hi>French,</hi> have made the Senſe of it <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I had
no purpoſe in doing ſo, but that being retir'd and indiſpos'd,
I had nothing elſe to do; I publiſh it, as well to ſhew the
Pride and Inſolence of Humane Nature, when Ignorance
is poſſeſt of Abſolute Power, as the Diſſimulation, Fraud,
and Corruption of any Sect, who pretend to be God's Elect,
or only choſen People, which the <hi>Mumelans</hi> do: Such
<pb facs="tcp:95291:4"/>
ever claim, by the Title of Gods Children, a right to every
thing; and conſequently think nothing unjuſt that puts
them in poſseſſion of their own. <q>There may too by this
piece (as the <hi>French</hi> Tranſlator ſaith) be ſeen, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
manner of Negotiating with the Turks; their Pride
and good Fortune; and the Judgment of God upon the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
who contribute ſo unreaſonably to the increaſe of a
Power which tends to nothing ſo much as to their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</q>
The Government of that People, though Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
ſhall not be cenſured by me, ſince I never read they
imployed the Terrible Mute and Bow-ſtring on any Man,
who like my ſelf, pretended to no Power amongſt them.
Nor indeed can I diſcern the difference of being Nooz'd
without noiſe or with it: for if I am unjuſtly to be put
to Death, Twelve Mutes or Twelve ſworn Enemies to
me or my Principles, who can talk me to a Hangman, are
all one. And I have cauſe to believe ſome wretches we
have heard of, might have been making Silver Bullets,
and charging Guns without Powder there till Dooms-day,
before their Names had been Regiſtred amongst unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Stateſmen: But it is no miracle in <hi>England,</hi> that
poor crawling Creatures ſhould be rankt amongſt Politicians,
and buſie their no Brains about Turning of States and
Kingdoms; ſince it is to ſuch, under the notion of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that all our half-witted Republicans Appeal, in their
whims of Reformation: But that Peſtilence being a little
ſtopt at preſent, I hope will never in my time ſo rage again,
as to be the moſt devouring of Plagues, which it prov'd to
be within theſe laſt Fourty Years. So</p>

LETTER
FROM
One of the Principal Officers of the GRAND
VIZIR, Written to a
PACHA,
Concerning the Buſineſs of Monſieur
Guilleragues.</head>
            <p>HAVING proſtrated my Face to the Ground, and being
Rub'd with the duſt of the Feet of my very good and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Lord; to whom God will grant a proſperous End: I
ſhall give him an Account of what hath Arrived to the
Glory of our moſt Invincible Emperour, King of Kings, <hi>Mehemet
Khan;</hi> to whom the Divine Bounty will ſubject all the Countries of
Infidels, to place him at laſt in Paradice, with his Glorious Anceſtors.</p>
            <p>You know, my moſt fortunate Lord, that the <hi>French</hi> Infidels,
whom God will Extirpate; a reſtleſs People, being never quiet, came
to <hi>Chio,</hi> under the Command of an Old Captain, in a brave Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
Guarded by five or ſix others, where they Fired during four
or five hours on the Veſſels of <hi>Tripoly</hi> in <hi>Barbary:</hi> They alſo da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95291:5"/>
the Fortreſs and the Moſques; nor had they then ceaſed, but
that the Cannon of the Faithful (with Bodies of Braſs, and Wings
of Draggons Vomiting Flames and Bullets) accompliſh't upon them
this Expreſſion of the Noble Scriptures; <hi>He threw Fear into their
hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Terror having in this manner ſeized on theſe Accurſed; to whom
Hell muſt be the laſt Stage; they were no longer able to uſe open
Force; yet ceaſed not however to keep their Station before the
Port of <hi>Chio,</hi> ſtopping all Merchant Ships that brought aſſiſtance to
the <hi>Tripolines;</hi> there ſayling up and down like Mad-men, making
mighty Threats. But their Brains ſeemed to be more ſettled, when
the <hi>Capoudan Pacha,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Admiral.</note> abſolute Lieutenant to the Emperor of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Climates, over the Seas of this vaſt World, had honoured the
Rode of <hi>Chio,</hi> by bringing thither the Galleys of the Emperour of
the Earth, whoſe Glory ſhall be perpetual.</p>
            <p>This Soveraign of the Seas, whom God will always favour with
Winds and Happineſs; for the propagation of Muſlemaniſme, and
the Grandure of the Invincible Rewarder our Maſter, had no ſooner
ſtopt his Conquering and Formidable Courſe, by caſting Anchor,
but the <hi>French</hi> Admiral (that the end of his days which are not
far off might be happy) ſent one of his principal and moſt truſty
Captains, to deliver his Submiſſions and Reſpects, as well as to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
him of ſome important Affairs; and to aſſure him, of his
deſires to do nothing that might make the leaſt breach of their
Amity, which had for more then one Age been Eſtabliſh'd, between
the Great and Sovereign Emperor of the habitable World; and the
Greateſt Emperor of all the Potentates of the belief of the Meſſia;
to whom be Salvation.</p>
            <p>This Ambaſſador, an able Man, and worthy ſo fair an Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
having rub'd his Face on the Veſt of the Lieutenant Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
of the Sea; and well acquitted himſelf of his Commiſſion,
appeared not at all aſtoniſh'd, when after the welcome of the <hi>Safa
Gueldy,</hi> pronounced with that gravity and decency, peculiar to him,
and which makes him be obeyed by Sea; he heard theſe words:
What ſign of Amity doſt thou bring us, to have raſhly affronted the
<hi>Moſques,</hi> where we Adore the great God of Heaven and Earth,
without giving him Companions, or defacing his Worſhip by Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
And where is the proofs of that Reſpect you boaſt? Is it to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95291:5"/>
have Fired on the Fortreſs of the Emperor, refuge to the Princes of
the World? You may perhaps be able to batter down a corner or
two; but God by the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which we defend, and
from whom we draw our Original, can from thoſe tumbling Stones
raiſe many Thouſand invincible Defenders. Tell thy Commander,
I adviſe him as a Friend to have recourſe to the Imperial Clemency,
by procuring the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador to ſupplicate for him at the
Port of Felicity.</p>
            <p>The Chriſtian Captain Accuſed the <hi>Tripolines</hi> of all the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
who being Enemies to the <hi>French,</hi> violated on their Merchants
the ſurety of the Capitulations. Then promiſing to conſider of the
Advice had been given him, he intreated the <hi>Capoudan Pacha</hi> to
Negotiate at the Port, as well concerning thoſe of <hi>Barbary,</hi> and the
damage at <hi>Chio,</hi> as about the Audience of Monſieur <hi>Guilleragues;</hi>
deſiring him beſides, to diſpoſe the <hi>Tripolines</hi> to make Peace.</p>
            <p>During this, the <hi>Grand Vizir</hi> (who is the Rule and Order of the
World, and who can fully finiſh all Cauſes, to whom God perpetuate
his Grandure, and redouble his Power) was in diſpute with the

proceeded as the <hi>Vizir</hi> pretends: And though <hi>Kieupruli</hi> the Son
did give the <hi>Sofa</hi> during his latter time, it was at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
where he was in a manner <hi>Incognito;</hi> and not at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> where
indeed there is no <hi>Sofa</hi> in the Chamber of Audience: Another day
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95291:6"/>
would bring him news, That the <hi>Dowanier</hi> appeared very merry,
and did not ceaſe his indeavours, but returned him thanks too for
the Wine he ſent him daily.</p>
            <p>He likewiſe ſent his Interpreters to the * <hi>Kaihaia</hi> of the <hi>Vizir</hi> and
the Lord of the Clerks,<note place="margin">Chief Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary.</note> who bid them Salute the Ambaſſador on
their parts, and aſſure him, they took pains for him; ſaying too,
That the <hi>Dowanier</hi> was his ſure Friend, as well as themſelves.</p>
            <p>The Interpreters coming another time from theſe Officers, would
tell the Ambaſſador, that they could not yet find a proper time to
ſpeak to the <hi>Vizir,</hi> becauſe that Miniſter is ever buſied about the
great Affairs of the World; which tumble in upon him every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the day; ſometimes like the Waves of the Sea, aſſaulting
him with fury; but are by him reſiſted, and drove back, as by an
unſhaken Rock, ſurmounting all difficulties by his Grand Genius,
which penetrates and reſolves, with eaſe, the moſt Myſterious and
Doubtful Matters: That it was neceſſary, great Affairs ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
ſmall ones, and that this of the Ambaſſadors, would have its
time; for which he ſhould not be impatient.</p>
            <p>The Ambaſſadour knock't too at other Doors, as at that of the
Chief Gardiners; who likewiſe amuſed him, and found his account
in this Negotiation: He attempted the Mediation of the moſt Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious<note n="*" place="margin">Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Kaimmakam,</hi> formerly <hi>Kahaia</hi> or Chief Secretary to the
Sovereign <hi>Vizir,</hi> who appeared with a frowning Countenance to
the Interpreters, with difficulty permitting them the Honor to kiſs
the bottom of his Veſt, and deliver the Complement of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter;
which when he heard, appearing aſtoniſh't, though he knew
all the buſineſs before: How! ſaith he, have you not yet finiſh't
this matter? On what can you think, that you make not your Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
reſolve? He cannot of himſelf be ſo Obſtinate; it muſt be
you that give him ill Counſel, contrary to your own proper know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
for you cannot be ignorant, how things have paſt, at for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Audiences: beware of your heads. They excus'd themſelves by
ſaying, Their Maſter was reſolved rather to dye, then be wanting
to the Orders of the Emperor of <hi>France:</hi> And that for themſelves,
they were only poor Interpreters, always ready to receive the high
Commands of the Sublime Port; and to report back, the moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Reaſons of their Ambaſſador; to whom they would moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
Relate what it pleaſed the moſt Illuſtrious <hi>Kaimmakam</hi> to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95291:6"/>
Command them, who ſtroking his Beard brought it together; then
pulling it a little, and caſting down his Eyes, as if he were think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Very well, ſays he, Salute the Lord Ambaſſador on my part; bid
him be Obſtinate no longer, for it is not his beſt way of Serving the
Emperor of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They were forced to return to the <hi>Kehaia</hi> of the <hi>Vizir</hi> and the<note n="*" place="margin">Or Lord of the Clerks.</note>
               <hi>Reiſeffend,</hi> who told them they had ſpoken to their Maſter in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the Ambaſſador, (God knows in what manner,) and that
his Anſwer was, He would ſpeak to the <hi>Sultan</hi> Emperor of the
World; the Iſſue whereof they expected with good hopes.</p>
            <p>The Interpreter of the Port of <hi>Felicity</hi> was moved in it too, who
Imployed all his Eloquence to ingage the prudence of the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador,
to take the beſt courſe; aſſuring him there was no better then
to yield; for in giving ſatisfaction to the <hi>Vizir</hi> in this, he would
oblidge a Lord, able to return it a hundred times double in other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
One could make the Ambaſſie of <hi>Monſieur Guilleragues</hi>
Glorious, ſo as to deface the Memory of all his Predeceſſors: In
fine, this was no longer the buſineſs of the Grand <hi>Vizir,</hi> but the
<hi>Sultans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The return again to the <hi>Kehaia</hi> and <hi>Reiſeffend,</hi> who told them
their Maſter had not yet ſpoke to his Highneſs; The Clerks too ſent
ſome Complements to the Ambaſſador; from whom one of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters
came one day to tell him, as a thing had been Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
in good Will: That if he would relax his pretence to the <hi>Sofa</hi>
in all other things, he would have more honour then he could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.
Sometimes the Interpreters told the Ambaſſador, that having
been delivering the Petitions to the Grand <hi>Vizir,</hi> concerning the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Affairs, they had been well received by him, who had asked
News of their Maſter, and made ſome advances, which ſeem'd De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations
of plain dealing: So that if things were not ended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his going to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> all would be agreed at his return. In
fine, my moſt Honoured Lord, whilſt this Affair remained int he
Clouds of Retardment, even after the <hi>Vizir</hi>'s return, we had the
news of what had paſt at <hi>Chio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Grand <hi>Vizir</hi> was in a Rage, but as his great Soul never yields
to the extreameſt difficulties, ſo it ſubmitted not at all to this,
which was but of the middle ones: He expos'd it at the Foot of the
Throne, of the Soveraign Maſter of the World, where having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95291:7"/>
himſelf, and received his Orders, he returned to his Houſe,
and ſent for the Grand <hi>Dowanier,</hi> Commanding him to let the <hi>French
Ambaſſador</hi> be told, That it was no longer his buſineſs (at leaſt at
preſent) to diſpute the <hi>Sofa,</hi> but to repair the Miſchiefs done at
<hi>Chio,</hi> as well to the <hi>Moſques,</hi> as <hi>Fortreſs;</hi> and to try by all manner
of Submiſſions to obtain a Pardon From the King of Kings, for that
Action: And that in the firſt place he ſhould begin by a Letter to
the <hi>French</hi> Admiral concerning what he had done; and to Command
him to do no more, nor come nearer <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> till they tryed to
obtain his Pardon: For if not, the <hi>Sultan</hi> would let looſe his juſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,
and ſtop his Ears to Mercy, to the utter Deſtruction of
him the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> and the whole <hi>French</hi> Nation: That they knew
he had exceeded his Orders; The Emperor of <hi>France</hi> being too
great an Emperor, too Juſt, and too Good a Friend to Command an
Enterpriſe ſo contrary to the Antient Amity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dowanier</hi> Replyed, That the Head of our Invincible Maſter,
and yours, may be at <hi>Repoſe;</hi> I dare anſwer for the Embaſſador in
this: I can oblige him to ſubmit to any thing you pleaſe: If he
make ſome ſeeming Reſiſtance, it will only be for Form-Sake. He
hath no deſire to Ingage himſelf in any thing may put him out of his
Imployment: He is for getting of Money, as his Profeſſion, and
manner of Living demonſtrate; and has been here too ſmall a time,
to deſire to be gone ſo faſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe words were not given in vain, for the Embaſſador writ di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
times to the Admiral, who thereupon remained without doing
any thing, like a Lyon bound in Chains; Theſe Letters were full
of real Fear, and perfect Terror leſt his doing more, might diſpleaſe
the <hi>Sultan</hi> in the leaſt. But to haſten things the Embaſſador went
himſelf to the <hi>Kehaia</hi> of the Grand <hi>Vizir,</hi> who made him thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſenſible of the mighty Crime the <hi>French</hi> Admiral had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
able to overturn the whole Negotiation, and reduce into
Captivity all the <hi>French</hi> within the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire; was there not
ſome reaſon to hope that he as a Prudent Ambaſſador, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
Mercy, and Forgiveneſs from the moſt happy and moſt Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
Emperor of the Earth. The Ambaſſador would have defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf, by pretending that nothing paſt at <hi>Chio,</hi> could in the
leaſt be interpreted to intend a Breach of the Antient Amity: That
if they had Fired on the <hi>Fortreſs,</hi> and hurt ſome Houſes, it was but
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95291:7"/>
by accident, and in a Juſt defence: ſince thoſe from thence, had firſt
Fired on the Ships, belonging to the Emperor of <hi>France.</hi> That this
Storm of the Juſt Indignation of his Maſter, had been reſtrained for a
long time by his Natural Moderation; but muſt at laſt, by Gods permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
fall upon the heads of thoſe Thieves, Rebels to the Grand
Seignior himſelf; The <hi>Trippolins</hi> unworthy to injoy the Protection
of his Highneſs; They who had taken the Merchants Goods and
Veſſels of the <hi>French,</hi> entring the Ports of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire; Nay,
in the very Ports themſelves, and under the Command of the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
Forts. That theſe Pirates only were reſponſible for all preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Damage, ſince only they were true occaſions of it.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Kehaia</hi> made anſwer to the Ambaſſador, Let us ſeperate
the <hi>Tripolins</hi> from the injury done to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> they are your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
I allow: But the Emperor of the World, is he your Enemy?
Doth he not give you daily convincing proofs of the contrary, by
his Imperial benefits? You are you ſay, carried on by the Force and
heat of a Juſt vengeance to perſue your Enemies: But on the other
ſide, could not the Reſpect due to the King of Kings, our invincible
Maſter, who had protected the <hi>Tripolins</hi> under his Forts, ſtop it?
was there no middle way to be found, as well to preſerve the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
due to the Soveraign of the World, who has the Univerſe in
his Guard; As likewiſe to prevent the eſcape of your Enemies?
There appears to me one, very eaſy, perſues the <hi>Kehaia,</hi> which is
to have kept the <hi>Tripolins</hi> Beſieged, till you had ſent to the Port of
<hi>Felicity,</hi> to Implore the High and Sublime Juſtice againſt them:
Then had that been refuſed, there had been ſome pretence of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
perhaps, for coming to that extremity you have done. The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
ſtrove to ſupport himſelf by many weak reaſons; And tho'
he often proteſted he had ſomething Eſſential to offer: All he could
ſay appeared meer Amuſements, which obliged the <hi>Kehaia,</hi> to ſtop
his Mouth, with theſe words.</p>
            <p>The Emperor of <hi>France,</hi> which we diſtinguiſh Infinitely beyond
other Potontates, as the moſt Powerful, beſt Born, and ancieneſt
Friend to the Port of <hi>Felicity,</hi> the end of whoſe days be happy, who
ſurpaſſes all his Anceſtors in Strength, Wiſdom, and every ſort of
Merit; and who is formidable to all Chriſtendom: Would he take
it well, if we ſhould do to him, as his Admiral hath done, to the
true <hi>Kaliſé,</hi> or Succeſſor, to the greateſt of all the Prophets: the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95291:8"/>
               <hi>Sultan Elbarrein,</hi> and <hi>Khaijan,</hi> and <hi>Bahrein,</hi> King of the two Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents,
and Emperor of the two Seas, the <hi>Cayzar Cezar,</hi> the Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Crowns of <hi>Cozroes.</hi> To whom God perpetuate his Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
to the very day of Judgement.</p>
            <p>If one of our Invincible Armies (as Numerous as the Sands in the
Sea) ſhould Attaque our Enemies, under one of your Maſters Forts,
what would he ſay? What Complaints had he not reaſon to make?
Is it not known, that the Commander of our Galleyes, let eſcape
from his Fury, the Ships of the Enemies of <hi>Cheincha,</hi> King of Kings,
becauſe they took Sanctuary, under the Standard of <hi>Padicha,</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
of <hi>France?</hi> And was it not done as it ſhould be? Could I,
Lord Ambaſſador, produce a more pertinent Example? But yet take
another, that may guide you to take right meaſures, in ſeriouſly
thinking, how to conclude this, and to bring your ſelf out of the
preſent danger: We have heard by certain Confus'd reports, That
ſome Souldiers, belonging to a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Garriſon in <hi>Flanders</hi> (a Land
of Vices) Incouraged by the ſtrength of the Place, which they
thought Impregnable, had grown ſo Inſolently Fooliſh, as to go forth
like Furies, Meriting Hell, to Attaque and Rob ſome <hi>French</hi>
Souldiers, immediately Retiring with their Booty, into that Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of their Cowardice; much miſtaken in thinking they were there
Safe: For the Emperor of <hi>France,</hi> reſolving that this Injury, which
hurt the Peace ſhould be repaired: Reſerved the Conqueſt of the
Place, whence it was done, to another time; It being not yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated
to be his: Therefore remaining Embarraſt in the Clouds of
certain delays, he contented himſelf, that they ſhould make amends
for the Raſhneſs of theſe Madmen, undoubted Limbs of the Devil, by
Money. We know, continued the <hi>Kehaia,</hi> that the Governors of
this Country, by Order of their Maſter, thinking themſelves hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
in not ſeeing Roll in upon them, the mighty Forces of the
Emperor of <hi>France,</hi> whoſe very ſhadows make them Tremble; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<hi>Hoſtage,</hi> and ſent the money agreed upon, with Solemn
Preſents: which he was pleaſed to accept, not for their Value, but
as proofs of their Homage, Submiſſions, and Reparation they were
forced to make: He made this little Sacrifice Conſiderable by his
acceptance, and Imperial Clemency: Here was nothing but a few
<hi>French</hi> Plundered to conteſt about, but we have the Faithful Kill'd
and Wounded, who call for Revenge, and the Holy Stones that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95291:8"/>
it, which are Rent from ſome of our <hi>Moſques:</hi> There
muſt be Blood, or Repentance, by Submiſſions, Expoſed to
the view of the Publick, or your Perſon muſt anſwer all, and
be Lyable to great extremities: Therefore think well of all
theſe Circumſtances. Thus ended the Diſcourſe of the <hi>Kehaia</hi>
to the Ambaſſador, who pretended, that the laſt example, was
not truly Reported: He affirmed that the Emperor of <hi>France,</hi>
always Invincible, never amuſed himſelf about trifling Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents:
And that he knew how to make his Enemies, render
true Homage, and ever puniſh't thoſe, that violated his Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
without a cauſe, by Fire and Sword; Not forgeting nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Generous Clemency, truly Noble, and diſſintereſted,
when he thought it convenient to ſuppreſs his Anger. In fine,
the Ambaſſador concluded, That he had no fear for his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
ſufficiently protected by the Power of his Maſter, and the
Right of Nations: Saying, He had nothing to give. The <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haia</hi>
told him, He had time to think, becauſe the Soveraign
<hi>Vizir,</hi> ſtayed for the Anſwer of the <hi>Capoudan Pacha,</hi> Admiral
of the Seas, to know truly how all things paſt at <hi>Chio;</hi>
Whereupon he would receive the Orders, given at the Fleet of
the Soveraign, who pronounces the deſtiny of the Univerſe:
There upon the Ambaſſador Retired to his Houſe at <hi>Pera.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The moſt Serene and Illuſtrious <hi>Vizir,</hi> who knows how to
make uſe of his Prudence, and his Force, as is moſt proper,
contented himſelf not to haſten the Matter. His faithful
Councellor the Grand <hi>Dowanier</hi> Negotiated conſtantly by the
uſual Perſons with the Ambaſſador, who gave him poſitive
aſſurances of his yielding; and that he would oblige him to
ſubmit, aſſuring him, he had made the Ambaſſador ſufficiently
apprehend a Rupture, as a thing would be of little advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to the Affairs of <hi>France</hi> in General, or his own in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
            <p>But during theſe delays, the <hi>Capoudon Pacha,</hi> obedient to
the Orders of the Soveraign <hi>Vizir,</hi> had entred the Port of <hi>Chio,</hi>
the better to underſtand the cauſe of the Diſorder; and fully
to inform himſelf of every particular, that he might the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
Contribute to the Peace he intended: There he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
the that Curſed Old Admiral of the <hi>French,</hi> who ſurely
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95291:9"/>
knows how to live by Air, and takes pleaſure to dance on
the moſt Inraged Waves of a Tempeſtuous Sea; living on
them as on the moſt Firm Ground; and like a perfect Fiſh
values neither Winter nor Summer.</p>
            <p>This Man who ceaſes not to Live, tho' a hundred years
Old; and four ſcore of them hath made good proviſion in the
Market, where they Sell Cheats, Tricks, and Fourberies
cheap: Took advantage of the Narrow entrance into the Port
of <hi>Chio.</hi> And after having made ſo many Compliments and
Civilities to the <hi>Capoudan Pacha,</hi> did now intreat him, not to
think of ſtirring out till he had Surrendred the <hi>Tripolins,</hi> or
obliged them to ſubmit. Nay more, this daring Old Man,
who ſeems to forget Death, and yet remains in Life, by the
permiſſion of God, meerly to augment his Crimes, the more
to Burn in Hell, had the preſumption to ſearch ſeveral <hi>Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Galleys.</hi> The <hi>Capoudan Pacha</hi> had not fail'd to go out to
puniſh his Inſupportable Inſolence, had not the Sea and Seaſon
Inconvenient for Galleys prevented it; ſo he could do no more
then give Advice of all, to that High Tribunal whoſe Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are unmovable.</p>
            <p>The Grand <hi>Vizir</hi> whoſe Angellick underſtanding knows a
perfect remedy for every thing, had no ſooner notice of the
vain Glory, Preſumption and Ill-Built Pride of this Old Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
of the <hi>French</hi> Galliens, in preſuming to keep (as it
were Impriſoned) the Admiral and Galleys of the Emperor of
the World; but he ſent for the Grand <hi>Dowanier</hi> to debate the
Buſineſs, between whom it was thought convenient, that the
Ambaſſador ſhould be Frighted; they both being Confident
he would yield, rather then expoſe himſelf to the Affronts to
which Revenge too much Ingaged their Maſter; and that all
the Pride of which he made ſo great appearance, was only to
ſave his Honour, and preſerve a Profitable Imployment.</p>
            <p>We now ended the Moon worthy of Bleſſing, which is that
of our Faſt of <hi>Ramazan;</hi> it being the Eve of the Feaſt of <hi>Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi>
which is begun by rendring thanks to God for giving us
the Grace to Faſt thirty days compleat: The Grand <hi>Vizir</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable
in the Obedience he pays, as well to the Great
Maſter of Nature, who has no Companions, as to his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95291:9"/>
on Earth, his moſt Perfect Image; the Emperor of the
<hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> Revenger of the Divine Unity: This Grand <hi>Vizir</hi>
having kept ſo long a Faſt, was come to the thirtieth day,
which he had paſt, without Eating or Drinking, from the
Riſing of the Sun to its going down: ceaſed not however to
preſerve his full Strength and Prudence, of which he gave
convincing proofs to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador.</p>
            <p>He ſent for him in the Evening before the Feaſt of <hi>Bairan,</hi>
juſt as the Canons ending their Faſt, denounced the next days
Solemnity; ſo that he who doth not too well underſtand our
cuſtoms arrived at the Grand <hi>Vizir</hi>'s in the midſt of that Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
ſufficient to terrifie him, as being the preſage of that
Rage and Threats, was going to fall upon him. They made
him attend above an hour in a Chamber, whilſt the Grand
<hi>Vizir</hi> was doing his Devotions; where ſome mov'd him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crept
his Audience below the <hi>Sofa,</hi> which he abſoutely refuſed,
propoſing to remain where he was, or in ſome other Room,
from whence he would anſwer the <hi>Vizir</hi> by Meſſage. But this
Lieutenant to the Emperor of the World was reſolved to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe
him face to face; that he might dart at him, Glances
like Lightning from that Majeſtick Preſence, Adorn'd with
<hi>Eagles Eyes.</hi> He placed himſelf on a Seat prepared on the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fa,</hi>
having firſt Gravely returned, by an almoſt Imperceptible
declining of his head, the Submiſſive Reverence the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
made him: You muſt know this <hi>Chriſtian</hi> had but few
with him, many not deſerving to enter that Place: he was
invited to ſit below; But having Generouſly reſiſted ſeveral
Motions, ſomething Violent, by which they attempted to
Conſtrain him; and ſeeming as if he would Revenge by
Blows the Force, they deſiſted: By which he had Liberty to
deliver a Letter from the Emperor of <hi>France,</hi> to the <hi>Vizir,</hi>
concerning the <hi>Sofa;</hi> It was conſidered too, that remaining
ſtanding as he was, it ſeem'd to be in a poſture more Reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and readier to obey the Orders he was about to receive:
It was then agreed, that the Interpreter of the <hi>Port</hi> ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
for the <hi>Vizir,</hi> and the Ambaſſadors for him.</p>
            <p>The Diſcourſe of the <hi>Vizir</hi> touched the Grandeur of the
Emperor of the <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> of the reſpect due to him, of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95291:10"/>
Danger to offend him; of the neceſſity readily to make Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for ſuch a Crime: And Laſtly, Of the Goodneſs and
Clemency of the Maſter of the World, willing always to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
thoſe that humble themſelves, and repair the Injuries
done to his Slaves: Adding theſe words, It is for thee therefore
<note n="*" place="margin">L. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador.</note> 
               <hi>Eſtchibeig,</hi> as the Surety of the<note n="*" place="margin">Emperor</note> 
               <hi>Gadicha</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> thy
Maſter; and Hoſtage reſiding at the Soveraign Port of <hi>Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,</hi>
for confirmation of the Peace, to repair all that weaknes
it, during the Embaſſie. It is for thee then to pay the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
at <hi>Chio,</hi> for the death of ſome Faithful: The Breaches in
the <hi>Moſques,</hi> and the Miſchief done to the <hi>Cittadel;</hi> I demand
of thee for this, three hundred and fifty thouſand Crowns:
And a due Submiſſion to ſuch an Emperor as my Maſter, who
is Protector of the true Belief. This thou muſt perform or go
to the ſeven Towers, I tell thee as a Friend, thou muſt obey
the Inevitable Doom of the Great Maſter of the World, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
to me, when proſtrated as his Slave at the Foot of his
Throne, the perfect and bright Reſemblance of the Celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
one. The Ambaſſador by Amuſements ſought to alter the
<hi>Vizir</hi>'s Reſolution, alledging the neceſſity of obeying the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
of <hi>France,</hi> who had Commanded his Admiral to perſue
to Death, the Thieving <hi>Tripolins,</hi> Enemies to <hi>France,</hi> and
Rebels to the Port; a People unworthy the Protection of his
Highneſs, having Seized the Merchants under the Forts of the
<hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire: And taken the <hi>Conſul</hi> of <hi>Cyprus</hi> out of his
Houſe, where he ought by the Capitulations of Peace to have
been ſafe: He then alledged, that if he was to be conſider'd as
a Hoſtage to Anſwer for what ſhould happen on the Emperor
of <hi>Frances</hi> part; It could only be Intended to relate to things
Ordinary, and not to thoſe that were out of his Power, as the
buſineſs of <hi>Chio</hi> was: The Circumſtances too of which, he ſay'd,
were aggravated: He profeſſed himſelf troubled, that Chance
and a Lawful defence againſt the Fort, which had firſt Fired
on the Standard of his Maſter, ſhould produce ſome Diſorder;
But proteſted too that he cou'd promiſe nothing was demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for it, and had only power write to <hi>France</hi> the true State
of things, and wait his Anſwer thence. That as to the Seven
Towers, it was eaſy to ſend him thither, but it was the way
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95291:10"/>
to make a Rupture: He then declared he would medle no
more in any thing, for a Priſoner contrary to the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
was no longer Capable of Negotiating: The <hi>Vizir</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
declared he knew nothing of the buſineſs of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> ſaid,
they might have Beſieged the <hi>Tripolins</hi> in the Port of <hi>Chio</hi>
without Fyring into it; and that during his Impriſonment, the
Commerce ſhould continue, provided there arrived no other
Acts of Hoſtility; telling him too, that other <hi>French</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors
had been Impriſoned, which the Emperor of <hi>France</hi> had
not taken ill.</p>
            <p>The Ambaſſador Reply'd, That his Maſter had not foreſeen
this Accident, which was indeed Morally Impoſſible he ſhould;
that if the ſame uſage had been to ſome of his Predeceſſors, it
was not totally without cauſe, as in the Caſe of Monſieur <hi>La
Haye,</hi> who was Impriſoned, as a Spye for the <hi>Venetians:</hi> But
for himſelf he had Prerogatives above other Ambaſſadors, and
had been ever Faithful to the Port: That, in fine, He was Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
of <hi>France,</hi> and it behov'd them to conſider well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they did any thing might wrong that Character.</p>
            <p>The Grand <hi>Vizir</hi> demanded Proofs of this great Fidelity he
boaſted; doth it, ſaith he, conſiſt in Conſederating with the
<hi>French</hi> Admiral? to demean himſelf as Enemy to the Grand
<hi>Sultan</hi> of the <hi>Oſmans:</hi> And how ſhall we diſcern this mighty
Prerogative above other Ambaſſadors, in one who can meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
complain concerning Trifles, with which the Port hath
ſuch conſtant Troubles; and pretends no Power to treat
about an Affair of Importance, wherein they had Juſt cauſe to
complain.</p>
            <p>The Ambaſſador urged, That the buſineſs of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and
many others, concerning which he had delivered Memorials
to the <hi>Vizirs</hi> Officers, were no Trifling matters; and that
he had no knowledge of the Orders which the <hi>French</hi> Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
had, more then what he had received from him, by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
But the <hi>Vizir</hi> remained firm to his Reſolution, repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to him, Pay or thou goeſt to Priſon: what I ſay to thee,
is nothing but an effect of my Friendſhip; take time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
of it, and do thy beſt, before there happens to thee ſome
great affront. But the Ambaſſador perſiſting in the ſame uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95291:11"/>
Reaſoning; was by the Grand <hi>Vizir</hi> thus admoniſhed.</p>
            <p>It becomes a Servant like thee, who Mediates Affairs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a Mighty and Invincible Emperor, and thy Maſter the
King of <hi>France,</hi> whom we diſtinguiſh much before all other
Chriſtian Kings, to behave himſelf with all Care and Wiſdom,
having ever before his Eyes the danger of ſuffering any
thing to ſlip between them, might occaſion Enmity or Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
to the end that the Subjects of two ſuch great Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies
may be free from Trouble: think therefore of Submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and ſpeedily paying, or thou goeſt to the Seven Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
            <p>The Ambaſſadour having no more to ſay, retired; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of ſending him to the Seven Towers, they convey'd
him to the little Lobby of the Chamber belonging to the <hi>Chia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oux
Barhy:</hi> So he ſtirred not out of the <hi>Vizir</hi>'s Houſe,<note place="margin">Chief Uſher.</note> but
there remained Priſoner, ſoon comforting himſelf, as we may
think in that Conſinement, ſince he boaſted, that he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
being ſent to the Seven Towers: One may indeed
rationally conclude, That he thought of nothing but the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
with which he was threatned; and therefore ſeemed not
to reſent the other, in which he was kept. He ſeem'd to be
pleas'd, and ſtudied to appear free, refuſing all was ſent him
from the <hi>Vizir</hi>'s Kitchin, and eating nothing but what came
from his own. He ſhew'd too a kind of falſe Reſolution, to
be ſteddy, againſt all the Overtures were made him, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
the matter, declaring by Reiterated Proteſtations,
that he neither could nor would give any thing, except
ſome Curioſities he had by him: Whereupon the <hi>Vizir</hi> ſent
him this Meſſage, The Amity I bear thee, and my moſt
earneſt Solicitations, have almoſt prevailed to make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible
thy moſt humble Diſcourſes, before the Foot of the
Imperial Throne; an Object worthy all the ſubmiſſions and
reſpect of Mortals: Thou ſhalt therefore within ſix Months
of this time, cauſe to be brought hither ſome Curioſities of
<hi>France,</hi> worthy the Acceptance of the Sublime Majeſty of
the Emperor of the Believers; with a Letter from the <hi>Padi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi>
of <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Emperor.</note> by which he ſhall declare to the <hi>Sultan</hi> his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of the Fact that hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> committed; and that he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95291:11"/>
did never intend his Ships ſhould have done any thing, could
alter the Ancient Friendſhip: And that if by chance ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
had happen'd at <hi>Chio,</hi> contrary to his intention, he
was troubled at it. The Ambaſſador explain'd himſelf on the
Meſſage, not allowing any Crime, but ſaid he would procure
ſuch a Letter as was proper in the Caſe: And that for the
Preſents, they ſhould be in his own Name, and not in that of
his Maſters. Things being thus prepared, they brought the
Ambaſſador, the fourth day of his Impriſonment, to a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Liberty, which was that of the <hi>Kehaia,</hi> to which the
Interpreter of the Port conducted him: There he met the
<hi>Kehaia</hi> and the <hi>Chiaux Barhy,</hi> who firſt magnified the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the <hi>Vizir,</hi> and his dexterity in appeaſing the Rage of
the <hi>Sultan;</hi> and then mutually fell to commending their own,
as well as the endeavours of the <hi>Dowanier.</hi> They ſeem'd to
approve too, the Conduct of the Ambaſſador, but would not
confide in his word, ſaying, it was neceſſary to be cautious
in things relating to the Great Emperor of the <hi>Oſmans:</hi> And
therefore the promiſe of the Ambaſſador muſt be in Writing
under his Hand and Seal.</p>
            <p>There hap'ned ſome diſpute in forming it, but at laſt it was
agreed, That the ſatisfaction ſhould be expreſt, to intend a
reparation for the miſchief done by the Emperor of <hi>France</hi>'s
Ships at <hi>Chio:</hi> They would have aſcertain'd the Preſents, but
the Ambaſſadour would only promiſe they ſhould be honeſt
or proper; and undertook too, for a Letter from the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of <hi>France,</hi> in which conſiſted the Matter of the Writing
he gave for his Liberty; whereupon he departed to his own
Houſe; however proteſting before he went, That he would
perform nothing, except the <hi>Sofa</hi> were granted him: And
that the <hi>Tripolins</hi> were obliged to make a Peace: They bid
him be contented, and not doubt of ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>There was, indeed, effectual Orders ſent to the <hi>Capoudon
Pacha,</hi> to conclude the Treaty with the <hi>Tripolins,</hi> ſince the
Ambaſſador had promiſed to repair the damage at <hi>Chio;</hi> the
Treaty was Concluded at the Foot of the Throne of Heroes
who have the World in Wardſhip; and ended to the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Old Admiral of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet; whom it had
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95291:12"/>
been well to have ſent dead into his Country; for inſtead of
retiring thereupon as was expected, he demonſtrated a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of making a longer ſtay, and of keeping in the Gallys,
covering however his actions with a pretence of Civility and
Fair dealing; ſending word to the <hi>Capoudan Pacha,</hi> that after
ſo ſure a proof of his great Genius, in reconciling him and
the <hi>Tripolines,</hi> it was unjuſt he ſhould be ſtayed longer there,
deſiring him therefore to procure ſatisfaction might be given
to the Ambaſſador, or that he might have leave to return,
declaring he was bound to ſtay till one or the other was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vizir</hi> conſider'd, as he ought, the Reſolution and
Boundleſs Obſtinacy, of this Old Captain; who though he
had many cauſes hourly to fear death; yet acted as if death
were afraid of him; negotiating like one of Thirty or Fourty,
that had hopes of many years to live.</p>
            <p>The Grand <hi>Vizir</hi> making juſt reflexions on the ſteddy Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy,
meriting Hell of this Old Seaman, ſent for the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manier,</hi>
who as a Secret, I muſt needs ſay, my moſt Honor'd
Lord, is a true Devil Incarnate; to whom this Illuſtrious and
Fortunate Lieutenant to the Emperor of the World thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
himſelf: If all the <hi>French</hi> were as Reſolute as this Old
Admiral, we ſhould be hard put to't to find the Moments of
their wavering, and ordinary inconſtancy. But if on the one
ſide, the great God gives us this proof of their ſteddineſs; he
ſhews us too on the other their Natural Genius, in the faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of changing the Ambaſſador. Should we imploy the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Naval Forces of the King of Kings, the ſucceſs would
be doubtful, for the <hi>French</hi> lye too far from us; but eaſily
approach our Fortreſſes, having the Chriſtians Harbours for
their Succours: This makes me think my ſelf predeſtinated
for another Conduct, which will be more to the purpoſe
then hazard, or to ſay better, the aſſiſtance of God, which is
never wanting to the Faithful, will divide the <hi>French</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
and make them Combat one another, as they did at
<hi>Candia:</hi> Do you therefore to this purpoſe Negotiate with the
Ambaſſador, who believes you his friend, ſerve your ſelf with
all your underſtanding, upon his Credulous Temper, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95291:12"/>
him from this other <hi>French-man,</hi> who is a thorough-pac'd
Infidel, covetous of Blood and Slaughter, and one who ſeems
to have forgot his Country, ſo Jealouſie between the two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dowanier</hi> is one full of the Slights and Tricks, natural
to thoſe of his Race,<note place="margin">Gipſie, or Fortune-Teller.</note> being by Birth a <hi>Chinquene,</hi> who has im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
his Subtleties and Fourberies by his Imployment in the
Cuſtoms; ſo he received the Orders of the Sovereign <hi>Vizir,</hi>
with great Submiſſion, promiſing, <hi>at the peril of his Head,</hi> to
execute them.</p>
            <p>He made it be told the Ambaſſador, that now things were
in a good way, this Old Mad Admiral would ſpoil all; and
it was to be feared by his reſtleſs Temper, produce an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Rupture: That he was an Ambitious, and Aſpiring kind
of Genius, that could not be contented to have ended the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
of the <hi>Tripolines</hi> which only concerned him, to his own
hearts deſire, but muſt now be medling too with that of the
Embaſſie, that the glory of gaining all Points might ſeem to be
his; and that ſince all things were adjuſted, only that Point
of the <hi>Sofa,</hi> which the <hi>Vizir</hi> was reſolved to grant too, it was
neceſſary to remove this buſie Obſtacle, to a perfect Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation.</p>
            <p>The Ambaſſador gave credit to this Man, whom the <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulman's</hi>
themſelves believe but by force; he therefore
writ to the <hi>French</hi> Admiral to depart to <hi>Milo,</hi> on pretence of
refitting, and to return again, if things were not accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
as he expected: This Letter made him ſeparate from
the Sea of <hi>Chio,</hi> which he ſeem'd before to have eſpouſed;
firſt ſending his humble requeſt to the <hi>Capoudan Pacha,</hi> that
he would Mediate at the Foot of the Sublime Throne, that
ſatisfaction might be given to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador.</p>
            <p>The moſt fortunate <hi>Vizir,</hi> whom God will always proſper,
was not a little pleas'd, to ſee enter into <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> the
Fleet which had been ſo long detain'd at <hi>Chio:</hi> And was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
well ſatisfied with the Conduct of the <hi>Dowanier,</hi>
whom he ordered to continue his uſual Amuſements to the
Ambaſſador; who for four or five Months was perpetually
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95291:13"/>
Imbarraſt with delays: He boaſted mightily of his Fidelity
to the Sublime Port, in having put a ſtop to the violent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions
of the <hi>French</hi> Admiral (though before he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to have no power over him) he therefore continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
urged their keeping promiſe with him about the <hi>Sofa;</hi>
ſometimes it would be promiſed him, and then again made
doubtful: Then it would he ſuggeſted as deſigned in a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
without <hi>Sofa,</hi> to be purpoſely dedicated to the Audiences
of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador: But at laſt he was plainly told,
nothing at all could be done in it, till he had performed his
promiſe concerning the Preſents; and that then they would
think of contenting him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Admiral, during theſe delays, was returned
again, near to <hi>Chio,</hi> being at the Iſles of <hi>Ourlar,</hi> on the Coaſt
of <hi>Smyrna:</hi> where the wiſe <hi>Vizir</hi> by the help of the Grand
<hi>Dowanier</hi> found means a long time to amuſe him. But the
Ambaſſador beginning to diſcover, that he was deluded, writ
to this old Madman, to approach to the <hi>Cape</hi> of <hi>Janiſſaries,</hi>
near <hi>Smyrna:</hi> But commanded him too not to come nearer
the <hi>Dardanelloes,</hi> thoſe Keys of the World, aſſuring him if
he did, it would prove the deſtruction of all the <hi>French</hi> Fleet;
And then theſe would be no Quarter for the Merchants, nor
Ambaſſador himſelf We knew theſe Circumſtances by reaſon
the <hi>Dowanier,</hi> at the beginning, whileſt the Matter of <hi>Chio</hi>
depended, had ſo poſſeſt the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador with the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of that danger; that, that terror ſtill poſſeſt him, which
had prevented the <hi>French</hi> Admiral coming nearer them before:
And was now again the Cauſe that he only came to an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor,
as I ſaid before, at the <hi>Cape</hi> of <hi>Janiſſaries,</hi> which is the
entrance of that Gulf which Conducts one by a ſpace of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
or eight Miles to theſe Caſtles, which are the firſt Keys of
this vaſt and ſtrong City: the deſire of Kings, the ſplendid
and proud Town of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The <hi>Dowanier</hi> had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
receiv'd intelligence from <hi>Smyrna,</hi> that the <hi>French</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
was troubled, he had obey'd the Ambaſſador, declaring
he knew that was not the way to do themſelves good. You
muſt know too, my moſt Honoured Lord, that the Grand <hi>Vizir</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:95291:13"/>
was aſſured that this <hi>French</hi> Admiral, had received Orders to
make a ſpeedy return Home, to go againſt <hi>Algier.</hi> The Theater
of War and Foyle of a Mighty <hi>d' Gachar</hi> of <hi>Germany</hi> who now
burns in Hell. But be it as it will, as a ſecret I aſſure you,
the moſt Serene and Illuminated <hi>Vizir</hi> reſented the whole
matter with great ſatisfactions, in having it Conducted ſo
that he hazarded not the Reputations of theſe two Caſtles,
which are the Jaws of this great Giant of <hi>Conſtantines:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caeſar Charles</hi> the Fifth.</note> But
that they appeared Formidable to the very <hi>French,</hi> the moſt
powerful of all Infidels; who ſeem to fear neither Storms, Famine,
Fire nor Water. Their Admiral being thus as it were Chain'd
from paſſing the <hi>Cape</hi> of <hi>Janiſſaries,</hi> was certainly as we are
inform'd all fury for being forced to return ſo ſoon; and that
he muſt be reduced to Prayers for having been obedient to an
Embaſſy. He therefore againſt his will Writ a moſt ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
Letter to the Supreme <hi>Vizir,</hi> Intreating him that ſatisfaction
might be given to the Ambaſſador by having Audience on the
<hi>Sofa,</hi> or that he might take his leave; He being obliged to
ſtay to carry him back. The Meſſenger who brought the
Letter was one of the Captains of the Gallions, and one we
knew to be a moſt particular Friend to the Ambaſſador.</p>
            <p>This Envoy came to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> well perpar'd with many
good reaſons to have offer'd to the Supream Arbitrator of the
affairs of Mankind, the Lieutenant to the Emperor of
the World. But being unworthy to appear in his Preſence,
that Honor was refuſed him, and he was referred to the
Chief Steward of the Houſhold of this Councellor, full of the
Glory of the King of Kings.</p>
            <p>The Grand <hi>Vizir</hi> who knows well how to preſerve the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of his Supream Dignity, refuſed to receive the Letter from
the <hi>French</hi> Admiral, declaring he would have no buſineſs with
him. And as to two ſent him by the Ambaſſador of <hi>France,</hi>
wherein he deſires leave to depart except he might have Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
on the <hi>Sofa,</hi> Alledging it was the Order of his Maſter: He
made no other Anſwer but commanded him to ſend him thoſe
Orders of the Emperor of <hi>France.</hi> But the moſt Illuminated
<hi>Vizir</hi> having made them to be Interpreted to him, returned
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95291:14"/>
them without ſaying one word; which obliged the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
to a Third: Wherein with Counterfeit earneſtneſs he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
leave to retire, pretending that the <hi>French</hi> Admiral was
bound to ſtay for him. This uſeleſs refinement cauſed the
Grand <hi>Vizir</hi> to ſmile, who knew that General was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to depart, and that the Envoy from him hourly preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Ambaſſador to diſpatch him away.</p>
            <p>The Wiſe <hi>Vizir</hi> perceiving the ſubtile deſign of the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador,
who made not the leaſt mention of diſcharging the
Obligation he had given in Writing, ſent him this Anſwer.
The moſt happy Port, which is the Sanctuary of the Empires
of the Age, is ever open to all thoſe who deſire the Glory to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
And thoſe that would have the ſhame to depart, we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
detain by Force, except they be Debtors. Thou mayeſt
then be gone; But firſt think of Paying thy Debts, comply
with thy obligation; make thy Money and Preſents to the
value of three Hundred and fifty Thouſand Crowns be laid at
the Feet of the Emperor of the <hi>Oſmans.</hi> And with this At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement,
for the buſineſs of <hi>Chio</hi> (unworthy our Maſter,
but which he is pleaſed to accept as a Mark of thy Humility)
thou ſhalt have leave to be gone.</p>
            <p>The Ambaſſador, who it ſeems, had not before, well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd
the conſequence of his promiſe, not dreaming perhaps
it extended ſo far; proteſted he had nothing came near thoſe
demands. They told him he was bound by his Writing to make
honeſt Preſents to the Grand Seignior; demanding of him,
what that word <hi>Honeſt</hi> Imply'd: Declaring to him in Fine,
that ſince the ſix Months time agreed upon was paſt, he was
obliged to perform his promiſe. He declared that thoſe Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſities
he had provided were rare and rich, worthy the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
of the Invincible Emperor. It was then required that
they might be View'd; to which purpoſe ſome Perſons were
ſent by the Soveraign <hi>Vizir:</hi> But upon their deſcription con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in a Catalogue upon the firſt ſight of them, the value
the Ambaſſador ſet upon them, and his offer of ſome ſmall
Summ to Augment them, were both rejected. But there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no other way to conclude: The Envoy of the <hi>French</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95291:14"/>
was forced to be gone without taking with him the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador,
whom he was conſtrained to leave as a Debtor
at the Port of Felicity.</p>
            <p>The Grand <hi>Vizir</hi> whom nothing eſcapes, underſtanding
the haſty departure of the <hi>French</hi> Captain, to joyn his Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
to Sail with him for <hi>France:</hi> was then Confirm'd in the
advice had been given him of the ſpeedy departure of the
<hi>French</hi> Fleet; and though he knew well enough that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
did not intend to fly ſtript away, yet he counterfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a care to prevent it, as a thing unjuſt that he ſhould go
without paying.</p>
            <p>The time came on which makes it neceſſary that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
Force of the Emperor of the World ſhould go forth;
Of which the Grand <hi>Vizir</hi> took particular Care; going
himſelf divers times to the <hi>Arſinal</hi> about it: So when it was
ready to Sail and Salute with all its Cannon and Artillery,
the Soveraign of the Earth ſitting upon his Throne of Felicity,
the Admiral went to proſtrate himſelf before the Invincible Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
and to receive his Orders. He was commanded to ſhape his
Courſe for the <hi>Archipellagues,</hi> and to receive the ſubmiſſions
of the <hi>French</hi> Admiral as he paſt: who would not as the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
promiſed, (fail to do his Duty:) After which he was
to proceed as occaſions required. All was performed as was Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd.
The <hi>Capoudan Pacha</hi> doubled the Point of the <hi>Seraglio</hi>
with his Fleet: and having paſt the Jaws or old Caſtles, came
to an Anchor at the Mouth of the Gulf, where having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Reſpects of the old <hi>French</hi> Admiral, he weighed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
his way: It ſeem'd as if this <hi>French</hi> Admiral only wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for that happy moment, for it was no ſooner paſt but he
hoyſted Sail for his own Countrey: very joyful no doubt to
eſcape that juſt puniſhment his raſhneſs had merited.</p>
            <p>The moſt honor'd <hi>Vizir</hi> well ſatisfied ſo to have morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the Old Man, applied all his Thoughts in contriving the
reparation was in Publick and Solemn Pomp, to be made in
the preſence of the Auguſt Monarch of the Univerſe: To
which purpoſe he ſent for the <hi>Grand Dowanier,</hi> merrily ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, when he would make an end of his very good Friends
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95291:15"/>
buſineſs; adding, though with Authority, that it muſt now
be diſpatcht. They both were of opinion there would be
little difficulty in bringing it about, being certain the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
would not be ſorry to get forth of the trouble; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
now, when the Admiral was gone: But they thought
ſome Arguments would be neceſſary to perſuade him; as firſt,
That he was obliged by his promiſe, made as Ambaſſador, to
repair the damage done by his Maſter's Ships: That there
was an appearance too of Orders come from <hi>France,</hi> which
left it to his diſcretion, as things ſhould occur upon the place;
upon which, and other Arguments, they both concluded,
that if he was preſt and threat'ned he would yield. But the
<hi>Dowanier</hi> went on with the Diſcourſe to the <hi>Vizir</hi> in theſe
Terms: I can aſſure you, my moſt happy Maſter, that the
Ambaſſador demurs not but only for appearances; he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes
of the quality of the Preſents and quantity of Money,
that it may not be ſuppoſed in <hi>France</hi> he yields too eaſily;
give him a little time to pleaſe his fancy with feigned reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and he will make the leſs Reflection on the manner he
is to make his Submiſſions; he deſires to have it thought,
that he gives no Money, and deſires extremely to have that
remitted or conceal'd; but how can that be, when it muſt
be borrowed of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Hollanders?</hi> He would have
it likewiſe thought, that he Augments not his Preſents, when
already they are increas'd, and truſt to me ſhall be more yet;
I know beſides, ſays the <hi>Dowanier,</hi> that there is a Letter come
from the Emperor of <hi>France,</hi> containing excuſes for the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of <hi>Chio;</hi> therefore there will be no more to do but to
haſten him: They then conſulted the manner of proceeding;
firſt, he had been told beforehand, that it was a Cuſtom to
ſend to Debtors, even Ambaſſadors themſelves, a <hi>Chiaux</hi> to
mind them of what was expected from them, that they
might comply: But to amuſe the Ambaſſador, they concluded
to give him occaſion to feed his vanity, by the quality of
the Meſſenger was ſent unto him, which would be a little
comfort to him, for what he was to ſuffer. They ſent therefore
an Officer, that is, him who is Judge of the <hi>Chiauxes;</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95291:15"/>
was contriv'd to make the buſineſs more publick: When
he came to the Ambaſſador, accompanied by the Interpreter of
the Port, and had Communicated to him the Imperial Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
for payment, and the neceſſity of appeaſing the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s
wrath, by publick Submiſſions and Satisfactions, capable to
procure the effects of his Clemency: He again flew back to
his former Allegations and Imaginations, deſiring to defer
the buſineſs, proteſting he would not in the leaſt increaſe his
Preſents. But they being ſenſible of his diſſimulation, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd
him as ſoon as might be, to get out of the difficulty:
Which done the Judge of the Uſhers, and the Interpreter of
the Port left him: His Interpreters too, received daily the
ſame advice, with frequent Threats of the Seven Towers:
yet ſtill the Ambaſſadour ſeem'd both by Diſcourſe, and a
Letter he writ to the <hi>Kehaia,</hi> to be ready to ſuffer every thing,
even death it ſelf, rather then give ready Money, or indeed
any other Preſents, then what he had offer'd. But the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wanier</hi>
aſſuring the contrary, made it be judged a fit time
for Concluſion, which it was neceſſary ſhould be made with
Solemnity. And becauſe it was judged to be too much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
for the Ambaſſador to agree it with the <hi>Vizir,</hi> it was
reſolved it ſhould be with the Prime Secretary to this Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the Emperor of the World.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip is to conſider, that the Ambaſſadors of
<hi>France</hi> did not uſe to attend the <hi>Kehaia,</hi> but <hi>Incognito,</hi> and
Clothed in <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Habit, with few followers, pretending it
to be a Condeſcention below them, only comply'd with to
expedite buſineſs. But now it was judged neceſſary to
change that Cuſtom, and oblige the Ambaſſadour to come
in his own Habit, with his Interpreters, Secretaries, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
and Foot-men; that all the Town might know it was
the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, who came publickly to attend the
Secretary of the <hi>Vizir,</hi> to end the buſineſs about the Pardon
for the attempt at <hi>Chio,</hi> and to agree the reparations for the
damage done there. He made no difficulty to come pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
as was deſir'd, though perhaps he might be ignorant
of the Cauſe. The <hi>Kehaia</hi> propos'd to him the Augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95291:16"/>
of his Preſents, which he pretended to refuſe; they ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
earneſtly to preſs him, and he as earneſtly to reſiſt; but
all his ſeeming Obſtinacy, and their Reiterated Inſtances to
perſwade him, was no more but a meer Comedy, for the Sum
to be preſented the <hi>Sultan</hi> was adjuſted before: And the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wanier</hi>
had undertaken for the Augmentation of the Preſents.
So the Ambaſſador went back with an Imaginary ſatisfaction
of a Mock-bravery: He had cauſed a Rumor to be ſpread,
that he was to be ſent to the Seven Towers; that coming
back to his Houſe, it might be thought his Conduct had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
him, which would make both that, and his Courage
be admir'd at by Strangers: To which vapour of Vain-Glory
for his comfort we may quietly leave him; whilſt the moſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<hi>Vizir</hi> thought of nothing more then the manner to make
moſt viſible, moſt ſubmiſſive, and moſt acceptible, his Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Expiation for the attempt at <hi>Chio:</hi> It was firſt reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to take the opportunity to reduce the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
by this occaſion, to a cuſtom refuſed by all his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
and to which none of them would ever ſubmit; which
was, to have their Preſents ſeen and valued before they were
offer'd: It was ſuppoſed the Ambaſſador would hardly refuſe
it, if his Interpreters did but tell him it was the Cuſtom;
And we were very deſirous he ſhould yield to it at this time,
the more becauſe the People would the ſooner think he was
ready to Augment his Preſents, in caſe the <hi>Sultan</hi> ſhould
not in his Clemency agree to accept thoſe he had prepar'd:
He yielded the Point, and now nothing was in diſpute but
the place where the Preſents, the Money, and the <hi>French</hi>
Emperors Letter ſhould be receiv'd, who ſhould receive them,
who ſhould carry them, and in what manner they ſhould be
preſented. The Great <hi>Divan</hi> was thought one, as the place
where Ambaſſadors are receiv'd, the Army paid, and Juſtice
diſtributed: But this propoſition was rejected, as not publick
enough; and becauſe that things, which were to paſs in the
Submiſſion, might be confounded with the Ceremonies of the
Ambaſſadors Audience, which he ought not to receive till
ſome time after he had expiated that diſorder at <hi>Chio,</hi> the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95291:16"/>
only thing able to render him worthy the preſence of
the Emperor of the World. There were divers other places
propos'd, but after full Conſideration, that the injury for which
Reparation was to be made, had been done on the Sea, in the
Port of <hi>Chio,</hi> in the ſight of many Nations, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
at the very Gates of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> it was by all agreed,
That no place was more proper to receive ſatisfaction in, then
the Palace of <hi>Cara Muſtapha,</hi> moſt advantageouſly ſituated on
the Sea ſide, at the Entrance of the ſafeſt and largeſt Port in
the known World; a Port which is the Theatre of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritine
Strength of the Great <hi>Sultan</hi> of the <hi>Oſmans,</hi> and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
of the <hi>French, Engliſh, Holland,</hi> and <hi>Venetian</hi> Merchant
Ships; a Port, which is at leaſt a third part of it, incompaſt
about by the incomparable City of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſtanding in
manner of an Amphitheatre for five Miles together on its
Banks; on the other ſide being ſeen many Cities and Towns
fit for Capital Cities to great Realms: On the Waters where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
may be conſtantly ſeen an infinite number of Veſſels fill'd
with People from every Nation of the World. All theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
made the Dome of <hi>Cara Muſtapha</hi> favoured with ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
a ſituation, and expos'd to the view of moſt of the
Ambaſſadors, Miniſters, Reſidents, and Agents of the Chriſtian
Princes, be thought moſt proper; that they as well as all the
People and Grandees of the Empire might ſee, that none
could with impunity offend the Sovereign Majeſty of the
Emperor of the World. They likewiſe the ſooner agreed on
the choice of that place, as being a ſumptuous Palace, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Maritine Throne of the Emperor of the two Seas;
where the Muſick that diverts him, is that of Trumpets, Ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-Drums,
and Cannons; which, with the noiſe of Oars, and
continual hurry of Ships and Galleys, fills the Air with an
agreeable Confuſion: It is in this place too the Admirals pay
their Homage, bringing thither the proofs of their Victories,
in the Spoils of the Enemies of the Faith. So there being no
place more proper for the Deſign of the Supreme <hi>Vizir,</hi> it
was agreed, that if the <hi>Sultan</hi> did not chuſe it of himſelf, it
ſhould be propoſed to him. It was then debated, who ſhould
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95291:17"/>
receive the Submiſſions of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador; and ſome
propos'd either the <hi>Kehaia</hi> or Intendant of the Grand <hi>Vizir:</hi>
But becauſe the Enterpriſe, for which Pardon was to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
regarded directly the Perſon of the <hi>Sultan;</hi> and that
it belong'd to none but him, to ſit upon the Throne of the
Sea, the <hi>Vizir</hi> reſolved to take the time when this Sovereign
of the World was come (as he often did) to this Dome of
<hi>Cara Muſtapha:</hi> That he would know in the mean time, if
His Highneſs were ready to receive the moſt humble Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, who till then ſhould be
kept in ſuſpence of that happy Moment: It reſted then to
determine, how the Ambaſſador ſhould perform his Duty:
about which ſome were of Opinion he ſhould do it in Perſon;
But becauſe he had not yet receiv'd Publick Audience from
the <hi>Vizir,</hi> it was concluded he ſhould ſend his Principal Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer,
that was his Secretary, to make ſatisfaction, by carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and expoſing the Preſents, and Money, and to deliver the
Letter from the Emperor of <hi>France.</hi> They had a Preſident of
the like nature with the * <hi>Bailo</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Or Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador.</note> about the <hi>Vallone,</hi>
where the <hi>Venetians</hi> had attack't thoſe of <hi>Barbary.</hi> As like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the yearly practice of the Secretary of that Republick,
when he brings the Tribute of five thouſand <hi>Chiquins.</hi> In
fine, they promis'd, the <hi>Vizir</hi> ſo to conduct all things, that it
ſhould appear a perfect Submiſſion, or Publick Penance for
what had paſt at <hi>Chio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Grand <hi>Dowanier,</hi> who had charged himſelf with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing, Congratulated the Soveraign <hi>Vizir</hi> that the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
was ſo well adjuſted: You have, ſaith he, My Lord,
part of what you deſire, and ſhall have the reſt; whileſt we
leave the Ambaſſador the vain ſatisfaction to repent and ſay,
That his Condeſcentions are only Perſonal, and his Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
as a private Man, That it was for his own proper ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
he made his Preſents; That the Money is for another
occaſion, and that he hath Writ nothing to <hi>France</hi> of all this
buſtle, All theſe Pretences are but bad Colours, and worſe
ſhadows, agreeing ill with the quality of him they are deſigned
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95291:17"/>
to ſerve: For if he be not Ambaſſador, can he be worthy
to rub his Face with the Duſt of the Feet of the Invincible
<hi>Sultan,</hi> whoſe Grandeur God will increaſe to the very Day of
Judgment? Is it not certain, it was not the Ambaſſador who
fired the Cannons againſt <hi>Chio,</hi> but the Emperor of
<hi>France</hi>'s General, purſued the <hi>Dorwanier?</hi> And is it not as plain,
that he for this, as Ambaſſador muſt ſubmit? He is obliged
to it by Writing, in which he engages to procure his Maſters
Letter of excuſe, and in ſix Months time to have Preſents
brought from <hi>France?</hi> Theſe are here and not intended for his
Audience: he has too procur'd the Summ of Money agreed
upon. I know he boaſts that all has been done is agreeable
to the Emperor of <hi>France:</hi> From whence may be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that his Impriſonment, his promiſe of Preſents, and of a
Letter of excuſe to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> are agreeable to the Emperor of
<hi>France:</hi> And that it is time therefore to come to a Concluſion.
Let the Ambaſſador then, ſay what he pleaſes, and form to
himſelf pleaſant Chymera's: Provided the Reality of his
Submiſſions conformable to our Cuſtoms and Manners, which
ought to be a Law to the World; clears away the ſhadow
from the true Throne which is the Sanctuary to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of the Age; ſurrounded by thoſe Mountains on which
ſtands the Capital City, from whence the Noiſe and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Action will fly to the reſt of the Earth. This was
very near the Diſcourſe of the <hi>Dowanier,</hi> who ſaid too that
he would go and ſend for the <hi>French</hi> Interpreters, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
them to inſinuate to their Maſter; that all things were
contriv'd for his Honor, as would appear to the aſtoniſhments
of all Strangers; that the Preſents and Reſpects would be
receiv'd by the great Emperor of the <hi>Oſmans,</hi> and that perhaps
he would come for that purpoſe to a place where he only goeth
for extraordinary Ceremonies, they ſhall adviſe him too, that
for his greater Glory he muſt intreat as a ſignal favour,
to have his Preſents carried by his own People, as his
Secretary and ſome Merchants. The <hi>Dowanier</hi> having
ſaid this kiſt the Veſt of the Soveraign <hi>Vizir,</hi> and retir'd. He
performed all. The Interpreters found the Ambaſſador ready
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95291:18"/>
to put in Action every thing he advis'd him, and extreamly
earneſt quickly to receive the imaginary Glory was promis'd
him.</p>
            <p>There were ſome days paſt ſince the viſit of the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
to the <hi>Kehara</hi> of the <hi>Vizir:</hi> That he might not therefore
be in doubt, word was ſent him that his Affairs were in ſo
good a poſture, and ſo near a Concluſion, that he would ſoon
ſee a glorious end of them: It was then inſinuated to him
that the grand <hi>Dowanier</hi> was one of the moſt conſiderable
Officers of the Empire; That he commanded all the Seas,
from the <hi>Basphore</hi> to <hi>Smyrna</hi> and <hi>Chio:</hi> That all Merchandizes
and every Slave of the World, as well Male as Female paid
him Tribute: That he had the Honor to provide for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> by whom he was ſometimes viſited, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lookt upon as one of his Favourites. This was ſuggeſted to
make the Ambaſſdor know, that if the <hi>Dowanier</hi> viſited him,
it was a particular Favour, and a Prerogative with which the
P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rt would honour him: And that though the Merchandize and
Wealth of all the World found Legs to attend this Officer to
obtain leave to be Sold, or the Honour to be detain'd for the
<hi>Sultan:</hi> He himſelf would come to the Ambaſſador to ſee and
examin his Preſents, and to contribute all he could to make
them in ſome meaſure worthy the acceptance and clemency of
the Invincible Emperor: The concluſion was, That he was not
only to receive the Grand <hi>Dowanier</hi> with demonſtrations of
acknowledgment and Friendſhip; but with all kind of
Honor, being to be attended by his principal Officers, <hi>Turks</hi>
and <hi>Jews;</hi> that is to ſay, thoſe of his Tribunal, proper for
the buſineſs he was ſent about.</p>
            <p>The Interpreters that were inſtructed in the main Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
were the firſt that by Order of their Maſter, put them
in execution: One of them went to fetch the <hi>Dowanier</hi> from
his Houſe; bringing with him a Horſe of the Ambaſſadors.
He was receiv'd at the Gate of the <hi>French</hi> Palace by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary,
Chief Interpreter, and other Domeſticks; the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95291:18"/>
met him in the Hall, and led him upon the <hi>Sofa,</hi>
where being placed in a Seat of Honor, the firſt Interpreter
having kiſt his Veſt, ſaid to him: That the Ambaſſador con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
him as one of his beſt Friends, bid him heartily wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com,
That he was extreamly pleas'd to ſee him, after all the
trouble he had given him, That he might perſonally return him
thanks, which he did ſincerely; That he had often, and
would continue to inform the Emperor of <hi>France</hi> of all the
good Offices he daily did his Subjects, in point of Commerce:
That all the Factory as well as the Ambaſſador himſelf, were
indebted to him for the concluſion of a buſineſs, had made
ſo much noiſe. To which the <hi>Dowanier</hi> made Anſwer; I boaſt,
ſaith he, nothing, but am a Friend at need; God knows what
I have done, and ſhall do: you have many Enemies, thoſe of
your own Religion,<note place="margin">So the <hi>Turks</hi> call all Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern-<hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiars.</hi>
               </note> and <hi>Francs,</hi> as you are, do not much
love you, nor are they much troubled to ſee the <hi>French</hi> ill
us'd, ſome of them gave continual Intelligence of things might
have anger'd the <hi>Vizir,</hi> if his Moderation and Prudence had
not retain'd him: He has not long ſince had aſſurances, that
the <hi>Padicha</hi> of <hi>France</hi> ſent to the Emperor of <hi>Germany;</hi> offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him aſſiſtance, in caſe our Maſter the Invincible
<hi>Sultan,</hi> broke with that Prince, or to make him if he
could declare War by way of Advance againſt us:
Others on the contrary ſide would perſwade us, That the
<hi>French</hi> would ſuddenly be at War, both with the <hi>Germans,</hi>
and moſt part of Chriſtendom: But the Grand <hi>Vizir</hi> confider'd
all theſe reports as the meer effects of baſe Envy, and ſordid
Jealouſie, being reſolved (purſued the <hi>Dowanier</hi>) to give you
proofs of his Friendſhip; I come therefore to tell you, he
as preſented the offer of your Submiſſions to the Imperial
<hi>Eſtrier;</hi> and conjectures they may be near acceptance, that
is, of being acceptible. The Ambaſſador denied all thoſe
things which ſeem'd to wound the Reputation of his Maſter:
And the <hi>Dowanier</hi> ſeeming to believe him, changed the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe,
ſaying, come let's to work, I have brought hither my
Officers that value the Cuſtoms, to make Eſtimation of your
Preſents according to uſage; and offer you my advice, as a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95291:19"/>
friend, wherein to augment them, that they may in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
be worthy to be offer'd the Emperor, Supporter of the
World; and that we may the better prevail with him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
them. They thereupon brought the <hi>Dowanier</hi> into the
faireſt Chamber of the <hi>French</hi> Seraglio, where he was much
ſurpriſed not to ſee the Principal Wall garniſh'd with Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Glaſſes:
But applying himſelf to the Obſervation of the
Preſents, and adviſing with the Praiſers, he told the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador
that theſe he brought with him, but he muſt add to
them thoſe he had ſince ſent for from <hi>France,</hi> beſides ſome
Jewels: Theſe laſt the Ambaſſador deſired him to buy for
him, which he promiſed to do: He mention'd too the ready
Money, but the Ambaſſador proteſted he had none, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
him to lend him ſome; which he conſented to do:
But the Ambaſſador deſiring that the Money might be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
ſecretly, could obtain only a doubtful anſwer from the
<hi>Dowanier;</hi> though to comfort him he readily granted him
another requeſt, which was, That his Preſents might be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to the <hi>Sultan</hi> by his own People. This, though the
ſureſt proof of his Submiſſion, was by the <hi>Dowanier</hi> magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to him as an exceeding favour, who told him, it muſt be
done then by his <hi>Kehaia,</hi> Clerks, and ſome Merchants; who
muſt be well Inſtructed, to comply with all the Ceremonies
would be taught them; and to behave themſelves with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty,
Silence, and Gravity. He then mention'd the Letter
from the Emperor of <hi>France,</hi> which the Ambaſſador would
have excuſed, but at laſt promiſed to deliver. This whole
Intertainment, and great Negotiation, was mingled with thoſe
ordinary ones of <hi>Cahu, Sherbet,</hi> and <hi>Sweet-water,</hi> and more
then one Collation of Fruit. The Ambaſſador often reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his Proteſtations of Friendſhip and Acknowledgment to
the <hi>Dowanier;</hi> the Praiſers neither were not forgotten: So
when it was time to part, the <hi>Dowanier</hi> bid him fear nothing,
for he would go to the Grand <hi>Vizir,</hi> to know whether he had
received Orders from the invincible Emperor, for ending the
buſineſs: The ſame honours were done him going, as when
he came, with repeated intreaties for a ſpeedy Concluſion:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95291:19"/>
He came immediately to the Sovereign <hi>Vizir,</hi> and gave him
a pleaſant account of all had paſt; but above all, they were
pleas'd at the Ambaſſadors haſt, whom therefore they agreed
ſhould be made ſolicite ſome days; which he did to the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wanier</hi>
earneſtly for the three following, receiving only dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Anſwers: But then the <hi>Dowanier</hi> went to his Houſe
again, and carried with him the Jewels he had bought with
the ready money, receiving the ſame Honours, as at firſt,
but could not appoint a poſitive day for a Concluſion; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
the <hi>Sultan</hi> had not yet appointed one; but he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
the Ambaſſador not to be diſcouraged, but in the
mean time ſend the Letter and Preſents to the Grand <hi>Vizir</hi>'s,
that the manner of carrying them might be Regulated, which
was immediately done: They brought too the ready money,
having in ſome manner agreed it ſhould be received private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
There was in the mean time a certain Memorial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to the Emperor of the World, ſent him by the Grand
<hi>Vizir</hi> in this Form: <q>My moſt Magnanimous, moſt Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
and moſt Happy Emperor, be pleaſed to behold what
is brought before you by the greateſt of your Slaves; It is
that your Slave the Ambaſſador of <hi>France</hi> makes continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Supplications, to implore Pardon for what paſt at <hi>Chio:</hi>
He hath never ſince that misfortune ceaſed to uſe his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
endeavours, to eſcape the terrible Grief of Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſo great a raſhneſs Merited; and to preſerve the
whole <hi>French</hi> Nation from the extirpating furious Sword
of the Monarch of the World: To which purpoſe he is
fled to the Cittadel of Submiſſion, and there humbly waits
for the happy Moment, wherein he may be admitted to
rub his Face with the duſt of the Feet of your Invincible,
and ever Triumphant Highneſs: He begs you would be
pleaſed to caſt an Eye tending towards acceptance, both
on the Letter of the Emperor his Maſter; and on the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
and Preſents he (according to the Orders he hath
received) is ready to expoſe at the Foot of Your Sublime
Throne: And which at preſent are in the poſſeſſion of me,
who has the honour to be Your Slave: He confeſſes
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95291:20"/>
them to be mean, if conſider'd with the Majeſty of the
Perſon they are deſigned to, but hopes they may become
of value by the Acceptance, being ſure proofs of his Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalage,
and Teſtimonies of his moſt Submiſſive and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Repentance, for the diſorder at <hi>Chio.</hi> It remains in the
breaſt of your Highneſs to Command any other thing you
pleaſe, which your Slave the Ambaſſador is ready to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The wiſe Emperor, who penetrates into the moſt ſecret
and difficult things, to whom the Almighty God grant for
ever a Happy and Glorious Reign, Commanded the Grand
<hi>Vizir</hi> to appear at his Foot; of whom he Inquired, Whether
all he writ was ſincere; and whether there was no Trick,
by which thoſe Infidels might ſhelter themſelves in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
of Treachery and Inſolence. The Grand <hi>Vizir</hi> aſſured
him he had reaſon to believe, that the Ambaſſador was in
earneſt: Whereupon this Sovereign, who is the Delight and
Glory of the World, ſpoke thus: The <hi>French,</hi> though ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate
in Error, are nevertheleſs protected by our High and
Imperial Power, in hopes we may one day reduce them to
receive the true Faith: Their Emperour boaſts to be our
moſt Ancient Friend, yet have they acted like Traytors,
and Enemies at <hi>Chio:</hi> But becauſe they readily humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
I ſubmit to the moſt high and abſolute Commands
of the holy Prophet, which ſaith, <hi>When you have Power over
your Enemy, pay me the Tithes of the Victory, by the Pardon
you ſhall give him.</hi> I am therefore diſpoſed to Pardon and
forget the Ingratitude of theſe Infidels, whom I have loaded
with my Sublime Favours; having granted to their laſt
Ambaſſadour, with conſiderable advantages, the Renovation
of the Capitulations denied to ſo many of his Predeceſſors.
The Emperor pauſed a little, and then addreſſing it to the
<hi>Grand Vizir,</hi> who durſt not yet ſpeak, purſued thus: Let
the Ambaſſador be well inſtructed in the Glory he is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to receive by his Submiſſions, Humility, and Publick
Repentance; whereby he not only diſarms our Rage; but
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95291:20"/>
procures to his Maſter the Confirmation of a Friendſhip,
and Alliance, to him ſo Glorious, that it will render him ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
to his Enemies.</p>
            <p>The Grand <hi>Vizir</hi> with a moſt ſubmiſſive bow, intreated the
mighty <hi>Sultan</hi> of the <hi>Oſmans</hi> to appoint the place, where he
would have his Slave the Ambaſſador make publick to the
World, his Repentance and moſt ſubmiſſive Reſpects, with
the proofs of a Fidelity, ſhould be no more ſubject to a change
the Emperor Replied, he would ſend his pleaſure in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
which came in this Form: I ſhall God willing, to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and next day divert my ſelf with the noiſe of the
Waves of the Sea; to reflect my Grandure in that Liquid
Cryſtal Miroir; and to delight my ears with the Artificial
Thunder and confuſion of Voices, which Reigns uſually on
that Element. I go to Seat my ſelf at the Entrance of the
Port on my Maritime Throne,<note place="margin">Pallace.</note> in the <hi>Kieusk</hi> of <hi>Muſtapha Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ha;</hi>
where the Sea ſeems to be ſummon'd into a long and
large Court, only to do Homage to my Imperial Seat, the
vaſt City of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> It is there, its natural inconſtancy
cannot hinder it from rendring me perpetual Homage, in the
name of other Seas: And to glory in bringing me Tributes
and Submiſſions conſtantly, from all the Princes of the
World. There I inſpire my Officers, with power of Gaining
Victories with eaſe, in granting them the glory at ſetting
forth, to proſtrate themſelves at my feet: And there at their
return I receive the proofs of thoſe Victories they have gain'd
in my name. It may be truly called the Abridgment of the World;
Being the refuge of all the Nations of the ſeven Climates, who
think themſelves happy in bringing thither their moſt
precious Merchandizes, for the uſe of me and my Slaves. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

with vaſt numbers of Ships and Galleys, and Beautified
by thoſe Mountains cloath'd with Moſques, Towns and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts
which encompaſs it about; Whileſt I there divert my ſelf,
true Emperor of the World, and make reflections of what I
owe to God, the unchangeable Lord; for giving me ſo beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95291:21"/>
a Reſidence in this periſhing World; as an earneſt of that
he hath prepar'd for me in the other, which ſhall never end:
You may cauſe to be brought before me, the ſubmiſſions of
the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador; in a manner, as much proportion'd
as can be to our Grandure, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he quality of Protector of the
true Faith, a Title we more eſteem than that of all our Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
This is what we Ordain; And thou who art our Grand
<hi>Vizir,</hi> and Counſellor, full of Glory, muſt give odedience
to this.</p>
            <p>The moſt diſcerning and prudent <hi>Vizir,</hi> was extreamly
pleas'd, that a Soul like his, ſo much Inferior to that of our
moſt invincible Maſter; ſhould enter into Sentiments ſo
agreeable to the clear thoughts of that incomparable Emperor.
He ſent preſently for the <hi>Dowanier,</hi> and Communicated thoſe
Orders to him, which none muſt diſobey without the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of being loſt: He aſſured the Grand <hi>Vizir,</hi> that he was
continually ſollicited for a diſpatch by the <hi>French</hi> Interpreters,
who were ſcarcely ever from him. So it was concerted that
the next day but one all ſhould be finiſht; of which the
principal Officers of the Port had notice: And things were ſo
order'd that the Common People might not be ignorant nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The Emperor of the two Seas, being accordingly come
to the <hi>Kieusk</hi> of <hi>Muſtapha Pasha,</hi> there took for ſome time the
pleaſure of a true Emperor; and being ſet at Dinner, they
cauſed the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors Preſents to be brought from
the Grand <hi>Vizir</hi>'s; where, as I before told your happy
Lordſhip, they had been depoſited three or four days; and
placed them in a Houſe near the Palace, under the conduct of
an Officer of the Port; And over againſt the <hi>Kendi,</hi> were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to publick view the Ambaſſadors People, his Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
and chief Clerk, a Merchant and three Interpreters,
who were the principal together with ten or twelve Footmen:
Theſe had waited with great impatience from day break, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
this happy moment; Then by Order of the Principal
Uſher,<note place="margin">Maſter of the Robes.</note> and Maſter of the <hi>Caftans,</hi> the ſix firſt had each of
them a <hi>Caſtau</hi> or Veſt of honour delivered them; Thus with
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95291:21"/>
the Interpreter of the Port, and a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Officer, in <hi>Caftans</hi>
at the head of them, they marched followed by the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <p>Theſe eight in Robes with the reſt of the Ambaſſadors Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
took each of them a part of the Preſent, and fyled one
after the other, with all the Gravity, Modeſty and Silence,
becoming a buſineſs of that nature: They were made ſtop
at one of the corners of the Pallace: And being drawn into
a Rank, with their Backs towards the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and Faces to
the Sea, Eyes caſt down, their Feet ſtreight and cloſed to one
another, each man held his part of the Preſent, elevated
with both his hands, as high, and as much expos'd to the
publick as might be; in which humble poſture having ſtood
a ſufficient time for the People to view and diſtinguiſh every
thing, they were diſcharged from that honour by the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of the Emperor, ſupporter of the World.</p>
            <p>It is not certainly known, how many Purſes of Money
were amongſt the Preſents, but ſome there were, and theſe
carried to his Highneſs, by him who had Order'd the whole
Ceremony,<note place="margin">Maſter of Kequeſts.</note> which is the <hi>Telkedgi.</hi> The Emperor of the World
caſt one corner of his Eye upon them, which Communicated
to them all their value and eſteem they ought to have: This
<hi>Corifee</hi> and Maſter of the Kings of the World, This mighty
Emperor of the <hi>Oſmanli;</hi> had the pleaſure to read the excuſes
of the Emperor of <hi>France,</hi> in his Letter deliver'd him by the
Grand <hi>Vizir;</hi> in which he aſſures him, he had given no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to his Admiral to diſturb the Antient Alliance, but on
the contrary to ſtrengthen it; But if in purſuing and fighting
the <hi>Tripolins</hi> his Enemies there had happened any wrong to
his Highneſs's Territories, he was troubled at it, and deſired
him not to take it ill; but conſider that thoſe Thieves had
before ſet upon the <hi>French</hi> Merchants in his Highneſs's Ports:
That though he had great reaſon to complain that the Fort
of <hi>Chio</hi> had fired upon his Flag, yet he freely forgot it, to
ſhew to what degree he would be a Friend to the moſt invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95291:22"/>
Emperor of the <hi>Muſulmans.</hi> Whileſt his Highneſs was
accepting theſe proteſtations of Fidelity, which he believed
ſincere; to prove them ſo, the <hi>Telkedgi</hi> and Interpreter of the
Port appeared, followed by the three Interpreters of <hi>France;</hi>
who being come to a certain diſtance ſtayed, and had the
honour to touch the Ground of the Field, before the <hi>Sultans</hi>
Throne with their Faces; there holding them as long a time
as is required to boyl an Egg: In this manner, without being
held, they ſaluted the Emperor; being by Birth Slaves to the
Grand Seignior: But the <hi>Kahaia,</hi> and Clerk to the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador,
with the <hi>French</hi> Merchant, who are only to be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Slaves by Force, and Repreſenters of their Maſter; were
held by two Uſhers, each in Veſts of Ceremonies, who exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
their Arms with one hand, and carried in the other Silver
Staves which they often rub'd on the ground with great noiſe,
and a certain Motion of Grandure and Oſtentation. Theſe
Conductors who led their Slaves like Victimes in ſeeming haſt,
made them ſtop as ſuddenly; ſaying to them in a rude Tone
<note n="*" place="margin">Stand.</note> 
               <hi>Dour.</hi> When the <hi>Telkedgi,</hi> and Interpreter of the Port, with
the three <hi>French</hi> Interpreters had done proſtrating; then might
be ſeen theſe chief Porters or Uſhers, like Maskers of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
ſo well inſtruct their <hi>French-men,</hi> that without
quitting their Shoulders or prejudicing the extenſion of their
Arms, they all kneeled ſoftly down, and imprinted their
Faces in the Duſt, in the open view of the Sun, remaining in
that poſture ſo long as it pleaſed the Emperor of the World;
who being well ſatisfyed with ſo full a reparation, made a
ſign almoſt imperceptible for taking them away.<note place="margin">Porter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

are ſo perfectly inſtructed in theſe Ceremonies, that
the leaſt motion of the Field is to them enough, ſo they rais'd
haſtily theſe proſtrated Slaves, and made them return back
without giving them time to behold the ſublime Majeſty of
the Emperor of the World, who was ſeated at a great diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
Thus the <hi>French-men</hi> performed their Commiſſion in
repreſenting the true ſubmiſſions of their Ambaſſador.</p>
            <p>The Auguſt and terrible <hi>Sultan</hi> of the <hi>Oſmanli,</hi> was Seated
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95291:22"/>
on his Throne at the entrance of the open Gallery, which
Ranges on that ſide of the <hi>Kieusk,</hi> which is towards the

doth not yet admit him to his Councels or <hi>Divan,</hi> but
keeps him in a plain Equipage, having him only often with
him at Hunting, Walking, Riding, and other diverſions; yet
his Highneſs would have him with him, to be a Witneſs of
the reſpects, ſubmiſſion and publick Repentance of the <hi>French</hi>
Ambaſſador; to make this young Prince ſenſible how
much the name of <hi>Oſman,</hi> which he muſt one day ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
was rever'd through the whole World, ſince the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of <hi>France,</hi> the greateſt Monarch of the belief of the <hi>Meſſia,</hi>
and terror to the reſt of thoſe Infidel Princes, whoſe Armies
and Garriſons are innumerable, and Treaſures inexhauſtible,

               <hi>Itheoglans:</hi> The Grand

of this moſt remarkable Affair: the chief Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
whereof are Recorded in the Regiſters of the Empire.
The great ones, nay the very People talk of it with delight
in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the news of it is gone to <hi>Perſia, Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>

               <hi>Droguemans</hi> of our Friends Allies,

many of the Secretaries and Clerks of the Imperial Regiſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have
writ exactly to the <hi>Pachas</hi> and <hi>Beglarbeigs</hi> of this vaſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
preſerved by God, concerning it. And I think my ſelf
happy to have been choſen to Communicate all theſe glorious
circumſtances to my moſt honoured Lord. The matter is in it
ſelf ſo ſplendid, that it needs no more but the pure and ſimple
relation to make it be admir'd; and Eloquence would but
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95291:23"/>
ſerve to hide ſome part of the Luſter: I have therefore uſed no
diſguiſes, nor indeed heſitated to mix ſome particulars in my
relation which deſerve to be kept ſecret; ſo that I have made
this rather a little Book then a Letter, nor have I yet fully
done, having forgot to relate to you the ſatisfaction of the
Ambaſſador in having got out of ſo difficult an Employment:
he magnifies his own Conduct, and has writ about it to his
Countrey, as well as given an account thereof to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
reſiding from other Princes, at the happy Port. And
he is ſo ſtrongly perſwaded that he hath done his Maſter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Service; that he hath ſent proofs of his acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to all thoſe he thought inſtrumental in procuring ſo
mighty an advantage as the Pardon of the moſt invincible
Emperor of the <hi>Muſulmans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The moſt diſcerning <hi>Vizir,</hi> ſo conducted this whole affair,
to the ſole Glory of our invincible <hi>Suitan;</hi> that there is not
the leaſt Circumſtance, or moſt minute paſſage can be Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
to the contrary, except by men of ſhatter'd under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings;
we are therefore confirmed by it, in that eſteem
which is due to his Merit: and may avow with juſtice the
moſt ſubmiſſive acknowledgments and thanks given him by
the Ambaſſador, which were accompanied with Preſents that
teſtified the Gratitude due to this Miniſter, for ſo well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhing
the Negotiation, Trade and Alliance with the
<hi>French,</hi> which without his Mediation to his Highneſs, was
in hazard to have broke: The effects whereof could not have
been otherways then Bloody.</p>
            <p>The Ambaſſador believ'd himſelf much honoured by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
words of Gratitude, which lookt a little like thanks from
the Grand <hi>Vizir:</hi> Nor has he wanted to acknowledge the
pains and endeavours of the moſt illuſtrious <hi>Kehaia,</hi> the <hi>Reſefen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di</hi>
Lord of the Clerks of the two<note n="*" place="margin">Regiſters.</note> 
               <hi>Teskeredgis, Chaoux Pacha,</hi>
Principal Uſher of the Interpreter of the Port, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of whoſe Friendſhips he makes ſure account. The
<hi>Dowanier</hi> who mediated all, did not labour for nothing: his
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95291:23"/>
reward was not forgotten, nor will be wanting hereafter for
the proofs he will daily give the <hi>French,</hi> Merchants of his
Friendſhip to them, or rather that he bears to himſelf.</p>
            <p>I muſt, My Lord, ſay one word or two concerning the
many mercies which God pours forth, on the Mighty <hi>Sultan</hi>
of the <hi>Oſmanli;</hi> of which, though we have a thouſand Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
in my opinion none are more viſible or ſtronger
proofs, then the Jealouſie he is pleaſed to ſow amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Princes: We know ſome of the effects this paſſion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
in the Countries of thoſe Infidels: But if our Grandure
and Power, which is arriv'd to ſo great a height, makes us
not neglect to enter into the thoughts of this Subject, in
certain particulars, which we have now before us, and which
will inſtruct us in many things; we ſhall eaſily perceive it
to be the perfect hand of God, which in Mercy to us ſo blinds
the Chriſtians, that moſt of their Princes are reduced to the
neceſſity of ſeeking the friendſhip of the Port, to divert from
them the fury of thoſe Armies which Command Victory.
And there may be diſcerned amongſt the Chriſtian Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
a moſt particular Application for the deſtruction of one
another. They ſeem indeed only ſo many ſpyes, not upon
our Government, but of what paſſes in the Countreys of
their Neighbours: And above all of any weakneſs amongſt
them, of which they think themſelves ſo happy to Inform us,
that they even make us deaf with their news; and ſo the
Glory of our Maſter, which permits not that we ſhould have
Ambaſſadors rende in their Courts, doth not the leaſt preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
to his Affairs. This Curſe of God upon the Chriſtians
has gained us many Victories, and gives us eaſie Conqueſts:
And you may diſcern a part of their Conduct, by what I
have ſaid about the buſineſs of <hi>Chio;</hi> and I may add truly,
that there never appear'd ſo much Zeal amongſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Miniſters againſt thoſe of <hi>France</hi> as then.</p>
            <p>They would come and tell us. That the Emperor of <hi>France</hi>
is an Ambitious and reſtleſs Prince, very Powerful and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95291:24"/>
who diſturbs all his Neighbours, and gives them great
trouble by his Victories and Money, that he would ſeem to
be a friend to the Port, whilſt he gives great Succours in all
places againſt it; that he values himſelf to the Pope by the
great deſigns he hath againſt the Turks; that we ought
to conſider him as a dangerous Enemy, and the greateſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litician
of the World; that all the reſt of Chriſtendom was
Confederating againſt him; and that the King of <hi>Germany</hi>
expected but the renewing of the Truce with us, to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in the Head of the League againſt him. The <hi>Venetians,</hi>
though for their particular Intereſt they ſhould deſire a War
between us and the <hi>Germans,</hi> yet nevertheleſs have not cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to excite as much as poſſible, the hatred of his Highneſs
to the <hi>French;</hi> and it is certain the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and others
did the ſame: They would all have ingaged us in a Rupture
with <hi>France;</hi> but the moſt diſcerning <hi>Vizir,</hi> who knows
how to make his advantage of every thing, is very well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with the Reparation of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador. He can
likewiſe, when he pleaſes, ſell very dear to the <hi>German</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
the Renewing the Truce; and in appearance preferrs
doing ſo to that of the War, notwithſtanding the intereſts of
thoſe would perſwade the contrary: He will Attaque the
<hi>Venetians</hi> ſooner then they dream of, and not fail to draw
Money from the others: He hears when he pleaſes, and
ſometimes lends an Ear to a buſineſs of which he will ſeem
to underſtand nothing: He will caſt out hopes, when neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
the more eaſily to deceive believing that moſt of thoſe
Negotiate with him, do but watch for opportunities to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
him; ſo it is very difficult to pleaſe him with any thing:
Delays, ſpinning out time; a haſtineſs like Anger, and haughty
Fierceneſs are to him Natural, and of great Advantage: He
never Treats directly, in the beginning of a Negotiation, but
leaves it to be managed by his moſt experienced Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
the better to take his Meaſures, for its Concluſion: If
he loves Money it is to Augment the Treaſures of his Maſter;
As his reaſon is Infinite, and capable of diſcerning what is in
his Power, and what not, ſo he governs with an abſolute
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95291:24"/>
Authority, and cuts off the heads of any dare oppoſe him;
and this way cannot chuſe but be good, and pleaſing to God,
ſince it is for the Preſervation and Propagation of the true
Faith, and for increaſing the Glory, and Proſperity of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
who is the Protector and Defender of the Divine Unity;
and the moſt worthy Succeſſor of the greateſt of the Prophets,
<hi>Mouhamet Mouſtafa:</hi> I have thus weakly mention'd a few of
thoſe Qualities, which recommend our Grand <hi>Vizir;</hi> and I
is may ſafely add, that it impoſſible but he ſhould be a very able
Man; having been Educated under the Conduct and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the bleſſed <hi>Kedgia Mhammed Pacha,</hi> and of his Son <hi>Ahmet</hi>
deceaſed, which were the Two <hi>Kieupruli</hi>'s; He Acted and
Govern'd under theſe two great Men: But to compleat his
Character, we need only ſay, he is the Choice of the Emperor
of the two Continents and two Seas; the Poſſeſſor of the two
moſt Auguſt Cities, our Maſter; the <hi>Kaliſe</hi> of the Age, who
has Conquer'd the Realm of <hi>Candia;</hi> and the moſt Impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Fortreſs of <hi>Cameniek,</hi> whoſe Grandure God will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,
and give him a bleſſed end: See my moſt honor'd

ever ſerving You.</p>

OBSERVATION
By way of
Continuation of the former Letter, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Negotiation of Monſieur
Guilleragues.</head>
            <p>THe Affairs of the Port may juſtly occaſion
very ſerious Reflections, ſince it is very
viſible, That the Motions of the <hi>Sultan,</hi>
and his Grand <hi>Vizir,</hi> do hold all the Chriſtian
part of <hi>Europe</hi> in ſuſpence: We have ſeen on the
one ſide the Emperor hope with a little too much
Confidence the renewing the Truce; but he had
certainly obtained it without all thoſe pains he
hath taken, if he had not ſo long given Ear to
thoſe Politicks, which advis'd him not to draw
the Forces of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperor too haſtily upon
him: His Imperial Majeſty without this fear, had
vigorouſly oppoſed the Progreſs of the Male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
in <hi>Hungary:</hi> A Reſolution ſo neceſſary had
ſubdued thoſe Rebels, and made the Infidels know
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95291:26"/>
he was ready to receive them: but whilſt that
Court became Ballanced with a deſire of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the War another way, they delayed both;
and through an untimely Fear of the moſt remote
danger, ſtood ſtill in an unactive Speculation, which
perhaps may draw upon them Enemies from all
ſides. <hi>Sultan Mehemet</hi> the Fourth is in Warlike
Pomp ſet forth from his Capital City, followed by
Count <hi>Alberte Caprara,</hi> whoſe Negotiation appears
to be brought to Extremity: But becauſe there
is often ſeen ſtrange Changes in great Affairs; he
flatters himſelf with hopes that ſome remedy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
upon the Frontiers, may work effectually,
even when the Diſeaſe appears moſt deſperate:
The <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> in the mean time, has remained
certain days in the Camp of <hi>Davont Pacha;</hi> and
notwithſtanding his obſtinacy of remaining in his
Tents, in defiance of Eighteen hours violent Rain,
he was at laſt forced to quit them, and the danger
he ran of being drown'd, fell upon three or four
of his People, who were loſt at a paſſage through
certain Waters, where the Bridge was broken
down: There was alſo loſt ſeveral rich things,
both of his Highneſs and other great ones, who
accompanied him; but this Emperor after a little
reſt, to give time to the Waters to fall, continued
his march to <hi>Adrianople.</hi> The <hi>Grand Vizir,</hi> who
has been in his Tents ever ſince the march of the
Emperor from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> began to follow on
the Nineteenth of <hi>October</hi> very early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95291:26"/>
to joyn his Highneſs; carrying with him the
ſatisfaction of having deluded Monſieur <hi>Guillerd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues</hi>
to the very laſt: But may not one think that
this Miniſter deceives himſelf in that pleaſure, ſince
it is apparent, that Ambaſſador hath contributed
more then he to his being cheated by him.</p>
            <p>He Negotiates no longer about the Firing at
<hi>Chio,</hi> that buſineſs was determined ſufficiently to
his Glory, if you will credit the <hi>Paris</hi> Gazette;
Or as it is well Explain'd by another, It is the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
of the <hi>Sofa</hi> continues.</p>
            <p>We muſt remember that whilſt Monſieur <hi>De
Queſne,</hi> beſieged the Galleys in the Port of <hi>Chio,</hi> to
oblige the <hi>Vizir</hi> to grant the <hi>Sofa;</hi> that Miniſter
being much aſtoniſh'd diſcours'd as if he was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to give that honour, as ſoon as the Galleys
were returned to <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> Monſieur <hi>Guillera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues,</hi>
who believ'd him, procured them liberty to
come; but the Promiſe, which was the Foundation
of all, remained unperform'd. See then how this
Miniſter deceived himſelf in letting eſcape a ſure
way of obtaining his deſires; and in believing the
Turks capable of fair dealing in a nice Rancoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>It is known how long the time was delay'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they came to an end of the buſineſs of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents,
that is to ſay, the Reparation for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95291:27"/>
upon <hi>Chio:</hi> But the more we perceive the
Turkiſh Miniſters to have a deſire to finiſh it, the
more, it is evident, he ſhould have refuſed to put
an end to that fine buſineſs, without having firſt
the <hi>Sofa:</hi> But Monſieur <hi>Guilleragues</hi> is content with
the words they gave him on this Subject, and <hi>poſt
pones</hi> the matter, till after delivery of the Preſents,
which was executed; he remaining ſtill without
the <hi>Sofa:</hi> There we ſee him cozen himſelf the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time.</p>
            <p>There has paſt a long time ſince the glorious
Victory on the 21ſt of <hi>May,</hi> the day on which they
Triumph over the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> in forcing him to
come himſelf to receive their Trifles, even to the
Sea ſide; and ſince the fifth of <hi>June,</hi> the happy day
on which Monſieur <hi>Gilleragues</hi>'s promiſe in writing
was reſtored; and the 29th of the ſame Month
when the Preſents were ſent by him to the <hi>Grand
Vizir;</hi> to the 19th of <hi>October,</hi> the day whereon
this Miniſter began his march for <hi>Adrianople.</hi> All
this time of five or ſix Months was vainly imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to ſoften this Miniſter in the point of the <hi>Sofa:</hi>
Monſieur <hi>Guilleragues</hi> the more preſt it, to the end
he might obtain it before the departure of the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zir:</hi>
And being neceſſitated to uſe all Peaceful
ways, having let ſlip thoſe of Force, which ſtruck
at the Intereſt and Glory of the Turks: He hath
not Heſitated to hazard a ſecond Letter of his
King's, which remains as well without Effect as
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95291:27"/>
Anſwer: He delivered the firſt himſelf, and had
a verbal Anſwer to this purpoſe, That he ought
to be contented with the great Honor the <hi>Sultan</hi>
had done him in receiving his Preſents, and not to
pretend to a thing ſo extraordinary as that of the
<hi>Sofa;</hi> and that it was not uſual with the Port to
grant ſo many advantages at one time. It is true,
he inſinuated that his Maſters Fleet would return
to fetch him back; But he that had ſent it away
before, and render'd it uſeleſs when there, where
it might have procured his pleaſure, had not his
Bravadoes much valued; but at the ſame time
there was a certain Rumor ſpread, as if he was to
repair the Subjects loſſes at <hi>Chio,</hi> pretending that
was diſtinct from the ſatisfaction made the <hi>Grand
Seignior.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this was not able to diſcourage him; he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
again to his incomparable friend the <hi>Dowanier,</hi>
who as readily undertakes to cheat him; ſo his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters
muſt make many uſeleſs Journeys to the
<hi>Vizir</hi>'s Camp, in the laſt of which they preſented
a Requeſt from the Ambaſſador, wherein he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates
to that Miniſter the neceſſity of his Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
for which purpoſe the King's Fleet would
come to the <hi>Dardanelloes</hi> to fetch him; he therefore
intreats Order might be given to the <hi>Kaimmakam</hi>
of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> not to hinder his departure, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon ſo indiſpenſible Neceſſity, it being not
juſt, that the Ambaſſador from the greateſt, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95291:28"/>
moſt powerful Monarch of Chriſtendom, and the
Antienteſt Friend of the Port, ſhould ſtay longer
without thoſe diſtinctions of Honour and Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
which were his due; that in all things beſides
the <hi>Vizir</hi> might uſe his pleaſure.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Grand Vizir</hi> took this as a concluſion for all
requeſts, and thereupon plainly declared his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
That he would neither grant the <hi>Sofa,</hi> nor
ſhould the Ambaſſador go till the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi>
pleaſed; and in caſe he continued obſtinate, they
ſhould take good order about him.</p>
            <p>The Interpreters hearing theſe angry Menaces,
found a way to ſoften them by the <hi>Kehaia,</hi> who,
as was pretended, had moderated the <hi>Vizir,</hi> ſo that
he declared himſelf willing to give him Audience
in his Pavillion upon equal place, to let it be ſeen,
That he underſtood well the Grandure and Power
of the Emperor of <hi>France,</hi> above other Chriſtian
Princes: But for granting Audience, on the <hi>Sofa,</hi>
it was not in his Power; The <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
order'd that Ambaſſadors ſhould receive it,
below, even all, not excepting that of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They pretend too, That the <hi>Grand Vizir</hi> after his
Avowing, this indeed wilful want of Power; ſhould
ſay he would try to alter his Highneſſe's Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as ſoon as he came to <hi>Adrianople;</hi> where he
was going to find that Emperor: And that in the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95291:28"/>
mean time he intreated Monſieur <hi>Guilleragues,</hi> that
as he had not come to the Port without leave of
his Highneſs, ſo he would not go without it:
finiſhing all this fine Diſcourſe with many offers of
Service to the Ambaſſador; as well relating to his
own particular, as to that of Trade.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Guilleragues,</hi> came not of his Embaſſy
by leave of the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> nor is the <hi>Vizir</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to intreat this Ambaſſador; ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
are not common with that haughty Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
no more than his offers of Service: And pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of Audience on equal Seats: Nor can we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riddle
the Myſtery of ſaying, The <hi>French</hi> Ships
ſhould come to the <hi>Dardanelloes;</hi> ſince why not to
<hi>Conſtantinople?</hi> But in fine we may conclude, That
if Monſieur <hi>Guilleragues</hi> expects the <hi>Vizir</hi> ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede
for the <hi>Sofa,</hi> he is cheated the third time.
For it is certain, the depriving him ſo long of it can
juſtly be imputed to none but himſelf, who in that
is Maſter. Therefore his beſt excuſe will be to ſay
that his Interpreters ſurpriz'd him: But all theſe
Cheats would appear but Trifles, ſo he be not
cheated too by the renewing the Truce with the
Emperor. And ſhould there be a War, it would
advantage him but little; and it is plain, nothing
would be of more uſe to him, then the playing
again, the Cannon of his King; It muſt not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
that the Ambaſſador would have it believ'd,
that he had ended the great Buſineſs at <hi>Chio,</hi> for
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95291:29"/>
Baubles, even juſt nothing: And that he had in a
manner forc't the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> to give Audience
to his Servants. This ridiculous Report, and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Vanity, is come to the Ears of the <hi>Grand Vizir,</hi>
to whom they Interpreted the <hi>Paris</hi> Gazets, that are
fill'd with the Glory of Monſieur <hi>Guilleragues;</hi> and
ſeem to inſinuate a low Condeſcenſion in the Port:
But ſince this Infidel Miniſter knows the folly of
theſe Brags; which he ſees deſtroy'd by the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
Printed in other Countries: They ſerve only,
for a Subject to augment his Pride; and gives him a
Pleaſure, the mor to Chagrine and Mortifie the
<hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador.</p>
