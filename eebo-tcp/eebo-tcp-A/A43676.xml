            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hoſoever thou art that loveſt either peace or happineſs, here or hereafter, To thee, in all love, I commend theſe enſuing lines, with an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire that thou mayſt profit by them.</p>
            <p>And to that end, let me intreat thee to read and conſider them impartially; trie and meaſure them by that true Touch-ſtone, and infallible Rule, which is the Word of God: ask him for wiſdom to diſcern between things which differ; and the Lord give thee underſtanding in all things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48878:3"/>The mark I chiefly aim at, is, to unfold the fraud and deceit of the man of ſin, and to lay open that myſtery of iniquity in which he worketh by his inſtruments, with all deceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of unrighteouſneſs, to deceive the hearts of the ſimple; and to ſhew what Rights and Titles he doth falſly claim in theſe evil days; and how groſly men miſtake, in giving him what is proper to God, both in Church and Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>I know thou canſt not be ignorant of the great Change that God hath wrought in this nation, in a few yeers; for which cauſe, many men do gnaw their tongues for anger, and are ready to blaſpheme the God of heaven, being not afraid to ſpeak evil of dignities and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which are ſet up and eſtabliſhed by God, (who <hi>pulleth down one, and ſetteth up another,</hi> whom he pleaſeth.) And for want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in theſe things, men <hi>periſh as in the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying of Korah,</hi> being found fighters againſt God, and are brought into the pit of deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unawares, to the ruine of body, ſoul, and goods. Which things having been by me conſidered in ſome meaſure, according to
<pb facs="tcp:48878:3"/>
the underſtanding the Lord hath given me, I finde my ſelf in conſcience bound, and by love and pity conſtrained, to ſpeak what I know and am ſure of, to others; having learnt it chiefly out of the Scriptures, and ſomewhat by conſidering the times, and the conditions of men in theſe days of danger and peril, in which ſo many <hi>make ſhipwrack of faith and a good conſcience:</hi> I therefore am bold to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent theſe lines to the view both of friends and enemies; by which I ſhall diſcharge my duty towards God and man in ſome good meaſure, and ſhall be at peace in my ſelf, when I know I have not hid my talent in a napkin, nor kept back any thing that might be profitable to my country-men &amp; acquaintance amongſt whom I live.</p>
            <p>But it may be ſome will ſay, that it is too weighty a piece of work for me to meddle with; I ſhould have left it to ſome wiſe and learned men, that are better able to diſtinguiſh between things which differ.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer: What I have done well, was not too hard for me to do. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it hinders none of the wiſe and prudent of
<pb facs="tcp:48878:4"/>
the nation that fear God, from doing more. Thirdly, theſe are the days in which God is pleaſed to chuſe and make uſe of fooliſh and weak inſtruments in the worlds account, to confound the wiſdom of the wiſe, and to bring down the ſtrength of the mighty, and to bring to nought the underſtanding of the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: and if God make choice, let Men take heed how they refuſe. Therefore, courteous Reader, let not the weakneſs of the inſtrument cauſe thee to ſlight any thing that may be profitable; but what is agreeable to truth and ſound Reaſon, receive in love; and what is contrary, reject.</p>
            <p>And thus with my unfeigned love to all that wiſh themſelves happineſs, I reſt, being ready to ſerve them in all things lawful and convenient to the utmoſt of my power,</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eeing it is the portion of the Saints, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, living in this generation (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in this our Nation of <hi>England</hi>) to partake of ſuch great mercies (from God our Father, and from our Lord and Saviour Ieſus Chriſt) as to live under ſuch Rulers; and that the Lord hath ſet over us ſuch in Authority, as are for the praiſe of them that do well, and for the puniſhment of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil doers; ſo <hi>that under them we may live a quiet life in all godlineſs and honeſty:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is therefore expedient, that we and all that truly fear God, ſhould labour to walk worthy of theſe mercies; and to ſh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w forth our thankfulneſs by our obedience, both tawards God, and thoſe men whom he hath ſet over us; that ſo the Lord may ſtill delight in us, and rejoyce over us to do us good,
<pb facs="tcp:48878:5"/>
and to bleſs us with all manner of bleſſings; both ſpiritual and temporal: that we being thus delivered from all our enemies, may ſerve him that hath wrought this great deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance for us, without fear, in holineſs and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs all our days: walking as his children, blameleſs and harmleſs, without rebuke, in the midſt of a crocked and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Nation, ſhining as lights in the world, holding forth the pure word of life.</p>
            <p>Therefore I exhort you, and every of you (profeſsing god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in ſincerity) in the Name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and by the mercies that we have received from him, and by him from God our Father, that we may with all diligence la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and exerciſe our ſelves(as our beloved brother <hi>Paul</hi> hath given us an example, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.15, 16.) to have always Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences void of offence, both towards God, and towards man. And for aſ much as we believe with him the reſurrection of the juſt and unjuſt, and the eternal judgement, that ſhall be at the appearing of our Lord and Saviour Ieſus chriſt: Seeing we look for ſuch things, let us conſider what manner of perſons we ought to be, in all holy converſation and godlineſs, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for, and making haſt unto the coming of the day of God: knowing, that we which patiently continue in well doing, ſhall then receive the reward of righteouſneſs, which is a Crown of righteouſneſs and glory; that in due time we ſhall reap if we faint not.</p>
            <p>Therefore, dear friends, let not us be ignorant of Gods great work, which he is now a working upon the face of the earth; but let us that be children of the day, be ſober and watch; knowing that theſe are the days of vengeance, in which all things muſt be fulfilled that are written in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: and the ſignes of the coming of the Lord are upon the face of the earth; even diſtreſs of Nations, and perplexity,
<pb facs="tcp:48878:6"/>
Kingdom againſt Kingdom, and City againſt City; and mens hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after thoſe things which are coming on the earth: but yet let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the promiſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.13. <hi>It ſhall come to paſs that whoſoever ſhall call upon the Name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved:</hi> and again; <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5, 6. he hath ſaid, <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee;</hi> ſo that we may boldly ſay, The Lord is our helper, and we will not fear what man can do unto us; therefore let us remember the words of our Lord Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.28. When theſe things begin to come to paſs, then look up and lift up your heads, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that your Redemption draweth nigh. Wherefore this is my humble advice to all that fear the Lord, that we labour now to approve our Conſciences before God, by being to him that Redeemed us, a peculiar people, zealous of good works; knowing that is the end of our Redemption and preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. Let us therefore conſider, that Chriſt is that great Prophet, by whom God hath ſpoken to us in theſe laſt days, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.12.</p>
            <p>And that we are commanded to hear him in all things whatſoever he ſhall ſay unto us, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.22, 23. And his ſheep are they that hear his voice, and follow him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.27. and the voice of a ſtranger will they not follow, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. and we are his friends if we do whatſoever he hath commanded us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.14. and he that hath his commandments and keepeth them, it is he that loveth him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.21. for this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments; and his commandments are not grievous, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.3.</p>
            <p>But he that ſaith he loveth Chriſt, or knoweth Chriſt, and keepeth not his commandments, is a lyer, and the truth is not in him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.4, 5. with <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.24. and whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tranſgreſſeth and abideth not in the Doctrine of Chriſt,
<pb facs="tcp:48878:7"/>
hath not God; 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. and if any ſhall come to you and preach any other doctrine then what is already preached, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him not, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. yea, if we, or an Angel from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhall preach any other Goſpel then that which we have preached to you, (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) let him be accurſed; as we ſaid before, ſo ſay I now again, let him be accurſed <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.9, 10. for how ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as was firſt preached by the Lord himſelf, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to us by them that heard him: God bearing them witneſs both with ſignes and wonders, and divers gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, according to his own will? <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3, 4.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, dear brethren and beloved in the Lord, let us contend earneſtly for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints, <hi>Jude verſ.</hi> 3, 4. even as it was delivered at the firſt by the Lord himſelf, and his holy Apoſtles: For there are certain men crept in unawares, which do turn this grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt into wantonneſs, and deny the Lord that bought them, in their actions, although they confeſs him in their words; and do alſo think to make us forget and deny him, by their dreams, which they tell every man to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as the Lord ſaith <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.27. Let us therefore, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we know theſe things before, beware lest we alſo being led away with the errour of the wicked, fall from our own ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs; but let us grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Ieſus Chriſt: let us abide in his love, by keeping his commandments, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.10. and continue his friends, by doing whatſoever he hath commanded us, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. ſo ſhall we have a good conſcience, void of offence towards God, through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and boldneſs and acceſs with confidence through faith in his blood, unto that throne of grace, where he ever liveth to make interceſsion for us.

               <pb facs="tcp:48878:7"/>Laſtly, we muſt exerciſe a good conſcience towards man, even by doing to all as we would they ſhould do to us: but in a ſpecial manner, we ough to have reſpect unto the Magiſtrates whom God hath ſet over us, to do to them even as we would they ſhould do to us; <hi>viz.</hi> If we would that they ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and preſerve us in well-doing, we ought alſo to aſsiſt and aid them, both with perſons and eſtates, without which they are not able to ſuppreſs wicked and ungodly men; they being, without us, but private or particular perſons: Therefore I deſire that all chriſtians may be put in minde to be ſubject to principalities and powers, and to obey magiſtrates; to be ready to every good work, and not to ſpeak evil of any man; to be no brawlers, but gentle, ſhewing all meekneſs to all men, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.1, 2. We know alſo, that there is no power but is of God; for the powers that be, are ordained of God: and therefore, he that reſiſteth them, reſiſteth the ordinance of God: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when Rulers are not a terrour to good works, but to the evil; therefore we muſt needs be ſubject to ſuch, not onely for wrath, but alſo for conſcience ſake: let us conſider them as the ſervants of God, ſet over us for our good, to take venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and execute wrath upon them that do evil. Let us ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to all their due; tribute to whom tribute is due; cuſtom to whom cuſtom, fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour belongeth: ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>But I know ſome will object, that we ought indeed to pay tribute and cuſtom to whom it is due, and to give honour to whom honour belongeth: but it belongs not to this preſent Power and Authority; for the Scripture ſaith, that we ſhould <hi>Fear God,</hi> and <hi>Honour the King,</hi> and that we ſhould be ſubject to every ordinance of man for the Lords ſake, and to the King as ſupreme: But theſe have rebelled, and ſlain their King; therefore neither honour, obedience, nor tribute belongs to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48878:8"/>To which at preſent I anſwer, That to the end this ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-block may be taken away, and a right underſtanding may come in the place, and a true affection to theſe preſent Rulers may be begotten in the hearts of thoſe people that ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and a general reconciliation might ſpeedily be brought forth amongſt all men; I have preſumed to preſent theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing lines to their view: knowing before that enemies will except againſt the moſt perfect Truth, and ſoundeſt Reaſon, (witneſs their excepting againſt the Word of God) but friends will bear with infirmities. Wherefore I deſire you that are friends, when you have read and conſidered what I have written, and tried it by the Word of God, if then you ſhall finde any thing too light or uſeleſs, that you will impute it to that imperfect part which in ſome meaſure doth dwell in all men; and remain fully aſſured, that what I want in words and expreſsions, is fully made up in my affection toward the State and Commonwealth in general.</p>
            <p>Thus, deſtring that what is according to Truth and ſound Reaſon may be profitable to all, I commit what is written to your ſerious conſideration, and impartial judgement; and you into the hands of the Lord; and remain, to the utmoſt of my power,</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd now, according to the method propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, I ſhall proceed to ſhew firſt, that it is God alone that ruleth; and men have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do to queſtion how: whether it be by Kings as ſupreme heads, as in and after the days of <hi>Saul, David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon;</hi> or by the Elders of the people to rule and judge them, as before there was any King but God himſelf in <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now let me not be miſtaken and abuſed, as if I went head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, without wiſdom or the fear of God, to rail againſt kingly power, or Kings; like thoſe that <hi>ſpake evil of things they know not:</hi> for I approve of Kings and Rule by Kings, as well as of ruling or judging the people by Elders; but it muſt always be conſidered, in all ages and generations of the world, what Rule and Rulers God doth approve of: for it is he that ſetteth up one, and pulleth down another; and he it is that ruleth in the kingdoms of men, and giveth them to whomſoever he will; yea, and ſetteth over them the baſeſt of men, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.17.25.</p>
            <p>And now let us conſider, if the God of heaven did in that age take away the Kingdom and Dominion of the whole earth from <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> that head of gold, and turn him out a graſing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48878:10"/>
among the Oxen, and give his kingdom to whomſoever he pleaſed; then let not men in this generation think it ſtrange, though God Almighty hath taken away the kingdoms of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> (which are but a ſmall part of the earth) from <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> and given them to the honorable Parliament, which were indeed at firſt confirmed by him, before his evil Counſel had drawn him away from them; therefore none can ſay they gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together without him, to conſpire againſt him; for they gathered together to him, and were confirmed by him, and with him, and he with them; and ſo were a lawful Aſſembly of Magiſtrates according to the Law of God and a lawful Parliament according to the Law of Nations; and from this lawful Aſſembly, and powers ordained of God, he withdrew, and by evil Councel rent himſelf from them, and would come no more at them, notwithſtanding all the invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they gave him in all humility, as will yet appear by their Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and Remonſtrances: all which plainly ſheweth the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate hand of God againſt him and againſt his family; his ſins and the ſins of his forefathers being now at the full.</p>
            <p>And further, let it be conſidered, that God will have the living men to know that <hi>the moſt High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomſoever he will;</hi> yea, and ſettetth over it the baſeſt of men, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.17 Now if the Lord will take a Kingdom from a King, and give it to the baſeſt of men; how can the moſt honourable of men help it?</p>
            <p>They may gnaw their tongues for anger, and blaſpheme the God of Heaven; yea, they may be found fighters againſt God, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have been; but they ſhall not proſper: as we ſee they have not in our days (conſider it:) for it was not becauſe they wanted the noble blood; for they had the King himſelf, and the greateſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in the Land with them: neither was it becauſe they wanted ſtout men of reſolved ſpirits; for they had of the prime of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they themſelves have oftentimes boaſted; and for the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men they far exceeded, and the affections of the Country were generally towards them; therefore it was the immediate hand of God againſt them, who in his time pulleth down one, and ſetteth up another, whom he pleaſeth; who at this time hath pulled down the King and Lords of this Nation, and hath and will make the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48878:10"/>
thereof Rulers and Judges in their places; and who can ſay to him, What doeſt thou?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be wiſe now therefore, O ye kings, and be inſtructed, ye that are judge's of the earth,</hi> Pſal. 2.10. <hi>Be ſtill and know that</hi> he <hi>is God:</hi> learn to know that <hi>The Lord of hoſts is with us, and the the God of Jacob is our refuge,</hi> Pſal. 46.10, 11.</p>
            <p>Again, that God alone is King, and ruleth the Nations how he pleaſeth, or by whom he pleaſeth; is evident, by conſidering that in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.12. where the Lord by <hi>Samuel</hi> reproveth the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for chuſing another King beſides himſelf, in theſe words:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And you ſaid, Nay, but a king ſhall reign over us, when the Lord your God was your king.</hi> And again he ſaith, When they ſaid, Give us a King, they rejected the Lord that he ſhould not reign over them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.7.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Lord lamenteth over them, ſaying, <hi>O Iſrael, thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf, but in me is thine help. I will be thy king for there is none other that may ſave thee in all thy Cities,</hi> Hol. 13.9, 10.</p>
            <p>Again, the people of the Nation of <hi>England,</hi> need not ſo much to wonder and be diſturbed at what the Lord hath done: for it was always Gods way and work, if any King diſpleaſed him, he would pull him down, and ſet up another, whom he pleaſed; yea, even the baſeſt of men: therefore ſaith <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.21. <hi>He changeth the times and ſeaſons, he removeth kings:</hi> Witneſs alſo his dealing with the Kings of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, his rejecting of <hi>Saul</hi> from being King, and rending the kingdom from him, and giving of it to his neighbour, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.23, 28.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Lord rent the kingdom again from <hi>David's</hi> houſe for <hi>Solomons</hi> Idolatry, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11.11. and gave it to <hi>Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> his ſervant; which came to paſs, <hi>ver.</hi> 30, 31.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Lord took away the kingdom from his houſe, in the days of his ſon <hi>Nadab;</hi> and gave it <hi>Baaſha</hi> the ſon of <hi>Ahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah,</hi> 1 King. 15.25, 26, 27, 28.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He took it away from him, and gave it to <hi>Zimri</hi> his ſervant: See 1 <hi>King.</hi> 16.2, 3, 15. And for his wickedneſs he gave it to <hi>Omri,</hi> ch. 16.22, 23.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:48878:11"/>Again, The Lord took away the kingdom from the houſe of <hi>Omri:</hi> in <hi>Ahabs</hi> days it was propheſied and accompliſhed in the days of <hi>Joram.</hi> See <hi>King.</hi> 9.6, 7, 8, 9. to the end,</p>
            <p>Thus it is cleerly proved that God alone ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomſoever he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>But it will be Objected. That God did this to them for their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs; but who can ſay King <hi>Charles</hi> was ſo wicked?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> As for his wickedneſs, it's poſſible to make it appear he had ſome, but I ſhall leave that to God to judge of: onely this I dare aſſirm that ſome of the fore-named Kings were as good and as holy men as King <hi>Charles</hi> and did as many good things for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory of God in their generation as ever he did; and had as much of the knowledge of God in them, and more then ever he had; as it appeareth by <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 10.9, 10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon.</hi> Therefore, for ſhame, let not that be plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for if <hi>Saul,</hi> onely for ſparing the ſheep and oxen with a good intent to offer ſacrifice to God with them, and for ſhewing mercy to <hi>Agag</hi> King of the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> muſt have his Kingdom rent from him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.19, 20 21, 22. becauſe he had left undone the commandment of God; ſurely then it may be proved, by the things already declared againſt <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> in print, to the view of all men to which I refer you, that he was ſo great a ſinner, that the great God that ſearcheth the hearts, and is a true, beholder of the inward parts of man hath ſeen ſo much evil in him, as might in juſtice move him to take away his Kingdom and Dominion from him, and lay his honour in the duſt; and will without queſtion, at the great day, make it appear to the faces of all them that do oppoſe him; to whom I leave it with what is written, and proceed to the ſecond, which is to conſider <hi>what it is to rule with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We read, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.12. the words of the Lord by the Prophet are theſe: <hi>Ephraim compaſſeth me about with lyes, and the houſe of Iſrael with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the Saints.</hi> From whence I thus reaſon: That that power, which is faithful with the Saints, or to the Saints, to protect them in well-doing that Power doth rule with God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, thoſe people that do the good and acceptable will of God, by keeping the holy and righteous commands of God given
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48878:11"/>
by Jeſus Chriſt in theſe laſt days, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1, 2. with <hi>Act.</hi> 3.22, 23. they are the righteous and holy people, and the Saints of God; and that Power and Authority that protects and preſerves ſuch a people in ſo doing, doth protect and preſerve the Saints. But the preſent power and Authority of this Nation of <hi>England</hi> do protect ſuch a people in ſo well doing: Therefore they rule with God, and are faithful to the Saints; and do hereby honour God, by having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his children, and them that fear him: And <hi>they which ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour me, I will honour,</hi> ſaith the Lord; but <hi>they which deſpiſe me, ſhall be lightly eſteemed,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.50. And ſuch a Power we muſt needs be ſubject to, not onely for fear of wrath, but alſo for conſcience ſake: for they are not a terrour to good works, but to the evil. Again, thoſe Rulers that are a terrour to good works, do not rule with God: for Rulers And Powers ordained of God, are not a terrour to good works but to evil. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. Therefore, ſaith the Lord, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 29.2.) <hi>When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoyce: but when the wicked bear rule, the people mourn.</hi> And the truth is, were it not to ſuppreſs the wicked that would deſtroy the Saints, as <hi>Cain</hi> ſlew his brother <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> there ſhould need no Power nor Law amongſt men, but the law of Love: for <hi>the law was not made for the righteous man, but for the lawleſs and diſobedient,</hi> &amp;c. And the powers that are ordained of God, were not ordained to be revengers of wrath upon good men that keep the Commandments of God, but upon evil men that break them.</p>
            <p>And thus it is plain, that thoſe Magiſtrates and Rulers which are faithful with the Saints, to preſerve and keep them in well-doing, That Power is of God and ruleth with God; and it ſhall ſtand againſt all oppoſers. And we may ſafely conclude, That that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which is uſed to vex perſecute and deſtroy the Saints and honeſt men ſearing God, is not of God; and therefore it ſhall not ſtand. But the Power in King <hi>Charles</hi> his days was ſo uſed, as many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt conſcientious men can teſtifie by woful experience: therefore it was not of God, and is thrown down.</p>
            <p>But it will be objected, that now ſince the King is gone, there is as great perſecution, taxing, and oppreſſing of men, as ever.</p>
            <p>To which I abſwer, I poſitively deny that honeſt conſcientious
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48878:12"/>
men that fear God, and deſire to live in peace, are perſecuted as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: But indeed, if any conſpire and rebel againſt this preſent power of the Nation of <hi>England,</hi> ſo wonderfully ſet up and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by God himſelf; it is their policie and good wiſdom to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſuch malignant ſpirits, by confining their perſons to ſuch places as they may do leaſt hurt in and by ſequeſtring their eſtates, to make uſe of them for the beſt advantage of the Commonwealth. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to that end they are a power ordained of God, even to take vengeance and execute wrath upon them that do evil. Therefore if any man would not fear the preſent Power, let him do that which is good, and he ſhall have praiſe of the ſame. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whereas many complain of Taxes, and oppreſſion by Taxes more then ever;</p>
            <p>I anſwer, There was never ſuch occaſion for Taxes as is now, in any mans days now alive: and we all know, That Neceſſity hath no law. Therefore if the Magiſtrate do require more then ordinary of us, to ſupply our preſent wants, and to deliver us out of ſuch great dangers and troubles as otherwiſe would come upon us, even to the deſtroying both of perſons and eſtates of all that fear God, we muſt not call this Oppreſſion, nor murmur againſt the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate: for in ſo doing we ſhall murmur againſt God; for it is he that ſendeth theſe wars and troubles upon us for our ſins; who then can give us peace? It's not in the Magiſtrates power, until the Lord pleaſe. As for example: if the Lord pleaſe to ſend a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of bread in the Land, and make us buy our food at an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary rate, ſhall we therefore murmur at the Magiſtrate? or will that do us any good, until the Lord be pleaſed to ſend plenty?</p>
            <p>So now alſo, if the Lord be pleaſed to make us buy our peace at a dearer rate then ordinary, let us not murmur againſt the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates; but rather let us conſider our ways, and labour to finde out the cauſe why the Lord doth thus chaſtiſe us, and to remove it, that ſo theſe evil effects may ceaſe.</p>
            <p>And truely, if we conſider well what the Lord hath done for us, in giving food and raiment in ſuch a plentiful manner, and that <hi>England</hi> is yet a Nation inhabited by its own children, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thoſe fierce and bitter wars that have been even in the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48878:12"/>
bowels of it, we ſhall have more cauſe to praiſe the Lord for his mercies then to murmur at his chaſtiſements: for <hi>he hath not dealt ſo with every nation.</hi> How often hath he chaſtiſed his people <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> with ſorer chaſtiſements then we have yet felt, praiſed be his Name! as we may read in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.25. when an aſſes head was ſold for fourſcore pieces of ſilver, and the fourth part of a kab of doves dung for five pieces; and when women boiled their children and eat them, becauſe of the ſiege, and ſtraitneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. I ſuppoſe <hi>England</hi> hath not yet taſted ſo deep of this bitter cup: Chap. 10.</p>
            <p>But there is a generation of <hi>murmurers and complainers,</hi> as <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith, <hi>that are not afraid to ſpeak evil of dignities,</hi> which remain ſtill in the body of the Nation, and diſturb the peace there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and will do, until they be purged out: the Lord is a doing of it; for the <hi>head</hi> and the <hi>tail</hi> muſt go together, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 9.14. He hath already cut off the <hi>head,</hi> which is the <hi>ancient and honorable;</hi> the <hi>tail</hi> muſt follow, which is <hi>the prophet that teacheth lyes,</hi> and doth daub the Princes of the Nations with <hi>untempered mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; ſeeing vanity, and divining lyes, ſaying, Thus ſaith the Lord, when the Lord hath not ſpoken.</hi> See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.14, 15. with <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.27, 28, 29.</p>
            <p>You may know them by their fruits: Theſe are they which teach the people to murmur againſt the preſent Powers, and to complain of the great Taxes and heavie burthens that are now in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; when indeed they were the men that firſt cauſed them, by ſtirring up the people, crying out, <hi>Curſe ye Meroz, curſe bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly the inhabitants thereof, becauſe they came not out to help the Lord againſt the mighty:</hi> and, <hi>Curſed be he that keepeth back his hand from ſhedding of blood.</hi> And are ſtill the onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuers of theſe bitter wars, (which cauſe the Taxes to continue) by ſtirring up ſedition, and cauſing diviſion amongſt the people. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, if they would as much labour to make peace, there would the ſooner be an end of theſe troubles, and a removing of the heavie burthens and Taxes neceſſitated thereby.</p>
            <p>But theſe men it is to be feared, have a further deſigne in hand then all men know: for, if it be obſerved they could in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the wars liſt up their voices like a trumpet, curſing. <hi>Meroz.</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:48878:13"/>
bitterly; uſing the aforeſaid words, to ſtir up men to go and fight againſt the King. And in thoſe days, they could pray heartily, even with tears, for the proſperity of the Parliaments Army; and as heartily give thanks for the overthrow and deſtruction of the Kings party; and teach others ſo to do: (let them deny it if they can.) And this zeal continued, ſo long as they thought, that, if their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers the Biſhops, and the reſt of that brood, had periſhed with him that then they ſhould have been heirs of their inheritance, <hi>viz.</hi> of all their Lands and Revenues, and ſo of all their honour, pride, and vain-glory; and to have had the Scepter committed to them. to rule and tyrannize over the conſciences of men fearing God While this hope remained, their zeal burnt hot as fire, and all was well, and the Parliament was a power ordained of God: But when the honourable and prudent Rulers of this Nation denied them theſe things, and eſpecially that they might not tyrannize over the conſcience, to make all men be of their Religion, to ſee with their eyes and go on their legs, and believe as they believe, even as they do at <hi>Rome:</hi> when this is denied, then they are the men that firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of perſecution, becauſe they themſelves may not be the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors: and now they cannot in conſcience give thanks for ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of blood; but when the State deſired thoſe that feared God to give him thanks for that great deliverance and victory over the Scots at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> there was ſcarcely one in five miles compaſs to be found: and ſome of thoſe that did meet, by relation of ſome that are honeſt which were among them, they told the people that they had more need to keep it as a day of Weeping, Mourning and Humiliation, then a day of Thankſgiving; with many other ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous words, tending to the diſaffecting and diſengaging of the hearts of the people from the State. Therefore let it be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, who are they that <hi>deſpiſe dominion, and are not afraid to ſpoak evil of dignitses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are they which in all ages had the praiſe of men generally: therefore ſaith Chriſt <hi>Luke</hi> 6.26. <hi>Wo be to you when all men ſpeak well of you: for ſo did their fathers of the falſe prophets,</hi> Theſe were they in <hi>Ahab</hi>'s days which deluded him and all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> teaching them to forſake the Commandments of the Lord, and to follow <hi>Baalim;</hi> when <hi>Elijah,</hi> that one Prophet of the Lord, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48878:13"/>
the folly and deceit of four hundred and fifty of them at once, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.</p>
            <p>Theſe are they which again in King <hi>Ahab</hi>'s time deluded him, and cauſed him to go up to <hi>Ramoth-gilead</hi> to fight, when that one Prophet of the Lord, <hi>Micaiah,</hi> withſtood four hundred of them to their faces, and warned <hi>Ahab</hi> not to go up; yet he believing the four hundred falſe Prophets, rather then that one Prophet of the Lord, went up, and was ſlain. Thus we ſee, that through their lyes and deluſions, they bring even Kings and Princes to deſtruction both of body and ſoul.</p>
            <p>Theſe are they which in our age, and in this Nation of <hi>England,</hi> have done the ſame to <hi>Charles</hi> deceaſed, which their fore-fathers did to King <hi>Ahab</hi> in ſtirring of him up to war againſt his ſubjects, eſpecially againſt thoſe that moſt feared God; and ſo have brought him to deſtruction. And theſe are ſtill at this preſent time deluding his ignorant ſon, calling of him <hi>Charles the ſecond; having his perſon in admiration, becauſe of advantage,</hi> as <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith, v. 16. and by this means they ſtir up him, and his poor deceived ſuppoſed ſubjects to war againſt the Powers of this Nation of <hi>England,</hi> ſo wonderfully ſet up and eſtabliſhed by God himſelf, and powerfully preſerved and defended by his immediate hand, againſt all enemies whatſoever; which all that have but eyes open may eaſily ſee: and yet theſe Seers are ſo blinde, that they cannot ſee the hand of the Lord lifted up againſt them, and that Kingly power, as they call it, which hath always joyned with them (being deceived by them) to perſecute the Saints and children of God; of whom God is now taking vengeance: yet they are ſtill leading their King whom they have choſen and his ſubjects whom they have deceived, into the pit of deſtruction without remedy, they themſelves being certain to fall with them: for, <hi>if the blinde lead the blinde, they ſhall both fall into the ditch,</hi> Matth. 15.14.</p>
            <p>Therefore let the honourable Parliament of <hi>England</hi> beware of them; let the noble and valiant Army take heed of them, and watch them, as the worſt enemies they have: For, what Satan and his inſtruments cannot do by tyranny and ſtrength, that they will accompliſh by treachery and deceit, if poſſible. Therefore let the Commonwealth of <hi>England</hi> in general, with all the noble Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours

and Officers, and honeſt plain-hearted Country-men, learn to watch them with a ſingle eye, leſt they ſeduce you, and cauſe you to divide, and ſo bring you to deſtruction before you are aware.</p>
            <p>Therefore; dear Country-men, take heed of being deluded by them again to war and bloodſhed, leſt you provoke the Lord to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and ſo the whole Nation be drowned in blood without reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: for then, they that now complain of ſome Taxes neceſſitated by theſe preſent troubles, ſtirred up firſt by them, will have cauſe to complain for want of bread to eat, and cloathes to put on. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>having food and raiment, let us be therewith content,</hi> and ſerve the Lord our God with gladneſs and joyfulneſs of heart, for the abundance of all things, leſt he give us up to ſerve our enemies which he ſhall ſend againſt us, in hunger, and in thirſt, and in naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in want of all things; and he put a yoke of iron upon our necks, until he have deſtroyed us. See <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.47 48.</p>
            <p>Thus have I, in ſome meaſure, diſcovered who are the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental cauſes of our unhappineſs. I ſhall proceed to the third par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, <hi>viz. Whence the original of Monarchy did ſpring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the clearing of that, I ſhall not make uſe of the worſt of people, <hi>viz.</hi> the Nations of the world; for they were enemies to God, and given up to work all manner of wickedneſs with greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, although they had Kings, as appeareth by their adulteries, abuſing themſelves with mankinde, and with beaſts, and cauſing of their children to paſs thorow the fire to <hi>Molech,</hi> allowed of by their Kings, like the wicked Rulers of <hi>Sodom, Levit.</hi> 18.19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. and God <hi>in times paſt ſuffered all nations to walk in their own ways,</hi> Act. 14, 16. therefore they are no exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for us to walk by: But we ſhall look into the ways of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> God's <hi>peculiar people:</hi> for I know that the people of <hi>England</hi> in general would gladly be counted the people of God, and would be offended if we ſhould deny them the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
            <p>We ſhall therefore conſider how there came to be a King in <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> at firſt, over the people of God; Whether it was by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God, and ſo according to his pure minde; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it did not ſpring from a corrupt principle in the people, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48878:14"/>
was the pride and wickedneſs of their hearts, and not the leaſt, but the greateſt of all the ſins they committed, to chuſe any other King to rule over them but God onely. For the clearing of which, I ſhall examine theſe following Scriptures.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. we read that <hi>all the elders of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael gathared themſelves together, and came to Samuel, and ſaid, Behold, thou art old, and thy ſons walk not in thy ways; now make us a king to judge us, like all the nations.</hi> Here we ſee the pride and wickedneſs of their hearts, in that they would have a King to judge them, like all other nations, whom God had given up to walk in their own ways, and according to the luſt of their own hearts. Therefore obſerve what followed: firſt, it diſpleaſed <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> the Prophet of the Lord: ſecondly, he prayed to the Lord, and ſought him about it: thirdly, the Lord anſwered, ſaying, <hi>Hearken to the voice of the people in all that they have ſaid unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected me, that I ſhould not raign over them: according to all the works which they have done ſince they came out of Egypt, even to this day, wherewith they have forſaken me, and ſerved other gods, ſo do they alſo unto thee. Now therefore hearken to their voice: howbeit, yet proteſt ſolemnly unto them, and ſhew them the manner of the king that ſhall reign over them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we ſee, that though they pretended good in it, namely, that it was becauſe <hi>Samuel</hi>'s ſons were wicked; yet the Lord was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with them, and ſaid that they rejected him in ſo doing: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he gave them their deſire, which was a King, but it was in his anger; and he took him away again in his wrath. See <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.11.</p>
            <p>Again, when <hi>Samuel</hi> had declared the manner of their King, and told them that they ſhould cry out in that day becauſe of their King which they had choſen, but the Lord would not hear them; yet ſtill they refuſed to obey the voice of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Nay. but we will have a king over us, to judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battels; that we may be like all the nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Samuel</hi> rehearſed all theſe words again in the cars of the Lord, by which he was provoked, and ſaid in his anger, Give them a King. And here's the beginning of Kings amongſt the people of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:48878:15"/>And thus have I ſhewed plainly, that it was not at all of God; but contrary to his holy will, that any ſhould have the name of a King over his people but himſelf; and it did ariſe from the pride and corruption of the people, as further appeareth in theſe words: <hi>And Samuel called the children of Iſrael together unto the Lord to Miz<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eh, and ſaid, Thus ſaith the Lord God of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, I brought up Iſrael out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hands of the Egyptians, and out of the hands of all king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and of them that oppreſſed you; and you have rejected your God, who himſelf ſaved you out of all your adverſities and tribulations; and you have ſaid to him, Nay, but give us a king:</hi> Chap. 10.17, 18, 19.</p>
            <p>Surely I might now take up the complaint of <hi>Moſes</hi> againſt them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.6. <hi>O fooliſh people and unwiſe! do ye thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite the Lord? Is he not thy Father that bought thee? hath he not made thee, and eſtabliſhed thee? Remember the days of old, conſider the yeers of many generations: ask thy father, and he will ſhew thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I deſire to apply it to <hi>England.</hi> Dear Country-men, conſider it in time, before you provoke the Lord to anger. Hath not God himſelf now of late years done as great things for us? Hath not he by his immediate hand delivered us out of all our troubles, and out of the hands of all that hate us, ſo as they do not rule over us? Conſider the condition the Nation hath been in within theſe few yeers, and how the Lord hath remembred us in our low condition, and changed it; and, beyond all expectation hath given us Peace and Plenty, in ſtead of War and Famine in our Land. Conſider how he hath proſpered all things under the hands of this preſent Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, both at home and abroad; and all that riſe up againſt them are confounded and brought to nothing, and that by weak means; which ſhews the immediate hand of God amongſt us. Let us therefore take heed that we do not requite the Lord evil for good, like a fooliſh and unwiſe people, by deſiring a King, to ſatisfie our own luſt pride, and vain-glory: for the Lord is now our King; and will be, if we do not reject him, and caſt him off, by chuſing a Man in his ſtead to reign over us, judge us, and fight our battels.</p>
            <p>And to that end, let us again conſider what a great wickedneſs it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48878:15"/>
was in the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and how mightily the Lord was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with them for asking a King. See 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.16, 17, 18, 19. in theſe words: <hi>Now therefore ſtand ſtill and ſee this great thing which the Lord will do before your eyes. Is it not wheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harveſt to day? I will call unto the Lord,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Samuel</hi>) <hi>and he ſhall ſend thunder and rain; that you may perceive and ſee that your wickedneſs is great which you have done in the ſight of God, in asking a king. So Samuel called unto the Lord, and the Lord ſent thunder and rain: and the people greatly feared the Lord, and Samuel. And all the people ſaid to Samuel, Pray for thy ſervants unto the Lord thy God, that we die not: for we have added to all our ſins this evil, to ask us a king.</hi> And his anſwer was, (verſ. 23, 24, 25.) <hi>God forbid that I ſhould ſin againſt the Lord in ceaſing to pray for you. But I will teach you the good and right way,</hi> (which is) <hi>onely to fear the Lord, and ſerve him in truth, with all your hearts, and conſider what great things he hath done for you. But if ye ſhall ſtill do wickedly, ye ſhall be conſumed, both ye and your king.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus we have conſidered, from the beginning to the end, what great ſin and abominable wickedneſs it was, for the people of God to chuſe any other King but himſelf, to rule over them, judge them, and fight their battels.</p>
            <p>And it is conſidered to that end, that we the people of <hi>England,</hi> profeſſing our ſelves to be the people of God in our generation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom alſo the immediate hand of God hath been lifted up, and his arm made bare for us: I ſay, that we run not headlong into ſuch ſin and wickedneſs as to ask us a king, when the Lord hath taken away our King in his anger, and is become our King himſelf. Let us remember from what principle it did ariſe, and from what root it did ſpring, that a Man ſhould be choſen King, and bear the name of King over the people of God: it was from the pride and corruption of their own hearts: and of all their wickedneſs and ſins that they had committed, there was none like this, that they ſhould ask another King, and reject God; as is formerly proved by theſe Scriptures; 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 19, 20. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.17, 18, 19. <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:48878:16"/>Therefore he gave them a King in his anger, and took him away again in his wrath, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.11. And ſeeing they would have a King, the Lord would have him of his own chuſing; and therefore he choſe <hi>David</hi> his ſervant, a man after his own heart, and took him from the ſheep-folds, from following the ewes great with young, he brought him forth to feed <hi>Jacob</hi> his people, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.70, 71.</p>
            <p>But I am afraid that if the Lord ſhould now take a young ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd from following the ewes great with young, and ſet him over us to be our King, even thoſe that ſo much deſire a King, would be as much diſpleaſed then, as they are now. What ſhall the Lord do to pleaſe theſe people? He muſt not reign over them himſelf, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he have all power in heaven and earth in his hands, and their own lives alſo; but they reject him, ſaying, Nay but give us a king: and he muſt not chuſe a man after his own heart for them, but he muſt be a man after their own corrupted hearts: And who is that? Truely one of the Blood Royal, one that is by deſcent come out of the loyns of the Lords Anointed, as they apprehend. Therefore ſeeing it is ſuch a hard thing to pleaſe theſe people, that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf cannot pleaſe them, (except he ſhould let them walk in their own ways, and give them up to their own hearts, luſts, as he did the Nations in times paſt which he deſtroyed) Why then ſhould I, or any man under heaven, think to pleaſe them by ſpeaking the truth? Yet notwithſtanding I will perform my duty at this time, to my country-men and acquaintance according to the fleſh; and would gladly make uſe of the talent or mite which God hath given me, for their profit, and his glory.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſhall ſpeak a few words to theſe two things ſo ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at amongſt men, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Royal Blood,</hi> and the <hi>Lords An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed.</hi> It may be, if theſe ſtumbling-blocks were taken away, men would walk more uprightly, and in leſs danger. And firſt, I ſhall ſpeak of the Royal Blood.</p>
            <p>I would gladly learn of any man, from whence the Royal Blood came firſt. Not that I deny that there is Royal blood, or perſons noble and honourable, and to be honoured more then others: but my queſtion is, How they came ſo; whether by Generation, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation. If by generation, and ſo muſt continue, then I ſhall eaſily
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48878:16"/>
prove that, all the men in the world are of the Royal blood, and ſo have all right to be Kings and Princes, one as well as another, if that give them right. And if it do not, why do men plead it? But it is evident that the Noble blood comes not by Generation: for <hi>God hath made of one blood all nations of men to dwell upon the face of the earth,</hi> Acts 17.26. Now if they were all made of one blood that was either Noble blood, or Ignoble. If it were noble, then all men were noble: for he made them all of one blood; and ſo they continue, and will continue, until the end of ages.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is by Exaltation, namely, when God exalteth men (as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113.7, 8.) <hi>out of the duſt,</hi> and lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them <hi>out of the dunghill, to ſet them with princes, even with the princes of his people;</hi> then they are honorable, and not before.</p>
            <p>Again, if the ſame God will caſt down the ſame perſons for their wickedneſs, whom before he exalted, and pour contempt and ſhame upon them and their poſterity, and bring them again to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour; Who can give them honour? It is not in the power of all the men of the earth to do it, if they ſhould ſtand up for one man: for it is God that <hi>poureth contempt upon princes,</hi> and cauſeth them to <hi>wander in the wilderneſs; where there is no way,</hi> Pſal. 107.40. and it is God that <hi>changeth times and ſeaſons,</hi> and <hi>removeth kings, and ſetteth up kings,</hi> Dan. 2.21. And it is God that turned out the greateſt King that ever reigned upon the face of the earth, to graſing among the beaſts; and made him, even that head of gold, more contemptible then the bafeſt of men, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.38. with Chap. 4.25. And it is the ſame God that <hi>exalteth the needy out of the duſt, and taketh the poor out of the dunghill; that he may ſet him with princes, even with the princes of his people;</hi> and then they are of the Royal blood: if men will plead for it, let them. But yet I humbly conceive, that it is the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of all the honorable of the earth, to conſider from whence they were taken; (and though they be called <hi>Gods,</hi> Pſal. 82.6, 7. yet <hi>they muſt die like men,</hi> and return to the duſt; and after that cometh Judgement:) that ſo, when they ſhall come to give up their account to God at the Great Day, they may be able to do it with joy: for then cometh that everlaſting
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48878:17"/>
honour and glory which ſhall not be taken away from them that ſhall once be counted worthy to be made partakers thereof. And thus much concerning the Blood Royal, who are of it, and how they came ſo.</p>
            <p>And now I ſhall come to ſpeak of the <hi>Lords Anointed;</hi> whoſe name we ought not to take into our mouthes, but with reverence and godly fear.</p>
            <p>But I know that Ignorance hath been the mother of Devotion in this thing alſo; and men have put Light for Darkneſs, and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for Light, and called Evil Good, and Good Evil; ſpeaking evil of things they know not; calling the Lord Biſhops Anointed, the Anointed of tne Lord; and have thrown down Chriſt the true Anointed, and, as much as in them lay, have laboured to lay his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the duſt; reviling and perſecuting him, in his poor Saints, whereſoever they found him, even to the death; not remembring the words of our glorious Lord Jeſus, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.40. conſidered with 45. by which words we underſtand, that what is done to his Saints, is done to himſelf, be it good or evil; according to his words to <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 9.4. <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> which was his Saints, &amp; holy people which contended earneſtly for that faith once delivered by himſelf. And thus have the kings of the earth ſtood up, and the Rulers have taken counſel together, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord, and againſt his Anointed, as it is written, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.26. Therefore now the Lord that ſitteth in heaven, is laughing of them to ſcorn, and hath them in deriſion, and is vexing of them in his fore diſpleaſure, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. ſtaining the pride of all their glory, and is bringing into contempt all the honourable of the earth: and thus the poureth contempt upon Princes, by caſting down and deſtroying of them, even by men that have been and are baſe and contemptible in their eyes. And thus the Lord is vexing of them, and will vex them in his ſore diſpleaſure, until he have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed them from off the earth: becauſe they have vexed, perſecuted, and ſhed the blood of his Saints, therefore he will give them blood to drink: for they are worthy. And thus will God the Lord let his King upon his holy hill of <hi>Ston,</hi> and learn all men to know who is the Lords Anointed.</p>
            <p>For the clearing of which, I would gladly be anſwered this
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48878:17"/>
Queſtion, if any will or can: (namely) How King <hi>Charles,</hi> or any of the Kings of the Nations, became the Lords Anointed? or when, or what day was it? What was done to them, by which they were made the Lords Anointed? But this I confeſs that when the Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> anointed <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt (deceaſed) to be King of <hi>England,</hi> that then he became the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s Anointed; but no other Lords Anointed that I know of: and therefore we may obſerve, that when that Lord that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed him loſt his head, he that was anointed by him could not keep his long: And ſo their old Proverb was verified, <hi>No Biſhop, no King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I much wonder what Lord's anointed <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond is, ſeeing there was no Lord Biſhop in <hi>Scotland</hi> to anoint him. Surely, the higheſt Title he can claim; is but Sir <hi>John Presbyter</hi>'s Anointed.</p>
            <p>But, for the further clearing of this thing, I deny that any King, whatſoever he were, ſince the Lords Anointed (Chriſt) came in the fleſh, was ever called the Lords Anointed. See <hi>Acts</hi> 10.36, 37, 38. with Chap. 4.25, 26, 27. And let any of the moſt wiſe and zealous people in the Land for that thing, prove it if they can: and if they cannot, let them confeſs that they have been zealous, but not according to knowledge.</p>
            <p>Another Queſtion is, Where ever any were called the Lords An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed before Chriſt came in the fleſh, but onely thoſe that had the rule and dominion over the Jews, which were the people of God, and <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed according to the fleſh, of whom (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) Chriſt, or the Lords Anointed, came. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4.5. And therefore they were called ſo in the type, as they were figures of (Chriſt) the true Anointed, that was to come, and be born of the Jews, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.2.</p>
            <p>If any ſhall object, and ſay, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> was called the Lords An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.1. I anſwer, That is the ſame which I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: for he was at that time King, and had rule and dominion over the people of God, <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed: and the Lord telleth us (in verſ. 4.) wherefore he calleth him ſo, in theſe words: <hi>For Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob my ſervants ſake, and Iſrael mine elect, I have even called thee by name, and ſurnamed thee, though thou haſt not known

me.</hi> And thus the Lord himſelf hath fully anſwered that Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and it's clearly proved, that none before the coming of Chriſt did ever bear the name of the Lords Anointed, ſo much, as in the type, but onely thoſe that were Kings; and had rule over Gods own peculiar people, <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed: which teacheth us thus much, That none are now the Lords Anointed, but he (onely he) that is Lord and King over the houſe of <hi>Iſrael, Abrahams</hi> ſeed; which in (Chriſt) the Lord, that was <hi>borne King of the Jews,</hi> Mat. 22. whom God hath Anointed himſelf; not with oyle-olive ſweetly perfumed, but with <hi>the oyle of gladneſs above his fellows,</hi> Heb. 1.9. even with the Holy Spirit of wiſdome and underſtanding, and of Counſel and might, and of knowledge and the fear of the Lord. See <hi>Act.</hi> 10.30. with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.2, 5. he is the Lords Anointed; to whom God hath given a <hi>name above every name,</hi> and <hi>him hath God highly exalted, and ſet him at the right hand of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty on high, far above all Principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not onely in this world, but alſo in that which is to come,</hi> Pſa. 2.9, 10 11. with <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.20, 21, 22. And to him hath God committed all power in Heaven and in Earth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.10. to give commandments, to the ſons of men for whom he hath, dyed, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.22, 23; 24. and alſo to reward them that obſerve and do them with the things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed; which is to partake of the ſame eternall life and glory with himſelf, that the Father hath given him; according to theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.17, 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6, 7. <hi>chap.</hi> 8.17.1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3, 4 <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.26.27. <hi>chap.</hi> 3.21, 22, <hi>chap.</hi> 22.14. and to reward thoſe. that know him not, and obey not his holy Goſpel, according to their works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.8 9. <hi>To thoſe that are contentious, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey not the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſs, he will render in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh upon every ſoul of man that doth evil, whether Jew or Gentile:</hi> and will deſtroy them with an everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of God, and the glory of his power. And this honour and glory he received from God the Father in the holy mount, when <hi>Peter, James,</hi> &amp; <hi>John</hi> were <hi>eye-witneſſes of his Majeſty;</hi> and that voyce they heard that came <hi>from the excellent glory,</hi> ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.16, 17, 18. This is the Lords A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48878:18"/>
who is the onely King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; by whom <hi>Kings raigne, and Princes decree Juſtice,</hi> even all the Judges of the earth. Counſel is his, and ſound wiſdome; he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and he hath ſtrength, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.14, 15, 16. he loves them that love him; and thoſe that ſeek him early, ſhall find him; But thoſe his enemies that will not that he ſhould Reigne over them, ſhall be brought and ſlaine before him. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.27.</p>
            <p>And thus have I ſhown, and clearly proved by the Scriptures, that Chriſt is the Lords anointed King onely and alone; and none of the Kings of the Nations can have any right to ſuch a title any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways then the Saints and all that fear God in generall have; which is, by partaking of the ſame anointing Spirit, through be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, as it is written, <hi>The anointing that ye have received of him, abideth in you; and you need not that any man teach you: but as that anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.27.</p>
            <p>And againe he ſaith; <hi>We have an unction from the holy One;</hi> verſ. 20. and, <hi>he that ſtabliſheth us with you in Chriſt, and hath anointed us, is God, who hath alſo ſealed us, and given us the earneſt of his Spirit in our hearts,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.21, 22. and this anointing is as proper to a Begger, as to a King, if he be a believer: and if a King be an unbeliever, he hath no Right at all to it; for <hi>there is no reſpect of perſons with God; but he hath choſen the poor in this world rich in faith, and heirs of the Kingdome prepared for them that love him,</hi> James 2.5. And he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed his Truth to Babes and Sucklings, and hid it from the wiſe and prudent; Inſomuch that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>that none of the Princes of this world knew it: For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.7, 8. Therefore ſaith <hi>James</hi> 1.9, 10. <hi>Let the Brother of low degree rejoyce in that he is exalted; but the Rich, in that he is made low:</hi> For God will raiſe them both up, <hi>to ſit together in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Eph. 2.6. And he will make them partakers of his fulneſs; and <hi>members of his Body, of his fleſh, and of his Bones,</hi> Chap. 5.30.</p>
            <p>Therefore let the Kings, Princes, and Rulers of the Nations, be wiſe, and learn to know what the Lord meaneth, when he faith,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48878:19"/>
               <hi>Touch not mine Anointed, and do my Prophets no harm:</hi> For he that once <hi>reproved Kings for their ſakes,</hi> and ſlew great and Famous ones for them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.14.15. with 136.17, 18. is now about to reprove all the Kings upon the face of the Earth for their ſakes; as I ſhall now make it appear, by ſhewing <hi>Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſigne againſt them, in theſe laſt days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And firſt: The deſigne of God and his purpoſe is (in this laſt age of the world) <hi>to ſtaine the pride of all their Glory, and to bring into contempt all the honorable of the Earth,</hi> Iſa. 23.9. and <hi>to pour contempt upon Princes, and to cauſe them to wander in the wilderneſs, where there is no way;</hi> and to <hi>ſet the poor on high from affliction, and to make him families like a flock;</hi> Pſa. 107.40 41.</p>
            <p>Again, the purpoſe of the Lord is to ſacrifice the fleſh of Kings, and mighty men, and the Chiefe of the Earth; and to give their fleſh to be meat to the fowls of Heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.17, 18. with <hi>Ezek.</hi> 19.17, 18. where he ſaith. <hi>They ſhall eat the fleſh of the mighty, and d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Now if the Lord will do theſe things to the great and mighty Kings, and Princes of the earth; who then can give them honour and, deliver them in the day of his wrath? And that the Lord will do it, conſider further what is written, <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.31, 32. <hi>A noiſe ſhall come from the ends of the Earth: for the Lord hath a controverſie with the Nations; he will plead with all fleſh: he will give them that are wicked to the ſword. Thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts, Behold, evil ſhall go forth from Nation to Nation.</hi> This the Lord will do, untill he have ſtained the pride of all their glory, <hi>(viz.)</hi> untill he have taken away their Kings, wherein they glory, and of whom they ſo much boaſt. That this is ſo, conſider the fore-going words: <hi>They ſhall eat the fleſh of Kings; and Princes, and mighty men, and chief Captaines, and of all that ſtand up with them againſt the Lord.</hi> And for further confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of theſe words, conſider what is written, <hi>Ier.</hi> 25.15. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts, the God of Iſrael, to me, Take the wine-cup of this fury at mine hand, and cauſe all the Nations to whom I ſend thee, to drink it.</hi> Conſider what Nations, ver. 18.19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26.</p>

               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:48878:19"/>Firſt, <hi>Jeruſalem, and the Cities of Judah, and the kings and Princes thereof, to make them a deſolution, an aſtoniſhments, and hiſſing, and a curſe, (as it is at this day.)</hi> We are ſure this is true, that they are a hiſſing and a curſe at this day: why then ſhould the other be ſo incredible, (namely) that he will deſtroy all the Kings of the Nations, with their honorable Princes, if they ſtand up againſt him, and againſt his Anointed; as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pharoah King of Egypt, and his Servants, and his Princes, and all his people; and all the mingled people, and all the Kings of the Land of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>z, and all the Kings of the Land of the Philiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines, and Aſhkolon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Aſhdod, Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon, and all the Kings of Tyrus, and all the Kings of Zidon, and the Kings of the iſles beyond the ſea: Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that are in the utmoſt corners</hi> (the Lord will find them out:) <hi>and all the Kings of Arabia, and all the Kings of the mingled people that dwel in the deſert: and all the Kings of Zimri, and all the Kings of Elam, and all the Kings of the Medes, and all the Kings of the north, far and near, one with another; and all the Kingdoms of the world that are upon the face of the earth,</hi> &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>Thus is the deſigne of the Lord of hoſts made plain by the Holy Scriptures of truth, and not by any cunning deviſed fables, or fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of my own brain: Theſe ſayings are faithfull and true; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will come to paſs in their appointed times. And that they are not yet come to paſs, is plaine to all that do underſtand: for
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48878:20"/>
moſt of the Kings of the nations are yet in their pompe and glory, and are enemies to the Lords Anointed; therefore he will avenge himſelf upon them ſpeedily: for theſe be the days of vengence, in which all things that are written in the Prophets againſt the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſt, muſt be fulfilled, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.22.</p>
            <p>And now in the earth is diſtreſs of nations, and perplexity; and mens hearts failing them for feare, and for looking after the things that are coming on the earth. For the ſignes of the coming of the Lord are now amongſt us, even here in <hi>England;</hi> and the beginning of ſorrows is in the nation: the Lord hath now begun to make us drink of this bitter cup; and it will be great mercy if we drink no deeper: notwithſtanding ſome murmur and complain; it is becauſe their eyes are not open to ſee God's deſigne now upon the face of the earth: if they did, they would ſee more cauſe to give thanks to the Lord for his mercies, then to murmur againſt him for his favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and gentle chaſtiſements; <hi>he hath not dealt ſo with every nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> and if <hi>England</hi> eſcape thus it will be very ſtrange to me; and ſo I beleive it will be to all that rightly underſtand what God is now doing, and his work which he will accompliſh upon the face of the earth, yet before the end: for he hath not yet made <hi>a man more precious then fine gold even a man then the golding wedge of Ophir.</hi> Iſa. 13.11, 12. neither hath he made <hi>the earth empty, and laid it waſte, and ſcattered the inhabitants</hi> thereof, Iſ. 24.1, 2, 3. but <hi>when it ſhall thus be in the mideſt of the land among the peoples, there ſhall be as the ſhaking of an olive-tree, and as the gleaning of the grapes, when the vintage is ended: they ſhall lift up their voice and ſing for the majeſty of the Lord,</hi> ver. 13.14.</p>
            <p>Therefore let the wicked and ungodly men, that know not Chriſt, and obey not his holy Goſpel, but are enemies, and will not that he ſhould reigne over them; let them howl for ſorrow of heart: for their ſorrows are begun, and the day of the Lord is at hand; and it ſhall come as a deſtuction from the Almighty: then <hi>ſhall all</hi> their <hi>hands be faint, and every mans heart ſhall melt, and they ſhall be afraid; pangs of ſorrow ſhall take hold of them: they ſhall be in pain as a woman in travel: they ſhall be amazed one at another, and their face ſhall be as flames.</hi> Iſa. 13.6, 7, 8.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe in all ages they have been his enemies, and the perſecuters of him and his Saints.</p>
            <p>Thoſe they were that in the time of the Law, being deluded and blinded by the falſe prophets, did perſecute and kill the prophets of the Lord; as in <hi>Ahabs</hi> days, <hi>Zedekiahs</hi> days, and <hi>Jehoiakims</hi> days, <hi>Ier.</hi> 26.29. chap. 37.12, 13, 14, 15. with 1 <hi>King.</hi> 9.9, 10. and <hi>chap.</hi> 24.25 26, 27.

            <p>This is the generation the Lord ſpeaks of, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. calling of of them <hi>Serpents,</hi> and <hi>generation of vipers;</hi> ſaying to them, <hi>How can you eſcape the damnation of hell?</hi> becauſe they had ſlain the Prophets and righteous men that lived in their days, and in the days of their forefathers.</p>
            <p>This is that wicked ſpirit of perſecution which all along from <hi>Cain</hi> to the end of the world hath reigned, and will reigne in the hearts of all ungodly men and women, to perſecute and kill the Saints: Therefore ſaith <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 4.29. <hi>As then he that was born after the fleſh, perſecuted him that was born after the ſpirit, even ſo it is now:</hi> and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The time cometh, that whoſoever killeth you, will think he doth God good ſervice.</hi> And, <hi>theſe things will they do unto you, becauſe they have not known the Father nor me,</hi> Joh. 16.2.3.</p>
            <p>And indeed, who have been the chiefeſt actors in it, but the Kings and Princes of the nations, which, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, knew not God, nor <hi>the hidden wiſdom of God: for had they known it,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48878:21"/>
they would not have crucified the Lord of glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7, 8. and the reaſon why they did not know it, was, becauſe they ſuffered the wicked prieſts and falſe prophets of the times to blind the eyes of their minds, leſt the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt ſhould ſhine into their ſouls, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 4. And this they effected, by handling the word of God deceitfully, &amp; changing the truth into a lye; <hi>teaching for doctrines the commandments of men,</hi> in ſtead of the commands of God given us by Chriſt: So walking in crati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſmoothing over their deceits with a company of good words, and falſe ſpeeches; thereby <hi>deceiving the hearts of the ſimple:</hi> and <hi>through covetouſneſs and ſained words,</hi> have <hi>made mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe of their ſouls,</hi> Rom. 16, 17, 18 with 2 Pet. 2.2, 3. and indeed, it's no marvell though it be thus: for it is the policy of Satan to gain the Kings and rulers of the nations to him ſelf; for by that meanes he can eaſily ſuppreſs the people of God living under them, and alſo delude and deceive thoſe that have not the knowledg of God amongſt them, by the examples of them in authority: for look what religion the Kings and rulers of the nations are of, the ſame generally the people are: as for example, The Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the rulers there of, if they were good, the people were the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but if they were evill, the people were generally wicked: and therefore it is ſaid, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14.15 16. <hi>The Lord ſhall ſmite Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael as a reed is ſhaken in the water, and he ſhall root up Iſrael out of this good land which he gave to their fathers: and he ſhall give up Iſrael becauſe of the ſins of Jereboans; who did ſin, and who made Iſrael to ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may likewiſe obſerve the ſame in <hi>Judah,</hi> in the days of <hi>Rehoboam</hi> the ſon of <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 King. 14.21, 22, 23, 24. in theſe words: <hi>And Judah did evil in the ſight of the Lord and provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to jealouſie with their ſins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The ſame things may be obſerved by us of late days here in <hi>England:</hi> for in the days of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, the people were Proteſtants; but in Queen <hi>Marys</hi> days they were Papiſts; for ſhee and the Rulers were ſoland in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> days, again Proteſtants; for ſhe and the rulers were ſo. Thus we ſee it is the faſhion of the nations, and of our nation of <hi>England</hi> alſo, to be of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48878:21"/>
that Religion that their Kings, Nobles, and Rulers were: and great reaſon: for, firſt, its praiſe-worthy, and highly commendable in the ſight of men, to be ſo; ſecondly, it is the way to live in peace, and to eſcape the croſe of Chriſt. But let us remember, that what is highly eſteemed in the ſight of men, is abomination in the ſight of God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.16.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Eightly, It is to be conſidered, <hi>what the Kings and rulers of, the nations may or ſhould do, to eſcape the hand of God lifted up againſt them:</hi> for although there be a generall diſtruction pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt the Kings and Princes of the nations (their ſins, and the ſins of their fore-fathers, being at the full) without reſpect of perſons; yet it is not without reſpect of their conditions, but <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they repent</hi> (as Chriſt ſaith) <hi>they ſhall all periſh,</hi> Luke 13.5. as we alſo ſee in <hi>Jon.</hi> 3.4. When the Lord by the Prophet had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced deſtruction to Nineveh within fourty days; yet we ſee when they acknowledged their ſins, and humbled themſelves before the Lord, he was pleaſed to forgive them, and ſpare their King and their City, according to his gratious promiſe, as we may read, <hi>Ier.</hi> 18.6.7 8.9, 10. in theſe words: <hi>At what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a Nation, on a Kingdom, to pluck up or to pull down and deſtroy it; if that Nation againſt whom I have pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, turn from their evil I will repent of the evil, I thought to do unto them. And at what inſtant I ſpeak concerning a nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and a Kingdom, to build and plaint it; if that nation do evil in my ſight, that it obey not my voice, then will I
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48878:22"/>
repent of the good wherewith I ſaid I would benefit them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we ſee, the Lord hath gratiouſly left open a door of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for them to eſcape thorow; although its to be feared that very few will make uſe of it: notwithſtanding my humble advice is to all in generall, that they will let the counſell of the Lord be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto them which in theſe words is expreſſed: <hi>Be wiſe now therefore, ye Kings; and be inſtructed, ye that are Judges of the earth: Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoyce with trembling,</hi> Pſa. 2.10, 11. <hi>Break of your ſins by righteouſneſs, and your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities by ſhewing mercy to the poor, if it may be a lengthening of your tranquility,</hi> Dan. 4.27. for who can tell whether God will turn and repent, and turne away from his fierce anger, that they periſh not? Seeing alſo he hath ſaid, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.8, <hi>If that nation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom I have ſpoken, turne from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do to them.</hi>

            <p>Firſt, That you will fear the Lord, and ſerve him in truth with all your hearts; and conſider what great things he hath done for you: for if you and the nation ſhall ſtill do wickedly, we ſhall be conſumed, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.24, 25. conſider therefore how he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred you in your low condition; and when you were little in your own eyes, he choſe you, and made you the heads of the nation, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.17. and ever ſince, hath gone before you, and fought your battels, and given you the victories: and now at preſent, he hath given you reſt, and a breathing-time, to ſit down and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how he hath wonderfully delivered you out of the hands of your enemies: ſo that they which hate you do, not rule over you; but he hath delivered them into your hands, and you rule over them: which is a double mercy. Now therefore in the fear of God, while

you have time, ſit down and ſeriouſly conſider how the Lord hath digged and planted you, and how he hath fenced you and made an hedge about you: and what could men fearing God deſire more for a temporall ſafety and deliverance, that he hath not done? as he ſaid once to Iſrael, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.2, 3, 4. now therefore is the time that the Lord looks for fruit; and now is the time that the Rulers of the Nation, and the Judges of the people ought to be inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to learn wiſdom; to ſerve the Lord (that hath thus deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them) in fear, and to rejoyce before him with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</p>
            <p>Secondly, take heed therefore leſt now, when the Lord <hi>looks for judgement,</hi> he <hi>behold oppreſſion;</hi> and <hi>for righteouſneſs,</hi> he hear <hi>a cry:</hi> which may juſtly cauſe him to take away the hedge, and pull down the wall that he hath built about us, and lay us waſte, as he did his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Iſa. 5.5, 6. I ſpeak not theſe things to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe any, but to warn all, in time to take heed; for as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in another caſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. If God ſpared not his people <hi>Iſrael</hi> the naturall branches, let us take heed leſt he alſo ſpare not us: and it is for you that are the heads of the people and Princes of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I ſay it is for you to know Judgment; and of you that the Lord requireth theſe things, <hi>Mic.</hi> 3.1. Therefore let all that are in authority in the nation, Conſider their ways; And, <hi>waſh you, and make you clean, put away the evill of your doings from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes of the Lord; ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well, ſeek Judgement, relieve the oppreſſed; judge the fatherleſs, plead for the widow:</hi> then you may have boldneſs to draw near, and to <hi>come and reaſon together</hi> with the Lord; and <hi>though your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be as white as ſnow: if you will be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and obedient, ye ſhall eat the good things of the Land; but if you refuſe and rebel, you ſhall yet be dovoured with the ſword: for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it,</hi> Iſa. 1.16, 17, 18, 19, 20.</p>
            <p>You may do all this now, you have time enough; no enemies to trouble you. In time of diſtreſs you promiſed well: the people hoped you would performe, and therefore were willing to put to their hand to help in time of need: and now the ſtorme is over, the eyes of all your friends in the nation are upon you, expecting theſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48878:23"/>
things from you; which the Lord requireth of you, and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do beleive you will perform, although we thus ſpeak, to ſtir up your minds by way of remembrance.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, and you Honourable, Noble and valiant men of the Army, whom God hath crowned with ſo many Victories; you that have ſeen the works of God, and his wonders in delivering you in moſt eminent dangers, and covering your heads in the day of battel, and made your hearts and hands ſtrong, and your faces bold, to look upon your enemies in the height of all their pride, and gave them into your hands when you were in your loweſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, (remember <hi>Dunbar;</hi>) be not now faint-hearted, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, and forget not to look your friends whom you have fought for in the faces, and petition to them, and plead with them for juſt judgement, and equity; that the Nation may be eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſs: then may you ſit down in peace, and injoy the fruits of your labour and hazards. But think not that the work is already done, becauſe you for preſent have done fighting: its true, the Lord hath delivered you, and all the Magiſtrates in the Land, out of the hands of your enemies; but it now remaineth that both you and they ſtrive together (and that while you have time) to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the oppreſſed from oppreſſion, and the poor &amp; needy out of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: for God hath delivered you to that end, that you, as inſtruments in his hands, may deliver them: and he hath prepared yet another bleſſing for you, againſt you have done that work; as you may ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.1, 2, 3. in theſe words: <hi>Bleſſed is he that conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the poor and neeby; the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble: the Lord will preſerve him, and keep him alive; and he ſhall be bleſſed upon the earth: and the Lord will not deliver him into the hands of his enemies; but the Lord will ſtrengthen him upon the bed of languiſhing: yea, he will make his bed in all his ſickneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we ſee how good and acceptable a work it is in the ſight of God, and what the Lord hath promiſed to thoſe that faithfully labour in it: therefore they that are already about it, let them <hi>not be weary of well-doing: for in due time they ſhall reap, if they faint not.</hi> And thoſe that are not about it, let them <hi>up and be doing:</hi> and Lord that hath promiſed to be with them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:48878:23"/>Therefore let none ſay, The former Lawes and Statutes of the nation do hinder them in this work: for if they be corrupt, why are they not taken away? who hinders you, or can hinder you? Is not the Lord with you, while you are with him, doing of his will and work? and hath he not given the power into your own hands? Be ſure therefore he will require theſe things at your hands that are in authority, and have the power in poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>But men are very prone in theſe things, to frame their work ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the politick Law of Nations, rather then to meaſure it by the perfect Law of God: therefore my humble advice in the next place is, that your honours will,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, be pleaſed to conſider <hi>David,</hi> that man after Gods own heart, who ruled the people prudently with all his power: conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I ſay, how he meditated in the Law of the Lord day and night, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2. and how he ſought him with his whole heart, that he might not wander from his commandments, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.10. for by them he was made wiſer then all his enemies, and had more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding then all his teachers: becauſe he meditated upon the teſtimonies of the Lord, and becauſe he kept his precepts, he came to underſtanding more then the ancients; verſe 97.98, 99, 100. And theſe things are written, and left upon record, for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, upon whom the ends of the world are come: therefore let us be inſtructed by them, and eſpecially you that are in high places; for the God <hi>Iſrael</hi> hath ſaid, They which rule over men muſt be juſt, ruling in the fear of God; and as the light of the morning, when the Sun ariſeth in a morning without clouds; and as the tender graſs ſpringing out of the earth, by the clear ſhining after raine, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.3, 4.</p>
            <p>And truly there hath bin a great ſhower upon the nation theſe many yeers; but now it is ended: therefore the Lord grant that after you may ſo ſpring up and grow in works of Juſtice, and mercy, and righteouſneſs, that by them you may ſhine forth in the nation: So as both your ſelves, and they which do behold you, may have cauſe to rejoyce, and glorifie God. Otherwiſe, I for my part am very Confident that <hi>Englands</hi> miſeries are not yet done; but the Lord will again chaſtiſe us with chaſtiſements ſeven times worſe then before: but I hope for better things, although I thus ſpeak.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:48878:24"/>Sixthly, The example of <hi>Solomon</hi> is worthy of ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, who when the Lord had made him ruler over his people, he then beſought him for an underſtanding heart that he might diſcern between good and bad, and that he might know how to judge righteouſly between man and man and how to go out and in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo great a people: and this thing pleaſed the Lord ſo, that he did not onely grant him his requeſt, but alſo gave him riches and honour, which he did not aske, nor cover after: and promiſed him further, that if he would walk in his ways, and keep his ſtatutes and commandments as his father <hi>David</hi> did, he would alſo lengthen his days, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3.5 6 7, 8 9, 10, 11, 12 13.</p>
            <p>Now, would the honorable Rulers of this nation know how to diſcern between good and bad, and to judge righteouſly between man and man, and how to go out and in before this great people which the Lord hath ſet them over? Would you have honour and riches here, and true happineſs hereafter, with God in glory? Then ask it of the Lord, as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> did: meditate in his law, and exerciſe your ſelves therein day and night: learn out of that, what is Juſtice, and Judgement, and equity, and the Lord will be with you, and give you wiſdome and underſtanding in all things: for he is no reſpecter of perſons, but giveth to all that ask in faith, freely, and upbraideth not, <hi>James.</hi> 1.5. Therefore, Right Honorable, diſpiſe not theſe ſayings becauſe of the weakneſs of the inſtrument who at this time puts you in mind of them, but let the counſell of the Lord be acceptable to you: <hi>it may be</hi> as <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith, <hi>a lengthening of your tranquillity,</hi> Chap. 4.27 therefore let all that are in authority labour to be ſuch as they ought to be, (namely) <hi>men fearing God, and hating covetouſneſs:</hi> (for if any be otherwiſe minded, let them know, the Lord will have ſuch to rule before he hath done:) and aske the Lord for wiſdome (even that hidden wiſdome, which few or none of the Princes of this world have attaind unto) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. that, ſo you may wiſe and underſtanding hearts, to judge the people righteouſly: for without this wiſdome, who is able to go out and in before ſo great a people as God hath ſet you over? eſpecially when the eyes of moſt of them are upon the Rulers for evill, and do watch for their haltings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:48878:24"/>Be wiſe now, therefore, you that are the Rulers of the Nation; and be inſtructed, yee that are the Judges of the people, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that although you be <hi>called Gods,</hi> yet <hi>you muſt die like men;</hi> and after that, cometh the righteous and impartiall Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, to whom you muſt give account at the great day, of all your actions.</p>
            <p>Therefore take heed ye be not conformable to their Image which God hath caſt downe by you, and do not tread in the footſteps of them whom God hath deſtroyed by your hands, for their pride, vaine-glory, covetouſneſs and oppreſſion: which wickedneſs in them, was now come to the full. But eſpeciaily, take heed of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting the Saints, and men fearing God, for conſcience ſake in the things of God, the which they were deluded and led into by thoſe wicked Antichriſtian Miniſters which attended upon them in the Biſhops days; a great part of whom is left amongſt us to this day, and ſome of them ſo transformed into Miniſters of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that they will hardly be diſcerned from them: but this need be no wonder; for <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, the Devill himſelf is <hi>transformed into an angel of light,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.14, 15. but by their works they may be known.</p>
            <p>Therefore if there be any ſecretly inticing your Honours to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute men fearing God, which make the holy Scripture a rule both for their faith and obedience, you may be ſure they are of that old generation the Lord Chriſt ſpeaketh of: you may read their genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, and ſee whoſe children they are, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.27, 28, 29 30 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37. compared with <hi>John</hi> 8.44. But I know by wofull experience, they have ſo much of the wiſdom from beneath as to call us <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and <hi>peſtilent fellows,</hi> and <hi>movers of ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and <hi>ring leaders of ſects:</hi> for after the ſame manner they accuſed <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 24.5. But his anſwer is ſufficient for all thoſe which tread in his footſteps, and contend earneſtly for that faith which was once delivered to the Saints in <hi>Pauls</hi> days; which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is written, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.4.13, 14 15, 16. in theſe words, <hi>They cannot prove the things whereof they accuſe me: but this he confeſſed</hi> (to <hi>Felix</hi>) <hi>that after the way which they call Hereſie, ſo worſhip I the God of my fathers, beleiving all things that are written in the Law and the Prophets; and have hope to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48878:25"/>
God, which they themſelves allow, that there ſhall be a reſurrection of the dead, both of the juſt and unjuſt. And herein do I exerciſe my ſelf always, to have a conſcience void of offence, towards God and towards man.</hi> From which words of <hi>Paul,</hi> I obſerve theſe things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That they which perſecuted him, did themſelves allow that it was lawfull for him to beleive all things written in the Law and the Prophets; and yet they accuſed him for an heretick: even ſo do men in theſe days: they will allow us to beleive all things writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Law and the Prophets, and all the gratious words of Chriſt and his Apoſtles; but if we practiſe them, they will accuſe us for hereticks.</item>
               <item>2. Thoſe which do believe all things written in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and acknowledge the reſurrection of the juſt and unjuſt, and labour to keep good Conſciences, void of offence towards God and towards man; they are no Hereticks: let them believe and do what they will, if it be no more then is written in the word of God to believe and obey. Therefore let all men take heed how they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute any for believing or practiſing any thing written therein, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be never ſo contrary to their judgement.</item>
               <item>3. If any be Hereticks, it muſt needs be they which do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and obey the things written and commanded in the holy Scriptures: for, as Chriſt ſaith to the Sadduces, <hi>They erre, not knowing the Scriptures.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. I underſtand that the great difference amongſt men lyeth in the practical part of Religion: for the Devill and wicked men do not care how much truth men know and believe, ſo they practiſe none; for the greater is their condemnation: But if any come to practiſe it, by keeping the commandments of God, by which do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they exerciſe a good conſcience towards God, and are blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and righteous before him, as <hi>Zacharias</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. then preſently perfecution ariſeth: for Satan well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that to believe and obey both, will bring a man to happineſs in diſpite of him: and therefore it is, that the poor Saints are ſo much perſecuted for practiſing nothing but what is written in the word of God, and was practiſed before in the days of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. But let men take heed how they offend thoſe which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48878:25"/>
earneſtly contend for the faith once delivered to the Saints; not in King <hi>Henries</hi> or Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> days onely, but I mean all that was firſt preached and practiſed by the Lord and his holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; even as it was delivered at firſt.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Therefore my prayer ſhall be for all thoſe in Authority, That, they may learn to know that they are ordained of God to judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and man, and not between God and man; and to to rule over mens bodies, not ſouls. But this I ſpeak in the behalf of thoſe which go not beyond the Scriptures, and do not preſume above what is written: but if any deny them, I have nothing to ſay for them; they muſt anſwer for themſelves when they are called to it.</p>
            <p>Thus hoping that the Magiſtrates in generall will be as willing to protect all people fearing God, and walking according to the rule of his word, as they are willing to pray for and aſſiſt them in time of need; I ſhall conclude this matter, and proceed to the next particular (viz.) to ſhew <hi>what is the Saints duty, and how they ought to behave themſelves in theſe dangerous days and perilous times,</hi> briefly in theſe words.</p>
            <p>Firſt, let not our hearts be troubled at the wars and rumours of wars, diſtreſſe of nations, and perplexity that is now upon the face of the earth: for all theſe things muſt come to paſs; but the end is not yet, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.6, 7, 8. for theſe are the beginnings of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and the days of vengeance, in which all things muſt be fullfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that are written in the Prophets, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.22.</p>
            <p>Therefore the ſecond thing we are to be exhorted unto, is, to take heed to our ſelves, leſt at any time our hearts be overcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſurfetting and drunkenneſs, and the cares of this life, and ſo we be taken unawares in that ſnare that ſhall come upon all them that dwell upon the face of the whole earth (which do not take heed:) Therefore let us watch and pray always, that we may be counted worthy to eſcape all theſe things that ſhall come to paſs on this ſide the grave, and that we may have our part in the Reſurrection of the Juſt, and ſtand before the Son of man with great boldneſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.34, 35, 36. for they which have their part in the firſt Reſurrection, are bleſſed and happy, and ſhall ſhine forth as the Sun in the kingdome of their Father, when our vile
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48878:26"/>
bodies ſhall be changed and made like the glorious body of the Lord, as it is written, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.43. with <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. But the wicked ſhall not be able to ſtand in the Judgement, nor ſinners in the congregation of the Righteous in that day, when the Heavens ſhall depart, or paſs away with a great noiſe, and the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhal melt with ſervent heat, &amp; the earth, with the works there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſhall be burnt up. At which time, the dead, both great and ſmall muſt all appear before the Judgment-ſeat of Chriſt, to receive accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their deeds done in the fleſh, whether they be good or bad. The conſideration of which righteous judgement to come, made <hi>Felix</hi> tremble, although he was a judge: therefore, dear Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and all that feare God, and believe that all theſe things ſhall come to paſs; let us, us as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3 10, 11, 12. conſider <hi>what manner of perſons we ought to be, in all holy converſation and godlineſs: looking for, and making haſte unto, the coming of this great day of God:</hi> for it's the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the wicked to put the evil day far from them: but let us, ſo much the more as we ſee the evil day approaching, prepare to meet the Lord, by putting off the work of darkneſſ and putting on the armour of light, walking honeſtly as the children of the day: Laying aſide all ſuperfluity of naughtineſs, and receiving with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that ingrafted word of God, which is able to ſave our ſouls. And foraſmuch as we know that godlineſs is great gaine, having both the promiſe of this life, and that which is to come; let us put on the new man which after God is created in righteouſneſs and true holineſs, and let us be clothed with humility; then ſhall we be fit and ready to meet the Lord at his coming, and to look death in the face, whenſoever it ſhall approach. Let us take heed of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deceit:and let no corrupt communication proceed out of our mouth, but that which is good to the uſe of edifying and building up each other in our moſt holy faith: and let all bitterneſs, and wrath and evil ſpeaking, filthineſs, fooliſh talking, and jeſting, be put away from us, and not once be named amongſt us: as becometh Saints: for, for theſe things ſake cometh the wrath of God upon the children of diſobedience:let us not therefore be partakers with them, but ſee that we walk circumſpectly, not as fools but as wiſe, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the light; redeeming our time, becauſe the days are evil.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48878:27"/>
And in a common calamity many times all things fall out alike to all; and as dieth the wiſeman, ſo dyeth the fool; and there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that ſacrificeth, and to him that ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth not, and to him that ſweareth, as to him that feareth an oath: ſo that no man knoweth either love or hatred by all the things that arc before him in this preſent evil world, <hi>Eccle.</hi> 9.1, 2, 3. But this we know through believing, that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt gave himſelf for our ſins, that he might deliver us from them, and all the corruptions and pollutions that are therein through luſt: and by him is given unto us exceeding <hi>great and pretious promiſes,</hi> that by them we might be made <hi>partakers of the divine nature.</hi> Let us therefore give all diligence to <hi>add to our faith vertue, and to vertue knowledge, and to that temperance, and patience, and godlineſs, and brotherly kindneſs, and love; that</hi> we may be fruitfull in the knowledge of Chriſt, and <hi>abound in the work of the Lord, for aſmuch as we know our labour ſhall not be in vaine; and if we do theſe things, we ſhall never fall, but an entrance ſhall be opened to us abundantly, into the everlaſting Kingdome of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, ſo that we may ſtand by ſaith, and rejoyce in the hope of the glory of God, even that <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal weight of glory</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 41.6, 17, 18. which will make our affliction ſeem light and momentary: and though our outward man ſhould periſh, yet our inward man will be dayly renewed. Let us therefore conſider theſe things, leſt we faint and be weary in our minds; and that we may lift up our heads and rejoyce, knowing the day of our Redemption draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nigh.</p>
            <p>Thus having laboured to ſtir up your pure minds in ſome meaſure by way of remembrance, I ſhall proceed to the laſt particular, namely, the <hi>vindication of the Saints from the falſe aſperſions caſt upon them by wicked ignorant men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, they aſſirme that we will not obey Magiſtrates, but have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliouſly roſe up againſt, and prevailed over the King to the taking away of his life: and therefore they conclude that we are thoſe that <hi>diſpiſe dominion,</hi> and <hi>ars not afraid to ſpeak evil of dignities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:48878:28"/>To which anſwer: This is no more true then that which <hi>Ahab</hi> ſpake of <hi>Elijah,</hi> when he told him that it was he that troubled <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.17.18. and therefore the ſame anſwer may well ſerve us, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That it is not we that have troubled the Nation, by <hi>fearing God,</hi> and <hi>keeping his Commandments,</hi> which are written in his Word of Truth; for <hi>that is the whole duty of man,</hi> Eccle. 12.13. but it was he, and his fathers houſe, in that he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the commandments of the Lord, and brought in the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and traditions of men in ſtead therof, as <hi>Ahab</hi> followed after <hi>Baalim:</hi> and therefore in vain did they worſhip God, as Chriſt faith.</p>
            <p>But let our accuſers remember thoſe prophane days of Liberty, which were ſet up by Authority, and Books of liberty read in ſtead of preaching, by which they ſtrengthened the hands of the wicked, that they could not turne from their wickedneſs: for they thought all was well ſo long as it was ſet up and allowed by Authority, and read by the Pariſh-Prieſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Let them remember the perſecuting of them that feared the Lord in thoſe days, by baniſhment, impriſonment, and ſpoiling their goods, and ſome by death, whoſe blood cried for vengeance in the eares of the Lord, with the prayers, ſighs and grones of the other baniſhed out of their native Countrey from friends and acquaintance, and thoſe in Priſon; the wife being ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from her loving husband, and the husband from his dear wife; the children from their parents, and parents from their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: being thereby made uncapable of getting a livelihood in the world; even to the utter undoing of many: and all becauſe they would but ſearch into the Scriptures for eternal Life, further then the Biſhops, and the King and his counſel would have them. By all which it is evident, that it is the juſt hand of God that hath taken vengeance upon his Teachers and Counſelers, and will yet find out more of them; and that not onely in this Land, but in other Nations alſo, untill he hath <hi>ſtained the pride of all their glory,</hi> and <hi>brought into contempt all the honorable of the earth:</hi> the which is ſufficiently proved before, in the ſixth and ſeventh parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of this Book.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Let them conſider the abundance of wickedneſs that was at Court in his days; what gluttony, drunkenneſs pride, ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48878:28"/>
lying, whoring, carding, dicing, and all manner of unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full gaming, allowed of, practiſed, and maintained by him, his Courtiers, and their attendance: all which, with the reft of their wickedneſs, procured the juſt judgement of God upon them: <hi>for, becauſe of theſe things the wrath of God cometh upon the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of diſobedience,</hi> Eph. 5.3, 4, 5, 67.</p>
            <p>Againe, whereas they accuſe us of ſpeaking evill of dignities, and for reſiſting of powers;</p>
            <p>I anſwer, It's falſe: for <hi>there is no power but of God,</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.3.1, 2. And how to know what power is of God, he ſheweth in the 3&amp;4 verſes, in theſe words: <hi>for Rulers</hi> and powers (that are of God) <hi>are not a terrour to good works, but to the evil. Therefore if thou doeſt that which is good, thou ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame: for he is the ſervant of God to thee for good: and is for the praiſe of them that do well, and for the puniſhment of them that do evil.</hi> And, ſaith the Apoſtle, To ſuch a power <hi>we muſt needs be ſubject, not onely for wrath, but alſo for conſcience ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But the powers that are, be of God; and muſt be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, though they ſhould be wicked.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny it: for wicked men in Authority commanding wicked things, ought not to be obeyed, but oppoſed; either active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by doing; or paſſively, by ſuffering. Therefore ſaid the Apoſtle to the Magiſtrates, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Whether it is right in the ſight of God, to hearken to you more then to God, judge you.</hi> And again, Chap. 5.28, 29. <hi>Peter</hi> and the other Apoſtles told the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, they ought to obey God rather then them. Thus we ſee Magiſtrates are not to feared and obeyed becauſe they are Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and powers, but becauſe they are good Magiſtrates, and powers ordained of God; ſuch as are for the praiſe of them that do well, and a terrour to them that do evill, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.3. they that do well ſhall not need to be afraid of the powers that are of God: but we know by wofull experience, that thoſe that did well, had moſt cauſe of fear, and were in greateſt danger: therefore that power was not of God, and is caſt down.</p>
            <p>Againe, if we muſt underſtand it in their ſence, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that all
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48878:29"/>
powers are of God; and muſt be obeyed becauſe they are powers; then we ſhall prove the Devil, and all wicked men, as theives and murtherers, muſt be obeyed: for the Devil is both a Prince and a power; even <hi>the Prince of the darkneſs, the Prince of the powers: of the aier, the Spirit that now worketh in the hearts of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of diſobedience,</hi> Eph. 2.2. but now I hope none will ſay, that becauſe he is a power, that therefore he ought to be obeyed, or that he is of God. But if the other argument be true, this muſt needs follow: but men reaſon thus, becauſe they are ignorant, and are indeed of the number of thoſe that <hi>ſpeak evil of things they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not:</hi> and ſhall utterly periſh in their own corruptions, except they repent, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12. for indeed, theſe men know not, neither do they conſider what God hath done in former ages; much leſs what he is doing, and will do, yet before the end of all things: and therefore ſpeak they evil of things they know not: and, as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſaith againe, <hi>they think it ſtrange that we run not in the ſame exceſſe of riot with them;</hi> and therefore ſpeak they evil of us: but let them know they ſhall give an account to him which is ready to jude the quick and dead, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.3, 4.5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But there are many Noble, wiſe, and prudent men in this Nation, and moſt or all of the Kings and Princes of other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that take part with them; and who dares ſay that they are ſuch?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Moſt or all of the Kings, Princes, and nobles of the World are ignorant of the knowledge of God, and of his great deſign and work that he hath to do upon the earth: <hi>for had they known it</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>they would not have cruciſied the Lord of glory,</hi> 1 Cor. 22.8. And did thoſe Princes and great men in our days know it, they would not crucifie him in his members: but, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Theſe things will they do unto you, becauſe they have not known the Father nor me,</hi> Joh. 16.2, 3. And indeed, the world by wiſdom knew not God: therefore ſaith <hi>Paul, The wiſdom of this world, and of the Princes of the world, comes all to nought,</hi> 2 Cor. 2.6. But as for the wiſdom of God, that ſhall endure for ever: he revealeth it <hi>to them that fear him:</hi> and his Covenant is to give them underſtanding, without reſpect of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.12.13, 14 with <hi>James</hi> 1.5. And there is <hi>not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiſe, nor noble, nor mighty, that God hath choſen; but he
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48878:29"/>
hath choſen the poor in this world, rich in faith, and heirs of his Kingdom,</hi> James 2.5. and <hi>God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world, to confound the wiſe; and weak thing of the world, to confound the mighty; and baſe things, and things that are diſpiſed, hath God choſen;</hi> to the end <hi>that no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence.</hi> See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26, 27, 28, 29. Therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I thank thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed them to babes: even ſo, Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight,</hi> Luke 10.21.</p>
            <p>Thus having ſhown the reaſon why men ſalſly accuſe us, and ſpeak evill of us, as of evil doers; I ſhall proceed to vindicate my ſelf and others from the next reproach and ſlander, (namely) that we are the falſe Prophets that ſhall ariſe in the laſt days, and deceive many.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to which, I ſhall proceed in order thus:</p>
            <p>Firſt, we will conſider which are the <hi>laſt days</hi> in which they ſhould ariſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, how we may know a falſe Prophet from a true one.</p>
            <p>And firſt, I affirme, that the laſt days in which the falſe Prophets ſhould ariſe, did begin in the time when Chriſt and his Apoſtles were upon the earth: which is cleared by conſidering the world in its three Ages: the firſt days of it being from the creation till the Flood, and after till <hi>Moſes,</hi> by whom the Law was given: the ſecond days, or middle age of the world, being from <hi>Moſes</hi> to Chriſt: the laſt days, from Chriſt to the end: which <hi>days ſhall be ſhortned, for the elects ſake,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that the falſe Prophets did begin to ariſe when Chriſt was upon the earth, and his Apoſtles is evident, firſt from <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.4, 5, where Chriſt warns his Diſciples to <hi>take heed that no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> for many ſhall come in my name and ſay I am Chriſt; and deceive many:</hi> therefore thoſe were the laſt days in which deceivers ſhould come, becauſe he warned his Diſciples then in the fleſh not to be deceived.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that thoſe were the laſt days in Scripture-Language appeareth, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.16, 17. in theſe words. <hi>This is that which
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48878:30"/>
was ſpoken by the prophet Joel, that it ſhould come to paſs in the laſt days (ſaith God) I will pour out my Spirit upon all fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. And this was then fulfilled: Therefore theſe were the laſt days.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1, 2. <hi>God who at ſundry times and in divers manners ſpake to our fathers by the prophets, hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken to us by his Son,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore thoſe days in which Chriſt was in the fleſh, and ſpake to us the minde of his Father, were the laſt days in which the falſe prophets ſhould ariſe: for, ſaith <hi>Peter, As there were falſe prophets among the people,</hi> (namely, the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> under <hi>Moſes;</hi>) <hi>even ſo ſhall there be falſe teachers amongſt you:</hi> (namely, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel.)</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that thoſe were the laſt days in which falſe Prophets ſhould ariſe, and did ariſe, is undeniable, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. in theſe words, where he ſpeaks in the preſent time, thus: <hi>Little children, it [is] the laſt time: and as you have heard that Antichriſt ſhall come, even ſo now there are many Antichriſts; by which we know that it [is] the laſt time.</hi> Therefore the falſe prophets and teachers did ariſe in thoſe days, and that out of the Church of Chriſt: for, ſaith the Apoſtle, verſ. 19. <hi>They went out from us:</hi> and again, (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>The myſtery of iniquity doth already work,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.7. And <hi>I know</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that after my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture grievous wolves ſhall enter in among [you,] not ſparing the flock. And of your own ſelves ſhall men ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe things, to draw away diſciples after them,</hi> Acts 20.29, 30. Thus we ſee when the laſt days began, and when the falſe prophets did ariſe; and ever ſince that, they have continued and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in the world. And, without queſtion, the Pope may from hence well plead his antiquity, and ſo his ſucceſſion: for I believe they might be in times paſt in the true Church at <hi>Rome:</hi> for we ſee that falſe prophets and teachers had their riſe out of the Apoſtolike Church, in the Primitive times.</p>
            <p>But there is another Prophecie to be fulfilled in theſe laſt days of all, (namely) that <hi>Chriſt will conſume and deſtroy them with the ſpirit of his mouth, and the brightneſs of his coming,</hi> 2 Theſ. 28. this compared with <hi>Micah</hi> 4.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. in theſe words: <hi>In
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48878:30"/>
the laſt days it ſhall come to paſs, that the mountain of the houſe of the Lord ſhall be eſtabliſhed in the top of the mountains, and exalted above the hills: and people ſhall flow unto it. And many nations ſhall come, and ſay, Come, let us go up to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Lord, and to the houſe of the God of Jacob; and he ſhall teach us his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law ſhall go out of Zion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And</hi> the Lord <hi>ſhall judge among many people, and rebuke ſtrong nations afar off; and they ſhall break their ſwords into plough-ſhares, and their ſpears into pruning-hooks: nation ſhall not lift up a ſword againſt nation, neither ſhall they learn war any more. But every man ſhall ſit under his vine, and under his fig-tree, and none ſhall make them afraid. For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the Name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.</hi> Theſe things ſhall come to paſs in their appointed times; for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it: but it is not yet come to paſs; therefore we muſt look for other times in the laſt days of all; <hi>viz.</hi> not the riſing of falſe prophets, but the deſtroying and caſting of them down; which the Lord will haſten.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing is, How we may know a falſe prophet: of which I ſhall ſpeak as briefly as I can, becauſe, by what hath been ſaid before, they may be known.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. They will preach and propheſie in the Name of Chriſt (very much;) but <hi>they ſay, and do not:</hi> ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.21, 22, 23, 24. If Antichriſt ſhould not come in the name of Chriſt, he could not deceive ſo many: for the world hath been deceived theſe many hundred yeers by praying and preaching in his name, by them that have not obeyed his commandments, nor contended for the faith as it was once delivered to the Saints, <hi>Jude</hi> 3.</item>
               <item>2. They are of a perſecuting ſpirit: for they win ſtir up the Magiſtrate to perſecute others, which both ſay and do thoſe things commanded in Scripture, which was firſt preached by the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his holy Apoſtles: and yet they cannot tell us how we ſhall eſcape, if we neglect it. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1, 2.3.</item>
               <item>3. They commonly deny Chriſt to be come in the fleſh, in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, though not in words, by grounding their Religion upon the Ceremonies of the Law; as is well noted in that little book of <hi>Tho.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48878:31"/>
Collier</hi>'s, called <hi>Three Parallels,</hi> one between, the Prieſts of our times, and they under the Law.</item>
               <item>4. They love to give expoſitions of plain places, of Scripture, thereby to blinde the eyes of the ignorant, by darkning the counſel of God with their words without knowledge; thereby endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make the people ſet their faith in their wiſdom, and not in the power of God; contrary to <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Apoſtles of Chriſt. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4 5.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Laſtly to eſcape their wiles, let all men <hi>try the ſpirits</hi> by the Words of God: remember, the <hi>noble Bereans,</hi> Acts 17.11, 12. who <hi>ſearched the Scriptures daily, to ſee whether the things were ſo.</hi> Therefore let none venture their ſouls upon their expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, leſt they loſe them; but let us he ſure we have a written Word of God for what we believe, and for what we obey: for he is a wiſe man that believes and obeys the ſayings of Chriſt, and not their Expoſitions of his ſayings. See <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.46, 47, 48, 49, Conſider it well, and learn to be wiſe.</p>
            <p>The next thing we are accuſed of, is, that <hi>we are thoſe that cauſe diviſions and offences contrary to the doctrine we have learned,</hi> Rom. 16, 17. From which place, our enemies take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to warn the people to take heed of us, and avoid our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: for, ſay they. Who are they which cauſe theſe diviſions and offences amongſt us, but theſe Separatiſts, and men of a new faith? To which, at preſent, I ſhall briefly anſwer thus, for the clearing of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, conſider [when] the Apoſtle ſpake theſe words: it was ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred yeers ago.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to [whom] he ſpake them: it was to the true Church of Chriſt that was then at <hi>Rome,</hi> Rom. 1.7.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, [what] doctrine it was they had learned: it was the doctrine of Chriſt which was preached to them by <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, in thoſe days; and therefore he exhorteth them to <hi>mark them that</hi> laboured to <hi>cauſe diviſions and offences contrary to</hi> it: <hi>for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they that are ſuch, ſerve not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own bellies; and by good words and fair ſpeeches deceive the hearts of the ſimple,</hi> verſ. 18.</p>
            <p>Now what is all this to a people that never learned this doctrine,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48878:32"/>
but the doctrine of their Teacher, or his predeceſſor; <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> be, if it were tried by the Word of God, it is ſo far from that which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, that they ought to ſeparate and divide from it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the ſame may be ſaid of <hi>Jude</hi>'s exhortation to the Saints to <hi>contend earneſtly for the faith once delivered to the Saints;</hi> therefore it is not that which was delivered ſince <hi>Jude</hi>'s days, contrary to it; but that which was delivered before, in his days: or elſe why ſhould he ſay, <hi>Contend for that faith which was once delivered,</hi> if it were ſtill to deliver? Therefore let us make that which was firſt preached by Chriſt and his Apoſtles in that generation, a perfect Rule of faith and obedience in this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and let us contend earneſtly for it, and mark them which cauſe diviſions and offences contrary to what is written in the holy Scriptures, and avoid them.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, it is ſaid, that <hi>we are the ignorant and unlearned that wreſt the Scriptures to our own deſtruction,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.16.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer: If <hi>Peter</hi> meant thoſe which are unlearned in reference to humane learning, I confeſſe we may be ſome what guilty: but if <hi>Peter</hi> meant humane learning, then he condemns himſelf, and the other Apoſtles: for, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.13. we read that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> were ignorant and unlearned men: therefore he meaneth them which are ignorant and unlearned in the things of the Spirit of God, which, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>the naturall man perceiveth not;</hi> nor any of the Princes of this world knew, for all their learning, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7, 8, 9, 10. with 14.</p>
            <p>Againe, we know that the Pope, his Cardinals and Jeſuites, want no humane learning; and yet moſt men in <hi>England</hi> conclude that they wreſt the Scriptures to their own deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Again, we know the ancient, learned, grave Biſhops in our days wanted no Greek nor Hebrew; and yet they are concluded to be Antichriſtian and erroneous.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the Apoſtle ſheweth us plainly who he calleth unlearned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24. where he ſaith, <hi>If the church be come together into ſome place, and they all ſpeak with tongues, and there come in thoſe that are unlearned, or unbelievers, they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude they are mad: but if all propheſie, and there come in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, or unbelievers, they will be convinced,</hi> &amp;c. By all
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48878:33"/>
which we ſee that unbelievers are the unlearned once which wreſt the Scriptures to their own diſtruction: which indeed they muſt needs do, if they have not heard and learned Chriſt, and been caught by him, <hi>as the truth is in Jeſus,</hi> Eph. 4.20, 21, 22.</p>
            <p>Thus having caſt in my mite into the treaſury, towards the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing and increaſing the peace and proſperity of the Church of Chriſt, and the Common-wealth of <hi>England;</hi> I freely commit what is written to the view of all men; deſiring them to read and conſider it ſeriouſly, and trie it by the Word of God, and judge impartially: and if any finde profit, let God have the praiſe and glory, and let me have the prayers of all that fear God, and regard not iniquity in their hearts: To whom I deſire while I live, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,</p>
