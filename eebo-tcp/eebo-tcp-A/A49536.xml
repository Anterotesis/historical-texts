            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Honoured Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have long had an Ambition to lay some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at your Feet that might be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy your Protection, but despairing to produce any thing my self deserving of that Honour, and impatient of making known how Proud I am of being in the Crowd of your Admirers, I cou'd not but lay hold of this Opportunity, where the <hi>Merit</hi> of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and Assistants I have had, might in some Measure attone for what is deficient in my Performance. I offer, Sir, to your Protection
<pb facs="tcp:59606:3"/>
this History of the Lives and Works of all the Dramatick Poets of your Native Country, of which few Nations have produc'd so great a Number under so very little Encouragements. But to shew them, Sir, the more Worthy your Patronage, I shall lay down a short Account of what Value their Art has been, in the most Polite and Politick, as well as most successful Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Athens, Rome,</hi> and <hi>France</hi> will furnish me with the Proofs I want. <hi>Athens</hi> gave Birth and Perfection to the <hi>Art,</hi> and seems, like the true Mother, to have been most fond of it, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>herefore gave its professors the greatest Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement. The Value that Government had for both is evident from these two Instances: <hi>Sophocles,</hi> as a Reward of his <hi>Antigone,</hi> had the Government of the City and Island of <hi>Samos</hi> confer'd upon him: And on the Death of <hi>Eupo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> in a Sea-Fight, there was a Law publish'd, that no Poet for the Future shou'd go to the Wars; so great a Loss they thought the Death of one Poet to the Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>Thus we see that <hi>Athens</hi> that was the most Populous and Trading City of <hi>Greece,</hi> and which produc'd braver, better, and more learned Men than all <hi>Greece</hi> besides, prove, by the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment she gave Dramatick Poetry, that it was the Opinion of the Wisdom of that State, that Plays
<pb facs="tcp:59606:3"/>
were so far from being destructive of Industry and good Morals, that they were equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to the Honour and Advantage of its Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>To say nothing of the Care that was taken of the Poets, and the Esteem they were in among the Greatest and Bravest of the Old <hi>Romans;</hi> I shall only mention the Great <hi>Maecenas,</hi> who laid the Foundation of the greatest Monarchy that ever was in the World; who form'd as Great and Politick Designs, did as Great Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to his Prince as any Man whatever; and and who indeed establish'd the greatest Emperor over the most Free and Polite People in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse; <hi>Maecenas</hi> I say, thought Poetry so worthy his peculiar Care, that we owe the best of the Roman Poets to him, and his Name is pass'd from a Proper to a Common Name for all Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Patrons.</p>
            <p>'Tis yet fresh in our Memories what that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in Politicks, the great <hi>Richelieu</hi> has done for these Politer Studies in <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>Theatres,</hi> the <hi>Academy</hi> remain a glorious Monument of it; and yet no Man could have fled with a better Pretence to the Multiplicity of Affairs, no Man ever dispatching more Business, or forming more Successful, and Serviceable-Designs for his Master's Advantage, and the present and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Glory and Grandeur of <hi>Fr<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>e</hi>; for to
<pb facs="tcp:59606:4"/>
his Counsels the French Monarchy owes all that Terror and Power, with which we have seen all <hi>Europe</hi> so lately struggle with: And yet this great and busy Polititian could find a time in spight of the Weight of the whole Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>France,</hi> to take Care of the Muses, and thought it an Honour to himself and Country for the lasting Advantage of learned Men and Poets. He took Care of the Reformation of the <hi>Stage,</hi> and by his Order the Abbe <hi>Hedeline,</hi> compos'd a Piece of the whole Art of the Stage.</p>
            <p>But our Nation, alas! Furnish'd with as brave a People, and a greater Genius for Poetry than our Neighbours, had never yet been so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, as to find in the Administration, any Man with Soul enough, to think the Care of the Muses worth their Thoughts; and yet the World will never be induc'd to believe, that they are wiser or greater Politicians than <hi>Maecenas</hi> or <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelieu.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Neglect of their Science has forc'd the Poets, who had nothing to expect from the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> to make the most Noble and useful School of <hi>Vertue,</hi> degenerate into a <hi>meer Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version</hi>; that they might Please an Audience, whence they cou'd only hope for their Support. And this has laid the Stage open to the weak As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults
<pb facs="tcp:59606:4"/>
of those whom either <hi>Biggottry, Intrest,</hi> or <hi>Hypocri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y</hi> have made its Enemies.</p>
            <p>'Tis not therefore the supine and criminal Neglect of the Great Men (I mean the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters) of our Nation, that we are to form the Esteem that is due to this Science by; but the Care and value the most refin'd and most successful Polititians in the World have Discover'd for it; If the <hi>English States-Men</hi> come short of this, 'tis to be look'd on by all Men of true Sense, as their Defect and Infamy, not their Wisdom.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, tho' the Publick has not yet thought fit to take this into its Consideration and Protection, yet I had reason to think a Man of Mr. <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Qualifications, cou'd not but be pleas'd to extend his Protection to those, whose Business it is to celebrate the Vertues that gain you the general Esteem. You that forsook the <hi>lower</hi> Pleasures of Fortune and Youth, for the Pursuit of Honour and Glory in the War; You, Sir, that in your Actions have shown the Hero, have a nearer Reason than other Men, to take care of the Poets, whose task it is to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Heroes Deeds, and to transmit them in their most engaging Form to Posterity, for their Honour and Imitation.

            <p>From you therefore I hope, Sir, a favourable Reception, when I shelter all our Dramatick Writers under the Protection of your Name; for in you we shall find a Manly, yet Modest Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Do not trouble the Reader with this Preface because 'tis the Mode to say something before ev'ry Book; but because there is a Necessity of premising a Word or two as to the following Treatises, and the other Essays of this Nature, that have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been seen. I shall take no notice of Mr. <hi>Winstanley</hi>'s or Mr. <hi>Phillips</hi>'s, for one I never saw, and the other I could not read, and Mr. <hi>Langbain</hi> has discovered their Defects sufficient to justify his undertaking a more perfect Work; and which he indeed in the last Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he has pretty near accomplish'd. I must own that his Vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king has sav'd me a great deal of Trouble, but then he is every where so partial, that he destroys the Character of a Critick and Historian at once, whose Object ought always to be Truth; whereas Mr. <hi>Langbain</hi> seems every where to gratify some private Pique, and seldom to regard the Merit of the Person he reflects upon. This I have every where avoided, and distinguish'd betwixt the Desert and Defect of the Auth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He often commends, <hi>Shirley, Heywood, &amp;c.</hi> and will scarce allow Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> a Poet; whereas the former have left us no Piece that bears any Proportion to the latter; the <hi>All for Love</hi> of Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> were it not for the false <hi>Moral,</hi> wou'd be a Masterpiece that few of the Ancients or Moderns ever equal'd; and Mr. <hi>Shirley,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Heywood</hi> have not left enough in all their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings to compose one tolerable Play, according to the true Model and Design of a Play.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Langbain</hi> has in many of the Lives, swell'd them out with interlarding them with tedious Copies of Verses little to the purpose in Hand, which I was obliged to avoid for Two Reasons; First I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd to give the Reader as compendious an Account of our Drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Writers as I cou'd, and so to bring my Book to an easier Price than Mr. <hi>Langbain</hi>'s. And therefore I was, Secondly, forc'd to leave
<pb facs="tcp:59606:6"/>
out all that was Superfluous: And this the rather, because I had seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Lives and Remarks to add to this Edition, which he cou'd give no Account of, fome of the Authors having appear'd since his time, and others, by the Advantage of the ingenious Mr. <hi>Ash</hi>'s admirable Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of <hi>English</hi> Plays, I have met with, which he never saw; all which has render'd this more Perfect in its Kind than his cou'd be: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, writing after him, I have endeavoured to avoid his Faults, and preserve his Beauties.</p>
            <p>Next I have to inform the Reader, that the following Piece is not writ all by one Hand, as will, I believe, be perceived in the Reading. And lastly, I find on the perusal of it, something in the Book, which I must differ from in the Preface, and that is in the Account of Mr. <hi>Oldmixon</hi>'s <hi>Amintas,</hi> where 'tis remark'd, that Pastoral is a Modern Invention, when in reality, the Ancients had a sort of Dramatick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance not unlike it, that is, their <hi>Satyrs,</hi> which might be said to be something of a nature with our Pastoral; but if we may guess at what is lost by what remains of that kind, it was also something different. In the <hi>Cyclops</hi> of <hi>Euripides,</hi> we find the Shepherds were the major part of the <hi>Dramatis Personae</hi>; for such was <hi>Polyphemus, Silenus,</hi> and the <hi>Chorus:</hi> But the Character of <hi>Ulysses</hi> hightned the Play, and gives a greater Force to the Passions; 'tis not the Love of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyphemus,</hi> but his Cruelty we see; and the Dexterity and Wisdom of <hi>Ulysses.</hi> Of this sort of Poem, Mr. <hi>Dacier</hi> in his Preface to the Satyrs of <hi>Horace,</hi> will give you something a fuller Account. And as this takes its Rise from Antiquity, so Farce, in some Measure, may derive it self from the <hi>Pantomimi</hi>; at least that sort of Farce which the <hi>Italian</hi> Players in <hi>Paris</hi> us'd to act; tho' the <hi>Mimi</hi> and the <hi>Panto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mimi</hi> were esteem'd for their admirable Expression of Nature in Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Dancing; but our Farce is something beyond Nature, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant to a Degree of Nauseousness, to all good Iudges.</p>
            <p>I have lately read Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi>'s <hi>Love for Love</hi> over, and am of Opinion, that the Contrivance of the Marriage of <hi>Tattle</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Frail</hi> is highly probable, tho' the Reflections on that Play do seem not to admit it as absolutely so.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I have to advertise the Reader, that on the Perusal of the last Sheets of this Book, <hi>I</hi> found that in the Remark on <hi>Beauty in Distress,</hi> one of my Assistants has seem'd to imply, that the Author is more a Comick than Tragick Poet; I cannot agree with him, for I think 'tis an extraordinary Effort for the first Vndertaking in Tragedy, in which most have fail'd in their first Attempt: I say this, least any thing my Friend said, should seem a lessening of that Performance of the Author, which he assures me he never meant.</p>

                  <p>THE Title of this Nobleman makes it evident that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives his Birth from <hi>Scotland,</hi> as the Dedication of his Works affords us a Proof that he liv'd in the Time of King <hi>Iames</hi> the First, for there he has this Stanza:
<q>
                        <l>Of this dived Isle the Nurselings brave</l>
                        <l>Earst from intestine Wars cou'd not desist,</l>
                        <l>Yet did in Foreign Fields their Names engrave,</l>

                        <l>What World of Words were able to resist?</l>

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That he was in Favour with King <hi>Iames,</hi> is evident from Sir <hi>Robert Ayton</hi>'s Verses before his Tragedies. As <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>or any Particulars of his Family and Private Affairs I can give you no Account, but that it may be reasonably drawn from his Quality, Nation, and Favour at that time, that he was not unhappy in any of them, at least that depended on Fortune.</p>
                  <p>This Nobleman has by his Writings shew'd Posterity, that he had a just Right to his King's Favour, as any one that reads his <hi>Recreations of the Muses</hi> will allow. Mr. <hi>Langbain</hi> tells us of former Editions, but the best is in <hi>Folio, London,</hi> Printed for <hi>Tho. Harper,</hi> 1637. and dedicated to King <hi>Iames,</hi> not King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, as Mr. <hi>Langbain</hi> mistakes. In this Volume are Four Plays, which he calls, <hi>Monarchick Tragedies</hi>; The <hi>Alexandrean Tragedy, Croesus, Darius,</hi> and <hi>Iulius Caesar.</hi> Nor can I agree with Mr. <hi>Langbain,</hi> that he has proposed the Ancients for his Model, whom he has fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd in nothing but <hi>the Chorus</hi>: For as for the Unities of Action, Time and Place, always observed by them, he seems to know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of them. He seems to mistake the very Essence of the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> which consists in Action, most of his being Narration; and may rather be term'd Historical Dialogues, than Dramatick Pieces. There is scarce one Action perform'd in View of the Audience; but several Persons come in, and tell of Adventures perform<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d by others or themselves, and which often have no more to do with the Business of the Play, than the Persons that speak, as in the First Scene of the Fifth Act of the <hi>Alexandrean Tragedy, Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Phoceon,</hi> who have no hand in the various Revolutions of that Play, spend a long Scene on the Uncertainty of Humane Grandeur, only to tell a few Lines of Business done by some of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Captains. This Play is so far from being after the Model of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, the Action so far from being one, that 'tis multiplied enough for at least Ten Plays, it containing the various Revolutions, and Murders of the Commanders of the Macedonean Army, after the Death of <hi>Alexander</hi>; and here, as in the rest, he runs too far back to bring things <hi>ab ovo,</hi> that have no Relation to the Action, as the Scene between <hi>Harpagus</hi> and <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and <hi>Craesus</hi> and <hi>Sandanis,</hi> and many more will evince. If he has not followed the Model of the Ancients, he has yet borrowed very freely their Thoughts, transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting whole Speeches from <hi>Seneca, Virgil,</hi> and others, as the First Act of <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> from <hi>Iuno's</hi> Speech in the First of the <hi>AEneids</hi>; and many of his Sentences, as well as the Defect of his Sententi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, he owes to <hi>Seneca.</hi> The Two First Acts generally are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foreign to the Business of the Play, as indeed the greatest part of the other Acts are too. This at least may be said of my Lord,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59606:10"/>
that he is a very good Historian, and from his Plays the Reader may gather a great deal of the Affairs of <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Rome. Iuno</hi> in the first Act of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> gives us the History of all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, by the barbarous Nations, whether <hi>Gauls</hi> or the <hi>Cimbri, &amp;c.</hi> to the time of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> and finding none of them effectual enough to ruin the Power of the Roman State, which deriving it self originally from the <hi>Trojan</hi> Race, she could not but hate, therefore she now resolves to destroy it by Civil Wars, and to raise her Brothers Servants, the Furies, always obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious to mischievous Commands,
<q>
                        <l>Whilst Furies furious by my Fury made.</l>
                     </q>
Says, she shall at last do the Work; with which, after a Speech of Two or Three Hundred Lines she ends the Act. Indeed my Lord seems often to have a peculiar Fancy to punning, and that in all his chief Characters; as <hi>Caesar</hi> says in the Second Act,
<q>
                        <l>Great <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Pomp is past—</l>
                     </q>
and

                        <l>To seem uncivil in these Civil Wars.</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>But not to wrong my Lord in the Iudgment of the Readers, by these ridiculous Quotations; they are to consider, First, that this was the Vice of the Age, not the Poet; he having in that, as well as some other things, imitated the Vices of our admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Shakespear,</hi> and next that these punning Fits come not very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon him.

'Tis the Reflection of <hi>Adrastus</hi> in <hi>Craesus,</hi> the most moving Play of the Four; but to return to <hi>Caesar.</hi> in the Second Act, <hi>Caesar</hi> thinks it a part of his Grandeur to boast his Deeds to <hi>Anthony</hi> (who knew 'em well enough before) and betwixt 'em both, we have an Account of his Commentaries, and almost a Diary of his Actions. I can't omit one thing in this Play, in the Fifth Act he brings <hi>Brutus, Cassius, Cicero, Anthony, &amp;c.</hi> together after the Death of <hi>Caesar,</hi> almost in the same Circumstances as <hi>Shakespear</hi> had done in his Play of this Name. But <hi>Shakespear</hi>'s <hi>Anthony</hi> and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59606:11"/>
                     <hi>Brutus</hi> ravish you, while my Lord's <hi>Brutus, Cicero,</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> would make you sleep, so much our <hi>English</hi> Poet excels. This must be said for my Lord's <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> that it is much the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular of all his Plays, at least in the Unity of Action, which is only <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Death, tho' the whole last Act is almost redundant, for when <hi>Caesar</hi> is once dead, we have no occasion to hear of the Consequence of it, either in the Grief of <hi>Calpurnia,</hi> or the Disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements of the Noblemen and Commons; but this may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected likewise to <hi>Shakespear,</hi> who gives us a History, not a Play.</p>
                  <p>But 'tis time now to give over our Reflections on this Poet, and give the Reader a more particular account of their Plots, in their Alphabetical Order.</p>

Tho' by his Episodes, being generally inartificial, we may conclude he has not much studied <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and the Art of the Stage, yet in Two of his Plays he has gain'd the true End of Tragedy, the moving Terror and Pity, which many more celebrated Authors are so far from, that they seem never to have aim'd at it: And this indeed makes some A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for the Defects of Language, in which he seems to me very faulty.

                  <p>AN Author now Living, he is of Foreign Extraction, his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being a Native of <hi>Holstein,</hi> and a very skilful Statuary. I cannot understand that his Education ever reached either of the Universities; he having been early by his Fancy led to the Stage, tho' it was not till the division of the Houses that he made any considerable Figure there, and then he at once exerted both the Poet and the Player, in his first Play call'd, <hi>Loves last Shift,</hi> and in the part of Sir <hi>Novelty fashion,</hi> which he played himself, and so encreased both his Profit and his Reputation; he has already Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished two Plays of something a different Character, of which in their Order.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:59606:19"/>
                     <hi>Loves last Shift,</hi> or <hi>The Fool in Fashion,</hi> a Comedy, Acted at the Theatre Royal by his Majesty's Servants. <hi>London,</hi> Printed 1696. 4<hi>to.</hi> And Dedicated to <hi>Richard Norton</hi> of <hi>Southwick,</hi> Esq.</p>
                  <p>In the Epistle our Author informs us that the usual Enmity at the Success of an unknown Author, had produced some Surmises that this Play was not his own; but he assures his Patron, that he should think he affronted him, if he should dedicate a Play to him that he could not entirely call his own; no part of this, either of the Plot or the Expression being borrowed from either the Dead or the Living. He indeed took a very rational Way to that Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, which his Epistle lets us know this Performance of his met with, by making use of the extensive Acquaintance of Mr. <hi>Southern.</hi> For that Author that will stand on the bare Merit of his Play, may satisfie <hi>himself</hi> in its Iustness and Perfection, but will seldom or never reap that Profit from his Labours, that will answer either his Hopes or his Merit. Being sensible of this, I suppose Mr. <hi>Cibber</hi> took care to engage the Interest of a great many, by obliging their Vanity, in submitting his Play to their Perusal and Censure; for there is no Complement so prevailing with Mankind, as that which is made to their Wit.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Cibber</hi> has taken Care to avoid the Guilt of an unconfessed <hi>Theft,</hi> in avowing his Innocence, only so far as he could remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. The Plot indeed seems to be new, as it is surprising and <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable</hi>; but some of the Criticks will have it founded on a very great improbability, <hi>viz.</hi> on <hi>Loveless</hi>'s not knowing his Wife: Tho' it may be urged in defence of it, That young Worthy's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of her Uncle's former Account of her Death might very much contribute to his being impos'd on. But were this insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, yet the Beauty of the Incident, and the excellent Moral that flows from it, abundantly outweigh the Fault. The Characters of Sir <hi>Novelty, Snap, Narcissa,</hi> and <hi>the Elder Worthy,</hi> seem to be good Copies of Sir <hi>Fopling, Ierry</hi> in <hi>Love for Love, Setter</hi> in <hi>the Old Batchelor,</hi> &amp;c. Of <hi>Melantha</hi> in <hi>Marriage Alamode,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Vain-love</hi> in the <hi>Old Batchelor.</hi>

                  <p>This Play is much short of the former in the Easiness of Wit and Style, as in the Artful working up of the Plot. The Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of <hi>Rakeish, Father</hi> and <hi>Son,</hi> with the Plot of their Walk, is much borrowed from the <hi>Fortune Hunters</hi>; from <hi>Otway</hi>'s <hi>Dare De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>; from Sir <hi>Thomas Revel</hi> and his Son in <hi>Greenwich-Parke</hi>; and indeed among the other Characters there is not much new.</p>

And indeed he took the most certain way to make sure of <hi>Fortune,</hi> by the Intimacy he contracted with the most active part of the <hi>establish'd</hi> and <hi>receiv'd</hi> Wits and Poets of the Age, before he ventur'd his Reputation to the Publick. For as a celebrated French Writer has observ'd, an Author should never expect to raise his Fame in the World, from an unknown State, by the Single Force of his own Genius, and without the Help and Concurrence of the Men of Wit, that have an Influence over the Opinion of the World in things of that Nature. But then on the other side, it must be confess'd, that his Merit was certainly of more than ordinary Power, to oblige them to forget their habitual <hi>Ill-Nature</hi>; and criminal Emulation or Iealousy (to give it no worse Name) of all those, whom they have any Cause to fear, will once prove any considerable Rivals in their Fickle Mistress, <hi>Fame.</hi> Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> has already given us Four Plays, of whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And yet all this got it not more Applause than it really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd: For there is abundance of Wit in it, and a great deal of diverting Humour. The Characters are justly distinguish'd, and the Manners well marked. Yet in the Plot he has not given himself the Pains of avoiding that so often repeated Improbability of Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Masques and Disguises, which Mr. <hi>Tattle,</hi> nor Mrs. <hi>Frail</hi> had Sense enough to avoid, if we may judge by the rest of their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters; yet it must be own'd, that he has much better prepar'd this Incident to gain it, at least some shew of Probability, than in the <hi>Old Batchelor,</hi> or than I have generally met with in other Plays.

                     </hi> This Play had the greatest Success, not only of all Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi>'s, but indeed of all the Plays that ever I can remember on the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Stage, excepting none of the incomparable <hi>Otway</hi>'s; and if what Dr. <hi>Blackmore</hi> says of it be true, it deserved even greater than it met with; for the learned Doctor in the Seventh Page of his Preface to <hi>King Arthur,</hi> says thus:
<q>—Since the writing of this, I have seen a Tragedy, called, <hi>The Mourning Bride,</hi> which I think my self obliged to take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of in this Place. This Poem has receiv'd, and, in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, very justly, universal Applause; being look'd on as the most perfect Tragedy that has been wrote in this Age. The <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> as far as I can judge at first sight, is a very Artful and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterly Contrivance; the <hi>Characters</hi> are well chosen, and well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineated; that of <hi>Zara</hi> is admirable. The Passions are well touch'd, and skilfully wrought up. The <hi>Diction</hi> Proper, Clear, Beautiful, Noble, and Diversified agreeably to the Variety of the Subject. Vice, as it ought to be, is punish'd; and oppress'd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence at last reward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d. Nature appears very happily imitated excepting one or two doubtful Instances, thro' the whole Piece; in which there are no immodest Images, or Expressions; no wild, unnatural Rants, but some few Exceptions being allow'd, all things are Chast, Iust, and Decent. This Tragedy, as I said before, has mightily Obtain'd, and that without the unnatural, and foolish Mixture of Farce and Buffoon'ry; without so much as a Song or a Dance to make it more agreeable. By this it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that as a sufficient Genius can recommend it self, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish out abundant Matter of Pleasure and Admiration, without the paultry Helps above named: So likewise, that the Tast of the Nation is not so far deprav'd, but that a Regular and Chast Play, will not only be forgiven, but highly applauded.</q>

Yet I must needs say, so very great a Commendation, will make some of the Censo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Criticks imagine what it was that oblig'd him to take such particular Notice of this Play; which, tho' I should be never so willing to allow a Place in the first Form, yet I can never prefer it to the <hi>All for Love</hi> of Mr. <hi>Dryden, The Orphan,</hi> and <hi>Venice Preserv'd</hi> of Mr. <hi>Otway,</hi> or the <hi>Lucius Iunius Brutus</hi> of Mr. <hi>Lee,</hi> either in true Art in the Contrivance and Conduct o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And in <hi>Lee</hi> (with the <hi>Critick's</hi> permission let me speak it) you find always something Wildly Noble, and Irregularly Great; and I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, with some, to think his Stile puffie or tumid; I'm sure in his Play of <hi>Lucius Iunius Brutus</hi> he is generally Iust, both in his Thoughts and his Expressions; and it is rather for want of a true Taste of him, than his want of Merit, that he is condemn'd in that Play, I mean, if there be any that do not exempt that from the Faults of his other Plays.</p>
                  <p>I urge not this as any Reflection on Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi>'s Performance, for which I have all the just Value the Merit o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Old Batchelor</hi> was usher'd into the World with several Copies of Verses of his Friends, and which the Merit of the Play abundantly justifies: For there's a genteel and sprightly Wit in the Dialogue, where it ought to be; and the humorous Characters are generally within the Compass of Nature, which can scarce be truly said of those of several Poets, who have met with Succe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some other Characters are not entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly new, but that is very excusable in a Young Poet, especially in a Play, which I have been assur'd was writ, when our Author was but Nineteen Years Old, and in nothing alter'd, but in the Length, which being consider'd, I believe few Men that have writ, can shew one half so good at so unripe an Age.</p>

                     <hi>March</hi> following, he was admitted a Member of <hi>Lincoln</hi> Colledge, 1621. the same Year that his Father was Mayor of that City: After some Smattering in Logick, he quitted those Studies for Poetry, which prov'd more advantagious to him than to any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Professor of that Art. From <hi>Lincoln</hi>-Colledge he went first into the Service of the Dutchess of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and afterwards to that of <hi>Foulk</hi> Lord <hi>Brook</hi>; after whose Death he apply'd himself to Writing of Plays.

His Patrons <hi>Endimion Porter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iermin</hi> (afterwards Lord St. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi>) got him as a Reward of his Poetry and Services, the Place of Commissioner of the Customs, and a Patent for a Company of Actors, who first set up in the same <hi>Tenniscourt</hi> in <hi>Little Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colns-Inn-Fields,</hi> where they now Act: But finding the good Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the other Company won the Favour of the Town, he set up the Whim of Opera's.

He is a Poet that has met with Applause often above his Merit; tho' in many of his Writings, it must be confe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is generally indeed the sublime, but very rarely the Pathetick; for in all his Plays he has not touch'd Compassion above thrice, and that but weakly; Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror he has often hit on; but 'tis not for me to Censure a Man of no Vulgar Genius; but what is necessary for the making this of a piece in its Impartiality.

                  <p>On the other hand, it must be confess'd, that he has, (where he detects his Thefts) urged a great deal of Truth; for Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> has borrow'd from the <hi>French,</hi> at the same time that he seems
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59606:29"/>
to contemn them; unless it may be pretended, that he has us'd them as <hi>Virgil</hi> did <hi>Ennius</hi> of old, to extract Gold out of their Dung. For I never found him in any Theft indeed, but what he gave a new Lustre too, when taken, ev'n from the best of the Ancients; and I may therefore believe the same of what he has taken from the <hi>French.</hi> I shall not therefore pursue Mr. <hi>Langbain</hi>'s steps in his Excursions; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the Foot of each Play, lay down the places from whence he has borrowed. But the Reader must not expect I shall give him all that he owes for in each Play, for that wou'd exceed the Limits of this Compendium; it must suffice that I give some Instances of each, to put him in mind of his own Deeds, and so mollify his Reflections on those young Men that are now coming up, and who may think it not below them to follow that Path which they have seen Conduct him to so much Glory; of which in their Order.</p>

                     <hi>Cleomenes, The Spartan Heroe,</hi> Trag. 4<hi>to.</hi> Acted at the Theatre Royal, 1692. and Dedicated to the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Rochester,</hi> Knight of the most Noble Order of the Garter: To which is prefix'd the Life of <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> Translated from the <hi>Greek</hi> of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Creech.</hi> This Play was by some Enemies of the Poets, so mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>represented at Court, that it was stop'd; but by the generous Friendship of the late Lord <hi>Falkland,</hi> clear'd from the Aspersions cast on it, and Acted with great Applause. As for the Plot or Story, the Author in his Preface owns it taken from <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and that he has closely followed the Truth as he found it there; only that he has chang'd, for the sake of their sound, some Names, as that of <hi>Agathoclea,</hi> the King's Mistress, into <hi>Cassandra,</hi> and that of <hi>Nicagoras</hi> into <hi>Caenus.</hi> To the Story he has added the Love of <hi>Cassandra</hi> for <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> and has given him a second Wife, which the Story only gave him a small hint for. And indeed our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has trod upon <hi>Plutarch</hi> so close, that the very words of that Author, are Transplanted with little variation, into the Play. You may read more of <hi>Cleomenes</hi> in <hi>Polybius,</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Nepos</hi> in his Life.</p>

                  <p>MR. <hi>Fletcher</hi> was the Son of Dr. <hi>Fletcher,</hi> created Bishop of <hi>Bristol</hi> by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and afterwards translated to the See of <hi>London,</hi> 1593. He dy'd the first year of <hi>Charles</hi> I. of the Plague in <hi>London,</hi> 1625. in his Forty ninth Year, and was Buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in St. <hi>Mary Overy's</hi> Church, <hi>Southwark.</hi> His Colleague in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting most of his Plays, Mr. <hi>Beaumont,</hi> I can say little of, but what the Reader may gather from the Verses of the Poets in that Age, before their Works; that he was a Man of Learning none can question; but to imagine, as Mr. <hi>Langbain</hi> does, that he was perfectly vers'd in the Dramatick Laws, is more than can be drawn from their Plays, of which there is scarce one regular. Their Comedies are much the best; yet of them take away five or six, and they will not bear Acting, scarce reading by a nice Iudge. I say not this to derogate from Men of undoubted Merit, but only prompted by my impartiality, a Character which Mr. <hi>Langbain</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses but has no where preserved. Their Plays are Fifty two in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, all which are Printed and Published in one large Volume Folio, 1679. They follow in Alphabetical Order.</p>

                  <p>THis Lady has very happily distinguish'd her self from the rest of her <hi>Sex,</hi> and gives us a living Proof of what we might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably expect from Womankind, if they had the Benefit of those artificial Improvements of Learning the Men have, when by the meer Force of Nature they so much excel. Rules indeed are but the Leading-strings to support and carry the Weaker, and more unobserving Heads, and which those of a strong Genius and Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration will have no need of, since a just Consideration of Nature will conduct them with more Ease and Success. Of this our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Authress is an evident Proof, for in the Two Plays she has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready published, we find no part of Art wanting, but what is the Mechanick Part, and by much the least valuable. There is a Force and a Fire in her Tragedy, that is the Soul that gives it Life, and for want of which, most of our Modern Tragedies are heavy, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid, unmoving, and dull. In her Comedy there is an easy Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of adding, which confesses a Conversation in the Authress no less genteel and entertaining. This Lady was born in the Isle of <hi>Iersey,</hi> her Father, Sir <hi>Roger Manley,</hi> being then Governor of it; a Gentleman of a double Merit, both the Gown, and the Sword claiming no small share in his Glory, and the Republick of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59606:54"/>
ow'd as much to his Wit and Iudgment, in those Books which he was pleased to publish, as his King and Country to his Loyalty, Valour and Conduct. And well might our <hi>Delarivier</hi> prove a Muse, being begot by such a Father. She has as yet given us but two Plays, of which in their Order:

                           <hi>The Royal Mischief,</hi> a Tragedy, 4<hi>to.</hi> Acted by his Majesty's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, at the Theatre in <hi>Lincolns-Inn-Fields,</hi> 1696. and dedicated to his Grace, <hi>William,</hi> Duke of <hi>Devonshire, &amp;c.</hi> The Story, as she owns, is originally taken from Sir <hi>Iohn Chardin</hi>'s Travels, but has receiv'd this Advantage, that the Criminals are here punish'd for their Guilt, who in the Story escape; a Poetick Iustice, which ought ever to be observed in all Plays; for a Iust Audience could never have been pleas'd with the Prosperity of <hi>Homais,</hi> and <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van,</hi> after so very criminal an Amour. I cou'd here give the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Proof how well the Rules of <hi>Aristotle</hi> are observ'd in this Tragedy, by a Lady who never read him; and how just all her Metaphors and Allegories are: but that wou'd exceed the Bounds I am prescribed by the Model I'm oblig'd to build on.

To this Play is no Epistle Dedicatory, and the Preface informs us of its ill Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, which we cou'd never gather from the reading of it; and if we wou'd, as we ought, give any Allowance for the <hi>Sex</hi> that wrote it, the Time it was wrote in, and its being the first Essay of that Nature, we shou'd agree with her, that it met with a much seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer Fate than it deserved.</item>

                  <p>THE Place of Mr. <hi>Otway</hi>'s Birth I know not; but he was of a good Family, and has a Nephew a Captain in the present Service.

We have in Print of his, ten Plays; another more excellent than all of them, is, by some malicious or designing Person suppress'd, either hereafter to set up a Reputation to themselves, by owning it, or to procure a Profit by selling it for their own.</p>

                     <hi>Amintas,</hi> acted at the Theatre Royal. The Title Page lets us know, that it is taken from the <hi>Aminta</hi> of <hi>Tasso,</hi> and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face informs us of the ill Success it met with on the Stage: which indeed cannot be attributed to the English Author's Performance, which is as well as the Original wou'd allow; but, with Submission to our Author's better Iudgment, I must needs say, that Pastoral it self, tho' never so well writ, is not a Subject fit for so long an Entertainment as that of the Stage. This the Ancients very well knew, and therefore they wisely confin'd it to a narrower Compass, as is evident from the <hi>Idyllia</hi> of <hi>Theocritus,</hi> and the <hi>Bucolics</hi> of <hi>Virgil:</hi> For the sedater Passions (which our Author himself attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to a Shepherd's Life) of these Innocent People represented in a Pastoral, cannot afford so lively Pleasure to an Audience, as may ballance the Length of their Attention, that must of necessity grow languid, and tyr'd, with so very calm an Emotion, which is still kept active by the more violent Passions, proper for Tragedy. This extending of the ancient Pastoral to so unreasonable a length was, as well as <hi>Farce,</hi> an Italian Invention, and not one jot the better, because cover'd with so great a Name as <hi>Tasso</hi>'s. I cou'd never find that Authority wou'd silence the Sentiments of Nature and Reason; and <hi>Tasso,</hi> that has been guilty of Absurdeties enough in his Epic Poem, must not be suppos'd infallible in his Pastoral. After all, I am of Opinion, that it is but a weak Refuge to fly to the Opinion or Taste of a Foreign Nation, from the Iudgment of our own; for I'm satisfy'd that there are not fewer Men of Sence, in <hi>England,</hi> and a great many more of Learning, than <hi>Italy</hi> affords us. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minta</hi> might please there, but if we judge by our Taste of Poetry, and with ours by the Ancients, it pleas'd without Reason, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perhaps for the Novelty, or, which is yet most likely, because it was sung in <hi>Italy,</hi> that Musical Nation minding more the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the Composer, than Poet. All that can be said for our Author is, that in an ill Choice, he has equal'd his Original, and in some Places improv'd it.</p>

Then the Poet seems under another Mistake, in thinking, that because an <hi>Italian</hi> Lady would esteem you a dull, heavy and Phlegmatick Lover, if you should waste time in idle Ceremony and Complement; it is Excuse enough for her yielding so soon in his Play: For if they are such, they are no fitter for a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, than one of our <hi>English</hi> Prostitutes, and can <hi>here</hi> merit no more Pity. And tho' it is an extraordinary thing to make us pity the Guilty, (which I know none but <hi>Otway</hi> could do) yet the Audience must be very Compassionate, to pity so willing an Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery as this; and her Repentance proceeds from Fear, more than a Sense of the Crime, or at least from the seeming Generosity of the Husband, join'd with a Fear of Death. Our Poet is under the same Mistake with other of our modern Writers, who are fond of cruel, barbarous, and bloody Stories, and think no Tragedy can be good, without some Villain in it; but of this elsewhere. As for the <hi>Laconic</hi> Way he effects, I shall only say this, That it was in use only with the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> who were also Masters of their Passions; and never the more natural for being short, for very few Passions, and only some part of them, are to be drawn in that snip<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                           <q>I stand engaged to Mrs. <hi>Behn</hi> for the occasion of a most passionate Distress in my last Play, (which was <hi>The Innocent Adultry</hi>) and in a Conscience that I had not made her a sufficient Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I have run farther into her Debt, with a Design to oblige
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59606:77"/>
me to be Honest, and that every one may find me out for Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, when I don't say all that's fit for me upon that Subject: she had a great Command of the Stage, and I have often won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd that she should bury her Favourite Hero in a Novel, when she might have reviv'd him in the Scene.</q>
I have quoted this, because 'tis very uncommon with Authors to speak well of those they borrow from in their Writings, for I have known a great Man perpetually rail at the French Authors, and yet contradict his Reflections on them, by filling his Writings with their<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But as to this Play of <hi>Oroonoko,</hi> you find our Poet has allow'd the Plot of it Mrs. <hi>Behn's</hi>; for on that Prince she has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the best of her Novels: and as it must be confess'd that the Play had not its mighty Success without an innate Excellence; so in my Opinion, the necessary regularities a Dramatick Poet is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to observe, has left many Beauties in the Novel, which our Author cou'd not transfer to his Poem. As Mrs. <hi>Barrey</hi> did the Poet all the Iustice so admirable an Actress, when she most exerts her self, could do, in the <hi>Innocent Adultery</hi>; so Mr. <hi>Verbruggen,</hi> in the Part of <hi>Oroonoko,</hi> by doing the Author Right, got himself the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of one of the best Actors of his time.</item>

                  <p>THO' this Gentleman's Modesty has hitherto hindred him from setting his Name to any of the Plays that he has Writ, yet they are so Universally known to be his, and own'd by him to the Stage by all other ways, that it cannot reasonably be taken amiss by him, to find his Name here, since it is not in the Power of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to mention it, without the highest Value and Esteem. This Gentleman, as I am informed, was born in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> and by more than a Common Education, and Converse with the best Company qualified for these Performances, which have got him the Prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to all our Modern Writers of Comedy, since Mr. <hi>Wycherly,</hi> and Sir. <hi>George Etheridge</hi> have left the Stage; and with all the due Respect that I owe those two great Men, I must place Mr. <hi>Van Brug</hi> in their Form, for the sprightliness of his Wit, the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>iness, and at the same time, force of the Conversation of his Plays are such, that none else can stand in Competition with him. Methinks in the Comparison of his Plays, with most of our other Drammatic Pieces, there is the same difference, which there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Draughts of <hi>Van Dike, Titian,</hi> and other great Masters of former Days, and some of our best Painters now; these are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59606:80"/>
good Representations, but his are the things they Represent; (if you'll pardon that seeming Contradiction of the Expression) many of our Writers have given us good Images of the Fools of our Age, but they are still but Images; but, when you read or see Mr. <hi>Van Brug</hi>'s, you see the very Originals, all is so free, so easie and so bold, as perswade them to be no Copies, you evidently see the Lineaments of Nature, without the stifness of Art, which would but debase his Work. Others of our Comic Writers, who have succeeded most in that way, pick out Characters that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed diverting enough on the Stage, but which scarce one sensible Man in a Thousand can read in his Chamber, so much is left to the Action: But Mr. <hi>Van Brug</hi>'s Characters are Compos'd of that part of Nature, which is not so Monstrous to shock the Reader, or Nauseate his Palate, but which yield a pleasing Entertainment; he puts Folly into such a Light, that it is as diverting to the Reader as Spectator; and his Fools are so pleasing, that you are not weary of their Company before they leave you.</p>
                  <p>Another Quality distinct from many of our Received Poets, is, That his Men of Wit are really so, and not like Mr. <hi>Shadwell</hi>'s the dullest in the Play: I have ventured to say all this, without either the Prospect of <hi>Encolpius</hi> in <hi>Petronius Arbiter, Vt foris Cena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris Poetam Laudasti,</hi> or the fear of that Wity Censure of <hi>The Plain Dealer,</hi> for <hi>choosing to flatter the Poets of the Age, rather than not flatter at all.</hi> Because one that is unknown, can have but little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of the former, or justly deserve the latter, when he speaks but what is justly his due; unless the Praise of Wit be as unallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as superfluous. He has Honoured his Country with three Plays that he owns: Of these in their Order.</p>

                           <hi>AEsop,</hi> A Comedy 4<hi>to.</hi> Acted at the Theatre Royal, 1697. In the Preface we learn both the Fate of the Play, and that the Author owes his Foundation to the <hi>French</hi>; for it was writ Originally in <hi>French</hi> by Mr. <hi>Boursaut,</hi> and had almost the same Fate there as here, as to its Success; the first day it was not lik'd, the next it scarce gain'd Ground, the third it held up its Head, and the fourth Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed, and was in <hi>Paris</hi> Acted for near a Month together. It is so far from wanting any Beauties of the <hi>French,</hi> that it e'ry where excels it; and that extreamly diverting Scene of Sir <hi>Polydorus Hog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stye,</hi> may be said to be entirely his own, as are all the three Scenes that were since added of the <hi>Players,</hi> the <hi>Senator</hi> and the <hi>Beau,</hi> and which were receiv'd with Universal Applause, as indeed they justly merited. It will perhaps be wondered that it should Act so very often in <hi>Paris,</hi> and not hold out a Fortnight nor ten days here; for which there may be two Reasons Assigned: First, in <hi>Paris</hi> there is not that foolish and extravagant Prejudice against the Stage, as is entertain'd in a numerous Party of this City, who rail against that and Common Prayer with an equal Zeal: So that in
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59606:81"/>
                           <hi>Paris</hi> almost e'ry one goes to the Theatre, here not the tenth part, for Hypocrisie and Business here, divide the greater part to their several and different Offices: Another Reason is, That the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the House were unwilling to wear it out, and so balk'd the Run of it.</p>
                        <p>I am not ignorant of the several Objections made against this Play by the Criticks, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Scenes are loose, and not at all akin to the Plot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> and may be cut out and alter'd in <hi>perpetuum,</hi> without the least Injury or Advantage to the thin and frail Design of the Play; that in <hi>Lydia,</hi> before the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, they talk of Iustices of the Peace, <hi>Fox</hi> Hunting, <hi>Flanders</hi> Horses and other things which are entirely Modern; but at the same time that these Accusations must be confess'd not to be ill grounded; it must be own'd, that without these Faults we must have lost Beauties of greater Consequence. This I'm sure, there has never been on the Stage, a Play of more general Satyr since the <hi>Plain Dealer</hi>; and there are such Publick and useful Morals re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to the Audience, that will be as beneficial to the Common-weal, as diverting to the immediate Spectators.</p>

                        <hi>The Provok'd Wife,</hi> a Comedy 4<hi>to.</hi> Acted at the Theatre in <hi>Little Lincolns-Inn-Fields,</hi> by his Majesty's Servants, 1697. To speak of this Play as I ought, I shou'd have the Pen of the Author who Writ it, and the recommending the Reader to a Perusal of it, is the greatest Praise I can give it. But I cannot omit the Objections I have heard made to it, by some of our Criticks, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is a loose Play, without Design, or if there be a Design, 'tis such a one as the just Rules of Comedy exclude, since it teaches the Wives how they ought to return the Brutality of their Husbands. I cannot by any means allow this Objection; for the Design seems to me as just as the Reflections and Wit of it are poinant, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation lively and genteel; for it rather teaches Husbands how they ought to expect their Wives shou'd make them a Return, if they use them as Sir <hi>Iohn Brute</hi> did his; such Husbands may learn, that slighted and abused Virtue and Beauty, may be provoked to hearken to the prevailing Motives of Revenge. I can never think any reasonable Man shou'd suppose a Woman entirely divested of a sense of Humanity, or insensible either of the Power of an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Temptation, or of the Pleasure it yields: and as most of our Vices are the surest Guard, if not source of our Virtues, I'm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, when the Husbands ill Usage of his Wife deprives himself of her Love, he dismisses the surest Guard of their common Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and the other, that is her Pride and Care of her Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will not be of force enough against Revenge; and the strong sollicitations of an agreeable Person, that demonstrates a value for what the Possessor slights: So that it cannot be deny'd, that this Moral is of admirable Use; and offers a Truth to our considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59606:81"/>
which wou'd often prevent the Ruin of Families, which generally begins with the Husbands Faults. I know of no Thefts in this Play, or indeed any of this Gentlemans, but what he has own'd in his Preface.</item>

This Play was received with mighty applause, and spight of the broken Scenes, which must be allowed an irregularity that might have been avoided, has its just and uncommon Merits; and I think the Character of my Lord <hi>Foppington,</hi> if it at all fall short of that Masterpiece of Sir <hi>Fopling Flutter,</hi> at least challenges the next place, in preference to all of that kind, for the Stage has been almost as Fruitful in <hi>Beaux,</hi> as the Boxes.</item>

His first attempt in the Drammatick way, was not till he was was past Thirty Two Years of Age; and then in about a Month's time, he gave us a Tragedy, call'd, <hi>The Roman Bride's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge</hi>; but of that in its Order: for we must first speak of a Play of the late famous Mrs. <hi>Behn's,</hi> which he introduc'd by the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of a Friend of hers and his, on the Stage: It was called, <hi>The Younger Brother</hi>; or, <hi>the Amorous Iilt</hi>; out of the Respect to her Memory, and a Deference, which was too nice, to her Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he durst not make any Alterations in it, but what were absolutely necessary, and those only in the first and second Act, which reflected on the <hi>Whigs</hi>; when if he had alter'd the jejune Stile of the three last Acts, betwixt Prince <hi>Frederick</hi> and <hi>Mirtilla,</hi> which was too heavy, in all Probability it would have been more to the Advantage of his Purse. But now I shall proceed to his own Plays, which are two in Number; the first in our Alphabeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Order, is,

Tho' it was a very bold Undertaking of a Young Author, to attempt to bring so very different a way of Writing on so corrupt a Stage as ours; yet the Success justified his Opinion, that the Irregular, Prophane, and Obscene Plays took only because our Audience saw no other, through the Poets Fault. The Plot, and a great many of the Beauties of the Play, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor fairly owns that he has taken from the <hi>Medea</hi> of <hi>Euripides</hi>;

                           <hi>The Roman Bride's Revenge,</hi> a Tragedy, acted at the Theatre Royal, 1697. 4<hi>to.</hi> dedicated by the Bookseller to <hi>William Gregory,</hi> 
                           <abbr>Esq</abbr> This Play was our Author's first; and as it was writ in a Month, so it had the Fate of those untimely Births, as hasty a Death. Tho' notwithstanding the Faults of this Play, which must be confess'd numerous enough, there is so much Merit in the First, and part of the Second Act, and the Beauty of the Catastro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe, that if the Voice of the Town had not been influenc'd by the Ill Representation, it must have met with a less rigorous Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. But the Author's Faults lie generally in the Stile, and the Incidents of the Third and Fourth Acts. The Stile is too near an Imitation of Mr. <hi>Lees</hi> (the worst Qualification of that Poet, who had Beauties enough to make amends for it) I mean in many Places, for in others 'tis Iust enough. The Incidents were too numerous, and not so distinct as to be well discern'd by the Audience, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Fourth Act. Tho' I think there is no Incident in this Play so unnatural, as some of our celebrated Plays are esteem'd for; and then the Confusion of the Action contributed to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them seem less prepar'd. The Plot I take to be of the Author's own Invention, allowing for a Hint taken from <hi>Camma</hi> of <hi>Galata,</hi> which is thus far improv'd, that the Husband here is alive after the Wife has drank the Poison, which heightens the Distress of the Chief Characters. But the Moral is one of the most noble of any of our Modern Plays, it being to give us an Example in the Punishment of <hi>Martian,</hi> that no Consideration in the World, ought to make us delay the Service of our Country.</item>

The Story, he tells you, is taken from the fourth or fifth Page of <hi>Machiavel</hi>'s History of <hi>Florence</hi>; and he seems sensible, that the Characters of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boino,</hi> and <hi>Rosamund</hi> are not agreeable to the present Taste of the Town; and that Sir <hi>William D'Avenant</hi> has writ a Play on the same Subject.</p>

It was reviv'd in 1692. and dedicated by the Anonymous Reviver to the Earl of <hi>Clincarty.</hi> Tho' I cannot, with the Reviver, say 'tis the best Tragedy this Age has produc'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is far from being so; yet this I can justly say, That the Character of <hi>Sciarrah</hi> is very well drawn, and distinguish'd through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Play; and so is that of <hi>Lorenzo.</hi> As for the Plot, 'tis very irregular, and consists of various Actions; tho' the Poet's Design seems to aim at a very good Moral. The strange Humour that has too long reign'd in our English Poets, misled the Author, I suppose, to the Choice of such barbarous and bloody Murders, to fill up his Play; which however frequent and tollerable in <hi>Italy,</hi> have nothing to do here. Murther is too great a Crime to see voluntarily committed on our Stage; the Law punishes it with Ignominy, tho' the Poet has nothing to do with it, I meanby Right. This Play has gone for <hi>Shirley</hi>'s.</p>

This Play is an Argument of the Strange Chance of Plays, when so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digested a heap could be tollerably received; and I think 'tis a great Argument against those judges who receive and permit the Plays to be acted: For I am unwilling that the Nakedness of our Country should be discover'd; that is, that an Audience cou'd bear such as this, and some other of a Modern Date. The Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters now (I mean all that attempt Writing) think if they can make a horrid Character or two in a Play, and some bloody and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Incidents, they can presently write a Tragedy, never reflecting

that a Poet is not to be a Hangman, he is not to rival <hi>Iack Ketch</hi> in his Office, and rob the publick Executioners of their Business, by ending a Criminal privately, who ought to have a Publick and most infamous Execution. Where the Laws condemn a Villain to the Gibbet, the Poet has nothing to do, such Characters are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Stage, and ought to appear no where but on the Cart, and in the Ordinary's Paper.
