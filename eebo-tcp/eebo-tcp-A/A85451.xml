            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

day of <hi>July</hi> laſt; of whoſe actions and confeſſions I ſhall
give you a few particulars, but thoſe you will confeſſe,
very rare and remarkable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anne Aſhby</hi> alias <hi>Cobler,</hi> who was the chief Actreſſe,
and who had the greateſt part in this Tragedy, and
<hi>Anne Martyn,</hi> confeſſed at the time of their triall, that
the Divell had known them carnally, and that they had
no hurt by it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:114722:3"/>
The ſaid <hi>Aſhby</hi> alias <hi>Cobler,</hi> in view of this Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
fell into an extaſie before the Bench, and ſwell'd
into a monſtrous and vaſt bigneſs, ſcreeching and crying
out very dolefully; and being recovered, and demanded
if the Divell at that time had poſſeſſed her, ſhe replyed
ſhe knew not that, but ſhe ſaid that the ſpirit <hi>Rug</hi> came
out of her mouth like a Mouſe.</p>
            <p>And further concerning this ſpirit <hi>Rug,</hi> it is reported,
that the ſaid <hi>Aſhby</hi> alias <hi>Cobler</hi> being under Examination
before a Juſtice of Peace, before whom ſhe was carried
by certain Souldiers of Colonell <hi>Humfreys</hi> Regiment;
at the ſame time of her examination, a certain Groom
that was in preſence ſaid come <hi>Rug</hi> into my mouth,
which Groom, as it is reported, died within a fortnight
after, near unto the City of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Anne Aſhby</hi> further confeſſed, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
had given them a piece of fleſh, which whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they ſhould touch, they ſhould thereby affect their
deſires.</p>
            <p>That this fleſh lay hid amongſt graſſe, in a certain
place which ſhe named, where upon ſearch it was found
accordingly.</p>
            <p>This fleſh was of a ſinnewy ſubſtance, and ſcorched,
and was ſeen and felt by this Obſervator, and reſerved
for publique view, at the ſign of the Swan in <hi>Maidſtone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Anne Aſhby, Anne Martyn,</hi> and one other
of their Aſſociates, after they were caſt, and upon the
pronunciation of Judgement againſt them, pleaded that
they were with child pregnant, but confeſſed it was
not by any man, but by the Divell.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Dock</hi> of <hi>Greſham,</hi> alias <hi>Creſham,</hi> Doctor to <hi>Anne
Aſhby,</hi> is committed to cloſe impriſonment, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114722:3"/>
to ſpeak with any perſon, without the preſence
of his Keeper.</p>
            <p>A Pin being thruſt to the head into one of their arms,
the party did not feele it, neither did it draw bloud
from her, which was <hi>Mary Browne, Anne Wilſon,</hi> or
<hi>Mildred Wright.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mary Read</hi> of <hi>Lenham</hi> had a viſible Teat under her
tongue, and did ſhew it to many, and it was likewiſe
ſeen by this Obſervator.</p>
            <p>It is likewiſe to be noted, that the aforeſaid <hi>Anne
Aſhby,</hi> alias <hi>Cobler,</hi> during the time of her extaſie, when
ſhe ſwell'd in that prodigious manner before mentioned,
uttered many ſpeeches which did greatly amaze and
aſtoniſh the Auditory, proceeding from her in that
manner, of which there was no ſmall number of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
in ſo great and generall a confluence of people,
ſome of which the Obſervator remembreth, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears
at preſent to ſet down the particulars.</p>
            <p>So upon the proceedings aforeſaid, and the evidences
brought in againſt them, the ſaid <hi>Anne Aſhby,</hi> alias
<hi>Cobler, Anne Martyn, Mary Browne, Anne Wilſon,</hi> and
<hi>Mildred Wright</hi> of <hi>Cranbrook,</hi> and <hi>Mary Read</hi> of <hi>Lenham,</hi>
being legally convicted, were according to the Laws of
this Nation, adjudged to be hanged, at the common
place of Execution.</p>
            <p>Some there were that wiſhed rather they might be
burnt to Aſhes; alledging, that it was a received opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
amongſt many, that the body of a Witch being
burnt, her bloud is prevented thereby from becomming
hereditary to her Progeny in the ſame evill, which by
hanging is not; but whether this opinion be erroneous,
or not, I am not to diſpute.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:114722:4"/>
Beſides theſe former ſix condemned Witches, there
were at the ſame time ſome others of <hi>Greanes</hi> Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
who although ſentence of death did not then paſſe
againſt them, yet one whoſe name was <hi>Creed,</hi> was by
three ſeverall Indictments found guilty by the Grand
Jury, conſiſting of perſons of good integrity, and eſtates.
And in the aforeſaid black Liſt, were muſtred one <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds,</hi>
and one <hi>Wilſon,</hi> with both their Wives.</p>
            <p>It is ſuppoſed that nine children, beſides a man and a
woman, were bewitched; 500 pounds worth of Cattel
loſt, and much Corn at Sea wrack'd, by Witchcraft.</p>
            <p>They confeſſed they had bewitched a child, that had
been languiſhing along time; this child died about the
time of their trials, whoſe pourtraicture in wax was
found, where they had laid it, under the Threſhold of
a doore.</p>
            <p>To this diſcourſe the bodies of three Children lately
found at <hi>Chatham,</hi> may have ſome reference, which
however it will not be much amiſſe to inſert here; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be doubtfull, whether their deaths be to be
attributed to Sorcery, or any other violent means; two
of theſe bodies appeared but in part, the reſt being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed;
the third was the entire body of a Male-child,
having a Navell five inches long.</p>
            <p>And here you may obſerve the helliſh and infernall
eſtate of thoſe wretched deluded people, calld Witches,
whom their Grand-maſter the Devill, at one time or
other leaves in the lurch; as here you may perceive in
the Story of theſe miſerable Wretches, who deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
received the Sentence of Condemnation, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd;
for it is written, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſuffer a Witch to live.</hi>

            <head>A true Relation of one Mrs. Atkins, a Mercers Wife
in Warwick, who was ſtrangely carried away from
her houſe in July laſt, and hath not been
heard of ſince.</head>
            <p>IN <hi>Warwick</hi> Town one Mrs. <hi>Katherine Atkins,</hi> a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
Wife, ſtanding at her door on Saturday night, the 24.
<hi>July,</hi> 1652. A certain unknown Woman came to her and ſayd,
Miſtris, pray give me two-pence, ſhe anſwered, two-pences are
not ſo plentifull, and that ſhe would give her no Mony. Pray
Miſtris, ſayd ſhe, then give me that Pin, ſo ſhe took the Pin off
her ſleeve and gave her, for which ſhe was very thankfull, and
was going away. Miſtris <hi>Atkins</hi> ſeeing her ſo thankfull for a
Pin, called her again, and told her if ſhe would ſtay, ſhe would
fetch ſome Victuals for her, or give her ſome thread, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
out of the ſhop. She anſwered, ſhe would have nothing
elſe, and bid a pox of her Victuals, and ſwore (by God) ſaying,
You ſhall be an hundred miles off within this week, when you
ſhall want two-pence as much as I, and ſo ſhe went grumbling
away.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the ſayd Miſtris <hi>Atkins</hi> was much troubled in
mind, and did adviſe with ſome Friends what were beſt to be
done in ſuch a caſe, but receiving no reſolution from any one
what to do, ſhe attended the Event what might befall within
ſuch a time, and upon the 29. of <hi>July,</hi> ſhe expreſt to a Kinſman
Mr. <hi>Nicholas Bikar,</hi> that ſhe was much troubled about the
foreſayd buſineſſe, but hoped the time was ſo near expired, that
it would come to nothing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:114722:5"/>
But the ſayd Thurſday night betwixt the houres of 8. and 9.
She going into the Shop, and returning thence in the Entry ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
to the ſayd Shop, ſhe was immediately gone, by what
means and whither we do not know, nor can we hear of upon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
made to this preſent.</p>
            <p>The deſire of her Husband and Friends is of all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of this Nation, That if they hear of any ſuch party in ſuch
a loſt condition as is before expreſſed: That there may be ſpeedy
notice given thereof to her Husband in <hi>Warwick,</hi> and that
all convenient proviſions both of Horſe and mony may be made
for the conveying of her to the place aforeſayd, and ſuch as
ſhall take pains, or be at expences herein ſhall be ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced

            <p>It's likewiſe deſired that the Miniſters in <hi>London,</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
