            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

imperfect picture, which the king thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accepted, not that he liked the work, but
that he loued the art. The paltering Poet
Cherillus dedicated his duncing Poems to that mightie
Monarch Alexander, saying that he knew assuredly if A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander
would not accept them in that they were not pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie,
yet he would not vtterly reiect them, in that they had
a shew of Poetrie. Caesar oft times praised his souldiers
for their will, although they wanted skill: and Cicero as
well commended stammering Lentulus for his painfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie,
as learned Laelius for his passing eloquence. Which
considered (although wisdome did will mee not to straine

hoping your Lordship will deigne to accept the matter in
that it seemeth to be prose, though some thing vnsauory
for want of skill, and take my wel meaning for an excuse
of my boldnesse, in that my poore wil is not in the wane,

<pb facs="tcp:6132:3"/>

it was his chiefe studie to search out the nature of
stones. All that courted to Atlanta were hunters, and
none sued to Sapho but Poets. Wheresoeuer Maecanas
lodgeth, thether no doubt will schollers flocke. And your
honour being a worthie fauourer and fosterer of learning,
hath forced many through your exquisite vertue, to offer
the first fruits of their studie at the shrine of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
curtesie. But though they haue waded farre &amp; found
mines, and I gadded abroad to get nothing but Mites, yet
this I assure my selfe, that they neuer presented vnto your
Honour their treasure with a more willing minde, then I
doo this simple trash, which I hope your Lordship

Fancie.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here dwelled in the Citie of <hi>Metelyne</hi> a
certaine Duke called <hi>Clerophontes,</hi> who
through his prowesse in al martiall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits
waxed so proud &amp; tyrannous, vsing
such mercilesse crueltie to his forraine eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and such modelesse rigour to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
Citizens, that it was doubtfull whether he was
more feared of his foes for his crueltie, or hated of his
friends for his tyrannie: yet as the worst wéede spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
vp more brauely then the wholesomest hearbe, and
as the crookedst trée is commonly laden with most fruit,
so this rigorous Duke was so fauoured and fostered vp
by fortune, his estate béeing so established with honour,
and so beautified with wealth, so deckt with the diadem
of dignitie, and endued with fortunate prosperitie, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
in warres such happie successe against his foes, &amp; in
peace such dutifull reuerence of his friendes, (although
more for feare then fauor) as he seemed to want nothing
that eyther fortune or the fates could allowe him, if one
onely sore which bred his sorrowe coulde haue bene sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
But this griefe so galled his conscience, and this
cursed care so combred his mind, that his happinesse was
greatly surcharged with heauinesse, to sée the cause of his
care could by no meanes be cured. For this <hi>Clerophon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
was indued with two children, the one a Daughter
named <hi>Lewsippa,</hi> and the other a sonne called <hi>Gwydo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:6132:5"/>
this <hi>Lewcippa</hi> was so perfect in the complection of
her bodie, and so pure in the constitution of her minde,
so adorned with outwarde beautie, and endued with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
bountie, so pollished with rare vertues and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
qualities, as she séemed a séemely <hi>Venus</hi> for her beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and a second <hi>Vesta</hi> for her virginitie; yea, Nature
and the Gods had so bountifullye bestowed their giftes
vpon her, as Fame her selfe was doubtfull whether shée
should make greater report of her excellent vertue, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
beautie. But his sonne <hi>Guydonius</hi> was so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to his sister <hi>Lewsippa,</hi> (though not in the state of
his bodie, yet in the stay of his minde) as it made all men
meruaile how two such contrarie stems could spring out
of the selfe same stocke: His personage indéede was so
comely, his feature so well framed, each lim so perfectlye
couched, his face so faire, and his countenance so amiable,
as he séemed a heauenly creature in a mortall carcasse.
But his minde was so blemished with detestable qualy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and so spotted with the staine of voluptuousnesse,
that he was not so much to be commended for the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his bodie, as to bée condempned for the imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his minde. He was so endued with vanitie, and so
imbrued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vice, so nursed vp in wantonnesse, &amp; so nus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
vp in wilfulnesse, so carelesse to obserue his Fathers
commaund, and so retchlesse to regard his counsell, that
neither the dreade of Gods wrath, nor the feare of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
displeasure, could driue him to desist from his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable
kinde of liuing. Nay, there was no fact so filthy,
which he would not commit, no mischiefe so monstrous,
which he wold not enterprise: no daunger so desperate,
which he would not aduenture: no perill so fearefull,
which he would not performe: nor no action so diuellish,
which he would not execute. So immodest in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
so rude in his iestures, yea, and so prodigall in his
expences, as mines of golde were not able to maintaine
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:6132:5"/>
such witlesse prodigalitie. This loathsome lyfe of <hi>Cwy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius</hi>
was such a cutting corasiue to his Fathers care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
conscience, and such a haplesse clogge to his heauie

children shall neuer liue without some myrth, nor dye

haue cause whereof to reioyce, if vicious, wherefore to be
sad, which saying I trie performed in my selfe, for as I
haue one childe which delights me with her vertue, so I
haue another that despights me with his vanitie, as the
one by dutie brings me ioye, so the other by disobedience
bréeds my annoy: yea, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one is a comfort to my mind,

griefe is there more griping, what paine more pinching,
what crosse more combersome, what plague more perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
yea, what trouble can torment me worse, then to
sée my sonne, mine heire, the inheritour of my Dukdome,
which should be the piller of my parentage, to consume
his time in roysting and ryot, in spending and spoiling,
in swearing and swashing, and in following wilfullye
the furie of his owne frantike fancie. Alasse, most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

Citizens, of the outragious behauiour of his sonne
<hi>Gwydonius,</hi> which being attentiuely heard, he in great
cholar called for his sonne, against whom he thundered
out such threatning reproches, laying before his face the
miserie that would insue of such recklesse mischiefes, &amp;
promising that if he directed not his course by a newe
compasse, and leuelled his life by a new line, he woulde
not onely repay his folly with the penaltie of the lawe,
but also by consent of his Commons, disinherite him of
his Dukedome: that <hi>Gwydonius</hi> greatly incensed with

            <p>
               <hi>Clerophontes</hi> no sooner heard this determination of
his sonne <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> but his sorrow was halfe salued,
and his care almost cured, thinking that by trauell hée
should either ende his life or amend his lewdnesse, and
therefore both hearted and hastened his sonne in this his
newe course, least delay might bréede daunger, or time
by some toye cause him tourne his tippet, furnishing &amp;
finishing all things necessarie for his sonnes iourney,
who readie to goe (more willing to trauell, than his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            </p>
            <p>SOnne (quoth he) there is no greater doubt which doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
more déepely distresse the minde of a young man,
then to determine with himselfe what course of life is
best to take, for there is such a confused <hi>Chaos</hi> of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
conceipts in young wits, that whiles they looke for
that they cannot like, they are lost in such an endles La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berinth,
as neither choice nor chance can draw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out to
their wished desires, for so manie vaines so many vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
if vertue draweth one way, vice driueth another

to take this, fancie forceth them to choose that: so that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
so long hangs in doubt, as either they choose none, or
els chaunce on the worst. But in my opinion, the fittest
kind of life for a young Gentleman to take (who as yet
hath not subdued the youthfull conceipts of fancie, nor
made a conquest of his will by witte) is to spende his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:6132:7"/>

For what chaungeth vanitie to vertue, staylesse
wit to stayed wisedome, fonde fantasies to firme affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

redresseth the witlesse furie of wanton yeares, but tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell:
what tourneth a secure life to a carefull lyuing,
what maketh the foolish wise, yea, what increaseth wit
and augmenteth skill, but trauell: in so much that the
fame <hi>Vlysses</hi> wonne, was not by the tenne yeares hee
laye at <hi>Troy,</hi> but by the time he spent in trauell. But
there is nothing <hi>Gwydonius</hi> so precious which in some
respecte is not perillous, nor nothing so pleasaunt
which maye not be painefull: the finest golde hath hys
drosse, the purest wine his lées, the brauest rose his pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles,
each swéete hath his sower, each ioye his annoy,
each weale his woe, and euerie delyght his daunger.
So trauaile <hi>Gwydonius</hi> is a course of life verie plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
and yet very perillous, wherin thou mayst practise
vertue if thou take héede, or purchase discredite if thou

honour &amp; shame, according to the dispotion of him which

defence himselfe with the target of vertue, vnlesse hée

First <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> be not too sumptuous least thou seeme

shew thy selfe to be an olde man for thy grauitie, and a

thy wit, a molester of thy minde, a besotter of thy sences,
and finally a mortall bane to all thy body, so that thou
shalt find pleasure the pathway to perdition, and lusting
Loue the load-stone to ruth and ruine. Séeke not then

the peaceable gouernment of his Dukedome, administe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
iustice with such sinceritie, and yet tempering the

the good will of straungers in hearing his vertue, &amp;
wonne the heartes of his subiectes in féeling his bountie,

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6132:11"/>
Fortune and the fates willing to place him in the
pallace of earthly prosperitie, endued him with two
children, the one a sonne named <hi>Thersandro,</hi> &amp; the other
a Daughter called <hi>Castania,</hi> eyther of them so adorned
with the giftes of Nature, and beautified with good nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as it was hard to knowe whether beautie or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
held the supremacie. But least by this happie estate
<hi>Orlanio</hi> should be too much puffed vp with prosperitie,
Fortune sparing him the mate, yet gaue him a slender
checke, to warne him from securitie, for before his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
came to the age of fourtéene yéeres, his wife dyed, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
him not more sorrowfull for the losse of her whom
he most entirely loued, then carefull for the well bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vp of her whome he so déerely lyked. Knowing that
as his Court was a Schoole of vertue to such as brideled
their mindes with discreation, so it was a nurse of vice
to those tender yéeres that measured theyr willes wyth
witlesse affection, estéeming lybertie as perillous to the
staie of youth, as precious to the state of age, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so soone allured the minde of a younge maide to
vanitie, as to passe her youth without feare in securitie.
Feared with the consideration of these premisses, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde
the inconueniences that might happen by suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<hi>Castania</hi> to leade her lyfe in lawlesse libertie, hée
thought it best to choose out some vertuous Ladie to
keepe her companie, who might directe her course by so
true a compasse, and leuell her lyfe by so right a lyne,
that although her young yeares were verie apt to bée
intangled in the snares of vanitie, yet by her counsell &amp;
companie, shée might steddelye tread her steppes in the
trace of vertue, and none hée coulde finde more fitte for
the purpose then a certaine olde Widdowe, called Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
<hi>Melytta,</hi> honored for her vertuous life throughout

greate praise, but wonne greate credite through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all the Countrie. Insomuch that I incensed by this
thy singular commendation, I haue selected thee as the

            <p>FIrst <hi>Melytta,</hi> so that shée leade her lyfe both chary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye

least shée prooue too wilfull, nor too much lybertie, least
shee become too lyght. The Palme trée pressed downe,
groweth notwythstanding but too faste. The Hearbe
<hi>Spattania,</hi> though troden on, groweth verie tall, and
youth although stricktlye restrained wyll prooue but too
stubburne.</p>
            <p>The vessell sauoureth alwayes of that lycour
wherewith it was first seasoned, and the minde retay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
those qualyties in age wherein it was trayned vp
in youth. The tender twigge is sooner broken then the
strong braunch, the young stemme more brittle then the
olde stocke, the weake Bramble shaken with eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
Winde, and the wauering wyll of youth tossed

with euerie puffe of vanitie, readie to be wracked in the
waues of wantonnesse, vnlesse it be cunningly guided
by some wise and warie Pylot.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Melytta,</hi> youth is so easily intrapped with the
alluring traine of foolish delights, and so soone intangled
with the trash of pernitious pleasures, suffer not my
daughter to passe her time in idlenesse, least happily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken at discouert, she become a carelesse captiue to
securitie (for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the mind once floteth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> surging seas
of idle conceits, then the puffes of voluptuous pleasures,
and the stiffeling stormes of vnbridled fancie, the raging
blasts of alluring beautie, and the sturdy gale of glozing
vanitie, so shake the ship of recklesse youth, that it is dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in doubt to suffer most daungerous shipwracke. But
let her spend her time in reading such auncient authors
as may sharpen her wit by their pithie sayings, &amp; learne
her wisedome by their perfect sentences. For where na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is vicious, by learning it is amended, and where it
is vertuous, by skill it is augmented. The stone of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
vertue is of greater price if it be brauely polished,
th golde though neuer so pure of himselfe, hath the better
coulour if it be burnished, and the minde though neuer
so vertuous, is more noble if it be inriched with the gifts
of learning. And <hi>Melytta</hi> for recreation sake, let her vse
such honest sportes as may driue awaie dumps, least she
be too pensiue, &amp; frée her mind from foolish conceites, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> she

            <p>TYE report (right worthie Prince) of your incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

Sorcerie, that as the Elephant reioyceth greatly at the

the surpassing beautie of <hi>Castania,</hi> yea, his onely blisse,

<hi>Castania.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is harde <hi>Signor Valericus</hi> (quoth she) to take you
either without your Hawke on your fiste, or your
heart on your halfepenie, for if for recreation you be not
retriuing the Partridge with dogs, you are in solemne
meditation driuing away the time with dumpes, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
caring for companie to solace your sadnesse, nor ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly
discoursing of some amorous <hi>Parle:</hi> which makes
the Gentlewomen of this Court thinke, that you are
either an Apostata to Loue, as was <hi>Narcyssus,</hi> or haue
displayed the flagge of defiaunce against Fancie, as did
<hi>Tyanaeus.</hi> If these their surmised coniectures be true
<hi>Valericus,</hi> I warne thée as a friend to beware by other
mens harmes, least if thou imitate their actions, thou be
mangled with the like miserie, or maymed with the like
misfortune.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valericus</hi> hearing his Saint pronouncing this su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred
harmonie, féeling himselfe somewhat toucht with
this quipping talke, was so rapte in admiration of
<pb facs="tcp:6132:16"/>
her eloquence, and so rauisht in the contemplation of hir
beautie, that he stoode in a maze not able to vtter on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
word, vntil at last gathering his wits together, he burst
foorth into these speaches.</p>
            <p>MAdame (quoth he) what it pleaseth the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of this Court to surmise of my solytarinesse I
knowe not, but if they attribute it too curiousnesse, or
coynesse to strangenesse, or statelinesse, either that I am
an enimie to loue, or a foe to fancie, that I detest theyr
bountie with <hi>Narcissus,</hi> or contempne their beautie with
<hi>Tiancus,</hi> they offer me great iniurie, so rashly to coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of my disease, before rightly they haue cast my wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
But to put your Ladiship out of doubt what is the
cause of my dumpes, so it is that of late raunging the
fieldes, my heart (my hawke I shoulde say Madame) ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
at such a princely pray, and yet myst of her flight,
that since she hath neither prunde her selfe, nor I taken
anye pleasure. Marie if the fates should so fauour me, or
fortune so shrowde me vp in prosperitie, that my desire
might obtayne her wish, I would not onely change my
mourning to mirth, my dolour to delight, and my care
to securitie, but I would thinke to haue gotten as rich
a pray as euer <hi>Caesar</hi> gaind by conquest.</p>
            <p>SUrely Signor <hi>Valericus</hi> (quoth <hi>Melitta</hi>) no doubt the
pray is passing princely, since the valew thereof is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at so precious a price, and therefore we haue neither
cause to condempne your Hawke of haggardnesse, for
want of pruning, nor you of foolyshnesse for want of
pleasure. And if your heart (your hawke I should saye
Signor <hi>Valericus</hi>) hath reacht farther with her eye, than
she is able to mount with her wing, although I am no
skilfull Fawlconer, yet I thinke you had better kéepe
her on the fist still and so féede her with hope, then let her
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:6132:16"/>
misse agayne of her flyght, and so she tourne tayle and
bée foyled.</p>
            <p>In déede Madame (quoth <hi>Valericus</hi>) your counsaile
is very good, for as there is no better consect to a crazed
minde, than hope, so there is no greater corasiue to a
carefull man than despaire, and the Fawlchoners also
iumpe with you in the same verdite, that the Hawke
which misseth her praye, is doubtfull to soare aloofe and
prooue haggard. Yet if she were so tickle, as she would
take no stande, so ramage as she woulde be reclaymed
with no lure, I had rather happely hazarde her for the
gayning of so péerelesse a praye, though I both lost her
and wanted of my wish: than by kéeping her still in
the Bynes to prooue her a kyte, or me a coward.</p>
            <p>In déede Sir (quoth <hi>Castania</hi>), Fortune euer fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
them that are valyant, and things the more hard,
the more haughtie, hie and heauenly: neyther is anye
thing harde to be accomplished, by him that hardelye
enterpriseth it. But yet take héede that you fishe not
so fayre, that at length you catche a Frogge, and then
repentaunce make you mumble vp a masse with <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No Madame (quoth he) it is neuer séene that hée
which is contented with his chaunce, should euer haue
cause to repent him of his choyce.</p>
            <p>And yet (quoth she) hée that buyes a thing to déere
maye be content with his chaffer, and yet wish he had
bene more chaire.</p>
            <p>Truth Madame, (quoth <hi>Valericus</hi>) but then it is
trash and no treasure, for that which is precious is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ouerprised, and a bad thing though neuer so cheape
is thought too chargeable.</p>
            <p>Oh Sir (quoth <hi>Melytta</hi>) and is it not an old say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that a man maye buye golde too deare, and that
Iewells, though neuer so precious maye bée set at too
<pb facs="tcp:6132:17"/>
high a price. I sée if you had no better skill in manning
of a Hawke, than in making of a bargaine, you would
prooue but an ill Fawlchoner. But since we haue so
long troubled you with our talk, we wil now leaue you
to your sport, and so bid you farewell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valericus</hi> with a courteous <hi>Conge</hi> repaying theyr
courtesie, and with a glauncing eye giuing hys God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse
the dolefull <hi>A dio,</hi> went solytarily into the secret
woods, wher laying him downe in the shade, he fell into
these musing meditations.</p>
            <p>WHat greater prosperitie (quoth he) can happen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any earthlye wight, than if he be crossed with
care, to finde a confect to cure his calamitie: then if hée
be pinched with paines, to get a playster for his passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
if he be drenched in distresse, to finde a meanes to
mitigate his miserye, which I sée by proofe perfourmed
in my seelye selfe: for the sight of my Goddesse hath so
salued my fore-passed sorrowes, her sweete words
hath so healed my heauye woundes, that where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I was plunged in perplexitie, I am nowe placed
in felicitie: where before I was oppressed with care, I
am now refreshed with comfort. O friendly Fortune,
if from hencefoorth thou furiouslye frowne vppon mée,
if thou daunt me with disaster mishappe, or crosse mée
with perpetuall care, yet this thy friendlye courtesie
shall bée sufficient to counteruayle all future enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes.</p>
            <p>But alas, I sée euery prosperous puffe hath his boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous

annexed: the bloud of the Uiper is most health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:6132:17"/>
for the sight, and most hurtfull for the stomacke, the
stone <hi>Celonites</hi> is very precious for the backe, and very
perillous to the braine: the flower of <hi>India</hi> pleasaunt to
be séene, but who so smelleth to it, féeleth present smart:
so as the ioye of her presence procureth my delight, the

my fancie with affection, that she wil not consent to my
request, but rather meanes to stiffle me with the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
stormes of repulse, and daunt me with the doome
of deadly denialles, so fretteth my haplesse minde with
hellish furie, that no plague, no paine, no torment, no
torture can worse molest me, than to be distressed with
this dreadfull despaire.</p>
            <p>Alas, her callyng is too high for me to clymbe vnto,
her royall state is farre aboue my reach, her haughtie
minde is too loftie for me to aspyre: no doubt if I offer
my sute vnto her she will prooue like the Stone of <hi>Sili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi>
which the more it is beaten the harder it is: or like
the spices of <hi>Ionia,</hi> which the more they are pounded the

foorth no iuyce though neuer so well brused: so,
though I shoulde with neuer so great deuotion offer vp
at her Shrine, prayers, promises, sighes, sobbes, teares,
troth, faith, fréedome, yea, and my heart it selfe, as a
pledge to pleade for pitie, yet she would make so small

            </p>
            <p>But oh vilde wretch that I am, why doo I thus with

How frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, how familiarly, yea how faithfully did she
talke with me, what a chéerefull countenaunce did shée
carrie towardes me, what sodaine glaunces, what loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lookes, which no doubt are signes that though she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse

though she be straight in words, she wil not be strange
in minde: though she giue me some bitter pilles of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall,
it shall be but for the better tryall. And shall I
then béeing fedde with this hope prooue such a meacocke
or a milkesoppe as to be feared with the tempestuous
Seas of aduersitye, when as at lenghth I shall arriue
at the Hauen of happie estate: shall I dread to haue
my shippe shaken with some angrie blastes, hoping to
bee safelye landed on the shoare, and so haue my share
of that, which the showers of shrewde Fortune for a

non gustauit amara.</hi> Hee is not worthye to sucke the
swéete, which hath not first sauoured the sower: hée
is not worthie to eate the kernell which hath not crackt

which hath not abidde the brunt of the Battaile:
he meriteth not to possesse the praye, whih will not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyngly

            <p>
               <hi>VAlericus</hi> thus mittigating his paine with the milde
medicine of hope, and rooting out the dead flesh of
despayre with the Playster of trust, determyned to
stryke on the Stythe whyle the yron was hotte, and
to pursue his purpose whyle his Mystresse was in
her good moode. And therefore leauing his sporte
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:6132:18"/>
for this time, hied him to the Court in hast: where insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating
himselfe into the societie of the Ladies and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen,
hée shewed himselfe in sport so pleasaunt, in

in <hi>parle</hi> so pithie, &amp; in all his conuersation so come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that whereas before hée was specially loued of none,
now he was generally lyked of all: insomuch that for a
time there was no talke in the Court but of the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphosis
of <hi>Valericus</hi> minde. Who often times deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
in plaine tearmes to present his sute to <hi>Castania,</hi>
when he came to the point, feare of offence and dreade of
deniall, disappointed his purpose, that he remained mute
in the matter: but at last perceiuing delaie bred daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
séeing his mistresse sit alone in his presence, houering
betwéene feare and hope, he began the assault with this
march.</p>
            <p>MAdame (quoth hée) for that I sée you sitting thus so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie
in dumps<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am the bolder to prease in place,
although the most vnworthie man to supplie it. Hoping
you will pardon my rudenesse for troubling thus rashly
your musing meditations, and count my companie the
lesse offensiue in that I sée you busied with no such sery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
matters whervnto my presence may be greatly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall.
<hi>Cyneas</hi> the Philosopher, Madame, was of this
minde, that when the Gods made beautie, they skipt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
their skill, in that they framed it of greater force
then they themselues were able to resist, if then there is
none so wise or worthie whome beautie cannot wracke,
nor none issued of such princely birth, whom beutie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bend, though I haue bene intangled with the snare
of fancie, and haue listened to the lure of beautie, I am
the more to be borne with, and the lesse to bée blamed.
For I must of force confesse Madame, that the giftes of
nature so abundauntly bestowed vpon you, your excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb facs="tcp:6132:19"/>
beutie and exquisite vertue, haue so scaled the wals
of my fancie, and sacked the fort of my fréedome, that for
my last refuge I am forced to appeale vnto your cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie,
as the onely medicine which may cure my intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
disease. Nay incurable I may well call it, for (I
speake with teares outwardly, and droppes of bloud in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly)
vnlesse the missing showers of your mercye
mittigate the fire of my fancie, the drops of your prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fauour quench the flame of my affection, and the
guerdon of your good will giue a soueraigne Playster
for my secrete sore, I am lyke to passe my lyfe in more
miserie, then if I had taken the infernall tormentes.
But I hope it is not possible, that out of a Sugered
Fount shoulde distill a bitter streame, out of a fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graunt
flower a filthie sappe, and from such diuine
beautie shoulde proceede hate and hellish crueltie.</p>
            <p>It is Madame your beautie which hath wrought my
woe, &amp; it is your bountie which must worke my weale.
It is your heauenly face which hath depriued mée of
lybertie, and your curteous consent must bée the meanes
to redéeme mée from captiuitie: for as hée that eateth of
the Briane leafe, and is infected, can by no meanes bée
cured, vnlesse hée taste of the same roote: As hée which
is wounded of the Porcuntine, canne neuer bée healed
vnlesse his woundes bée washt with the bloude of the

a Snake, then to bée rubbed with an Adders slough,
and as hée which is hurt of the Scorpion séeke a salue
from whome hée receiued the sore, so Loue onely is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied
by Loue, and fancie by mutuall affection: You
madame must minister the medicine, which procured the

               </gap>
plaister which inferred the paine.</p>
            <p>Therefore I appeale to your good grace and fauour,
and at the barre of your beautie I humblie holde vp my

handes, resting to abide your sentence, either of consent
vnto life, or of deniall vnto death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>CAstania</hi> hearing this solempne discourse of <hi>Valeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
was driuen into a maze with this vnlookt for
motion, musing that he would so farre ouershoote him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
as to attempt so vnlikelye a match, and therefore
with disdainefull countenaunce shée gaue gim this
daunt.</p>
            <p>AS your present ariuall Signor <hi>Valericus,</hi> dooth not
greatly preiudice my muses, so I thinke it will as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
profit your motion, and as your companie pleaseth
me regarding the person, so it much misliketh me, respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the <hi>parle:</hi> that your countes beeing once cast, you
shall finde your absence might haue more pleasured you,
and better contented mée. For it is vnpossible <hi>Valeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
to call the Fawlcon to that Lure wherin the pennes
of a Camelion are pricked, because shée dooth deadly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
them, it is harde to traine the Lyon to that trappe
which sauoureth of <hi>Diagredium,</hi> because he loatheth it.
And it is as impossible to perswade mée to enter league
with fancie, which am a mortall foe to affection, and to
vowe my seruice to <hi>Venus,</hi> which am alreadie addicted
to <hi>Diana.</hi> No, no sir, I meane not to loue least I liue by
the losse, nor to choose, least my skill béeing small I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
my chaunce. She that is frée and willinglye run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
into fetters is a foole, and who so becommeth captiue
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out constraint, may be thought either wilful or witles.
It is good by other mens harms to learne to beware, &amp; to
looke before a man doth leap, least in skipping beyond his
skill, he light in the myre. Who so considereth the fickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of mens affections, &amp; the fléeting fondnesse of their
fading fancie, who carefully looketh at the lyghtnesse of
their loue, and marketh the inconstancie of their waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:6132:20"/>
minde, who readeth the recordes which make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their déepe dissemblinges, faithlesse protestations,
false vowes, periured promises, fained loue, and forged
flatterie: how poore <hi>Ariadne</hi> was abused, howe <hi>Medea</hi>
was mocked, how <hi>Dido</hi> was deceiued, how <hi>Oenone</hi> was
reiected, and how <hi>Phillis</hi> was forsaken, and yet would be
allured to the traine with such filthie scraps, I woulde
count her chaunce too good, were her choice neuer so bad.
But leauing these necessarie doubtes, <hi>Valericus,</hi> I tell
you for troth, if I ment to loue, it is not you I meane to
lyke, if affection forced me, it is not your person I meane
to fancie, your patrimonie is not sufficent to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
my parentage, nor your bringing vp my birth, and
therefore I would wish you to sow the séede of your sute
in a more fertill soile, for in me you shall finde no grafts
of graunt to growe, nor no consent to be cropped, for I
neither lyke of your vnlikely loue, nor meane not to bée
framed to your fancie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valericus</hi> béeing pushed with this Pike, thought it a
signe of small courage to yéelde at the first foine, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
looking more narrowly to his ward, and gathering
himselfe within his weapon, he stoode to his tackeling
with this replie.</p>
            <p>MAdame (quoth hée) if you condempne me of folly for
climing a staffe to high, or accuse me of fondnesse for
laying my loue on a person of such princely parentage, if
I séeme to make an ill market in cheaping such precious
chaffer, as the price thereof is farre aboue my reach, yet
my offence is too small to beare anie waightie penaunce,
sith where the fault procéedeth of loue, there the pardon
ensueth of course, but your beautie shall beare all the
blame, as the onely spurre of this my rash enterprise. For
as it is impossible for the yron to resist the operation of

            <p>IF euer wofull creature had cause to complaine his
wofull case, then vndoubtedly maye I preace for
the formost place, for there is no sorrow more sower,
no torment more terrible, no griefe more grieuous, no
heauynesse more hurtfull, then to haue desire requited
with despight, and good wyll with hate, then to like vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
hope of courtesie, and to finde nothing but hate and
hellish crueltie.</p>
            <p>Alasse poore <hi>Valericus,</hi> is thy true loue thus trifling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
accounted off, is this the guerdon for thy good wyll?
Doeth thy déepe desire merite no better desert, then hast
thou no choice, but eyther to dye desperatelye, or else to
liue loathsomelye? Why fonde foole, doest thou count
her cruell, that at the first giues not a frée consent? Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
thou thinke her coye that commeth not at the first
call, wouldest thou haue the match made at the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Shée that is wonne with a worde, wyll bée lost
with a Winde, the Hawke that bates at euerie cast of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:6132:21"/>
the Lure, wyll neuer bée steadfast on the stonde, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that frameth her wyll to euerie wishe, will prooue
but a wild wanton. No, no, <hi>Valericus,</hi> let not her denials
daunt thée, let not the sower tast of her talke quat thy
queasie stomacke, conster all thinges at the best, though
her censure was verie seuere, yet shée knitte vppe her
talke wyth a courteous close. The hound which at the
first default giueth ouer the chase, is called but a curre.
The Knight that finding the first encounter comber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
giueth ouer the quest, is counted but a coward, and
the louer that at the first deniall is daunted with des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire,
is neyther worthie to obtaine his desire, nor inioy
his desert. And with that hée floung out of his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
both to auoyde the melancholy which tormented
his minde, and sée if hée coulde haue a sight of his
Goddesse.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Castania</hi> altogether vnwilling to <hi>parle</hi> wyth
her newe patient, kept her selfe out of his sight, which
<hi>Valericus</hi> espying, was no whit amazed, but lyke a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaunt

vouchsafeth not to match with a man of meane
Gentilitie. Of meane Gentilitie <hi>Gwydonius?</hi> yea
truely, for <hi>Castania</hi> rather thinketh thée sprong of some
poore peasaunt, than of anye princely personage.</p>
            <p>Besides, alas Fortune her selfe denieth me anye
such fauour, my good will as yet hath deserued no
suche gwerdon, my desire is farre aboue my deserts,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:6132:26"/>
my ambition aboue my condition, and the poore staye of
wandering <hi>Gwydonius</hi> farre vnfit for the princely state
of worthie <hi>Castania.</hi> But put case she did will as I did,
wish that she wer pricked in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same veine, caught in the
same snare, trapped with the like traine, &amp; fired with the
like fancie, yet the Duke her father will neither condes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
to her mind, nor consent to my motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neither think
well of her liking nor of my loue, nay if he shoulde but
once heare of such recklesse folly, as he hath wrought
my promotion, so he would worke my confusion, as hée
hath bene my friend, so he would be my foe, and in troth
<hi>Gwydonius</hi> not without cause, for art thou so voide of
vertue, or vowed to vice, so nursed vp in vanitie, or nus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
vp in villanie, as to requite his liberalitie with such
disloialtie, to returne the trust which he reposeth in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
with such treason. Tush, Loue is aboue Lord or Lawe,
friend or faith. Where Loue leadeth, no master is made
account off: no king cared for, no friende forced off, no
dutie respected, but all things done according to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is predominant. Why <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> what doubts
are these that thou thus dreamest on? Why dost thou cast
beyond the Moone, and feare before thou art in daunger
to fall: knowing that Loue and Fortune desireth not
them that are dastards, nor careth not for them that are
cowardes. The Captaine that retireth from the walls
before he hath the repulse, shall neuer returne a conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
the Souldier that fainteth before the battaile bée
fought, shal neuer vaunt himself of victorie. He that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
euerie tempest is not fit to be a trauailer. He that
doubteth euerie waue shall neuer proue a perfect Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot,
and he that in loue dreadeth euerie chip of mischance,
may well encounter, but neuer obtaine the conquest.</p>
            <p>Sith then <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> hardie venturing is a signe of
happie victorie, sound out the march with the trumpet of
trust, beginne the assault, giue the onset. Laie the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
<pb facs="tcp:6132:27"/>
péeces of loue, against the bulwarke of beautye,
and no doubt thy successe shall bée such as thou shalt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
with <hi>Caesar</hi> and saie, <hi>Veni, Vidi, Vici.</hi> And art
thou so presumptuous fonde foole, as to promise thy selfe
the conquest, knowest thou not that the path of loue is
perillous. And with that he fell into such melancholike
passions, such contrarie cogitations, such doubtfull
thoughtes, such fearefull supposes, that as hée which
cateth of the Goorde roote looseth his memorye, and as
the Elephaunt when hée eateth of the <hi>Helitropion</hi> leafe,
is then verie sléepie, so <hi>Gwydonius</hi> was so perplexed
with these vnacquainted passions, that contrarie to his
custome hée hadde driuen mirth into mourning, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt
conceites into painefull cares, laughing into low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
singing into sorrowe, as béeing thus besotted to
solace himselfe, hée went into a Parke adioyning to the
Dukes Pallace, where sitting vnder the shade of a béech
trée, leaning his head on his hande, he laye as one in a

this young Nouice, brought it so to passe, that <hi>Tersan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro,
Valericus, Castania</hi> and <hi>Melytta,</hi> with diuerse other

            <p>WHy how now <hi>Gwydonius</hi> (quoth shée) are you drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
or doubting, or is your minde musing vpon
some metaphusicall motions, that you sit thus as a man

the picture of <hi>Pigmalion,</hi> which once I sawe portray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

so bedewed with brinish teares, as his outward

In truth <hi>Gwydonius</hi> I had taken thée for <hi>Pigmalion,</hi> if
thou hadst hadde teares as thou wert in a traunce, for
thou doest not greatly differ from him neither in counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce

that thus combred thy conscience, or a doubte that

to darke, or decide the other, if it be not too secrete, marie
if the case be combersome, I leaue it to the iudgement of
these Gentlemen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>GWydonius</hi> wakened out of his musing slumber wyth
this sugured harmonie, séeing before his eyes his gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
Goddesse, the verie Saint, at whose shrine he was
offering vp scalding sighes, farre fetcht sobbes, plaintes,
prayers, and protestations, was so appalde with her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
that as the Basiliske looseth his sences with the
sight of a naked man, as the Torteise séeing the North

stone Echites is greatly amazed, so <hi>Gwydonius</hi> séeing the
incomperable beautie of his best beloued <hi>Castania,</hi> was
so astonished, yea, so inchaunted with the rare perfection
of this heauenly <hi>Pallas,</hi> that as one besotted he sate sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
not being able to vtter one worde, vntill at length
reuiued with the view of her chéerefull countenance, he
repaide her with this pleasaunt aunswere.</p>
            <p>MAdame (quoth he) whereas iestingly you saye, that
at the first sight you had taken me for perplexed <hi>Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malion</hi>
by my pittifull plaintes and carefull counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce,
but that I wanted trickeling teares to decypher
my sorrowe, I aunswere, that woe may verie well bée
wythout watrie wailinges, for when the Stone <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratides</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:6132:28"/>
then most drie, where the streame is most déepe, there it
is most still, and where is the smallest shewe of teares,
there is the greatest signe of sorrowe. And also I call the
heauens to witnesse, that when you wakened me out of
my dreame by your diuine eloquence, I tooke you either
for beautie to be <hi>Venus,</hi> for comelynesse to be <hi>Pallas,</hi>
or for port and honour to be <hi>Iuno,</hi> so that both your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
and curtesie daunted my minde, your presence in
dazeling my eies so sodainely with so solempne a sight,
your curtesie, in that your Ladyship without curiositie
would vouchsafe to talke with so meane a Gentleman.
But Madame, sith that I perceiue your skill in nauiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be great, in that you made so cunning a coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and without anie great aiming, so rightly hitte the

                        <head>The Dreame.</head>
                        <p>I Was walking (Madame <hi>Castania</hi>) in my dreame,
(as I supposed) solitarily by the sea side, where, as I
tooke delight to sée the Dolphins leape (which as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
saie is a signe of imminent tempest) I forthwith
espyed a rocke in the sea, wherevpon stoode a Ladie arai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with roabes of burnisht golde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so formed and framed,
so adorned and decked with the giftes of Nature, as at
the first I tooke her to bée <hi>Thetis,</hi> that had so gorgeouslye
clad her selfe, to welcome home her louer and Lord <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunus.</hi>
But viewing her countenaunce more narrowly,
I perceiued her to be a mortall creature (though vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
such diuine beautie should be shrouded in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce
of an earthly carcasse) which so inflamed my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
so fired my fancie, &amp; sp kindled my desire, that the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:6132:28"/>
tormentes of <hi>Tantalus,</hi> the torture of <hi>Ixion,</hi> the sorrowe
of <hi>Sisiphus,</hi> were not halfe comperable to the perplexed
passions that pinched my haplesse heart, when I sawe all
hope cut awaie from inioying this earthly Goddesse, the
sea which compassed the rocke was so déepe and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
the cliffes so stéep-downe and fearefull, as to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
was no lesse daunger then death it selfe, thus as I
surged in griefe, and wandered vp and downe in woe, I
spied a bridge a farre off, whereby was a passage to the
rocke, which sight so salued my forepassed sorrow, and so
reuiued my daunted minde, as I was driuen into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie
for ioy, to sée so good meanes to inioy my wished de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.
Comming to the bridge, I found it built of glasse so
cunningly, and so curiously, as if Nature her selfe had
sought to purchase credit by framing so curious a péece
of workmanship. But yet so slenderly, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> least waight
was able to pash it into innumerable péeces, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath
the bridge did run so terrible a sea, such boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
billowes, such tumbling waues, such fearefull sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
such roaring stremes, such hideous goulfs, as it made
the passage séeme a thousand times more perillous. This
terrible sight was such a cooling Card to my former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
as hope was turned to feare, blisse to bale, &amp; suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
happinesse to assured heauinesse. And yet my fancie
was not quenched, but rather far the more inflamed, my
desire was not diminished, but augmented, &amp; my liking
no lesse, but rather inlarged, so that to liue in loue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hope was loathsome, to séeke redresse was losse of
life, to want my wish was horror, to inioy my will was
hell, to liue in care without comfort was calamitie, to

incouraged by ventrous desire, I hadde either obtained
<pb facs="tcp:6132:29"/>
my wish, or wanted of my will, if your Ladyshippe had

madame <hi>Castania,</hi> you haue heard my dreame, now the

the brickle bridge, and so either desperatly to haue
ended cares with death, or else valiantly to haue inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <hi>Castania</hi> hearing the surmised dreame of <hi>Gwydoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
both smelled the fetch, and smiled at the follie of this
young youth, knowing that these fantastical visions and
presupposed passions, would in time (if he tooke not héed)
proue but too true, to preuent therefore such imminent
perills, shée nipt her young nouice on the pate with this
<hi>parle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>GWydonius</hi> (quoth shée) I haue listened to thy drousie
dreame, with déep deuotion, by so much the more desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
attentiuely to heare it, by howe much the more I
finde it straunge and wonderfull: yea, so straunge as if
I my selfe had not wakened thée out of thy slumber, I
would either haue thought it a fained vision, or a fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
inuention, but sith these Gentlemen héere present
&amp; mine owne eyes are witnesses, &amp; thine owne tongue a
testimonie of thy talke, suffice I beléeue it, though I can
not diuine it: to giue a verdit where the euidence is not
vnderstood is vanitie, to yéeld a reason of an vnknowen
case is méere folly, and to interpret so straunge a dreame
without great practise is but to skip beyond my skill,
and so lay fast in the mire. Yet least I might séeme to
promise much and performe nothing, I will decide your
doubt if you please to take my doome for a censure.</p>
            <p>It is a saying <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> not so common as true,
that the hastie man neuer wantes woe, and that hée
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:6132:29"/>
which is rash wythout reason, seldome or neuer sléepeth
without repentaunce. To venture amiddest the Pikes
when perills cannot bée <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>schewed, is not fortitude but
folly, to hazarde in daungers, when death ensueth is
not to bée worthely minded, but wilfully mooued. Uer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
alwayes consisteth betwéene extremities, that as
too much fearefulnesse is the signe of a quaking cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,
so too much rashnesse betokeneth a desperate Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fian.
Manhoode <hi>Gwydonius</hi> consisteth in measure and
worthynesse, in fearing to hazard without hope. But to
giue a verdite by thine owne voyce, I perceiue thou art
guiltie of the same crime, for when the bricklenesse of
the Bridge portended death, and the surging Seas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
losse of lyfe, yet desire draue thée to aduenture so
desperate a daunger. Better it is <hi>Gwydonius</hi> to liue
in griefe, then to die desperatelye without grace: bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to choose a lingering lyfe in miserie, then a spéedie
death without mercie, better to bée tormented wyth
haplesse fancie then with hellish fiends, for in lyfe it is
possible to represse calamity, but after death neuer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
miserie. <hi>Tully Gwydonius</hi> in his <hi>Tusculans</hi> que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,
discoursing of the happinesse of life and heauinesse
of death, sayth, that to lyue we obtaine it of the louing
Gods, but to die, of the vnluckie destinies: meaning
heereby, that lyfe though neuer so loathsome, is better
then death, though neuer so welcome: whereby I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<hi>Gwydonius,</hi> that to liue carfully, is better then to
die desperatly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gwydonius</hi> perceiuing that <hi>Castanias parle</hi> was

neuer raigneth without repentaunce, nor hastie ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding
without haplesse harmes, that he which aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureth
desperate daungers is a foole, &amp; he that passeth ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitable
perills is worse then an Asse: Yet from these so
generall rules Madame, I exempt these perticular excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
namely <hi>Loue</hi> &amp; <hi>Necessitie,</hi> which two are tied w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in
no bonds, nor limitted within no law, for whom y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuel
driues he must néedes run, be the passage neuer so peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous:
and whom Loue or Necessitie forceth, he must ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
be the daunger neuer so desperate: for as there is no
enterprise so easie which to an vnwilling man séemeth
not verie hard to bée atchieued, so there is no incounter
so combersome where will wisheth, that séemeth not pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
easie to bée perfourmed, nowe this will is with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
sooner pricked forwarde, then either with the force
of Loue, or sting of necessitie. So that whosoeuer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentureth
in a daunger, though neuer so desperate, is
not to be blamed, if inforced by fancie, or incouraged by
affection, and especially where the perill is in possibily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to bee passed without death, and in the performaunce
thereof, the possession of such a prise as the passionate
person more estéemeth then lands, limmes, or lyfe it selfe,
bée it neuer so swéete. In which case madame my cause
consisteth. For the Ladie who was an heauenly obiect to
my glasing eies, was so beautified with the giftes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and so perfectly pollished with more then naturall
perfection, that with the only view of such diuine beutie,
my sences were so besotted, my wit &amp; will so inueigled,
my affection so inflamed, &amp; any fréedome so fettered, yea,
Loue alreadie had made so greate a breach into the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke
of my breast, that to obtaine so gorgeous a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse,
I thought death no daunger, though neuer so dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
nor losse of lyfe no torment, though neuer so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible.</p>
            <p>

            <p>And yet Sir (quoth <hi>Gwydonius</hi>) your sister <hi>Casta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
condemnes me of follye, in ventring for so precious
a price, when as hope perswaded me, that no hazarde
could be haples, and assured me that Loue and Fortune
fauoureth them that are bold: that the Gods themselues
séeing my perplexed passions, would of pittie defend me
from those perillous daungers. For if <hi>Theseus</hi> by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine

<pb facs="tcp:6132:31"/>
               <hi>Melytta</hi>) for I sée to graunt one false proposition, is to

inferre some cauillyng conclusion to your former rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
thus I replye. That I confesse necessitie to haue

will not make bolde? who so doubtfull, that beautie wil
not make desperate? yea, what so harde that a man
will not hazarde, to obtayne so diuine a thyng, as
beautie.</p>

of the Fishers, that while the <hi>Porcupine</hi> standeth sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
at the glymmering of the starres, hée is ouer-taken
with dogges, that the Deare gazing at the bowe is stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with the bolte, that the Leoparde looking at the
Panthers paynted skinne is taken as a praye, and that
he which taketh too much delyght to gaze vpon beautie,
is oftentimes galled with griefe and miserie. Yea, his
pleasure shall inferre such profite, and his good wil such
gayne, as if he reapte the beautifull apples of <hi>Tantalus,</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:6132:31"/>
which are no sooner toucht, but they tourne to ashes.</p>
            <p>Beautie <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> no sooner flourisheth but it fadeth,
and it is not fullye ripe before it beginne to rot: it no
sooner blossometh but it withereth, and scarcelye béeing
toucht it stayneth, lyke to the <hi>Guyacum</hi> leafe, that hath
the one halfe parched, before the other halfe be perfect: to
the Birde <hi>Acanthis,</hi> which hatched white, yet tourneth
blacke at the first storme: or lyke to the Stone <hi>Asti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
that chaungeth colour with the onelye breath of a
man.</p>
            <p>If then <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> Beautie be so fading, so fickle,
so momentarie, so moouing, so withering, so waning, so
soone passed, and so soone parched: is this the Iewell,
which you count more déere than life? and the Iemme
which you thinke worthie to be purchased with the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of death? No doubt <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> if you wonne the
victorie, you might vaunt of a great Conquest, and if
your long hope were repayed with a great happe, it
shoulde bée much lyke to his, which thinking to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
<hi>Iuno,</hi> caught nothing but a vanishing clowde.</p>
            <p>You doo well Madame (quoth <hi>Castania</hi>) to put an
If, in it, because hée that vaunteth of victorie before hée
hath wonne the fielde, maye prooue himselfe a foole: hée
that bragges of gaines before the accompts be cast, may
perhappes put his winnings in his eyes: and hée that
bloweth the Mort before the fall of the Buck, may very
well misse of his fées: so he that counts himselfe a spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
before he be a wooer, sheweth himselfe a vaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or a vaunting patch.</p>
            <p>Might it not bée I praye you Master <hi>Gwydonius,</hi>
that passing the bridge scaping the dangerous seas, &amp; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely
arriuing at the desired Rocke, yet you might misse
of your purpose? Yes forsooth: for many a man bendeth
his bow, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> neuer killeth his game, laieth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> strap y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> neuer
<pb facs="tcp:6132:32"/>
catcheth the fowle, pitcheth the Net that neuer getteth
the fish, &amp; long time are heauie wooers that neuer proue
happie speeders.</p>
            <p>So perhaps <hi>Gwydonius</hi> you might be crossed with a
chippe of the same mischaunce, and the gorgeous Dame
whome you adore for a Goddesse might repaye your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
with loathing, your loue with hate, your good will
with despite and your fixed fancie with small affection,
either that she lyked you too little, or loued another too
much. All these doubts <hi>Gwydonius</hi> are carefullye to be
cast, and wisedome it is to feare the worst, and finde the
best: but you Sir like a lustie champion, thinke a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
won at the first looke, and the good will of women
gained at the first glaunce, thinking the Gods the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues
are to be accused of iniustice, if they be not ayders to
your enterprise, insomuch that if in ventring ouer the
perilous passage, you had by disaster Fortune fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the daungerous Seas, you doubted not but that <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>
would haue sent a Dolphin, that <hi>Arion</hi> like you
might escape the fearefull surges: but <hi>Gwydonius</hi> bée
not so ventrous, least though you harpe very long, you
get not the like hap. These premisses considered, if my
censure might stand for a sentence, I déeme it better to
be counted a dastardly coward, than a desperate caitife,
better to forsake your Goddesse, than your God, better
to lyue pinched with a few momentarie passions, than
with desperate death to destroy both soule and body: for
there is no sore such which in time may not be salued,
no care such which cannot bée cured, no fire so greate
which may not bée quenched, no loue, liking, fancie, or
affection, which in time may not either be repressed, or
redressed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valericus</hi> hearing this rough replye of <hi>Castania,</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
that although she leuelled at <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> yet shée

            <p>MAdam quoth hée, I se you will sit nye the wals eare

            <p>
               <hi>Valericus</hi> (quoth she) take no care what daunger I
incurre for speaking the truth, if I chaunce to bee har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
it is mine owne mishap, and for <hi>Venus</hi> reuenge I
care for it the lesse because I feare it not: if I speake
against my selfe, you may sée I am the fitter to bée a

of persons.</p>
            <p>These quippes Madame (quoth <hi>Gwydonius</hi>) are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the purpose, therefore in the behalfe of my selfe
and beautie thus I answere. That as there is nothing
that so soone procureth a man to loath as deformitie, so
there is nothing which sooner perswadeth a man to loue
than beautie, for the most precious stone is chosen by the
most glystering hiew, the purest golde by the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
colour, the best fruite by the brauest blossomes, and
the best conditions by the swéetest countenaunce, so that
where beautie raineth, there vertue remaineth, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a faire face resteth a faithfull heart. Sith then beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and bountie cannot be parted, what man is hée so
brutish, whom the least of these will not make to break
or bende?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6132:33"/>
And wheras you condemn me of vanitie for vaunting
before the victorie, I say, that if fortune had so fauored
mée, that I had gayned the presence of my Goddesse, I
would neuer haue doubted to haue obtained my desire:
for if she had séene the desperate daunger which I adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured,
and the fearefull perilles which I passed for her
sake, she coulde not but of conscience, repaye my loue
with vnfayned loyaltie, and my good will with treble
gaine. And in troth I thinke it vnpossible, that such hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlye
beautie shoulde bée eclypsed with crueltye,
and such perfect comelynesse be blemesht with curious
coynesse.</p>
            <p>Why <hi>Gwydonius</hi> (quoth she) doost thou call it cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
not to condiscende to the request of euerie one that
wooeth, or doost thou tearme it coynesse not to yéelde
to the assaulte of euerye flattering Louer, then in my
iudgement it were good for euerye woman to bee both
cruell and coye, that by crueltie she might auoyde the
traine of trothlesse wooers, and by coynesse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>schewe the

            <p>And so Madame (quoth <hi>Valericus</hi>) she should reape
small comfort and lesse credit.</p>
            <p>Tush <hi>Signor Valericus</hi> (quoth <hi>Gwydonius</hi>) it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
her thus merelye to iest, whereas I knowe shée
dooth accompt more of a courteous Dame, than of a
curyous Damsell, and that her Ladishippe so detesteth
the name of crueltye, that shée woulde bee loath to bée
thought to haue a mynde deuoyde of mercie. And in
troth to leaue these particular instaunces, women in
generall, or for the most parte, are bountifull, courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
sober, chaste, demure, not imbrued with vice, but
indued with vertue: so that by howe much womens
bodies are weaker than mens, by so much their mindes
are more strong and vertuous.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Gwydonius</hi> (quoth she) doo you thinke to bée

            <p>Not so Madame (quoth he) but I hope in extollyng
a Souldiours life to haue Saint <hi>George</hi> to my friend,

            </p>
            <p>And yet Madam (qd he) his mishap shall not make me

            <p>
               <hi>Castania</hi> had no sooner conueyed her selfe closely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her chamber, but her minde was moued with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
sundry motions, and she felt such a cruell conflict in
her haplesse hart, by the assault of diuers contrarie passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that how stoutly so euer she defended the walles,
she found her force too weak to resist the rage of so reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
a tyrant. Now the prayers <hi>Valericus</hi> powred forth
came to effect, now <hi>Venus</hi> meant to be reuenged for the
crueltie she vsed to her valiant Captain <hi>Valericus,</hi> who
so valiantly had fought vnder the flagge of affection,
and yet could by no meanes preuayle. For <hi>Castania</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the sugured Eloquence, which so swéetlye flowed
from the sappie wit of <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> framing in her fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie

            <p>Yea, the harde heart, which so rigorouslye reiected the

came to my fathers court without countenance or coine,
wealth or worshippe, credit or calling: yea, who by his

then <hi>Castania</hi> to asswage this flame, and to quench this
fire, which as it commeth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out cause, so it wil consume
without reason. For the greatest flowe hath the soonest
ebbe, the sorest tempest hath the most sodaine calme, the

to suspect your Ladyshippe of flatterie, nor my selfe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
to be accused of ingratitude, for your diligence
hath bene so great, &amp; my deserts so small, that if I might
but liue to requite some parte of your good will, it were
the second felicitie I looke for in this life. But touching
the pensiue passions which thus diuersly perplexed mée,
I aunswere, that as he which is wounded of the Bores
tuske, if his sore take aire is verie hardly healed, as hée
which stroken with a Scorpion if his wound take wind
can neuer be cured: so madame, many inward maladies
carry this nature, that if they be once discouered<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

far the more hardly recouered, that it is better to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
them with griefe, then reueale them in hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léefe.</p>
            <p>Not so <hi>Castania,</hi> your principle is not true, for if your
passions procéeded of loue, which of all other inward

which is so honoured in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that if thou doost

mée so incredulous or suspitious, as not to beléeue your

perfection of <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> his exquisite qualities, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
vertues haue fiercely assaulted the fort of my
fancie, as I am perforce constrained to resigne my liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

prison of my heart. This lucklesse and vnlikely loue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame,
is the cause of my care, &amp; the sum of my sorrowe,
this frantike affection hath driuen my drouping heart to
shew forth these drousy looks, this is it which hath made
me an enimie to my selfe, a foe to all good companie, &amp; to
delight in nothing but sorrow &amp; solitarinesse: yea, this
is the sore, which if in time it be not salued, will preuent
by death all other miseries.</p>

who seeing his goddesse thus surprised with sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
was so galled with griefe, so pinched with hellish

<hi>Castania</hi> hearing, she perceiued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out touching his pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
the cause of these his sodain passions. In fine, such me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholike
motions so amazed his minde, that he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
mute in his message, yet at length incouraging
himselfe, he presented it vnto her in this wise.</p>
            <p>Madame (quoth he) the Duke your Father hearing of
your sodain sicknesse, in token of his fatherly affection, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
all his dainties, hath sent you this dish, which he
thinks most méete for your diet, wishing your Ladyship
to let no doubtfull motions distresse your minde, nor no
carefull thoughtes cumber your conscience, for you shall
lacke nothing if you reueale to him your want, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
your will or wish can desire. And truely madame,
to manifest my willing duetie (if the prayers of a poore
Gentleman may be heard of the heauenly Gods) I wish
that before you tast of this foode, it may turne to <hi>Nectar,</hi>
whereby not onely your sicknesse should be salued, but
your diuine beautie and vertue according to desert shuld
be crowned with immortalitie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Castania</hi> perceiuing with what seruent affection
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:6132:37"/>
               <hi>Gwydonius</hi> vttered these wordes, began to chéere vp her
selfe, in hope y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> her good will should not be repaied with
ingratitude, taking therfore the present at his hands, and
liking it neuer the worse for his sake that brought it, she
returned him this replie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gwydonius</hi> (quoth she) as I haue cause most reuerent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to accept of my fathers louing curtesie, &amp; to repay his
natural affection with most dutiful obedience, so I haue
cause to thanke thée for thy paines, and to thinke wel of
thée for thy wish, promising in recompence of thy good
will, if in any respect I may plesure thée, to séeke and sue
to my father for preferment.</p>
            <p>Madame, I account the performance of my message
no paine, but pleasure, and I think my selfe as much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
by this office, &amp; thrice more happie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if I shuld
in <hi>Ganimedes</hi> place present the cup to <hi>Iupiter.</hi> But Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame,
sith that to stop the streame, is to make the floud
flow more fiercely, to represse the fire, is to make it flame
more furiously, and to restraine the force of loue, is to
kindle a greater flame, least too long delaie shoulde
bréede too great daunger, and by concealing my sorrow I
shuld make the sore incurable, I thought good either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
to heare the curteous sentence of my lyfe, or the
cruell doome of my death. So it is Madame, that too long
gasing vpon the beames of your heauenly beautie, &amp; to
narrowlye construing ouer your vertuous conditions, I
remaine so caught in the snare of your bounty, &amp; so thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the thridde of your vertue, that the staie of my
life hangeth in your hands, either to driue me downe to
hellish miserie, or to hoist me vp to heauenly felicitye.
For although I haue not héeretofore by duetifull seruice
made manifest the loyaltie of my loue, yet since I first
framed in my fancie (as in a mirrour) the shape of your
surpassing beautie, my heart hath bene crossed with such
cruell Camizados for your sake, as if with the Target
<pb facs="tcp:6132:38"/>
of hope, I had not withstoode the furious force of such ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
furies, I had by dispaire bene dashed against most
dangerous rocks. Sith the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Madam y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> sight of your swéet
face hath fast fettered my fancie in the linkes of loue, as
without your meanes I can neither bée redressed nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased:
I humbly desire you neither to resist the motion
of my wel meaning, nor to reiect the deuotion of my good
will, but to accept your poore <hi>Gwydonius</hi> as a faithfull
seruant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Castania</hi> hearing diligently the faithfull discourse of
distressed <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> perceiuing by his sighes the pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sorrow of his thoughts, and séeing him to fast fettered
in folly, on a sodaine to giue her the slip, had that she desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and now her louing lookes was tourned to lowring
glances, her delightfull curtesie, to disdainfull coynesse, &amp;
she thought to repaie the swéet meate wherewith before
she feds him, with most sowre sauce, not that she misliked
of his loue, for it was the onely thing she desired, but to
make him the more feruent in affection, vttering these or
such like words to her selfe secretly.</p>
            <p>And is not <hi>Castania</hi> the victory most accounted of, wher
the conquest is most doubtful? is not the castle which abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the longest battery thought the richest bootie, are not
those pearles which are scarcely found &amp; hardly gotten,

The Maide that by long sute and much trauaile is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
by how much the more she was hard in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
by so much the more she will be swéet in the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
she which in her virginitie is charie of her chastiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,

I will qualifie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hot loue of <hi>Gwydonius</hi> with a cold
potion, &amp; with that she made him this waspish answere.</p>
            <p>Why <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> shal the olde Prouerbe be verified
in thee, that the Priest forgets himselfe that euer he was

Madam though my nature and nurture be such in your
sight, as they bewray my bringing vp and birth to bée so
base, as if I meane to draw my discent, I must (as you
say) imblaze mine armes in the beggars coate, yet thus
much I aunswere in respect of my parents and without
arrogancie thus farre I stande on my pantuffles, that
the credit I haue in your Fathers Court, is not coequal
with the calling I haue in my owne countrey, if I did
not count it more great credite and honour, in that I
haue sometime inioyed a curteous countenance of your
swéete selfe, since my comming. But if I were the most
famous Prince in the world, I so estéeme your deuine
beautie and exquisite vertue, as I would thinke my self
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:6132:39"/>
farre vnworthy to possesse such heauenlye perfection:
which if I could obtaine, the displeasure of your Father
could no whit discourage mée, his thundring threates
could no whit amaze me: no, death it selfe could neuer
daunt my minde, were it neuer so despitefull. But who
(say you) can lay their loue wher is no desert, and wher
want bréeds a flat deniall?</p>
            <p>Ah <hi>Castania,</hi> Nature by her secret motion, hath indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d
all creatures with some perfect qualities, to supplye
that what which bréedes misliking. The Moule depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of sight hath a wonderfull hearing, the Hare being
very fearefull is most swifte, the fish hauing no eares,
hath most cléere eyes: so though want of dignitie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
me, though want of coyne discountenaunce me,
though lacke of wealth impaires my credite, yet Nature
hath giuen me such a loyall and louing heart, as I hope
in the perfection of that, she hath supplyed the want of
all the rest: so that Madame though I want coyne I do
not want constancie, though I haue no lands, yet I lack
not loyaltie, though I want wealth, yet I want not wil
to ende my life to doo you good, or spend my time to doo
you seruice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>GWydonius</hi> hauing thus pithely replyed, draue <hi>Casta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
into a great doubt, whether she should presentlye
consent to his demaund, or still driue him off with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes,
whether she shuld yeelde the fort at the first skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish,
or stand to the doubtful euent of battaile: at length
least she shuld digresse from the course of womankinde,
she thought best to denie that she most of all desired, and
therefore then gaue him this aunswere.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>GWydonius</hi> (quoth she) in what state you came to
my Fathers Court I know, what you are by discent
I knowe not, nor I care not, and if I did, it auayl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>th
<pb facs="tcp:6132:40"/>
not, but this I saye, that it is harde taking of Fowle,
when the net is discryed, and ill catching of Fish, when
the hooke is bare: impossible it is <hi>Gwydonius</hi> to inferre
beléefe, where no credite will be giuen, and to deceyue
her that spieth thy fetch: when the string is broken, it
is hard to hit the white, and when a mans creditte is
called in question, perswasions can little preuaile. It is
a religion amongst louers to sweare and forsweare, to
promise mountaines and perfourme moulhilles, to bée
ripe without and rotten within, to carrie a rustie blade
in a veluet scabberde, and a siluer Bell with a leaden
clapper. Therefore <hi>Gwydonius</hi> I had rather mistrust too
soone, than mislyke too late, I had rather feare my choice
than rue my chaunce, I had rather stop at the brimme,
than at the bottome: for the signet being set, it is too
late to breake the bargaine, and fancie being once fixt, it
is too late to reclayme affection. For the loue of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is lyke the Oyle of Flynt, which being once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed
will neuer be dissolued, like the Diamonde,
which being once rubbed with the gum of a Pine trée,
will neuer be broken: so if I fancie any, sith I meane
not to fléete, it shall bée such a one, as I néede not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
me.</p>
            <p>And whereas you say <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> that in despight
of Fortune, Nature hath giuen you a louing heart, I
my selfe surely did neuer déeme any lesse, but thought
you of the crue of those louers that loue too much, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
as manie Ladies as they haue wits, and that is
not a fewe, who count that euery face must haue a new
fancie, and if they sée a thousand the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

doost thou finde no fitter meanes to obtain a reasonable

what daunger will followe of this denyall? Is it

Oh would to God <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> thou wert againe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
thy demaund, and I to frame mine aunswere: then
would I salue thy sores with swéet strops, not with cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
corasiues: then wold I mittigate thy maladie with
easie medicines, not with pinching playsters: then wold
I comfort thée with consent, not daunt thée with deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls.
But alas, had I wist now comes too late, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Castania</hi> if thou hast made a fault, séeke to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends,
and recompence this his iniurie with most frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>And with that came <hi>Melitta,</hi> who comforting <hi>Casta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> who all this while had a flea in

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:6132:41"/>
were great, his gaines should be little, &amp; though
he made a very long haruest, yet he shoulde reape but a
very small croppe, thinking that vnder such sower spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
a sugred minde could not be contained: yet at last
entring into déeper consideration with himselfe, he fell
into these tearmes.</p>
            <p>But by the swéete (quoth he) how should we know
the sower: but by the blacke how should we know the
white: he neuer greatly accompteth of prosperitie which
hath not bene before pinched with aduersitie: which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce
<hi>Castania</hi> meanes to make me trye by expery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
thinking to féede me first with bitter broaths, that
her after daintie fare may more delight me: to daunt
me with the raging stormes of deniall, that the calme
of her consent may more content me: to make mée tast
the bitter pills of annoy, that héerafter I may enioy the
greater ioy: for the chilling cold of Winter makes the
sprowting spring time séeme farre more pleasaunt, the
parching heate of Summer, makes the coole shade more
delightfull, and the frowning lookes of <hi>Castania,</hi> will
make her smiling countenaunce séeme more chéerefull.
Then cease not <hi>Gwydonius</hi> to pursue thy sute with end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
paine, either to enioy her curtesie, or tast of her cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie,
to thy great happinesse or extreme heauinesse.</p>

how he might in close combat once again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter

that his loue was not counterfait, but constant: not

should not finde him immutable in prosperitie, which
was so permanent in aduersitie. Yet (whether it were
for coynesse in consent, or charinesse of choise I knowe
not) she once againe thought to sound him more deeper,
to kéepe out still the flagge of defiaunce, and to spende

                  <p>MAister <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> your Letter béeing more hastely
receiued then heartely read, I perceiue by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,

may be appeased, or your maladie mittigated by no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,
but by my meanes, you are like either to pay your
due vnto death, or still to linger in distresse. My cunning
is too small to enterprise the composition of anye secrete
simples, and my calling too great to become a Phisition
to such a paltering pacient, so that I neither can nor wil
cure another mannes harme by mine owne mishap. To
loue him whome I cannot like, were but to wreast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
mine owne will, to flatter him whome I meane
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:6132:43"/>
not to fancie, is but a méere tricke of extreame follye.
What the cause is <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> that thy good will reapes
so small gaine, and that so rigorously I repaie thy loue
with hate, I knowe not, vnlesse the constellation of the
Starres by some secrete influence haue so appointed it
in the calculation of our natiuitie. But this I am sure,

thy friend, which am by instinct of nature thy protested
foe, and as harde to winne me to thy wife, who so little
likes of thy loue, that the verie remembrance of thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

thou shouldest accuse me of ingratitude, though I cannot
inwardly mittigate thy miserie, yet I will outwardlye

féeding mine eyes with the forme of thy feature, I think
my selfe sufficiently shrowded against all the tempestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

promises to be no fained vanities but faithfull veritie,
I commit my selfe, my stay, and state into thy hands to

            <p>
               <hi>GWydonius</hi> listening attentiuely to this sugred har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,
was so rauished with the sight of her sweete
face, and so rapt into a traunce with the contemplation
of her beautie, that as the Lyon tasting of the gumme
Arabicke becommeth senselesse, as the Bul by browsing

séeing in his armes the Saint whom in heart hée
did honour, and imbracing the Goddesse whome with
most déepe deuotion hée did adore, was so amazed, that
he was not able to vtter one worde as witnesse of his
happinesse, vntill at last gathering his wits together, he
beganne thus to reply.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>CAstania</hi> (quoth hée) it is an axiome in Philosophie,
that the colour ioyned hard to the sight, hindereth the
sence, the flower put into the nosethrill stoppeth the
smelling, the Wine vessell béeing full, lets passe no wine
though neuer so well vented, the water-pot béeing fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to the brimme, yeeldes forth no licour, though hauing
a thousand holes: so where the minde is surcharged with
ouermuch ioy, or too much pleasure, there the tongue is
both tied, and the sences so restrained, that the heart is
neither able to conceiue the ioye, nor the tongue able to
expresse the pleasure. Which <hi>Castania</hi> I nowe
<pb facs="tcp:6132:48"/>
speake by proofe, and knowe by experience, for I am so
drowned in delight by inioying that princely Iemme,
which I estéeme the rarest and richest Iewell, not onely
in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> but in all the worlde, and so puffed vp
in pleasure by thy diuine presence. Yea, thy faithfull
and vnfained affection, the promise of thy constancie, and
the hope of thy loyaltie, the report of thy chastitie, &amp; the
renowme of thy modestie, the force of thy beautie, &amp; the
fame of thy vertue. But aboue all thy prodigall boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
in bestowing these heauenlye perfections on thy

                  </gap>tion</hi> the Comicall Poet, constrayned by
silence to vnfolde that affection, which in words the filed
phrase of <hi>Demosthenes</hi> were not able to decypher. But
this assure thy selfe <hi>Castania,</hi> that if <hi>Iuno</hi> wold aduance
me to be Monarch of the world, if <hi>Pallas</hi> would preferre
me to excéede hautie <hi>Hercules</hi> in valour, if <hi>Venus</hi> wold
present me with some princely péece of heuenly perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet would I not so gladly receiue their proffers, as
I doo gratefully accept the promise of thy loue and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie.
No, I accompt the treasure of <hi>Croesus</hi> but trash, in
respect of the guerdon of thy good will: I accompt the
fortune of <hi>Caesar</hi> but folly, respecting the fruites of thy
fauour: I estéeme the dignities of <hi>Priamus</hi> as dregs,
in respect of thy diuine perfection. Yea <hi>Castania,</hi> I am
so snared with thy beautie, and so intangled in the trap
of thy bountie, as I shall neuer leaue to loue thée, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
beginne to like any other.</p>
            <p>IT is easie <hi>Gwydonius</hi> (quoth <hi>Castania</hi>) to purchase
credite, where the partie is alreadie perswaded, and
to infer beléefe, where euery word is counted an Oracle.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:6132:48"/>
Therefore omitting these friuolous protestations, thus
much I say touching the purpose. <hi>Cecillius Metellus</hi> was
wont to say, that as it was necessary that old men shuld
be graue in counsaile, so it was expedient young men
should be secret in loue, and therefore when the contract
was made betwéene <hi>Fuluius</hi> and his daughter, he sealed
vp their lippes with his signet, meaning that to violate
the secret conference of louers, was to commit a second
sacriledge. I speake this <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> as one carefull of
thy staye and my state: for if <hi>Orlanio</hi> my father should
but once heare of our loue, or suspect our liking, it wold
bréede thy mishap and my miserie: yea, no doubt hée
would spéedely preuent our pretence, which woulde bée
thy care and my calamitie. Dispose our affaires at thy
pleasure, but discouer not our purpose, if thou hast won
the castell vaunt not of the conquest, if thou hast made
a good market, bragge not of thy gaines, lest by boasting
of thy bootie, thou loose thy pray and be thought a prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.
And <hi>Gwydonius</hi> aboue all men beware of <hi>Valeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
least vnder the shape of a friend, he proue in tyme
thy mortall foe, least his fained amitie proue faithlesse
enmitie: that in trusting too much without triall, thou
finde not treason: and then though thou repent, yet had
I wist cometh too late, &amp; so thou wish thou hadst neuer
loued, and I neuer liked.</p>
            <p>TUsh <hi>Castania</hi> (quoth <hi>Gwydonius</hi>) he that is afraide
to venter on the Bucke because he is tapisht in the
briers, shall neuer haue hunters happe, and he that puts
his doubt in loue for euery chaunce, shal neuer haue lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
lucke. Cannot the Cat catch Mice, without she
haue a bell hanged at her eare? Cannot the Hobbie seaze
on his praye but he must checke? Cannot the Spaniell
retryue the Partridge, but he must quest? and cannot
we deale so warely but all the worlde must wonder at
<pb facs="tcp:6132:49"/>
it? Yes, it is a subtill birde that bréedes among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aerin
of Hawkes, and a shifting Shéepe that Lambes in the
Foxes Denne, and he shall looke narrowlye, that spyes
me halting. Let <hi>Orlanio</hi> not onely weigh our workes,
but our wordes, and let <hi>Valericus</hi> both déeme our déeds,
and deuine our thoughts, and yet I hope we will deale
so secretlye in our affaires, as neither the one shal haue
cause to suspect our familiaritie, nor the other to detect
our affection. And therefore <hi>Castania</hi> least (if we bée
spyed) the time and place giue occasiou of mistrust, I
will leaue you as I found you, and so farewell.</p>
            <p>WEll these two louers placed thus by fortune in the
Pallaice of earthlye prosperitie, floated so secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
in the streames of blisse, as they thought no chips
of mischaunce might chaunge their present happinesse
to future heauines, as long as their priuie contract was
kept so secret to themselues. But as they which cannot
sée fire in the strawe are stone blinde: so he that cannot
sée the flame of fancie is a foole. It is harde to couer
smoake, but more harde to conceale loue, which these
two Louers in tract of time tryed true. Who as close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as they kept their cloake, yet it was most easie to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
the lining: for fancie secretly restrayned, is like the
sparke couered with ashes, which at length bursteth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

such amorous glaunces, such louing lookes, such cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
congies, such countenaunces, and such friendlye
familiaritie, such often méetings, such open gréetings,
such sighes, such sobbes, and such straunge passions, as
not onely <hi>Valericus</hi> but all the Courte (though they

               </gap>ach other. Which as it did not displease many which
loued <hi>Gwydonius</hi> as their friend, so it greatly despited
<hi>Valericus</hi> which was his foe, to see one of small counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce

shoulde winne the Bulwarke which he so long

shoulde vaunt of the victorye: that while he beat
the Bush, another shoulde catche the Birdes: and that
the méede of his merite, should be giuen to one of small
deserte. Béeing combred with these cholaricke cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and perplexed with these despightfull passions,
inflamed with wrathfull furie, he fell into these termes.</p>
            <p>O Goddes (quoth hée) what courtesie is there to bée
founde in such Kytes of <hi>Croesus</hi> kinde, or what
constancie is there to bée hoped for, in suche dayntye
disdayning Dames? whose wauering wills and stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse

whose Lunaticke mindes chaunge with euerye sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayne
motion; yea, whose lyghtnesse and leawdnesse

Didde not <hi>Sirichia</hi> the Princesse of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke</hi>

refuse the renowmed Gods, and choose a most deformed
Smith.</p>
            <p>Why, but <hi>Valericus,</hi> is it fancie that forceth them to
this folly? Doth loue lead them? doo the Destenies driue
them? doth beautie allure them? Is it their countenance
that constraineth them? no, they are clownes: is it their
person or parentage that perswadeth them: no, they are
pesants. But like craftie <hi>Calipsos</hi> they thinke by these
vnequall matches to rule the roste after their owne dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
to be soueraigne Mistres of their owne mindes, with
<hi>Venus</hi> to let <hi>Vulcan</hi> possesse the trée, and <hi>Mars</hi> enioye
the fruite, to haue their husbands féede the shéepe, &amp; some
other reape the fléece: vnder the shaddowe of his heade,
doo defende themselues from such heate, as would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
greatly scorch their credite, to make him followe
the bent of their bowe, although he set the Cuckoldes
end vpward. It is a simple cloake that cannot couer one
from a shower of raine, and a silly husband that is not
able to father that another dooth beget. But to see howe
these gallaunt girles, if they like not the partie, what
shewe of shamefastnesse they will make, how they will
vale their face with the visour of virginitie, howe they
will cloake themselues with the colour of continencie,
how charie they will be of their chastitie: whereas if
they fancie, who so loose of their lips, and frée of theyr
flesh as they. But <hi>Valericus,</hi> why doost thou thus recke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessely
raile and rage against womankinde. It is not
<hi>Castania</hi> that thus crosseth thée with care, but <hi>Gwydo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
that bréedeth thy griefe. It is not shée that infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
thy sore, but hée that procureth thy sicknesse.</p>
            <p>Shée is not the meanes of thy maladye, but
hée the hinderer of thy medicine. Shée is not the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:6132:50"/>
worker of thy woe, but he is the sower of thy sorrowe.
And shall hée bée puffed vp with prosperitie, and I pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

and I sinke in want? shall he bath in blisse, and I waile
in woe? shall he bée pampered vp with pleasure, and I
pinde awaie with penurie? No, I will either spoile him,
or spill my selfe, in despight of the fates and fortune.</p>
            <p>WHile thus <hi>Valericus</hi> sought opportunitie to reuenge
his wrath vppon guiltlesse <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> Fortune
minding to bewraie her immutabilitie, brought it so to

to the sum of thirtie thousand Duckets, either wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

he determined with as much spéede as might bée, to
wage battaile against him, and to obtaine that by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint,

of his sonne <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> came into his minde,
which not onely amazed him, but so molested him, as hée
was driuen into most distressed dolour, now he called to

his moodlesse rigour in rebuking his folly: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

yea, he was so diuersly perplexed, as he began thus dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
<pb facs="tcp:6132:51"/>
to discourse with himselfe.</p>
            <p>ALasse (quoth he) now I sée the saying of <hi>Cicero</hi> to be
true, that who so wilfullye peruerteth the lawes of
nature, séemeth to proclaime himselfe an enimie to the
Gods: for that Nature neuer framed anye thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse,
wherein I haue most grieuously offended: For in
beastly rage I haue surpassed the brute beasts, and in
crueltie the sencelesse creatures: I haue béene more
deuoyde of pittie then the fowles of the aire, and more
vnnaturall then the Fishes of the Sea. The Birde
called <hi>Apis Indica,</hi> séeing the venimous Uiper readie to
deuour her young ones in the neast, presenteth her selfe
to death, to preserue them from destruction. The Eagle
is so carefull ouer her young, that if it happe by her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault

her selfe in many places with her owne beake. The Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so louingly fostereth vp her Whelpes, that shée ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
tasteth of the praie vntyll they bée fullye satisfied.
The Foxe is so carefull ouer her cubbes, that shée wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
falleth into the Hunters handes to defende hir
young from harme. But I vilde wretch, (as though I
had drunke of the Ryuer <hi>Lincestis</hi> in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> which
presently tourneth whatsoeuer it toucheth into stones.
In stéede of friendly courtesie, haue abused mine owne
sonne with frowning crueltie, in liew of mercie I haue
brought him to miserie, the fatherlye affection I haue
shewed him, hath béene raging furie: yea, my rygorous
Nature, naye rather my vnnaturall rage hath béene
such towardes him, as hée lyueth a bannished exile in a
straunge Countrey, perhappes pinched wyth penurye,
oppressed with pouertie, wandering in the wilde De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sartes,
in daunger of deuouring, in peryll of spoyling,
afflicted not onelye with the maladie of the bodie, but
the miserie of the minde: so that no doubte hée wisheth
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:6132:51"/>
that I had neuer béene Father to such a sonne, or he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
sonne to such a Father.</p>
            <p>Alasse what ioye canne I nowe enioy, when I want
my onely ioye? What comfort canne I haue to sée my
childe in calamitie? What pleasure canne I take while
hée toyleth in penurie, who nowe in mine age shoulde
bée the staffe whereon to staie, that by his valyaunt cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and warlike prowesse (wherewith from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie
hée hath béene indewed) might defend mee from
mine enimies, and reuenge mée of my foes. But alasse
I lament too late, the calme commeth out of time, when
the Shippe alreadie hath suffered shipwracke, and these
pittifull plaintes little preuaile, where the patient is
alreadie pushed into perill. No, no, my rage hath béene
too greate, to heare of his hastie retourne, my peruerse
furie hath béene such, as hée dare not abide my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence:
and surely my sorrowe is too greate euer to bée
salued.</p>
            <p>And with that <hi>Clerophontes</hi> start vp, minding to
reuenge these his cholarike cogitations by bloudie bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile,
vppon the confines of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and therefore
in greate hast mustered all his men, made great prouisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for the warre, and caused his Nauie to bée rigged, for
that hée meant to conueie his armie by sea into <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While thus there was no worde through the whole
Dukedome of <hi>Meteline</hi> but warre, warre, and no newes
but of the cruell conflicte that shoulde insue betwéene
the two Dukes. Certaine Merchauntes of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
which then roade in the Hauen, durst not goe a shoare
to sell their commodities, but as fast as Winde and
weather would serue them, highed them out of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and coasted spéedely into their owne countrie: wher
they no sooner arriued, but they made reporte there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to <hi>Orlanio,</hi> who driuen into a dumpe wyth this
<pb facs="tcp:6132:52"/>
noysome newes, whether he doubted of the puissant pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of <hi>Clerophontes,</hi> who was such a worthie warriour,
and in battaile so bolde, that no man durst abide him, or
whether he feared his owne force was not able to resist
the furie of his raging enimie. He presently summoned
all his Lordes to a Parliament, where after some confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
it was concluded, that <hi>Thersandro</hi> should bée sent
Embassadour to <hi>Metelyne</hi> to <hi>parle</hi> of peace with <hi>Clero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phontes,</hi>
which determination was no whit deferred, but
with as much spéede as might be, the barke wherein he
should passe was prouided, the charge of the Embassage
was giuen him, &amp; he accompanied with a traine of braue
Gentlemen, departed.</p>
            <p>But if this newes was dolefull to <hi>Orlanio,</hi> no doubt
it was death it selfe to <hi>Gwidonius,</hi> who hearing that his
Father would bend his force against the place, wherein
he was. Sawe all possibilitie taken awaie from obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his purpose. For he feared death if he were know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
to <hi>Orlanio,</hi> and he doubted despightfull hate at the
least if he bewraide himselfe to <hi>Castania.</hi> Which double
dolour so distressed him, as he felte himselfe diuersly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
with dumpish passions, his mirth was tourned to
mourning, his pleasaunt conceits, to painefull cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
his wanton toyes, to wailing thoughtes, now he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bondoned
all good companie, and delighted onely in soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie
life, the wilesome woodes were his wished walkes,
and the secret shades the couert he chiefly coueted. In

of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> so that all the Court meruailed at
this so sodaine a chaunge: but especially <hi>Castania,</hi> who
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iecturing his doleful hart by his drousy looks, was asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
at this his strange state, casting in her mind whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            </p>
            <p>Who no sooner luckely ariued at <hi>Metelyne,</hi> but <hi>Clero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phontes</hi>

how I pittie thy passions, and thinke wel of thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that if my Fathers will might be framed to my

of Fortune denies our loue to haue such happie successe,

               <hi>Thersandro</hi> was nothing amazed with the first part

               </gap>ing,
and depriue him of his Loue, he was so puffed vp
with wrath and chollar, as hap what hap would, he fell
into these tearmes.</p>
            <p>I Remember (quoth he) that <hi>Caligula</hi> the Emperour
prouiding a mightie armie to subdue great <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi>
when he was come to the Sea, readie to post ouer

boasting that he would bestowe the kingdome of <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midia</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Clerophontes</hi> hearing the cholaricke conclusion of
<hi>Thersandro</hi> could scarcely bridle his frantick furie from
raging without reason against this young youth, yet
somewhat mittigating his moode, he breathed out these
cruell threatenings.</p>
            <p>IF the lawe of Armes (quoth he) did not both safely
protect thee, &amp; surely forbid me to hurt thée in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> thou

thée not to stande too stiffe vpon this poynt, least if thou
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:6132:56"/>
be so recklesse as to breake the bondes of reason, I be so
forgetfull as to passe the lymits of the law. Thou hast
receiued a determinate aunswere for the Embassage, &amp;
there I charge thée this present day to depart out of my
Dominions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thersandro</hi> fearing the tyrannie of this cruell <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rophontes,</hi>
presently passed out of the Chamber of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
taking his leaue of Ladie <hi>Lewcippa,</hi> onelye with
louing lookes, which she requited with such glaunces of
good will, as they were sufficient signes what insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
sorrowe she receiued by his so sodayne depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
yet knowing that her fancie was incountred with
mutual affection, she droue away the mystie clowdes of
despaire, hoping that the Gods séeing their faithful ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
would take pitie of their passions, &amp; in time redresse
their miserie.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Thersandro</hi> hauing with spéede dispatchte hys
affaires (all his train being set aboord, and they coasting
the straights with a luckie gale) was so combred with
care, and so ouer-growen with griefe, that he passed no
hower, minute, nor moment, without wofull waylyng,
sorrowfull sobs, and farre fetcht sighes, so that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
his companions, supposing that he was thus
painfully perplexed for feare of <hi>Clerophontes</hi> pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssance,
began both to comfort and incourage him not to doubte
or dread the force of the enimie, sith his father was able
to repulse him, without any daunger to himselfe, or any
great damage to his subiects. But these their perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
could no whit preuaile to asswage his passions, this
their incouragement coulde not cure his care.</p>
            <p>But as there is no greater bane to the bodye, than
trouble of the minde: so <hi>Thersandro</hi> so long continued
in these pensiue passions, and carefull cogitations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
his griefe so couertly, which so much the more
furiously flamed within him, that he was constrayned
<pb facs="tcp:6132:57"/>
to kéepe his Cabbin till his arriuall at <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where being set on shore, and presently conueyed to the
Courte, he remained for the space of thrée dayes, so
strangely perplexed, as he was not able to make report
of his message: which so griped <hi>Orlanio</hi> with such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
griefe, as he wished rather to haue died vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly
 w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the force of hys enimye, than to put the health
of his sonne in hazard by passing so perillous a iournie.
But <hi>Thersandro</hi> séeing that sorrow would not salue his
sore, but rather increase his sicknesse: that mourning
would not appease his maladie, but rather augment his
miserie: began to take heart at grasse, and within few
dayes began to recouer his former health. And then hée
declared to his Father, what he had in charge from <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rophontes,</hi>
how he meant spéedely to wage war against
him, &amp; by force of armes to driue him out of his Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
which he had alreadie promised to one <hi>Lucianus</hi>
in dowrie with his Daughter. <hi>Orlanio</hi> hearing this
proud presumption of this bragging Duke, thought the
greatest barkers were not alwaies the sorest biters, and
that it was farre more easie with words to obtayne the
victorie, than with déeds to attayne the Conquest. Yet,
least he might be taken at vnwares, he made a generall
muster throughout all his Dominions, prouiding in
euery place necessarye munition for the defence of hys
Countrey. And assembling his Nobilitie to giue theyr
verdite, who were fittest to bée Captaines in this
skirmish: after some consultation had in this cause,
they concluded, that since <hi>Clerophontes</hi> meant to ioyne
battayle in his owne person, that lykewise hée shoulde
bee Generall of the field, and <hi>Gwydonius</hi> who surpassed
all the rest in martial exploites, should be Lieuetenant,
and conduct the armie, which he no sooner hearde but hée
was tormented with inspeakable griefe, he beganne to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:6132:57"/>
pull downe his Peacockes feathers, to hang his wings,
and crye creake: euery man hoping to winne fame was
merrie, but he alone mourning: euery man laughed, &amp;
he alone lowred: insomuch, that he was generallye sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to be a fearfull cowarde, and that dread of daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
draue him into these dolefull dumpes. But as they
rashly coniectured the cause of his sorrowe, so they mist
the nature of his sicknesse: for <hi>Gwydonius</hi> séeing that
of this cruel conflict his calamitie should ensue, and that
this bloudie broyle would bréed his bane, he fell into
such solitarie surmises, and such musing meditations,
that <hi>Valericus</hi> his open friende and yet his secrette foe,
sought by sundry meanes to search out the cause of his
care, but not being able to wring out any thing, eyther
by flattering promises or fained protestations, he ceased
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his importunate sute. But froward fortune brought
it so to passe, that <hi>Valericus</hi> comming by the chamber of
<hi>Gwydonius,</hi> heard him thus desperatly discoursing with
himselfe.</p>

by the sinister meanes of frowning fortune am sowsed
in the seas of sorrow, exalted alate to the highest degrée
of happines, am nowe driuen to the greatest extremiti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of euill: alate puffed vp with prosperitie, &amp; now pushed
downe with aduersitie: yea, alate placed in Paradise,
and now plunged in perplexitie.</p>
            <p>Oh <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> if thy fathers friendlye preceptes
<pb facs="tcp:6132:58"/>
might haue perswaded thée, if his aduice had bene thy
aduertisement, and thou hadst carefully kept his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile,
then by his fore-warning thou hadst bene fore-ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
against all mishap and miserie. The force of fickle
fancie had not then giuen thee the foyle, loue had not so
lyghtly procured thy losse, nor the painted shew of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
had not so soone procured thy bane. My bane? Why
fond foole, beautie hath bred my blisse, fancie hath not
giuen me the foyle, but hath yéelded me the fort: Loue
hath not wrought my losse, but requited me with treble
gaine.</p>
            <p>Hath not <hi>Castania</hi> requited my loue with loyaltie,
and repayed my good will with mutuall affection? Is
shee not my Saint and I her seruaunt? Are wée not
contracted together by loue, and shall continue together
by lawe? May I not dispose of her in the waye of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
at my pleasure? Yes, but what then, the more is
my grief, and the greater is my care. For if her presence
procureth my delight, will not her absence bréede my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight?
If her consent preserued my life, will not her
contempt inferre my death? Yes. For alas sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinies

will cause <hi>Castania</hi> (where before shée accepted mée for

better happe can I hope for, than horrour and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinesse?
Yea, which waye so euer I tourne mée I
sée nothing but woe and wretchednesse. For if <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanio</hi>
perceyued our liking, how would he storme at our
loue? If he knew my chaunce, how woulde he fret at
his Daughters choyce? Woulde hée euer consent,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:6132:58"/>
that <hi>Castania</hi> should match with so meane a mate, that
her princely personage should be disgraced with my base
parentage, that her calling shuld be crazed with my slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
countenaunce: no, he would no doubt first banish me
out of all his dominions. Tush <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> would God
this were the worst, and then thou mightest hope in
time by some meanes to redresse this doubt. But if <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanio</hi>
shoulde knowe thou wert heire apparaunt to the
Dukedome of <hi>Metelyne,</hi> and onely sonne to <hi>Clerophon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>

which thou shouldest not trie? What paine so pinching,
which thou shouldst not passe? What hap so hard which
thou shouldest not hazard? Yea, what death so direfull,
which at his cruell hands thou shouldest not suffer? And
what if <hi>Castania</hi> were priuy to thy state, dost thou think
her so constaunt as to consent to her Fathers foe? doest

            <p>
               <hi>Valericus</hi> hearing this doubtfull discourse of <hi>Gwy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius,</hi>
was driuen into an extasie for ioy, to sée that hée
had found such fit meanes whereby he might not onely
purchase the Dukes fauour, aspire vnto honour and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
but also obtaine the loue of <hi>Castania,</hi> for he meant
spéedely to preuent the pretence of <hi>Gwydonius</hi> by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding
to the Duke the summe of his secrete purpose,
assuring himselfe, that after <hi>Orlanio</hi> knew his parents
and parentage, that hée was sonne and heire to <hi>Clero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phontes,</hi>
no price though neuer so precious, no raunsome
though neuer so rich, might redéeme him from the most
despightfull death that could be deuised. And of these
premisses he inferde this conclusion, that the cause bée ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
awaie the effect faileth, that <hi>Gwydonius</hi> béeing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected,
hée should bée receiued: that hée being despighted
with hate, he shoulde be requited with loue, and vppon
this hope he went presentlye to bewraie this matter to
<hi>Orlanio,</hi> whom he found with his sonne <hi>Thersandro,</hi> and
diuerse other noble men consulting what course they had
best take against <hi>Clerophontes,</hi> whome <hi>Valericus</hi> salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

whose liniaments béeing first leuelled, hée tricketh vp

kéepe the lawes carfully, and defend his Countrie valy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly,
in which thrée pointes (saith he) consisteth the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest

good tournes which without desert your grace hath

a vicious vassall, deuoide of all vertue, a trecherous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen,
rather then a trustie subiect, a carelesse slaue, then
a carefull Gentleman: yea, a gracelesse monster, misled
with ingratitude. I am come (right worthie Sir) not to

the fault of my enimie, but to disclose his offence,
which liueth with me in perfect amitie, in whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
hetherto hath ben all my ioy, pleasure and delight:
but since his pretence is greatlye preiudiciall to your
graces person, I thought to preferre your profite before
mine owne pleasure, and the commoditie of my countrie
before mine owne priuate contentation. So it is that
<hi>Gwydonius,</hi> whome your grace hath honoured, and all
the Court estéemed, is sonne and heire to <hi>Clerophon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
the Duke of <hi>Metelyne,</hi> who by the péeuish pollicie of
his Father, vnder the pretence of seruice, is purposed to
procure your fatall death, and the finall destruction of
your Dukedome. And the better to performe this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellish
practise, hée hath contracted himselfe to my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
<hi>Castania,</hi> who blinded with his beautie, and inueag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with his wit, hath consented, not onely to kéepe his
counsaile to your confusion, but also closely to conuey her
selfe with him into his Countrie. Which pretence if
your grace doth not spéedely preuent, you shall finde that
delaie bréedes daunger, &amp; that procrastination in perils
is but the mother of mishap.</p>
            <p>And haue I (quoth <hi>Orlanio)</hi> brought vp the Birde
that will picke out mine owne eyes? Haue I fostered vp
the Serpent in my bosome that will bréede my bane?
Haue I giuen her lyfe that séekes to yéelde me death?
Haue I cherisht her béeing younge, and wyll shée

consume me being older: was there none to choose but
<hi>Gwydonius,</hi> nor none to loue but the son of her fathers
foe? Will she preferre her lust before my life, her priuate
pleasure, before the safetie of my person? Well, as she for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
the dutie of a child, so I will forget the natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of a Father, and therefore <hi>Valericus,</hi> goe spéedely
with these noble men to <hi>Gwydonius</hi> chamber, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
him, that I may requite his hatefull trecherie
with most hellish torments. And <hi>Thersandro,</hi> sée you that
<hi>Castania</hi> be closely kept vntill we haue caught the tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,

she saue her selfe by flight.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valericus</hi> hauing this commission giuen him from
the Duke, made no delay, but passed to <hi>Gwydonius</hi> lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
with as much spéed as might be: but Fortune who
after euery chip of mischaunce, sendeth some lot of good
lucke, and after euerie storme of aduersitie, sendeth a qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
calme of prosperitie, so carefully prouided to frée <hi>Gwy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius</hi>
from mishap, that he was newlye gone towardes
<hi>Castania,</hi> to impart vnto her this his pretence, but before
he came to her chamber, he was incountred by <hi>Thersan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro,</hi>
who stearnly taking <hi>Gwydonius</hi> by the bosome, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
out his Rapier, commaunded him as a traitour to
stand, or else without anye farther doome he shoulde féele
the dint of death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gwydonius</hi> amazed with this sodaine motion, stoode
as one in a traunce, neither being able to defend himselfe
with word or weapon, but yéelded himself into y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hands
of <hi>Thersandro,</hi> who shakt him vp with these bitter spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
            <p>THou traiterous wretch (quoth he) as it is impossible
for the flame so closely to bée couered, but it wyll bée
spied, so it is impossible, but that treason, though neuer

by experience is verified in thée, for although thou hast
hetherto falsely fained thy selfe to be a straunger of a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine

by whose péeuish pollicy thou hadst not only brought the

Hast thou ben so trained vp in trecherie, or is thy

inuincible courage, as he séemed from his infancie to bée
vowed to <hi>Mars</hi> and martiall affaires, manfully marched
forward to méete with his enimies, which he performed
so spéedely, that within few dayes, both the Armies wer
within viewe, which <hi>Clerophontes</hi> séeing, he began to
incourage his souldiours on this sort.</p>
            <p>ALthough most trustie subiects (quoth he) I neither
doubt of your prowesse, nor haue cause to feare your
manhoode, as hauing mine Armie fraught with the most
couragious Captaines, and boldest blouds of <hi>Metelyne,</hi>
yet I wish you to consider how desperately we haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentured
vpon the Conquest of this Dukedome, which
if we atchieue, we shal not onely gaine perpetual fame
and renowme, but reap such riches and treasure, as shall
sufficiently counteruaile our trauaile. But to obtaine
this victorie we must behaue our selues valiantly, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dreading any daunger though neuer so desperate,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:6132:65"/>
nor doubting any perill though neuer so fearefull. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our face we haue our enimies, behinde our backes
the surging seas, so that fight we must, but flye we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not:
in being couragious we winne the fielde, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
conquerours: in proouing cowards, we both loose
our liues and the conquest: if we foyle our foes we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
with triumph, if we faint and flye we haue no
hope of safetie, but death and desperation is imminent.
Be then hardie to hazard, and valiaunt to venture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>middest
the prease of your enimies, that daunted with
your valour they may be forced to flye, and we both tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
and inioy the treasure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>CLerophontes</hi> hauing thus louinglye incouraged his
souldiers, <hi>Orlanio</hi> on the other side séeing his men
began to feare the force of the enimie, and were amazed
with such a monstrous multitude, prickt them forward
with this <hi>Parle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THat mightie Monarch <hi>Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der</hi> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> great, who for his
martiall exployts, was a mirror to all his posteritie,
whose prowesse was such as he daunted <hi>Darius,</hi> &amp; by his
inuincible courage made a conquest of the whole world:
hearing on a time one of his Captaines to demaunde
what multitude was in their enimies campe, aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that it was not the point of a good soldier to inquire
how many the enimies were, but wher they were, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that to feare the multitude is rather the signe of
cowardise, then a toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of courage. Which saying I wish
you carefully to consider, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the huge army of <hi>Clerophon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
neither amaze your minds, nor abate your valor, sith
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the equitie of our cause doth more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> counteruaile his
companie. He inuadeth our realme without reason, &amp; we
defend but our owne right: he cruelly séeketh to depriue
vs of fréedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; we lawfully do maintain our own liberty.
<pb facs="tcp:6132:66"/>
He tirannously striueth to make vs bondslaues, and we
fight to frée our selues from captiuitie. If he preuayle
let vs looke for no pittie, but that we shall be murdered
without mercie, we shall sée before our face our wiues
rauished, our daughters defloured, our parents put to
death, our children slaine, our goods spoyled, our Citie
sacked, and our selues brought to vtter ruth and ruyne.
Sith then we are placed betwéene two extremities, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
possesse our owne with plentie, or to passe our liues
in penurie: let vs valiauntly venter whatsoeuer wée
gaine, let vs fight without feare: for better it is to die
with honour, than to liue with shame.</p>
            <p>BY that time <hi>Orlanio</hi> had ended his Oration, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
met in a Plaine, within thirtie leagues of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria.</hi>
Where both of them ordering (as became good
Captaines) their people, there began in the breake of the
day, the most cruell and terrible battaile that earst was
heard of, considering the number on both partes, theyr
experience and pollicie, with the valiant prowesse and
courage of the Captaines. Thus continued they in
fight, euen almost vntill éeuen, with meruaylous
slaughter on both sides, the victorie yet doubtfull, till in
the ende the <hi>Alexandrians</hi> began to faint and flye, more
oppressed with the excesse of the multitude, than distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for want of manhoode, for there were two and fortie
thousand slaine, but not one taken prisoner, and of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rophontes</hi>
companie eight and twentie thousand slain,
and sixe hundred mortally wounded. This monstrous
massacre and fearefull slaughter, so amazed the mindes
of these two Captaines, that for the better burying of
the dead, and healing of them which were hurte, they
concluded a truce betwéene them for fiftéene dayes, in
which time <hi>Orlanio</hi> sent Ambassadors to parle of peace
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Clerophontes,</hi> but in vaine: for he was resolued either
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:6132:66"/>
valiantly to die in the field with glorie, or to inioye the
Dukedome of <hi>Alexandria</hi> with renowme. Yet as a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
Prince, preferring the securitie of his soldiers before
the safetie of his owne person, he offered them the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,
which <hi>Orlanio</hi> to auoide the effusion of bloud, most
willingly accepted. Nowe it was agréed and concluded
betwéene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that two champions might be chosen, who
by the dint of the swoord should stint the strife betwéene
these two armies. If he of <hi>Metelyne</hi> remained victor,
then <hi>Orlanio</hi> shuld not onely paie his former tribute, but
deliuer vp his Dukedome into the hands of <hi>Clerophon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</hi>
But if y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 
               <hi>Alexandrians</hi> obtained y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> conquest, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Duke
of <hi>Metelyne</hi> should peaceably depart the countrie, release
the tribute, and also resigne his state, and become a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to <hi>Orlanio.</hi> And for the better kéeping &amp; confirming
of these conditions, they presentlye dispatcht Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
to <hi>Fernandus</hi> the king of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> to intreate his
maiestie that he would vouchsafe to become iudge in the
combat, who for that he wished wel to both these dukes,
graunted to their requests, and with as much spéede as
might be, came to <hi>Alexandria.</hi> But in the meane time
there was some difference aboute the champions. For
<hi>Clerophontes</hi> sayd, that sith in loosing the field, consisted
the losse of liuing, life, and libertie, and in getting y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie,
the gaine of a Dukedome, he would in proper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
fight the combat and trie the chance of Fortune, and
therefore made a challenge to <hi>Orlanio.</hi> But he finding
himselfe farre vnfit to resist his furious force, refused it.
Yet promising, that none vnlesse he were descended of
Nobilitie should enter the lists, wherwith <hi>Clerophon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
was verie well contented. Nowe while this truce
continued, which was prolonged for thirtie dayes, it was
lawfull for them of <hi>Alexandria</hi> to come and viewe the
campe of <hi>Metelyne,</hi> and for the <hi>Metelynes</hi> to goe and sée
the Citie. Wherevpon <hi>Clerophontes</hi> desirous to sée <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanio</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:6132:67"/>
and his Court, went onelye accompanied with his
garde to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where he was most royally enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and sumptuously feasted by <hi>Orlanio,</hi> both of them
remitting the rigour of their mallice, till it shoulde bee
shewed in effect, by reason of their manhood. But as soone
as <hi>Thersandro</hi> and the other Lords saw <hi>Clerophontes,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
he was rather a monster then a man, hauing each lim so
strongly couched, each part so proportioned, so huge of sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
&amp; so fierce of countenance, they were so dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted with
the sight of his perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as they almost feared to come in his
presence, saying: that thereof the boldest blouds in <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi>
were not able to abide the force of <hi>Clerophontes.</hi>
Who now peaceably departing to his hoast, lefte <hi>Orlanio</hi>
as greatly perplexed for asse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling his nobilitie together,
amongst whom he appointed the champion shuld be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen.
They not onely with one consent withstood his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund,
but began to murmure and mutine against him,
condempning him of folly that he would so vnaduisedly
commit his own state, &amp; ther stay to the doubtful hazard
of one mans hap. <hi>Orlanio</hi> seeing y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it was now no time to
chastise this their presumption, vnlesse he meant to raise
ciuill dissention in the citie, which were the next way to
confirme the enimie, &amp; bréed his owne confusion, he disse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
his cholar &amp; began to work a new way. For first he
fréed <hi>Castania</hi> out of prison, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made generall proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
throughout his Dukedome, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> what Lord so euer w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his land would try the combat with <hi>Clerophontes,</hi> if
he remained victor in the conquest, he would not onely
giue him his daughter <hi>Castania</hi> to wife, let him possesse
peaceably the Dukedome of <hi>Metelyne</hi> as her dowry, but
be content to acknowledge him as his liege, &amp; paye him
tribute, as he was wont to <hi>Clerophontes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While he lingered and listened how this proclamition
would preuaile, <hi>Castania</hi> hearing this seuere sentence &amp;
dolefull doome pronounced, séeing that shoulde not onely
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:6132:67"/>
be forced to forsake <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> but be constrained to
match in marriage with one whome shée should neyther
loue nor like, burst forth into these bitter complaintes.</p>
            <p>A Alasse (quoth she) how pinching a pain it is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
with diuers passions, what a noisome care it is
to be combred with sundrie cogitations, what a woo it is
to hang betwéene desire &amp; despaire, &amp; what a hell it is to
houer betwéene feare and hope. For as to him which is
assured to die, death is no dolour, in that he perfectlye
knowes there is no salue can cure his sorrow, so to him
which feares to die, &amp; yet hopes to liue, death were thrice
more welcome, then to linger in such doubt. In which
cursed case alas my case consisteth, for as out of the riuer
<hi>Cea</hi> in <hi>Sicillia</hi> bursteth most feareful flames, and yet the
streame is passing colde, neither is the water able to
quench the fire, nor the fire cause the water to bée hotte,
so the heate of hope flameth out of the chilling fountaine
of feare, &amp; yet the force of the one is not able to asswage
the vehemencie of the other, but still my heauie heart is
diuersly assailed with them both. If my Father <hi>Orlanio</hi>
winne the conquest, I doubt my desire shall neuer haue
happie successe, if <hi>Clerophontes</hi> triumphe as victour, I
greatly feare his crueltie is such, as I shall not escape
most haplesse death. And yet againe I hope that then my
own <hi>Gwydonius</hi> wil accept me for his, and with trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
armes imbrace me. But alas, will <hi>Clerophontes</hi>
suffer him to match with his mortal so, wil he not rather
preuent it by my peril? Yes no doubt, if he returne with
triumph, my Father shal serue him as a subiect, my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall become his vassall, my friendes shall bée for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne,
my Citie sackt, and my natiue Countrie brought
to vtter confusion. And shall I for the loue of a straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
wishe these straunge stratagemmes? Shall I
to féede mine owne fancie, and content my lustinge
<pb facs="tcp:6132:68"/>
minde, wish my Fathers death, my Brothers bane, my
friends mishap, my Countries confusion, and perhappes
my owne miserie. For though <hi>Gwydonius</hi> loued mée
when our parents were friendes, he will not now lyke
me béeing foes: but to reuenge the iniuries my Father
offered him, will subtilly séeke to sacke my honour and
honestie, and so triumph of my shame and discredit. Had
I not better praie my Father may winne the combat, &amp;
then shall I bath in the streames of blisse, and flowe in
the flouds of felicitie, then shall I dread no daunger, no
feare, no perills: then shall I see my father, friendes, and
Countrie, flourish in most happie prosperitie: then shall
I inioy some iolly Gentleman, who will loue me béeing
young, and cherish me being olde, and possesse the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>Metelyne</hi> for my dowrie. And canst thou <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stama</hi>

séeing the dismal day drew on, and hearing that <hi>Fernan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
the king of <hi>Bohemia</hi> was lately landed, he fell into
more furious passions, vntill he was driuen out of his
dumps by his sonne <hi>Thersandro,</hi> who perceiuing his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thus dolefully daunted, he began most louingly to
comfort him, promising that since none durst venture to
deale with <hi>Clerophontes,</hi> he himselfe would fight y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,
and either worthelye winne the conquest with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme,
or manfully die in the field with honour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orlanio</hi> hearing the bold courage of this new champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
felt his sorrow somewhat salued by this proffer, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
himselfe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> his sonne was better able to abide y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
brunt then he, &amp; hoping that the Gods would fauour the
equitie of the cause, and assuredly by iustice graunt him
the victorie. Resting I saie vppon this hope, and than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<hi>Thersandro</hi> for his naturall affection, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
him for his noble courage, hée presentlye went
to méete <hi>Fernandus,</hi> whom he most princely entertained,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:6132:70"/>
conducting him very royally into <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where hée
most sumptuously feasted him and all his traine. But
as they passed away the time in pastime and pleasure,
so poore <hi>Thersandro</hi> spent the daye in dolour and the
night in sorrowe. For although to comfort his Father he
made light of the combat, and valiauntly offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to trie the chaunce of Fortune, yet séeing his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
force farre to excéede his féeble strength, he began
to faint, although like a worthie Gentleman he couered
his dreadfull courage with a desperate countenaunce,
raunging vp and downe the fieldes to driue awaye his
melancholy, where by chaunce in disguised apparaile he
met <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> to whom after some <hi>Parle</hi> past betwéen
them, he bewrayed the whole state of the matter, howe
he was to enter combat with <hi>Clerophontes,</hi> and that hée
doubted greatly of the euent of the victorie, fearing the
force of his Father, and fainting at his owne imbecili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
Which <hi>Gwydonius</hi> hearing he made this short aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THersandro</hi> (quoth he) it is vaine with long talke to
passe away the time when delay bréedes daunger, &amp;
folly to hope for faire weather when the aire is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cast
with clowdes: leauing off therefore all oathes to
confirme my faith, thus much to the purpose. If it please
thée to trust me without triall, and to giue anye confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

my loyall loue to <hi>Castania,</hi> and to repay thy courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
that I will, resembling thy person, and disguised in

either intending by winning the victorie to obtaine my

            <p>Alas poore <hi>Gwydonius</hi> (quoth he) how art thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
with diuers cogitations, what a cruell conflict dost
thou sinde in thy minde betwéene loue and loyaltie, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
&amp; necessitie? who euer was so wilfull, as willingly
to wage battaile against his owne father? who so cruell
as to enter combat with his owne sire? Alas, duetie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades
me not to practise so monstrous a mischiefe: but
the deuotion I owe to <hi>Castania</hi> driues me to perfourme
the déede, were it thrice more daungerous or desperate.
The honour I owe to my Father makes me faynt for
feare, but once to imagine so brutish a fact: the loue I
owe to <hi>Castania</hi> constrayneth me to defende the combat
if <hi>Iupiter</hi> himselfe made the challenge. And is not (fond
foole) necessitie aboue nature, is not the lawe of loue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
King or Keyzar, Father or Friends, God or the
Diuell? Yes. And so I meane to take it: for either I
wil valiantly win the conquest and my <hi>Castania,</hi> or lose
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:6132:71"/>
the victorie, and so by death ende my miseries.</p>
            <p>With that the trumpets sounded, and <hi>Gwydonius</hi>

yet he alwaies receiued the strokes, but neuer so much

spying <hi>Castania,</hi> his courage so increased, that all feare
set aside, he carelessely flang away his sword and shield
and ranne vpon his Father, not onely tearing from him
his target, but vyolently casting him vpon the ground,
and spéedely vnlacing his Helmet, offered to cut off his
head with his owne sword: but <hi>Clerophontes</hi> crying
out confessed himselfe captiue, and granted his enimie
the conquest. Wherevpon they of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> gaue a

the King, pulling downe his beauer, began to speake in
this manner.</p>
            <p>I Let thée <hi>Orlanio</hi> (quoth he) and the worthie king
of <hi>Bohemia</hi> to knowe, that I am <hi>Gwydonius,</hi> sonne

I haue wonne <hi>Orlanio</hi> my Fathers Dukedome by vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie,

            <p>
               <hi>Clerophontes</hi> kissing and imbracing <hi>Gwydonius,</hi>
tolde him his care was halfe cured, in that such a good

Painting their faces if they be foule, with liuely colours.
But if they be faire, they so carfully kéepe their beautie
from the parching heate of Summer, from the chilling

their iemmes, iewells, ouches, ringes, perfumed gloues,
and what not? In fine, what beautie or brauerie is in
the apparell eyther of man or woman, all proceedeth of
Loue. Shall I saie that Musicke was onely inuented
by loue, yea truely, for eyther it mittigateth the passions
wherewith men are perplexed, or else augmenteth their
pleasure, so that dayly they inuent diuerse kindes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentes,

Bandoras, whereon they plaie Madrigalis, Sonnettes,
Pauins, Measures, Galiardes, and all these in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce
of Loue, as he for whom men doe more then for

chaunces and straunge passions, and to relate them

suspitious iealousie, sometimes the husband comming

wish: sometimes coniecturing without cause, and
other times beléeuing nothing, but trusting vppon hys
wiues honestie. To be short, the greatest pleasure after
loue, is to tell what perillous daungers are passed. But
what maketh so many Poets in the worlde, is it not
Loue? the which séemeth to be the plaine song whereon
all Poets doo descant: yea, there is few which write vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

                  <p>All this happie successe came by Loue, as long as hée

insue such a confused inequalitie, that the faire shal not
be matched with the wel featured, but shal be oft times
ioyned with fowle and deformed persons Great Ladies
and noble Dames shall fall in loue with them whome
before they would disdaine to accept as their seruants.
And when the loyall and faithfull Louers, haue long
languished in the loue of some beautifull Dame, whose
mutuall good will they haue gayned by deserte: then
Folly will cause some fickle &amp; false flatterer, to enioye
that in one hower, which in all their life they coulde not
attayne. I passe ouer the continuall debates and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells
that shall ensue by Folly, whereof shall spring
woundes, massacres, and most fearefull murthers. And
I greatly feare that wheras Loue hath inuented so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
laudable sciences, and brought foorth so many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
that now he will bring great idlenesse accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied

to leaue feates of armes, to forsake the seruice
of their Prince, to reiect honourable studyes, and to
appplye them selues to vaine songs and sonnets, to

bringing infinite diseases to their bodies, and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie

I hope when your Maiestie shall throughlye heare

more than his reasons. For it is not vnknowen vnto
you and all the Gods, that Folly is no whit inferiour
vnto Loue, and that Loue should be of no force without
her, neyther could his kingdom indure without her help,
ayde and counsayle. I praye you call to remembraunce
how Folly incontinently after Man was placed in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise,
beganne most imperiously to rule, and hath euer
since continued in such credite, as neuer any Goddesse
had the like, raigning and ruling amongest men, from
time to time, from age to age, as the onely Princesse of
the worlde. Insomuch that who haue bene more hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

<hi>Alexander</hi> the great. which féeling himselfe to suffer
hunger and thirst, to be subiect to sorrow and sicknesse,
not able to kéepe himselfe from dronkennesse, yet would
be honoured for a God.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:6132:80"/>What kinde of people hath bene in greater credit than

his treasure into the sea, commit a wise déede? What
folly shewed <hi>Empedocles,</hi> by his straunge coniectures?
what say you to <hi>Diogenes</hi> tunne, and to <hi>Aristippus</hi> flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie?
Who so throughly considereth their opinions, shal
finde them subiect to the state of Folly. How many other
sciences are there in the world, which are altogether foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
and yet the professors of them had in high reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
amongest men. They which are Calculators
of Natiuities, makers of charecters, casters of figures,
are they not Friers of this fraternitie. Is it not Folly
to be so curious, as to measure the heauen, the height of
the starres, the breadth of the earth, and the deapth of the
sea, and yet the professors heereof are highly estéemed, &amp;
onely by the meanes of Folly. Nay, how could y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> world
continue, if the daungers, troubles, calamities and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities

                  <p>Who would haue coasted the seas if Folly had not ben

And yet notwithstanding by this meanes the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth is maintained, knowledge and learning

séeke to fill vp the valleyes, to make plaine the

drowned in sorrow: whereas Folly quickeneth his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
maketh him sing, daunce, leape, and frame himselfe
altogether to pleasure. It is not possible that Loue shuld
be without the daughter of youth, which is Folly. For
Loue springeth of sodaine and sundry causes, by recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
an Apple, as <hi>Cydippe:</hi> by looking out at a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe,
as <hi>Scylla:</hi> by reading in a Booke, as the Ladye
<hi>Frauncis Rymhi:</hi> some fall in loue by sight, some by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
but all liuing in hope to obtane their desires. And
yet some haue loued without anye naturall cause, as
<hi>Pigmalion,</hi> who fell in Loue with his marble picture, &amp;
I pray you what <hi>Sympathia</hi> could there be betweene a
lyuely youth, and a dead stone, what was it then but
Folly that kindled this flame? what forced <hi>Narcissus</hi> to

what aduenture is passed in loue without Folly.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:6132:81"/>
For the Philosophers define Folly to be a depriuation
of Wisedome, and Wisedome is altogether without
passions: of the which when Loue shall be voyde, then
no doubt the sea shall be without waues, and the Fire
without heate.</p>
                  <p>Consider but a young man which onely placeth his
delight in amorous conceiptes, decking, dressing, and
perfuming himselfe most delicately, who passeth out of
his lodging, fraught with a thousand sundry fancies, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with men and pages, passing to the place
where he may haue a sight of his Mistres, obtaining for
his trauell no gain but perhaps some amorous glaunce,
making long sutes, spending his time and his treasure,
consuming his wit, and wasting his wealth, and yet
reaping nothing but disdaine and discredite. But if it
chaunce that his Mistresse condiscend vnto his requests,
she appoynteth him to come at some suspitious houre,
which he cannot performe without great perill. To come
with companie, were to bewray his secrets: to go alone,
most daungerous: to goe openly, too manifest: so that
he must passe disguised, sometime like a woman, other
times like a peasant or some vilde person, scaling the
walles with ladders, clyming vp to the windowes by
cordes: yea, continually in daunger of death, if Follye
did not holde him vp by the hand. It is not also vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen
vnto you how manye sundrye passions doo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexe
the poore passionate Louers, all which procéede of
Folly, as to haue ones heart seperated from himselfe, to
be nowe in peace and than in warre, now couering his
dolour, blushing one while and looking pale another,
fraught wholly with feare, hope and shame, séeking that
carefully which he séemeth to flie, &amp; yet doubtfully dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not to find it, to laugh seldome, to sigh often, to burn
in cold, &amp; fréeze in heate, to be crossed altogether w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,

that honoureth him, exalteth his name, and causeth him
to be counted as a God. Further, whosoeuer loueth must
applie himselfe to the affection of his mistresse, although
it be contrarie to his natural constitution, if he be quiet,
wise and discréete, yet if his louer please to haue him
chaunge his state, he must turne his stearn and hoise his
saile to goe with another winde, <hi>Zethius</hi> and <hi>Amphion</hi>

If the Lady whom thou louest be couetous, thou must
chaunge thy selfe into golde, and so fall into her bosome,
if she be merrie, thou must be pleasaunt, if sullen, thou
must be sad. All the seruauntes and sutors to <hi>Atlanta</hi>
were hunters, because she delighted in that sport. Many
Gentlewomen to please their louers which were Poets,
left the rocke and the néedle, and tooke in hand pens and
bookes: now tell me if these straunge Metamorphosis be
