            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Certainly this august Furniture of these Councellors of State is worthy the Matter, wherewith they are concerned: for if Counsell be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what divine and sacred, as inspired by GOD, we must not think it strange, that in <hi>China</hi> it is accordingly reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.

It is also from such men, that one learns the wise Maxims of good Government, and not from Councellors, that are disquieted by Avarice, diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and corrupted by Delights, puft up and swoln with Ambition: <hi>For who is he, that would search for a living Spring in a silthy Bog, or that would draw foul

When any one of these Statesmen dies, he, that is next in Order of Reception, takes possession of his Place according to the Law, so strictly observed in <hi>China: That the Services of every one have the Recompence, that their Condition can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to.</hi> They ascend then from one Degre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But for to supply the last Place, the Councell chooses the most experienced and wisest man of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: If he be absent, they send for him; being arrived, they present him to the King, who confirms, or disallows his Election; but the last scarce ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens. The new chosen Councellor in this manner takes his Oath between the Kings hands: <hi>That he will render Iustice to every one according to the Laws of the Kingdom, and that in the Administration thereof, as also in the Nomination of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, or Iudges of the State, Passion or Affection shall never supplant with him Vertue and Merit: That he will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Presents: That he will with all diligence preserve the Peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and that he will advertize the King

and his Councell, of whatever shall come to his knowledge, prejudiciall to his Service.</hi> After this solemn Oath, he is put in possession of his Place in one of the thirteen Seats in the Councell-Hall.

He, that is sent, departs without being known, arrives there In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognito, informs himself of all, that has past, and afterwards, if it be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, makes himself known, and shews his Power. Moreover these Councellors of State, not by Dozens as elsewhere, but twelve in number, keep the first and uppermost Ranks in the Realm: For there b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>By the Advice of these wise Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors of State, the King commits the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his Realm to those, whom Vertue and Merit has rendred most worthy thereof. These Charges or the most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent of them are six in number.

They have under them a great number of Provosts for the Exercise of Justice: but they are not so absolute in their Judgments, but that they have over them another Judge, who may reform them. This Judge is called <hi>Hondim,</hi> which signifies in the <hi>Chinese</hi> Language <hi>the Repairer of Evil</hi>: It is also his Business to repair it by his Decrees, if the other Judges have done any by their Sentences. There is also at Court the <hi>Tompo,</hi> and by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample thereof his Office is erected in the remote Towns.

            <p>This is in generall the account of the <hi>Chinese</hi> Officers: let us now consider in particular the manner, how they worthily perform their Employs. As soon as they are invested therein, they depart to go and exercise them: The Charges of their Journey are at the Kings Expence, so is their House in the place, where they are to make their abode: Which is so vast, that all the Officers of Justice dwell therein, for the convenience of the Publick, and the ready Execution of Judgments. The Salary, which they have besides this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is sufficient for all their Expences, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they ought to content themselves: For to take any Present from the Parties, the Law, so rigorously observed in the Realm, very expressely prohibits them under great Penalties, as also it doth the Parties to give any, who are not p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48275:34"/>
They give them Times for payment: The first Failure is punished by scourging; if they satisfie not at the second time, their Chastisement is doubled; if they are Affronters to the third, they are whipt, till they are bloody, and are kept perpetually in Prison. Which causes, that, when any one is unable to pay his Debts, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plores the Aid of all people to be quit thereof, and if he cannot bring it about in this manner, he gives his Liberty, and sells himself to his Creditors, to avoid the smarting Stripes of the Whip. Now when any Judge appears abroad (which is very seldom, their Custom being to be very retired, by which means, they say, they are less diverted, and better preserve their Authority) he goes accompanied with all the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of Justice: whereof the two first, who go in a breast, carry upon their Shoulders two long Maces of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, for a Sign, that they are Officers of Justice; two others follow them, having each of them in their Hands a long and strait Reed, which they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upright, shewing thereby, that they ought to do right Justice, and that such will be done by the Judge, whom they

attend; these are likewise followed by two Officers, who carry also Reeds, which they draw upon the ground with long red Girdles, these are the Rods, wherewith they scourge such Criminals, as they meet with; the two following carry two white Tables, wherein are written the Name of the Judge, his Office, and his Quality: The rest of the Train are Persons, that follow and accompany the Magistrate, to do him Honor. This Pomp and Formality of Justice is not a vain Ostentation of these Officers, they live as they speak, and are such, as they appear, endued with Vertue, exact and upright in their Employs, and of unblameable Lives.
