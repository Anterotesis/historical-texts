            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>our RATIONAL FACVLTIES, but with great Fury and Zeal declaim against the Study of NA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TVRE, as a thing most dangerous and pernicious; telling us, that too strict an Enquiry into the Works of NATVRE, does often terminate in a Spirit of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism.</hi> But whoever He was that first broach'd this Doctrine, I am sure the true RELIGION is little beholden to him for it; for instead of Obeying the <hi>Jewish Law,</hi> which forbids us to offer up to <hi>God</hi> a Sacrifice that has a Blemish; <hi>He</hi> has only assign'd to <hi>Religion</hi> those Men, who have the greatest Blemish of <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> even a defect in their <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and <hi>Understanding.</hi> Indeed, it cannot but justly provoke any Man of an Ingenious temper, to hear after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner some Men inveigh against REA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON, calling it the Step-Mother of FAITH, and a proclaim'd Rebel against God Almighty; and such declar'd Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s dare harbour it, or so much as appear in its defence. Methinks these Sort of Men Act every whit as foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as <hi>He</hi> who in great wrath should break his <hi>Perspective,</hi> only because it
<pb facs="tcp:61138:5"/>
could not bring home to his view the most remote Objects; and are as unjust as <hi>Jacob</hi> had been, if he had divorc'd from <hi>Leah,</hi> because she was <hi>Tender-Ey'd.</hi> Ever since FAITH and REASON have been by <hi>Divines</hi> set together by the Ears, the brutish Multitude conclude those who are most REASONABLE to be least RELIGIOVS; and the greatest SPIRITS to be the least SPIRITVAL: A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit most inconsistent with that <hi>Divine Parable,</hi> wherein Those who received the <hi>Many Talents,</hi> improv'd them to the best advantage, whilst <hi>He</hi> who had <hi>but One,</hi> laid it up in a <hi>Napkin.</hi> Nor is it probable, that <hi>God</hi> would chuse <hi>low Shrubs,</hi> and not <hi>tall Cedars,</hi> for the Building of his Glorious Temple. And besides, it is remarkable, that <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Old Law</hi> refus'd to accept the First-Born of an Asse in Sacrifice, but not of any other Creature. We have Reason (then) to think, that no Perfection is to be valued at so high a Rate, as a true Freedom and Ingenuity of Mind; 'Tis this that distinguishes <hi>Churches</hi> from <hi>Heards,</hi> as a Modern Author expresses it. And those Men who have laid aside the free and impartial use of their REA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON, are just as fit for RELIGION, as Sheep and Oxen; for they differ only
<pb facs="tcp:61138:6"/>
in this, that the <hi>One</hi> are <hi>Brutes</hi> without REASON, and the <hi>other</hi> Brutes with it. How could the <hi>Scythian</hi> have Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crific'd RATIONAL Beings, had he not first Sacrific'd his own REASON? Or the <hi>Egyptian</hi> adored IRRATIONAL Creatures, had not He himself been one? <hi>Onions</hi> could never have been <hi>Deities,</hi> if <hi>Egyptians</hi> had been <hi>Men</hi>; but when REASON was once banish'd the Temples, no wonder if <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Superstition</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menc'd RELIGION; a <hi>Stock</hi> might be a <hi>Deity,</hi> when the <hi>Priest</hi> was no more. Thus then we see, that unless we make use of our RATIONAL Faculties, we presently cease from Acting like <hi>Men,</hi> nay, <hi>We</hi> do not so much in <hi>our Kind,</hi> as <hi>Beasts</hi> do in <hi>theirs,</hi> who justly obey the Prescrpit of their Natures, and live up to the height of that <hi>Instinct</hi> that Providence hath given them. But, alas! though every Man would be thought to be ANIMAL RATIONALE, yet how few are there who Act as if they really were so! insomuch that it may be truly said, <hi>Humanum paucis vivit genus</hi>; MANKIND is but preserv'd in a few <hi>Individuals</hi>; The greatest part of Men, like the <hi>Serpent,</hi> ly hissing and groveling upon the <hi>Earth,</hi> and their Souls are so fixed in that grosser <hi>Moity</hi> of Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb facs="tcp:61138:6"/>
their <hi>Bodies,</hi> that nothing can Sublimate or Refine them. The numerous <hi>Rabble</hi> that seem to have the Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of <hi>Man</hi> in their Faces, are but <hi>Brutes</hi> in their Vnderstanding, and have nothing of the Nobler part that should denominate their Essences; 'tis by the favour of a <hi>Metaphor,</hi> we call them <hi>Men,</hi> for at the best they are but <hi>Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Cartes</hi>'s AVTOMATA, moving Frames and Figures of Men, and have nothing but their Outsides to justifie their Titles to Rationality.</p>
            <p>Now, having said thus much, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains only, that I apply my self to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother sort of Men, and they are such, who pretend to be wiser and more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than the rest of Mankind: These, I know, will be apt to smile at, and despise many of the Subjects here treated of, as mean and trifling. What! Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain such brave <hi>Heros,</hi> such mighty <hi>Dons,</hi> with an insipid Discourse of PLANTS, INSECTS and REPTILES! away with them, this is an Impertinence not to be bore with. But let these high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown Topping <hi>Sparks</hi> swell and strut as much as they please, I am sure one, who may be allow'd to have a great deal more Wit than Themselves, I mean the Wise <hi>Solomon,</hi> was of another Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
<pb facs="tcp:61138:7"/>
for <hi>he</hi> thought it not beneath him to take notice as well of Abject REP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TILES, as of <hi>Lions, Eagles, Elephants,</hi> and other noble <hi>Animals</hi>; nor did he only write of the tall <hi>Cedars</hi> of <hi>Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> but also of that <hi>Dspicable Plant,</hi> which grows out of the <hi>Wall. Pliny</hi> in his Treatise of INSECTS seems to be transported with an unusual admiration of the Workmanship of NATVRE in them; <hi>Nusquam alibi spectatiore Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae rerum Artificio; In nothing,</hi> saith he, <hi>is the Workmanship of</hi> NATVRE <hi>more remarkable, than in the Contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of these little Creatures.</hi> And after a Wonder, not unworthy a <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher,</hi> He concludes, <hi>Rerum Natura nusquam magis quam in</hi> Minimis <hi>tota est,</hi> NATVRE <hi>in her whole Power is never more wholly seen than in her smallest Works.</hi> And from this very Opinion, in all probability, did <hi>Epicurus</hi> frame his Doctrine of ATOMS. The <hi>Gods,</hi> saith <hi>Aristotle,</hi> are as well in the <hi>least</hi> INSECTS, as in the most <hi>bulky</hi> ANIMALS; and therefore we ought not to despise these <hi>little Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> For on the contrary, as in <hi>Art,</hi> the less room a <hi>Picture</hi> takes up, the more it is esteem'd; so in <hi>Nature,</hi> the less Volume Things are in, the more
<pb facs="tcp:61138:7"/>
worthy they are of Admiration. Much to the same Effect saith that Noble Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher, <hi>Mr. Boyle,</hi> viz. <hi>That Gods Wisdom appears not less in lesser Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, than in the larger; and that there is none of them so little, but would deserve a great deal of our Wonder, did we attentively enough consider it. History</hi> tells us, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelles</hi> was discover'd by the skillful <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoras,</hi> by drawing so fine and slender a Line, that <hi>Protagoras,</hi> by being scarce able to discern it, discover'd it to have been drawn by <hi>Appelles</hi>; even so Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, in these <hi>little Creatures,</hi> does often draw such exquisite and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate Lines and Traces, that nothing less than the <hi>Divine Pencil</hi> could ever have fram'd the like: How can any thing be more stupendious and wonderful, than to see in these <hi>little Creatures</hi> all the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the <hi>largest Animals</hi>? They have the same Organs of Body, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Parts, variety of Motions, diversity of Figures, and severality of Functions with those of the largest Size; And that which is still more wonderful, is, that all these in so narrow a room do neither interfere, nor impede one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in their several Op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61138:8"/>And now, that I may not be too tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, I will close this PREFACE with a word or two, in Answer to one Objection, that this <hi>following Piece</hi> may seem lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to. I know many will think it very ahsurd and preposterous, that I should undertake to write a NATVRAL HISTORY in so small a Volume, and Contract a Subject of the largest Field into so narrow a Compass. But in Answer hereunto I have this to say; that (indeed) had I taken in all things that properly relate to <hi>Natural History,</hi> instead of an <hi>Octavo,</hi> I could easily have swell'd it into a <hi>Folio</hi>; but I consider'd, that by reason of the present Taxes men now are forc'd into good Husbandry, and that the laying out much Money in Books is by most men thought an unnecessary Charge fit to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e retrench'd: wherefore I resolv'd to make my self as <hi>easie</hi> to the <hi>Reader</hi> as I could, by not being too <hi>chargeable</hi> to him; and this I thought was best to be done, by sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling out such <hi>Subjects</hi> only, as I knew con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them matters of the greatest cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity. So that (in a word) my chief De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign is, that by the help of such a <hi>Vade Mecum,</hi> Gentlemen may entertain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon these following <hi>Subjects,</hi> without too great an Expence either of Time, or Money.</p>

               <head>Observations concerning <hi>MUSK.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe MUSK-Cat is a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture almost like a <hi>Goat,</hi> bred in the Kingdom of <hi>Pegu,</hi> in the <hi>Indies</hi>; as also in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and other places. It has been brought into our <hi>Northern</hi> Countries, but through the disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeableness of the Climat, it will not with us yield any MUSK, nor will it live long.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Schroder</hi> says, that MUSK is an Excrement, or matter included in a <hi>Cistis</hi> or <hi>Bladder</hi> about the Navel, while the Creature is full of Venery. When this <hi>Imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sthume</hi> swells much, and puts him to Pain, he rubs it against Stones or Shrubs.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61138:10"/>
and breaks it, upon which the Matter falling it sticks, and, by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Sun-beams, it becomes sweet-scented MUSK.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monsieur Thevenot</hi> tells us, That in the Province of <hi>Azmer,</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Great Mogul,</hi> there is a Beast, like a <hi>Fox</hi> in the Snout, which is no bigger than a <hi>Hare</hi>: The Hair of it, is of the Colour of a <hi>Stags,</hi> and the Teeth like to a <hi>Dogs.</hi> He says, it yields most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent MUSK; for at the Belly it hath a Bladder full of corrupt Blood, and that Blood maketh the MUSK, or is rather the MUSK it self; which they take from it, and immediatly cover the place where the <hi>Bladder</hi> is cut with Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to hinder the Scent from eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating: But after this Operation is made, the Beast is not long-liv'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monsieur Tavernier,</hi> in his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels in <hi>India,</hi> says, That the best sort, and the greatest quantity of MUSK, comes from the Kingdom of <hi>Boutan,</hi> from whence they bring
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61138:10"/>
it to <hi>Patna,</hi> the chief City of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gala,</hi> to truck it away for other Commodities: And that all the MUSK which is Sold in <hi>Persia,</hi> comes from thence: And that the MUSK-Merchants had rather deal with you for <hi>Coral</hi> and <hi>Tellow-Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> than for <hi>Gold</hi> or <hi>Silver</hi>; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the other is more in esteem among the Natives where they live.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tavernier</hi> also tells us, That after they have kill'd the Creature, they cut off the <hi>Bladder</hi> that grows un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Belly, as big as an Egg, nearer to the Genital parts, than to the Navel: And that then they take out the MUSK that is in the <hi>Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> which at that time looks like Clotted-Blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> observes to us, That this Creature is not to be found in 65 degrees, but in 60 there are vast Numbers, the Country being all over cover'd with Forrests. But he says, that in the Months of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> after they have
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61138:11"/>
endur'd a sharp Hunger, by reason of the great Snows that fall where they breed, Ten or Twelve Foot deep, they will come to 44 or 45 degrees to fill themselves with Corn and new Rice. And then it is that the Natives lay Gins and Snares for them, to catch them as they go back: Shooting some with Bows, and knocking others o'the head. Nay, he says, some have assur'd him, That they are so lean and faint with Hunger at that time, that one may almost take them running</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> also informs us, That none of these Creatures have above one <hi>Bladder,</hi> no bigger th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There are three sorts of MUSK, Black, Brown, and Yellow; of which the <hi>First</hi> is naught, the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> is good, the last best; which

               </head>
               <p>THe CIVET-CAT is a Beast almost as big as a good Dog; it hath a sharp Snout, small Eyes, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Ears, and Mustachios like a Cat; the Skin of it is all spotted Black and White, with some yellowish specks, and hath a long bushy Tail, almost like a Fox. It is a very Wild Creature; and I believe the bite of it would put a Man to no small pain. There is great plenty of this sort of Animals in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> but especially in the Kingdom of <hi>Naria,</hi> Tributary to the King of <hi>Aethopia</hi>; where the <hi>Iews</hi> keep them in great square Wooden Cages, feeding them with raw Mutton and Beef, cut into small pieces. When they would get from them that which is call'd CIVET, (and is the Sweat of this Beast, that smells so sweet,) they make him go back with a Stick, which they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61138:13"/>
thrust in betwixt the Bars of the Cage, and catch hold of his Tail; when they have that fast, they take hold also of his two hind Legs, pulling him half out of the Cage by the Door, which falls down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his back, and keeps him fast there, then another opens a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Males</hi> have that piece of Flesh betwixt their Stones and Yard, which is like a Cats. The <hi>Females</hi> have it betwixt their Fundament and Privities; and it is emptied of the Sweat but twice a Week; each Beast yielding about a <hi>Drachm</hi> at a time. When that Sweat or Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is taken out, it is of a whitish Gray, but by little and little in some short space it turns to a very brown Colour. It smells very sweet at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but near hand it stinks, and causes the Head-ach. There are as many Kinds of CIVET-Sweat,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61138:13"/>
as there are of CIVET-CATS, for it is more whitish, grayish, or yellowish, and drier, in some than in others, and yet they mingle all together. After all, it is in vain to think to have pure CIVET, for the <hi>Iews</hi> falsifie it; and if a Man imagine it to be pure, because he has seen it taken from the Beast, he is mistaken; for the <hi>Iews</hi> (before People come to their Houses) rub the inside of that piece of Flesh, with a little Oyl, or some such stuff, that so the Sweat and it together may make more Weight; but when no body is present, they take it out pure, and mingle it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. The <hi>Iews</hi> hold this Beast very dear, the common rate for a CIVET-CAT being an hundred <hi>Chequins. THEVENOT</hi>'s <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, Pag.</hi> 239.</p>

<q>AMBER-GRISE is not the <hi>Scum</hi> or <hi>Excrement</hi> of the <hi>Whale, &amp;c.</hi> but issues out of the Root of a Tree, which Tree how far soever it stands on the Land, always shoots forth its Roots towards the <hi>Sea,</hi> seeking the warmth of it, thereby to deliver the fattest <hi>Gum</hi> that comes out of it: Which Tree otherwise by its copious fatness might be burnt and destroy'd. Where-ever that fat <hi>Gum</hi> is shot into the <hi>Sea,</hi> it is so
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61138:17"/>
tough, that it is not easily broken from the Root, unless its own weight and the working of the warm <hi>Sea</hi> doth it, and so it floats on the Sea.</q>

               <p>Of the Nature and Generation of CORAL, it is affirmed by the Honourable Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> That whilst it grows, it is often found Soft and Succulent, and propagates its <hi>Species.</hi> And by <hi>Georg. de Sepibus,</hi> That of those who had been us'd for many Years to dive for CORAL in the <hi>Red-Sea, Kircher</hi> learned thus much; <hi>That</hi> it would sometimes let fall a <hi>Spermatick</hi> Juice, which light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon any [<hi>Steady</hi>] body, would thereupon produce another CO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAL.

The <hi>Occidental</hi> is rough without, Whitish, Ash-Colour'd, Black, or Blackish Green, and generally big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than the former.</p>
               <p>BEZOAR, (says <hi>Tavernier</hi>) comes from a Province of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Golconda,</hi> toward the <hi>North-East.</hi> It is found among the Ordure in the Paunch of a <hi>Wild-Goat,</hi> that browzes upon a certain Tree, the Name whereof <hi>Tavernier</hi> had forgot. This Shrub bears lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Buds, round about which, and the Tops of the Boughs, the BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZOAR Engenders in the Maw of the <hi>Goat.</hi> It is shap'd according to the form of the Buds, or Tops of the Branches or which the <hi>Goats</hi> eat: Which is the reason there are so many shapes of BEZOAR Stones.</p>
               <p>The Natives (as <hi>Tavernier</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us) know by feeling the Belly of the <hi>Goat,</hi> how many Stones she has within, and sell the <hi>Goat</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the quantity. This they will find out by slideing their hands
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61138:23"/>
under their Bellies, and then shak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both sides of the Paunch; for the Stones will fall into the middle, where they may easily count them all by their feeling.</p>
               <p>The rarity of BEZOAR is in the bigness; though the small BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZOAR has the same Virtue as that which is larger. But there is more deceit in the large BEZOAR; for the Natives have got a trick to add to the bigness of the Stone, with a certain Paste compos'd of <hi>Gum,</hi> and something else of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of BEZOAR. And they are so cunning too, to shape it just like Natural BEZOAR. The cheat is found out two ways; the <hi>first</hi> is by weighing the BEZOAR, and then sleeping it in warm Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: If neither the Water change Colour, nor the BEZOAR lose any thing of its Weight, the Stone is right. The other way is to thrust a red hot Bodkin of Iron into the Stone; If the Bodkin enters, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61138:23"/>
causes it to fry, there is a mixture. <hi>TAVERN. Trav. in</hi> India, <hi>Pag.</hi> 153, 154.</p>

               <p>As for the BEZOAR which breeds in <hi>Apes,</hi> as some believe it, it is so strong, that two Grains work as effectually, as Six of <hi>Goat</hi>'s-BEZOAR: B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THere are divers sorts of PEP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PER; <hi>viz. Black, White,</hi> and <hi>Long</hi> PEPPER. The <hi>Black</hi> is the commonest.</p>
               <p>The Plant that beareth the <hi>Black</hi> PEPPER, groweth up like a <hi>Vine</hi> among Bushes and Brambles, where it naturally grows; but where it is manur'd, it is Sown at the bottom of some Tree, where it climbs up to the top. The Leaves are few in Number, growing at each joint one, first on one side of the Stalk, then on the other, like in shape to the long undivided Leaves of <hi>Ivy,</hi> but thinner, and broader.</p>
               <p>The Plant that bears <hi>White</hi> PEP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PER is not to be distinguish'd from the other, but only by the Colour of the Fruit; no more than a <hi>Vine</hi> that beareth <hi>Black</hi> Grapes, from that which bringeth <hi>White:</hi> And by some it is thought, that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61138:32"/>
the self same Plant does sometimes change it self from <hi>Black</hi> to <hi>White.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Tree that beareth <hi>long</hi> PEP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PER, is quite different from the Two former, and grows in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Country. It is much hotter than the common' <hi>Black</hi> PEPPER, yet sweeter, and of better taste. <hi>GERRARD</hi>'s <hi>Herbal.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Tavernier</hi> says, there are two sorts of PEPPER; one is very small, another sort much bigger; both which sorts are distinguish'd into <hi>Small</hi> and <hi>Great</hi> PEPPER. The <hi>larger</hi> sort comes from the Coast of <hi>Malavare</hi>; and <hi>Tuticorin</hi> and <hi>Calicut</hi> are the Cities where it is brought up. Some of this PEP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PER comes from the Territories of the King of <hi>Visapour,</hi> being ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at <hi>Rejapour,</hi> a little City in that Kingdom.

                  <hi>Ligon</hi> says, that in the Island of <hi>Barbadoes</hi> there is a kind of <hi>Red</hi> PEPPER, which is of two sorts; the <hi>one</hi> so like a Childs <hi>Coral,</hi> as not to be discern'd at the distance of two paces; a Crimson and Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let mixt; the Fruit about two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches long, and shines more than the best Polisht <hi>Coral.</hi> The <hi>Other</hi> of the same Colour, and glistering as much, but shap't like a large Button of a Cloak; both of one and the same Quality; both so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently strong, that when they break but the Skin, it sends out such a vapour into their Lungs, as makes them fall a Coughing, which lasts a quarter of an hour after the Fruit is remov'd; but, as long as they are garbling it, they never give over.

The Leaf, Bark, and Wood being Green, is as strong as the CLOVE. When the Blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soms are Green, they have the pleasantest smell in the World. The right Colour of CLOVES, when they are dry, is a dark Yellow, and to give them a black Colour they are commonly smoakt. The CLOVES are gathering from <hi>September</hi> unto the End of <hi>February,</hi> not with hands, as we gather Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Cherries, and such like Fruit, but by beating the Tree, as we do <hi>Walnuts.</hi> The CLOVES that stay on the Tree ungather'd are

The time when they are most gather'd, and begun to be dried, is in <hi>December</hi> and <hi>Ianuary</hi>: They dry it in this manner; They cover it with Pot-Earth, which they do to stop and fill up the Holes, thereby to make it continue the fresher; for the Pot-Earth preserves it from Worms,

               <p>Mr. <hi>Ligon</hi> says, that in <hi>Barbadoes</hi> the GINGER (being a Root) brings forth Blades, not unlike in shape to the Blades of Wheat, but broader and thicker, for they cover the Ground so, that one cnanot see any part of it. They are of a <hi>Popinjay</hi> Colour, the Blossom a pure <hi>Scarlet.</hi> When 'tis ripe, they dig up the Roots, (cutting off the Blades,) and put them into the Hands of an Overseer, who sets many of the Young <hi>Negroes</hi> to scrape them with little Knives, or small Iron Spuds, ground to an edge. They are to scrape all the outward Skin off, to <hi>kill the Spirit</hi>; for, without that, it will perpetually grow. Those that have GINGER, and not hands to dress it thus, are compell'd
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61138:37"/>
to scald it, to <hi>kill the Spirit</hi>; and that GINGER is nothing so good as the other, for it will be as hard as Wood, and Black, whereas the scrapt GINGER is White and soft, and hath a cleaner and quicker taste. <hi>LIGON</hi>'s <hi>Hist. of</hi> Barbadoes <hi>Pag.</hi> 79.</p>

               <p>The MANNA of <hi>Calabria,</hi> is the best, and in most Plenty. They gather it from the <hi>Leaf</hi> of the <hi>Mulberry</hi> Tree; but not of such <hi>Mulberry</hi> Trees, as grow in the <hi>Vallies.</hi> And MANNA falleth upon the Leaves by Night, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Dews</hi> do. It is very likely, that before those <hi>Dews</hi> come upon the Trees in the <hi>Vallies,</hi> they dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate, and cannot hold out. And, in all probability, the <hi>Mulberry</hi> Leaf hath some <hi>Coagulating</hi> Virtue, which thickens the <hi>Dew,</hi> for that it is not found upon other Trees: And we see
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61138:38"/>
by the <hi>Silk-Worm,</hi> which feedeth upon that Leaf, what a dainty smooth <hi>Iuice</hi> it hath; and the Leaves also, (especially of the <hi>Black Mulberry,</hi>) are somewhat Bristly, which (possibly) may help to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the <hi>Dew.</hi> Certainly, it were not amiss, to observe a little better the <hi>Dews</hi> that fall upon Trees, or Herbs, growing on <hi>Mountains</hi>: For it may be, many <hi>Dews</hi> fall, that spend before they come to the <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</hi> And I suppose, that he that would gather the best <hi>May-Dew</hi> for <hi>Medicine,</hi> should gather it from the <hi>Hills.

               <p>The Learned and Ingenious Mr. <hi>Evelyn,</hi> says, that the MANNA of <hi>Calabria</hi> is found to exsude out of the Leaves and Boughs of the <hi>Ash.</hi> This is also confirm'd by Mr. <hi>Iohn Ray,</hi> in his <hi>Historia Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, Vol.</hi> 2. <hi>Pag.</hi> 1703.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Christophorus Vega</hi> Writes, that MANNA is made by a sort of little <hi>Bees</hi> like thick <hi>Gnats,</hi> from whom, sitting by Swarms upon

Trees, <hi>Sweat</hi> as it were drops from them. But <hi>Sennertus Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 8. thinks, that they are rather drawn thither by the Sweetness of the MANNA, and that they make it not.</p>
               <p>It hath been controverted among the Learned, whether the <hi>Iews</hi> MANNA was the same with <hi>Ours</hi>? They do indeed in many Things agree, but in this they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that <hi>Theirs,</hi> ground in a Mill, or bruis'd in a Mortar, was fit to make <hi>Wafers.</hi> If it be not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, MANNA will melt with any Sun; for even an <hi>Easterly</hi> Sun will dissolve it.</p>
               <p>We read in <hi>Scaliger, Exercit.</hi> 164. that those Shepherds that frequent the Desarts of <hi>Targa,</hi> use MAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NA instead of <hi>Sugar,</hi> with the Water which they drink. <hi>IOH.

               <p>INDIGO comes from several Parts of the Great <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; and according to the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of the Place it differs in Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and consequently in price.</p>
               <p>In the first place, it comes from the Territories of <hi>Biana, Indoua,</hi> and <hi>Corsa,</hi> a Day or two's Journey from <hi>Agra</hi>: Which is esteem'd the best of all.

               </p>
               <p>INDIGO is made of an <hi>Herb,</hi> which they sow every Year after the Rains are over: Which when it is grown up, is very like our <hi>Hemp.</hi> They cut it three several times; the first cutting far exceeds the two latter. The Second cutting is worse than the First by Ten or Twelve in the Hundred. And the Third worse than the Second by Twelve in the Hundred. The difference is found by breaking a piece of the Paste, and observing the Colour. The Colour of that INDIGO which is made of the First cutting, is a <hi>Violet-Blue,</hi> but more brisk and lively than the two others: And that which is made of the Second, is more lively than the Third.</p>
               <p>When they have cut the <hi>Herb,</hi> they throw it into Pits which they make with <hi>Lime,</hi> which becomes so hard, that you would judge it to be one entire piece of <hi>Marble.</hi> They are generally 80 or 100 Paces
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61138:48"/>
in Circuit; and being half full of Water, they fill them quite up with the <hi>Herb.</hi> Then they bruise and jumble it in the Water, till the Leaf (for the Stalk is worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) becomes like a kind of thick Mud. This being done, they let it settle for some days; and when the settling is all at the bottom, and the Water clear above, they let out all the Water. When the Water is all drain'd out, they fill several Baskets with this Slime, and in a plain Field you shall see several Men at work, every one at his own Basket, making up little pieces of INDIGO flat at the bottom, at the top sharp like an Egg. Though at <hi>Amadabat</hi> they make their pieces quite flat like a small Cake. Here you are to take particular notice, that the Merchants, because they would not pay <hi>Custom</hi> for an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary Weight, before they trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their INDIGO out of <hi>Asia</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Europe,</hi> are very careful to cause it to be sifted, to separate the Dust

from it; which they sell afterwards to the <hi>Natives</hi> of the Country to Dye their <hi>Calicuts. TAVERN. of the Commodities belonging to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of the</hi> Great Mogul.</p>

                  <hi>Philippus Baldaeus,</hi> in his Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of some of the Chief Parts of the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> says, That the Plant, which yields the INDIGO, beareth a Flower like that of <hi>Thistles,</hi> and a Seed like that of <hi>Faenum Graecum</hi>: He says, That the principal Marks of good INDIGO are, dryness, lightness, and swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on Water; yielding a high <hi>Violet-Colour</hi>; and when put upon live Coals, giving a <hi>Violet</hi> Smoak, and leaving but few Ashes: <hi>That</hi> the INDIGO Merchant is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of buying moist INDIGO, because he will then find, that in Eight Days time he loses three Pounds in Ten; <hi>That</hi> the best way is to try it in a clear Sun-Shine, by breaking some Lumps in pieces, and viewing them well, whether there can be observ'd in them any

thing that glistens; which if there be, one may be sure there is Sand in it, with which it hath been so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisticated, to increase the Weight. But for the greater assurance of the goodness of INDIGO, his Advice is, to pass the Nail of ones Thumb over the broken pieces, and if it be good, it will be of a <hi>Violet</hi>-Colour, and the higher that Colour, the better the INDIGO.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monsieur Tavernier</hi> says, That the penetrancy of the Powder of IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIGO is such, that all the while they are sisting it, they are fain to keep a Linnen Cloth before their Faces, and to stop their Nostrils, leaving only two little holes for their Eyes: And that besides, they are forc'd every half Hour to drink Milk, which they find to be a great Preservative against the pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Quality of the Dust: And that notwithstanding all this caution, they yet often find, that having been for Nine or Ten Days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther employ'd about this Work,

whatever they spit for a good while is Blueish. And <hi>He</hi> also tells us, That one Morning he laid an Egg among the Sisters, and when he came to break it in the Evening, it was all Blue within.</p>

               <p>This Tree requires to be shelter'd from the Sun while 'tis Young, and always from the North-East Winds; and to have a fat, moist, low Soil, which makes them to be Planted commonly by Rivers and between Mountains: So that 'tis ill living where there are good CACAO-Walks.

               <p>IN the Twelve-Days they begin to Sow their Seed in Beds of fine Mould, and when the Plants be grown to the breadth of a Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, they are fit to Replant into the Hills; for in their Plantations they make small Hills about four Foot distant from each other, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what after the manner of our <hi>Hop-Yards</hi>; these Hills being prepared against the Plants be grown to the forementioned bigness (which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the beginning of <hi>May,</hi>) they then in moist Weather draw the Plants out of their Beds, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant them in the Hills, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they keep with diligent Weedings. When the Plant hath put out so many Leaves as the Ground will nourish to a substance and largeness that will render them Merchantable, then they take off the top of the Plant; if the Ground
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61138:72"/>
be very rich, they let a Plant put out a dozen or sixteen Leaves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they top it; if mean, then not above nine or ten, and so according to the strength of their Soyl, the top being taken if the Plant grows no higher; but afterwards it will put out Suckers between their Leaves, which they pluck away once a Week, till the Plant comes to perfection, which it doth in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust.</hi> Then, in dry Weather, when there is a little Breeze of Wind, they cut down what is Ripe, letting it lye about four hours on the Ground, till such time as the Leaves, that stood strutting out, fall down to the Stalk, then they carry it on their Shoulders into their TOBACCO-Houses, where other Servants receiving it, drive into the Stalk of each Plant a Peg, and as fast as they are pegg'd, they hang them up by the Peggs on TOBACCO-Sticks, so nigh each other that they just touch, much after the manner they hang <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:61138:73"/>
in <hi>Yarmouth</hi>; thus they let them hang five or six Weeks, till such time as the Stem in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Leaf will snap in the bending of it; then, when the Air hath so moistned the Leaf, as that it may be handled without break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they strike it down, strip it off the Stalk, bind it up in Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, and pack it into Hogsheads for use.</p>
               <p>Sometimes they are forced to Plant their Hills twice or thrice over, by reason of an <hi>Earth-Worm,</hi> which eats the Root; and when the Plant is well grown, they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer damage by a <hi>Worm</hi> that devours the Leaf, called a <hi>Horn Worm,</hi> (an <hi>Eruca</hi> or <hi>Caterpill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now under these Rowlers is set a Receiver, as a Trough, Cistern, or the like convenient thing, to receive the Juice or Liquor that is squeez'd out of the CANES: And from this Trough or Cistern, is a Spout to convey this Juice into the Furnaces or Coppers, where it is to be boyl'd to SUGAR; whereas, in some SUGAR-Houses, there are five or six Coppers for that purpose, which are commonly set in a House built only for the same use, at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the Mill; and also some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what lower than the Mill, because the Liquor is always running down into the Coppers: All which Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages

               <head>Observations concerning PEARL.</head>
               <p>IN the first place, there is a Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery for PEARLS in the <hi>Persian</hi> Gulf, round about the Island of <hi>Bakren.</hi> Every one that fishes pays to the King of <hi>Persia</hi> five <hi>Abassi</hi>'s, (every <hi>Abassi</hi> is worth about 18 <hi>Sols</hi> French Money) whether he get any thing or no. The Merchant also pays the King some small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for every thousand <hi>Oysters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second Fishery for PEARLS is right against <hi>Bakren</hi> upon the Coast of <hi>Arabia Felix,</hi> near the City of <hi>Catifa,</hi> which together with all the Country about it, is under the Jurisdiction of an <hi>Arabian</hi> Prince. The PEARLS that are fish'd in these Places are sold to the <hi>Indians,</hi> who (as <hi>Tavernier</hi> informs us) are not so nice as we; for they give a good price for all, as well the <hi>uneven</hi> as the <hi>round</hi> ones.</p>
               <p>There is another Fishery for PEARLS in the Sea that beats a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:61138:84"/>
the Walls of a great Town call'd <hi>Manar,</hi> in the Island of <hi>Cey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan.</hi> For their <hi>roundness</hi> and their <hi>Water,</hi> they are the fairest that are found in any other Fishery; but they rarely weigh above three or four <hi>Carats.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are excellent PEARLS, and of a very good Water, and large, which are found upon the Coast of <hi>Iapan</hi>; but there are few fish'd for, in regard <hi>Iewels</hi> are of no esteem among the Natives.</p>
               <p>There are other Fisheries, in the <hi>West-Indies</hi>; in the first place all along the Island of <hi>Cubagna,</hi> three Leagues in compass, lying ten De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and a half of Northern Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, a hundred and sixty Leagues from <hi>Santo Domingo.</hi> The PEARLS are small, seldom weighing above five <hi>Carats.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second Fishery is in the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sland of <hi>Margarita,</hi> or the Island of PEARLS, a League from <hi>Cubagna,</hi> but much bigger. This Fishery is not the most plentiful, but it is the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:61138:85"/>
most esteem'd of all those in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> by reason the PEARLS are of a most excellent Water, and very large. <hi>Tavernier</hi> says, He sold one <hi>Pear</hi>-fashion'd to <hi>Sha-est-Kan,</hi> the Great <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Uncle, that weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fifty five <hi>Carats.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Fishery is at <hi>Camogete,</hi> near the Continent.</p>
               <p>The fourth at <hi>Rio de la H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The fifth and last, at St. <hi>Martha</hi>'s, sixty Leagues from <hi>Rio de la Hacha.</hi> All these three Fisheries produce ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weighty PEARLS; but they are generally ill shap'd, and of a Water enclining to the Colour of Lead.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Scotch</hi> PEARL, and those that are found in the Rivers of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia,</hi> though a <hi>Neck-lace</hi> of them may be worth a thousand Crowns, yet they are not to be c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

says, <hi>He</hi> has seen some which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have brought thence; They are of a very good Water, and large, but very uneven. <hi>TAVERN. Trav. in</hi> India, Part II. Book II. Chap. xvii.</p>
               <p>Over all <hi>Asia</hi> they chuse the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Water inclining to white; for they say, those PEARLS that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline somewhat to a Gold Colour, are more brisk, and never change Colour; but that the white ones will change in Thirty Years time, through the very heat of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Sweat of the Person that wears them, turning them scandalously yellow.</p>
               <p>Take this Observation along with you, touching the difference of their Waters; some being very White, others inclining to Yellow, others to Black, others to a Leaden Colour. As for the last, there are no such, but only in <hi>America,</hi> which proceeds from the Nature of the Earth, at the bottom of the Water; which is generally more Ouzy than
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61138:86"/>
in the <hi>East.</hi> I once met with Six PEARLS, in the return of a Cargo from the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> that were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly round, but black like <hi>Iet,</hi> which weigh'd one with another Twelve <hi>Carats.</hi> I carried them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>East-Indies</hi> to put them off, but could meet with no Chapman to buy them. As for those that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to Yellow, it proceeds from hence, that the Fishermen selling the Oysters to the Merchants in heaps, while they stay Fourteen or Fifteen Days, till the Oysters lose their Water, the Oysters wast and begin to smell, for which reason the PEARL grows Yellow by Infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which appears to be a Truth, in regard that where the Oysters preserve their Liquor, the PEARLS are White. Now the Reason why they stay till the Oysters open of themselves, is, because that if they should force them open, they might perhaps injure and cut the PEARL. In short, the <hi>Eastern</hi> People are much of our Humour, in matter
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:61138:86"/>
of <hi>Whiteness,</hi> for they love the whitest PEARLS and the blackest <hi>Diamonds</hi>; the whitest Bread, and the fairest Women. <hi>TAVERN. Ibid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some Ancient Writers have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Reported, that PEARLS are produc'd by the Dew of Heaven, and that there is but one in an Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster; but Experience teaches the contrary. For the Oyster never stirs from the bottom of the <hi>Sea,</hi> where the Dew can never come, which is many times Twelve Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms deep; besides, that it is as often observ'd, that there are Six or Seven PEARLS in one Oyster; and I have had in my hands an Oyster, wherein there were above Ten beginning to breed. 'Tis very true, that they are not always of the same bigness; for they grow in an Oyster after the same manner as <hi>Eggs</hi> in the Belly of a P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:61138:87"/>
Money at three or four in the Hundred a Month. So that unless a Thousand Oysters yield them five <hi>Fano</hi>'s of PEARLS, they do not Fish that Year. As for the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, they must buy their Oysters at hap-hazard, and be content with what they find in them. If they meet with great PEARLS, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count themselves happy; which they seldom do at the Fishery of <hi>Manar,</hi> those <hi>Pearls</hi> being sit for little else but to be sold by the Ounce, to Powder. Sometimes a Thousand Oysters amounts to seven <hi>Fano</hi>'s, and the whole Fishery to a Hundred Thousand <hi>Piasters,</hi> (every <hi>Piaster</hi> being worth four Shillings <hi>Sterling.</hi>) The <hi>Hollanders</hi> take of every <hi>Diver</hi> 8 <hi>Piasters,</hi> in regard they always attend the Fishery with two or three small Men of War, to defend them from the <hi>Malavares</hi> Pyrats.</p>

               <p>There goes a Common Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that PEARL, which hath lost its Colour, may be recover'd by <hi>being buried in the Earth</hi>; which if true, would (as the <hi>Lord Bacon</hi> Observes) be a thing of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage:

For he having one that weigh'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four Ounces and a half arm'd, which would take up Sixteen times its own Weight: And having laid it by for the space of some Years unus'd, found it to have lost one Fourth part of its strength, so that it would now take up but about three Pound; and, upon search, meeting with no Means Effectual to recover it; consider'd with himself,

That as in <hi>Morals,</hi> the Exercise of Virtue, makes it more generous; and that <hi>Animal</hi> Motions, by use, become more Vigorous: So it might possibly prove also as to some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of <hi>Inanimate</hi> Bodies. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, he hung as much at his Stone, as it would bear; and so left it for the space of some Weeks. Then, returning to it, and applying more Weight to the former, it very easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly held the same. And repeating the Addition of more Weight, at several Periods, in the space of about Two Years; He at last found, That his Stone had not only recover'd its former strength, but encreas'd it; for whereas before he had never known it to take up more than Sixteen, it would now take up Twenty times its own Weight. And he is now continuing the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, to see how far it will go further. <hi>GREW</hi>'s <hi>Mus. Reg. Societ.</hi> pag. 317, 318.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Reason of which difference may probably be, that some of these PETRIFYING Steams or Atoms, may be gross and more bulky, than some others are, and cannot be held up in the watry <hi>Vehicle,</hi> without such a Heat as they have under

               <p>Among the several Kinds of the PETRESCENT Liquors, I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served a sort that is of so fine a Substance, and yet of so PETRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FYING a Vertue, that it will Penetrate and PETRIFY Bodies of

very different Kinds, and yet scarce, if at all, visibly increase their bulk, or change their Shape or Colour.

                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:61138:116"/>
the SALT is made more or less white. The Reddish Earth maketh the SALT more Gray; the Blue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish more white. Besides, if you let run in a little more Water than you ought, the SALT becomes thence more White; but then it yields not so much. Generally all the <hi>Marishes</hi> require a fat Earth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spungy, nor Sandy.</p>
               <p>Unless it rain much, the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water does little hurt to the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish</hi>; and although it rain a day or a night, they do not let the Water which is in the <hi>Marish</hi> run out, the heat of the Sun sufficiently exhaling such Rain-Water. Only, if it have rain'd very plentifully that day, no SALT is drawn for the three or four next following days. But if it rain five or six days, the People are then necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to empty all the Water of the Beds by a peculiar Channel, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighing it into the Sea; which Channel cannot be opened, but when 'tis low Water. But 'tis very seldom
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:61138:116"/>
that it rains so long, as to constrain them to empty those Beds.</p>
               <p>'Tis Obvious that the hottest Years make the most SALT; where yet it is to be noted, that besides the heat of the Sun, the Winds contribute much to it, in regard that less SALT is made in calm, than in Windy Weather. The West and North-West Winds are the best for this Purpose.</p>
               <p>In the Beds of the <hi>Marish,</hi> where the SALT is made, the Water must not be above an Inch and an half deep. Each of these Beds is fifteen Foot long, and fourteen Foot broad.

               <p>SILVER is the most Perfect of all <hi>Mettals</hi> Except <hi>Gold,</hi> whereunto it comes so near, as to want nothing but the Colour; and therefore those that most of all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Opinion of the <hi>Transmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Mettals</hi> one into another, do yet hold it possible to turn SIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VER into <hi>Gold,</hi> because the Colour only being wanting, the Fire and Artificial Concoctions can supply that, whereof there be many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments: From the good Mixture and Fineness of its Parts, proceeds its induring the Fire with very little waste, as also its being Tough and Malleable, and endures the drawing out into very Thin Leaves, and small Wyre; if it were not a Common Trade to do it, it would not be believ'd to be possible, that
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:61138:124"/>
an Ounce of SILVER should be Drawn out into Fourteen Hundred Yards of Wyre; and it is yet more admirable, that all <hi>that</hi> shall be made Guilt Wyre, with only six Grains of <hi>Gold</hi>; So that although SILVER can be Extended to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, yet <hi>Gold</hi> is a Hundred times more <hi>Ductile</hi> than it. <hi>BARBA of</hi> Mettals, <hi>Chap.</hi> 27.</p>

               <p>How these Rich Mines of <hi>Potozi</hi> came first to be discover'd since it was a thing somewhat Remarkable, I shall here give an account: The manner (therefore) of this Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was as followeth.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Peruvian</hi> call'd <hi>Gualpa,</hi> who Work'd at the Mines of <hi>Porco,</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Hunting, it chanc'd that the Game ran up the steep Mountain of <hi>Potosii,</hi> which prevented his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:61138:125"/>
this Agreement between them, that they should both be Partners, and share the Booty; <hi>Gualpa</hi> was to keep the <hi>Vein,</hi> since call'd the <hi>Rich Vein.</hi> and <hi>Guanca</hi> was to have another, at Present Nam'd <hi>Diego Centeno</hi>: But they agreed not long; for <hi>Guanca</hi> finding much Labour upon his Vein, by reason of the hardness, and that he could get no share in what <hi>Gualpa</hi> got, acquainted his <hi>Spanish</hi> Master <hi>Vilaroel</hi> with it, who rested not till he had sound out the truth thereof; for which <hi>Valaroel</hi> obtain'd (according to the Custome of <hi>Porco</hi>) several Rods to work for him, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Paying the <hi>King</hi> one fifth Part of what he got, and so remain'd owner of the Mine <hi>Centeno.</hi>

Causes, saith the <hi>Dr.</hi> may be vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, either Simple, or Compound: As the meer Corruption of the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Air alone upon a long <hi>Stagna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in the <hi>Coal</hi>-Rooms, and the Rifts and Clists of the Rock of <hi>Coal</hi> it self, may be its <hi>Material</hi> Cause indeed; but the <hi>Causa sine qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> non</hi> of such a <hi>Damp,</hi> he takes to be the want of motion in those Cavities, without which, the <hi>Air</hi> would never have Corrupted; no more than <hi>Water</hi> which never Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts till it Stagnates, when indeed like the <hi>Air</hi> it becomes poysonous, tho' possibly not to that Degree, the <hi>Air</hi> being a Body much finer, and convey'd to the more tender parts of the Body. Whence it is, that in the <hi>Old Works,</hi> wherein there has been no digging for a long time, no laveing, drawing, or pumping of Water, all which keep the <hi>Air</hi> in motion, and the <hi>Water</hi> from Cankering, these DAMPS are most frequent and most dangerous. Whence it is too, that the <hi>Works</hi>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:61138:131"/>
where the Bed of Coal is thin, and admits of but few or no such Rifts or Clefts for the <hi>Air</hi> to Stagnat or Corrupt in, are seldom or never troubled with them. Upon which account 'tis likewise, that tho' a Bed of Coal have many of these Rifts, and large Ones too; yet as long as there is a profluence of <hi>Water</hi> through them, there is no Danger of their Entertaining such DAMPS; which as soon as made dry by a <hi>Sough</hi> or <hi>Free-Level,</hi> the same <hi>Mine</hi> shall become much more lyable to them; the wholesome <hi>Air</hi> that was in them whilst kept in motion by the <hi>Flux</hi> of the <hi>Water</hi> (having little or no Communication with that above Ground) now Stagnating and Corrupting to that Degree, that it not only extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes the glowing heat of Coals, and the Flame of Candles, Torches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the <hi>Flammula Vitae</hi> too in most living Creatures, so that the <hi>Animal</hi> which respires it, sometimes

                  <hi>Subterraneous</hi> Waters are at the lowest. They fancy, it proceeds from the multitude of Red <hi>Trifoil</hi> Flowers, by them call'd <hi>Honey-Suckles,</hi> with which the Lime-Stone Meadows of the <hi>Peak</hi> (where they have this sort of DAMP) do much abound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dr. Plot</hi> says, that he enqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'d concerning this <hi>Sort</hi> in the East part of <hi>Staffordshire,</hi> where the <hi>Moore-Lands</hi> bound upon the <hi>Peak-Country</hi> of <hi>Darbyshire,</hi> and found it not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there, but as far as he could learn, to be the most common DAMP in the Country, it making their Candles first to diminish, to burn round, and at length to go out, persuming the <hi>Stauls</hi> at the same time with a faint Sweet smell, as those in <hi>Darbyshire</hi> do, only with this Difference, that these in <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordshire</hi> are said to be sometimes visible, shewing like a <hi>thin Smoak</hi> which may be seen not only in the <hi>Groves,</hi> but fuming out at the top of the Pit. But in <hi>Staffordshire</hi>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:61138:132"/>
(says <hi>Dr. Plot</hi>) they are wiser (where they go for their <hi>Coal</hi> Forty or Fifty Yards deep, and have no such thing us <hi>Trefoil,</hi> for many Miles, and yet have this DAMP,) than to think it proceeds either from <hi>Pease</hi> or <hi>Trefoil</hi>; it being rather appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended to arise from the Workmens Breath and Sweat, mixt with the Steams of the Golden <hi>Marchasite</hi> or Brass Lumps, than any thing else.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Third</hi> sort of DAMP is the strangest, and most Pestilential of any, if all be true which is said concerning it. Those who pretend to have seen it (for it is visible) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe it thus: In the highest part of the Roof of those Passages, which Branch out from the main <hi>Grove,</hi> they often see a round thing hanging, about the bigness of a Foot-ball, cover'd with a Skin of the thickness and Colour of a <hi>Cob-Web</hi>: This, they say, if by any Accident, as the Splinter of a Stone, or the like, if it be broken, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:61138:133"/>
disperseth it self, and Suffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates all the Company. Therefore to prevent Casualties, as soon as ever they espie it, they say, they have a way, by the help of a Stick and a long Rope, of breaking it at a distance; which done, they pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the place well by Fire, before they dare enter it again. Mr. <hi>Ies<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sop</hi> says, He dares not avouch the Truth of this Story in all its Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances; because the Proof of it seems impossible, since they say, it kills all that are likely to bear Witness to all the Particulars: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dares He deny, but such a thing may have been seen hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Roof, since He has heard many affirm it. Perhaps the General Tradition they have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, hath made them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe all Strange and Surprizing <hi>Effects</hi> unto this <hi>Cause.</hi> They are not without a Reason for it, which is not altogether irrational, if the Matter of Fact be true; for they say, the Steam which arises from
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:61138:133"/>
their Bodies and the Candles, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends unto the highest part of the <hi>Vault,</hi> and there condenseth, and in time hath a <hi>Filme</hi> grows round about it, and at length Corrupting becomes Pestilential: Thus (saith Mr. <hi>Iessop</hi>) have I heard many of our <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Ground Philosophers</hi> Discourse.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> which they also call a DAMP (although how properly, I will now not argue) is that <hi>Vapour,</hi> which being touch'd by their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, presently takes Fire, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Crack like a Gun, produceth the like Effects, or rather those of Lightning. Hence it is commonly call'd the <hi>Fulminating</hi> DAMP. <hi>PHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOS. TRANSACT. Numb.</hi> 117. pag. 391, 392.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Iessop,</hi> in a Letter to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Mr. <hi>Oldenburg,</hi> concerning a further Account of DAMPS, says, That DAMPS are most generally observ'd to come about the latter End of <hi>May,</hi> and to continue dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Heat of Summer, and in those places, which have DAMPS
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:61138:134"/>
all the Year long, yet they observe them to be most violent at that Season: And that <hi>He</hi> could meet with no other certain Rule for any <hi>Periodical</hi> returns, except this <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual</hi>; although it be certain they do often return in the same Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> also saith, There are some DAMPS that will quite extinguish all those Fires that are let down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, be they never so many Successively, or never so great; and Fire is observ'd to be so far from Curing, that it often creates DAMPS in places not otherwise Subject to them. Indeed they are a present Remedy, if you can so order them, as by their help to make a Circula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To that Opinion of the <hi>Italian Francisco Redi,</hi> viz. <hi>That some live Plants or their Excrescencies do truly generate some INSECTS,</hi> I told my Friend, as I Remember, that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed had observ'd, that the By-Fruits of some <hi>Vegetables,</hi> as of the <hi>Oak</hi> and <hi>Wild-Rose,</hi> for Example, did grow up together with their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective <hi>Worms</hi> in them, from small Beginnings to fair and large Fruit, some of them Emulating even the <hi>Genuin Off-spring</hi> of the Plant,
<q>—Et miratur non sua poma.</q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:61138:138"/>And further, that I did believe, the <hi>Worms</hi> were furnish'd with food in and from them; but not by any <hi>Naval</hi>-Connexion, as that Author fancies, and which I said, to me was unintelligible, and that I should be glad of a Notion, which might make out to me such a monstrous Relation, as <hi>half Animal, half Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable,</hi> or, which is all one, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable</hi> Vessels inserted into an <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,</hi> or, the Contrary.

               <p>That I ever found the <hi>Worms</hi> in all the <hi>Excrescencies,</hi> that I had

yet met with, perfectly at liberty; and for the <hi>Filaments, our Author</hi> mentions, it was very possible he might be mistaken, it being very hard, and a matter not yet Treated of in any Publick Paper, <hi>which</hi> and <hi>what</hi> are the Vessels that enter into the Texture of a <hi>Vegetable,</hi> as of a large Tree, for Example, much more hard would it be to say, this is a Vessel in a small <hi>Gall.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:61138:139"/>I have for my own Particular, besides several of those mention'd by the diligent <hi>Goedartius,</hi> observ'd divers other Circumstances, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, not much taken notice of, though very Common, which do indeed afford us a very Coercive Argument to admire the Goodness and Providence of the Infinitely Wise Creator, in his most Excellent Contrivances and Dispensations. I have observ'd at several times of the Summer, that many of the Leaves of divers Plants, have been spotted, or, as it were scabbed, and looking on the under-sides of those of them that have been but a little irregular, I have perceiv'd them to be sprinkl'd with divers sorts of little <hi>Eggs,</hi> which letting alone, I have found by degrees to grow bigger, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come little <hi>Worms</hi> with Legs, but still to keep their former Places, and those Places of the Leaves, of ther own accords, to be grown very Protuberant upwards, and very hollow, and arch'd underneath,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:61138:139"/>
whereby those Young Creatures, are, as it were, shelter'd and hous'd from External Injury; divers Leaves I have observ'd to grow and swell so far, as at length perfectly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close the <hi>Animal,</hi> which by other Observations I have made, I guess to contain it, and become, as it were a womb to it, so long till it be fit and prepar'd to be Translated into another State, at which time, like (what they say of) <hi>Vipers,</hi> they gnaw their way through the Womb that bred them; divers of these kinds I have met with upon <hi>Goosber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> Leaves, <hi>Rose-Tree</hi> Leaves, <hi>Willow</hi> Leaves, and many other kinds.</p>
               <p>There are often to be found upon <hi>Rose-Trees</hi> and <hi>Brier Bushes,</hi> little red tufts, which are certain Knobs or Excrescencies, growing out from the Rind, or Barks of those kinds of Plants, they are cover'd with strange kinds of threds or red hairs, which feel very soft, and look not unpleasantly. In most of these, if it has no hole in it, you shall find
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:61138:140"/>
certain little <hi>Worms,</hi> which I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to be the causes of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction; for when that <hi>Worm</hi> has eat its way through, they having perform'd what they were design'd by Nature to do, by degrees die and wither away.</p>
               <p>Now, the manner of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, I suppose to be thus; that the All-Wise Creator has as well Implanted in every Creature a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of knowing what Place is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the Hatching, Nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and preservation of their Eggs and Off-springs, whereby they are stimulated and directed to conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Places, which become, as 'twere, the wombs that perform those Offices; as He has also suited and adapted a Property to those Places, whereby they grow and inclose those Seeds, and having inclosed them, provide a convenient Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment for them; but as soon as they have done the Office of a Womb, they die and wither.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:61138:140"/>The Progress of <hi>Inclosure</hi> I have often observ'd in Leaves, which, in those Places where those Seeds have been cast, have by degrees swell'd and inclos'd them, so perfectly round, as not to leave any perceptible pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage out.</p>
               <p>From this same cause, I suppose that <hi>Galls, Oak-Apples,</hi> and several other Productions of that kind, upon the Branches and Leaves of Trees, have their Original; for if you open any of them, when almost Ripe, you shall find a little <hi>Worm</hi> in them.</p>
               <p>Thus, if you open never so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dry <hi>Galls,</hi> you shall find either a hole whereby the <hi>Worm</hi> has eat its passage out, or if you find no passage, you may, by breaking or cutting the <hi>Gall,</hi> find in the middle of it a small Cavity, and in it a small body, which does plainly enough yet retain a shape, to manifest it once to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the ANTS themselves, which I take to be the true ANTS Eggs; it being obvious to Observation that where ever this is uncover'd, they make it their business to carry it away in their Mouths to secure it, and will, after you have scatter'd it, lay it on a heap again, with what speed they can.</p>
               <p>I Observe they lie in multitudes upon this (if I may so call it) <hi>Spawn</hi> of theirs; and after a little time, every one of these small adherances is turn'd into a little <hi>Vermicle,</hi> as small as a <hi>Mite,</hi> hardly discern'd to stir; but after a few days more, you may perceive a feeble Motion of Flexion, and Extention, and they begin to look Yellowish and Hairy, shaped very like a small <hi>Maggot</hi>; and so keeping that Shape, grow almost as big as an ANT, and have every one a black spot on them.</p>
               <p>Then they get a <hi>Film</hi> over them, whitish, and of an <hi>Oval</hi> shape, for which reason I suppose they are
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:61138:144"/>
commonly call'd ANTS <hi>Eggs,</hi> which yet (to speak properly they) are not.</p>
               <p>I have, to prevent mistakes, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd many of these vulgarly call'd ANTS <hi>Eggs,</hi> I mean, the lesser sort, (for there are some as big as a <hi>Wheat-Corn,</hi> others less than a <hi>Rye-Corn</hi>) and in <hi>Some</hi> I find only a <hi>Maggot,</hi> to appearance, just such as was describ'd before: In <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>But when they have newly put on this Shape, I could never discern the least Motion in any one part of the little Creature, whereof the Reason may perhaps be, the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Fibres; for after a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:61138:144"/>
more time, when they begin to be Brownish, they have strength to stir all their parts.</p>
               <p>At last I met with some of these reputed <hi>Eggs,</hi> which being careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this I took for a clear Demonstration of what I design'd, which was to know, That the <hi>Film</hi> does only co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Maggot,</hi> while she is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming into an ANT, and fit to shift for her self.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Black Speck</hi> that is at one end of every such reputed ANTS <hi>Egg,</hi> I suppose to be cast out of the <hi>Maggot,</hi> in her transformation; since, after it puts on the Shape of an ANT, the <hi>Speck</hi> is quite gone, and the whole Body of the ANT pure clear; since also this <hi>Speck</hi> at the end of the said <hi>Egg,</hi> lies always

I had a little White Sugar which I desir'd to keep from them, and was devising which way to do it, and I knockt a Nail in the Beam of the Room, and fastned to it a brown Thread, at the lower end of which Thread, I tied a large Shell of a Fish, which being hollow, I put the Sugar in, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Another sort of ANTS there are, but nothing so numerous or harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as the other, but larger by far; These build great Nests, as big as <hi>Bee-Hives,</hi> against a Wall, or a Tree, of Clay and Lome, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times within Doors, and in it several little Mansions, such as <hi>Bees</hi> make for themselves, but nothing so cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious;

These the <hi>Cockroaches</hi> and <hi>Lizzards</hi> meet withal, way-laying them near their Nests, and feed upon them: which to prevent, they make from thence many and several Galleries, that reach some of them Six or Seven Yards several ways, of the same Earth they do their Nests: So that for such a distance as that, they are not to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, by any of their Enemies, and commonly their <hi>Avenues</hi> go out amongst Leaves, or Moss, or some other Covert, that they may not be perceiv'd: But the most of These are in the Woods; for we have destroy'd their Nests, and their Galleries within Doors so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as they are weary of Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and so quit the House: I can say nothing of These, but that they are the quickest at their Work of Building, of any little Creatures that ever I saw. <hi>LIGON</hi>'s <hi>Hist. of</hi> Barbadoes, <hi>Pag.</hi> 63, 64.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Sting</hi> of a BEE seems to be a Weapon of Offence, and is as great an instance, that <hi>Nature</hi> did really intend <hi>Revenge</hi> as any, and that <hi>First,</hi> because there seems to be no other use of it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of its admirable shape, seeming to be purposely shap'd for that very end. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> from the Virulency of the Liquor it ejects, and the sad Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and Symptoms that follow it.</p>
               <p>But whatever be the Use of it, certain it is, that the Structure of it is very admirable; what it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to the Naked Eye, I need not describe, the Thing being known almost to every One; but it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears through the <hi>Microscope,</hi> to consist of Two parts, the One a <hi>Sheath,</hi> without a Chape or top, shap'd almost like the <hi>Holster</hi> of a <hi>Pistol</hi>; this <hi>Sheath</hi> I could most plainly perceive to be hollow, and to contain in it, both a <hi>Sword</hi> or

               <p>The Consideration of which very pretty Structure, has hinted to me, that certainly the Use of these <hi>Claws</hi> seems to be very Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as to the Main end of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, for the drawing in, and holding the <hi>Sting</hi> in the Flesh; for the point being very sharp, the top of the <hi>Sting</hi> or Dagger is very easily thrust into an Animal's Body, which being once <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that he thus gets in his <hi>Sting</hi> into the Skin, I conjecture, because, when I have observ'd this Creature living, I have found it to move the <hi>Sting</hi> thus, to and fro, and thereby also, perhaps, does as 'twere, pump or force out the Poysonous Liquor, and make it hang at the end of the <hi>Sheath</hi> in a drop.

               <p>There are Multitudes of several sorts of SPIDERS, whose Eyes,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:61138:162"/>
and most other Parts and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, are so exceedingly different from one another, that it would be almost endless to describe them, as <hi>Some</hi> with Six <hi>Eyes,</hi> plac'd in quite another Order; <hi>Others</hi> with Eight Eyes, others with fewer, and <hi>Some</hi> with more. They all seem to be Creatures of Prey, and to feed on other small <hi>Insects,</hi> but their ways of catching them seem very differing: The <hi>Shepherd</hi> SPIDER by running on his Prey; The <hi>Hunting</hi> SPIDER by leaping on it; <hi>Other Sorts</hi> weave Nets, or Cobwebs, whereby they insnare them, Nature having both sitted them with Materials and Tools, and taught them how to Work and Weave their Nets, and to lie perdue, and to watch diligently to run on any <hi>Flie,</hi> as soon as ever entangl'd.</p>
               <p>Their Thread or <hi>Web</hi> seems to be Spun out of some <hi>Viscous</hi> kind of <hi>Excrement,</hi> lying in their Belly, which, tho' soft when drawn out, is presently, by Reason of its small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:61138:163"/>The <hi>long Threads</hi> in the Air in Summer, and especially towards <hi>September,</hi> have been a strange puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle to the Wiser World. It would divert you, tho' you know them as well as I, if I should here reckon up the ridiculous Opinions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them: but I shall omit them, and proceed to tell you the certain and immediate Authors of them, and how they make them.</p>
               <p>I say then, that all SPIDERS, that Spin in a <hi>Thread,</hi> (those, which we call <hi>Shepherds,</hi> or long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Legg'd SPIDERS, never do;) are the Makers of these <hi>Threads,</hi> so much wonder'd at, and in such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite quantities every where.</p>
               <p>I sent you the last Summer a Catalogue of <hi>Thirty</hi> sorts of SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DERS, that I had distinguisht here with us in <hi>England</hi>; and I must confess, I had well near compleated that Number, with many other Experiments concerning them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I discover'd this Secret.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:61138:163"/>I had exactly Mark'd all the ways of <hi>Weaving,</hi> us'd by any sorts of them, and in those admirable Works I had ever noted that they still let down the <hi>Thread,</hi> they made use of; and drew it after them. Happily at length, in nearly attending on One, that wrought a Net, I saw him suddenly in the Mid-Work to desist, and turning his Tail into the Wind to dart out a <hi>Thread</hi> with the same violence and stream, as we see Water spout out of a Spring: This <hi>Thread</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up by the Wind, was in a moment emitted some Fathoms long, still issuing out of the Belly of the Animal; by and by the SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER leapt into the Air, and the <hi>Thread</hi> mounted her up swiftly.</p>
               <p>After this Discovery, I made the like Observation in almost all the sorts of SPIDERS, I had before distinguish'd; and I found the Air fill'd with Young and Old, sailing on their <hi>Threads,</hi> and undoubtedly seizing <hi>Gnats</hi> and other <hi>Insects</hi> in
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:61138:164"/>
their passage; there being often as manifest Signs of Slaughter, as Legs, Wings of <hi>Flies, &amp;c.</hi> on these <hi>Threads,</hi> as in their <hi>Webs</hi> below.</p>
               <p>One thing yet was a Wonder to me, <hi>viz.</hi> That many of these <hi>Threads,</hi> that came down out of the Air, were not single, but snarl'd and with complicable Wooly Locks, sometimes more, sometimes less; and that on these I did not always find SPIDERS, tho' many times I had found Two or Three upon One of them: Whereas when they first flew up, the <hi>Thread</hi> was still single, or but little tangl'd, or, it may be, thicker in one place than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In the End, by good atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I plainly found, what satisfied me abundantly, and that was this; That I observ'd them to get to the top of a Stalk or Bough, or some such like thing, where they Excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise this Darting of <hi>Threads</hi> into the Air, and if they had not a mind to sail, they <hi>either</hi> swiftly drew it up again, winding it up with
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:61138:164"/>
their Fore-Feet over their Head in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Lock; <hi>Or</hi> break it off short, and let the Air carry it away. This they will do many times to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and you may see some of them, that have Chains of these Locks, or <hi>Snarl'd Thread</hi> before them, and yet not taken flight.</p>
               <p>Again, I found, that after the first flight, all the time of their Sailing they make <hi>Locks,</hi> still <hi>Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth</hi> fresh supplies of <hi>Thread</hi> to sport and sail by.</p>
               <p>It is further to be Noted, that these <hi>Complicated Threads</hi> are much more tender, than our <hi>House-Webbs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Winter and at Christmass, I have observ'd them busie a <hi>Darting,</hi> but few of them sail then, and therefore but single Threads only are to be seen; And besides, they are but the Young Ones of last <hi>Autumns</hi> hatch, that are then em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd; and it is more than proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the great Ropes of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn</hi> are made only by the great
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:61138:165"/>
Ones, and upon long Passages and Summer Weather, when great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Prey may invite them to stay longer up. <hi>MARTIN LIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER</hi>'s <hi>Observ. See the PHILOS. TRANSACT. Numb.</hi> 50.</p>
               <p>The Learned and Ingenious Mr. <hi>King,</hi> Chaplain to Mr. <hi>Chetwynd</hi> of <hi>Staffordshire,</hi> tells us, that SPIDERS in projecting a <hi>Thread</hi> cross a Room <hi>in plano Horizontis</hi> (which they do for their easier and more direct pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage) raise themselves on their Legs, as high as they can, setting them very straight and stiff, and turning their hinder Parts up higher than usual, they will shoot out a <hi>Thread</hi> to a great distance; which when fasten'd where they would have it, with their Fore-Legs they will wind up the <hi>Thread</hi> shorter till it is very straight, as the <hi>Funambuli</hi> strain their Ropes, and then like <hi>them</hi> too, will get upon it, and run from one end to the other.</p>
               <p>And as to their <hi>Sailing</hi> at the Ends of these <hi>Threads,</hi> He further
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:61138:165"/>
observed, not only that they <hi>Sailed</hi> much swifter than any <hi>Wind</hi> then stirring could carry them, but that at the same time they constantly <hi>Sail'd</hi> all the same way, which was not directly with, but as he once noted at <hi>Eight Points</hi> distance, as it were with a <hi>Side-Wind</hi>; which plainly shews, that they do not only <hi>Row,</hi> but <hi>Steer</hi> too, with the motion of their Feet, according as directed by some <hi>Secret Instinct</hi> they have in them. <hi>PLOT of</hi> Stafford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire, <hi>Pag.</hi> 239.</p>

               <p>THE use of SILK was brought over from the <hi>East-Indies</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Europe</hi> above a Thousand Years since, and was particularly intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd into <hi>Italy</hi> by Two Religious Men, who brought thither the <hi>Grain</hi> of it somewhat above Three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years since; in which Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Italy,</hi> that Commodity hath been much Cultivated, and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on several Accounts; as, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousness of it, the easie Transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from one place to another, by Reason of its lightness: And lastly, for that it is one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:61138:167"/>
Instruments of Luxury, which never wanted Partizans and Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in any Age, not to mention the great Advantages and Wealth attending the Manufacture of it. The Latine Word SERICUM is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from that of SERES, an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riental People, who were more Sedulous in the Cultivation of it than any other: And the same thing that hath happen'd to this, as to many other Excellent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions deriv'd from mean an de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicable Principles. For the <hi>Animal,</hi> from whose Labour we have the SILK, is an <hi>Insect,</hi> as are all those which <hi>Spin,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Spider</hi> and the <hi>Caterpillar,</hi> and it differs in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from this latter, save that the <hi>Caterpillar</hi> hath a little Hairiness, and the <hi>Silk</hi> of the <hi>Silk-Worm</hi> is stronger than the <hi>Web</hi> of the <hi>Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillar,</hi> and of another Colour, but as to figure and bulk there is little difference between them. Whereto may be added, that their producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is much at one, as being as it
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:61138:167"/>
were hatch'd of certain Eggs, liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Leaves, inclosing themselves in certain Webs, out of which they make their way, after they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a kind of <hi>Butterflies,</hi> by a strange <hi>Metamorphosis,</hi> which forces them from one Extremity to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>That is,</hi> from the Nature of <hi>Reptiles</hi> to that of <hi>Volatiles</hi>: Which Transformation is such, as, were it not for the frequency of it, might be plac'd among the greatest Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Nature, considering the great difference there is between those Two Forms. And that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is such, as hath given some occasion to doubt, whether the SILK-WORM becoming a BUT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERFLY did not change its <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> as certainly it would, were it not that every thing produces its like; and the SILK-WORM deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving its Birth from the Seed of the BUTTERFLY, it is an Argument that <hi>both</hi> are of the same <hi>Species.</hi> Thus much as to their Progress.

never coming to any good. These Worms are thence transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with the Leaves laid upon little Boards or Hurdles, into a temperate place, and dispos'd in a lightsome and spacious Room, where they are Entertain'd with fresh Leaves twice a Day, among which those of the <hi>White Mulberry</hi> make finer SILK, than those of the <hi>Black</hi>; for want whereof, the Leaves of the <hi>Rose-Bush, Lettice,</hi> and some others may be used: But though the Worm makes a shift to Subsist by that Nourishment, yet either it will not <hi>Spin</hi> at all, or the SILK will be like the <hi>Web</hi> or <hi>Clue</hi> wrought by the <hi>Caterpillars.</hi> Thus it feeds for the space of Forty Days, during which it becomes Grey, and changes its Colour four times, not eating for some Days before each Change, by reason of the fullness it is then sensible of.

them out of one Room into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that even when they are dying in great quantities; Perfume, Incense, Benjamin, Vinegar, and Wine recovering and comforting them; as also the smell of broil'd Bacon.

All harsh sounds, as those of the discharging of Muskets, Bells, and Trumpets, destroy them; nay, the strong Breaths of those who come near them, especially such as have eaten or handled Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick or Onions, are very prejudicial to them.

               <p>IN the Islands of <hi>Solon</hi> and <hi>Timor</hi> in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> there grows a Tree called the STINKING-TREE; and indeed, well may it be so called: For it naturally smells like the strongest <hi>Humane Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> especially, as upon the Emptying of a <hi>House of Office.</hi> Sir <hi>Philiberto Vernatti</hi> procur'd an Arm of this TREE, and sent it to the ROYAL SOCIETY at <hi>Gresham</hi> Colledge. Where, though it hath now been preserv'd many Years, yet seems to give as full and quick a Scent as ever. Yet in burning, it yields no smell; as do <hi>Lignum Aloe,</hi> and some other Woods. 'Tis ponderous, hard, and of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of <hi>English-Oak</hi>; and as that hath large <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi>; yet but few I should have conjectur'd, saith <hi>Dr. Grew,</hi> that this Wood belong'd to the TREE called <hi>Ahovaj,</hi> which
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:61138:179"/>
hath a Stinking smell, but that <hi>this</hi> is said to be the more odious when it burns. <hi>GREW</hi>'s <hi>Mus. REG. SOC. Pag.</hi> 180.</p>
               <p>There is in <hi>Iamaica</hi> a sort of Tree called the SOAPE-TREE; the Berries whereof (being as big as Bullets of Musquets) without any proportion of Salt-Lixiviate, or Sulphur, or Oile, wash better than any <hi>Castile</hi>-SOAPE; but they rot the Linnen in time.

               <p>In the <hi>Caribe-Islands</hi> grows the Famous TREE called the <hi>Cabbage-Tree</hi>; which, tho one would not imagine, I assure you, saith <hi>Dr. Stubbes,</hi> is a sort of <hi>Palme-Tree</hi>: All that part which is eaten as the <hi>Cabbage,</hi> is, what sprouted out that Year, and so is tender.

               <p>In <hi>Barbadoes</hi> there is a particular sort of TREE called the POYSON-TREE. Its Leaves are full out as large and beautiful, as the <hi>Lawrels,</hi> and so like, as not to be known asunder. The People that have liv'd long there, say, 'tis not whole some to be under the Shade of this TREE. The Work-Men, as they cut them down, are very careful of their Eyes; and those that have <hi>Cipers,</hi> put it over their Faces; for if any of the Sap fly into their Eyes, they become Blind for a Month. A <hi>Negro</hi> had two Horses to walk, which were left with him by two Gentlemen; and the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses beginning to fight, the <hi>Negro</hi> was afraid, and let them go; and they running into the Wood toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, stuck at one another, and
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:61138:180"/>
their Heels hitting some young TREES of this kind, struck the poysonous Juice into one anothers Eyes, and so their Blindness parted the Fray, and they were both led home Stone Blind, and continued so a Month, all the Hair and Skin peeling off their Faces. Yet, of this Timber they make all, or the most part, of the Pots they <hi>Cure</hi> their <hi>Sugar</hi> in; for being Sawed, and the Boards dryed in the Sun, the POYSON vapours out. <hi>LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GON</hi>'s <hi>Hist. of</hi> Barbadoes. pag. 68.</p>

Both these Causes seem to me very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent and insufficient. <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes</hi> seldom make MOUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAINS, they often take them away, and sink them down into the Caverns that lie under them; Besides, <hi>Earthquakes</hi> are not in all Countries and Climats as MOUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAINS are; for, as we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd more than once, there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Island</hi> that is Original, nor <hi>Continent</hi> any where in the Earth,

<pb n="370" facs="tcp:61138:186"/>
Torrents and Land Floods violent, is their fall from the MOUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAINS and high Lands, which our Earth is now full of, but if the Rain fell upon even and Level Ground, it would only sadden and compress it; there is no possibility how it should raise MOUNTAINS in it. And if we could imagine an <hi>Vniversal Deluge</hi> as the <hi>Earth</hi> is now constituted, it would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther throw down the <hi>Hills</hi> and MOUNTAINS, than raise new ones; or by beating down their Tops and loose parts, help to fill the <hi>Valleys,</hi> and bring the <hi>Earth</hi> nearer to evenness and plainness.</p>
               <p>Seeing then there are no hopes of Explaining the <hi>Origin</hi> of MOUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAINS, either from <hi>particular Earthquakes,</hi> or from the General <hi>Deluge,</hi> according to the common notion and Explication of it; these not being <hi>Causes</hi> answerable to such vast <hi>Effects</hi>; let us try our <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis</hi> again, which hath made us a <hi>Channel</hi> large enough for the

Sea, and room for all Subterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cavities, and I think will find us Materials enough to raise all the MOUNTAINS of the Earth. We suppose the great Arch or Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of the first Earth to have fallen into the <hi>Abyss</hi> at the <hi>Deluge,</hi> and seeing that was larger than the <hi>Surface</hi> it fell upon, 'tis absolutely certain, that it could not all fall flat, or lie under the Water: Now, as all those parts that stood above the Water made dry Land, or the present Habitable Earth, so such parts of the dry Land as stood higher than the rest made <hi>Hills</hi> and MOUNTAINS; and this is the first and General Account of them, and of all the Inequalities of the Earth. <hi>THO.

               <head>Observations concerning EARTH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QVAKES.</head>
               <p>EARTHQUAKES are too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Demonstrations of the Hollowness of the Earth, being the dreadful Effects or Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it; for if the Body of the Earth was sound and compact, there would be no such thing in Nature as an EARTHQUAKE. They are commonly accompanied with an heavy dead Sound, like a dull Thunder, which ariseth from the <hi>Vapours,</hi> that are striving in the Womb of Nature when her Throes are coming upon her. And that these <hi>Caverns</hi> where the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours</hi> lie are very large and capo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, we are taught sometimes by sad Experience; for whole Cities and Countries have been swallow'd up into them, as <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah,</hi> and the Region of <hi>Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi> and several Cities in <hi>Greece.</hi> and in <hi>Asia,</hi> and other parts.
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:61138:203"/>
Whole <hi>Islands</hi> also have been thus absorpt in an EARTHQUAKE; the pillars and props they stood upon being broken, they have sunk and saln, in as an House blown up. I am also of Opinion, that those <hi>Islands</hi> that are made by divulsion from a <hi>Continent,</hi> as <hi>Sicily</hi> was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from <hi>Italy,</hi> and great <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> as some think, from <hi>France,</hi> have been made the same way; that is, the <hi>Isthmus</hi> or Necks of Land that joyn'd these <hi>Islands</hi> with their <hi>Continents</hi> before, have been hollow, and being either worn by the Water, or shak'd by an EARTH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUAKE, have sunk down, and so made way for the <hi>Sea</hi> to overflow them, and of a <hi>Promontory</hi> to make an <hi>Island.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For it is not at all likely, that the Neck of Land continu'd stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the <hi>Sea</hi> overflow'd it, and so made an <hi>Island</hi>; for then all those Passages between such <hi>Islands,</hi> and their respective <hi>Continents,</hi> would be extreamly shallow and unnavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:61138:203"/>
which we do not find them to be. Nor is it any more wonder, if such a Neck of Land should fall, than that a Mountain should sink, or any other Tract of Land, and a Lake rise in its place, which hath often happen'd. <hi>Plato</hi> supposeth his <hi>Atlantis</hi> to have been greater than <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> together, and yet to have sunk all into the <hi>Sea</hi>: whether that be true or no, I do not think it impossible that some Arms of the <hi>Sea</hi> or <hi>Sinus</hi>'s might have had such an Original as that: and I am very apt to think, that for some Years after the <hi>Deluge,</hi> till the Fragments were well settled and adjusted, great alterations wou'd happen as to the Face of the <hi>Sea</hi> and the <hi>Land</hi>; many of the Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would change their posture, and many would sink into the Water that stood out before, the props failing that bore them up, or the Joynts and Corners where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they lean'd upon one another; and thereupon a new Face of Things
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:61138:204"/>
would arise, and a new <hi>Deluge</hi> for that part of the Earth. Such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves and interchanges, I believe, would often happen in the first Ages after the <hi>Flood</hi>; as we see in all other Ruines there happen lesser and Secondary Ruines after the first, till the parts be so well pois'd and settled, that without some vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence they scarce change their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture any more.</p>
               <p>But to return to our EARTH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUAKES, and to give an instance or two of their Extent and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: <hi>Pliny</hi> mentions one in the Reign of <hi>Tiberius Caesar</hi> that struck down Twelve Cities of <hi>Asia</hi> in one Night. And <hi>Fournier</hi> gives us an Account of one in <hi>Peru,</hi> that reach'd Three Hundred Leagues along the <hi>Sea-Shore,</hi> and Seventy Leagues Inland; and levell'd the <hi>Mountains</hi> all along as it went, threw down the Cities, turn'd the Rivers out of their Channels, and made an Universal havock and Confusion; And all this, <hi>

There must be dreadful Vaults and Mines under that <hi>Continent,</hi> that gave passage to the <hi>Vapours,</hi> and liberty to play for Nine Hundred Miles in length, and above Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in breadth. <hi>Asia</hi> also hath been very subject to these Desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by EARTH-QUAKES; and many parts in <hi>Europe,</hi> as <hi>Greece, Italy,</hi> and others. The Truth is, our Cities are built upon Ruines, and our Fields and Countries stand upon broken Arches and Vaults, and so does the greatest part of the outward Frame of the Earth, and therefore it is no wonder if it be often shaken; there being quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Exhalations</hi> within these Mines, or Cavernous passages, that are capable of rarifaction and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="412" facs="tcp:61138:207"/>
generally a greater abundance of <hi>Moisture</hi> sucked up, more <hi>Vapours</hi> and a larger quantity of <hi>Nitrè,</hi> as Experience doth demonstrate, all which <hi>Ingredients</hi> may conspire to the producing of an EARTH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUAKE. For if we consider, how capable they are of a large Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pansion, how forcible they are when ratified in <hi>Vessels</hi> closed, and placed over the <hi>Fire</hi>; in <hi>Aeolypiles,</hi> or vents, from which they break out, with forcible Blasts, or in Winds, which frequently proceed from the rarisaction of such Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, we may suppose that those <hi>Vapours,</hi> which produce such great Commotions in the <hi>Air,</hi> may cause a considerable Disturbance in the <hi>Earth,</hi> when pent and <hi>locked</hi> up by <hi>Cold,</hi> or any such like Accident.</p>
               <p>It is generally observ'd, that some little time before an EARTH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUAKE, there is not only a great <hi>Calmness,</hi> but likewise a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>Coldness</hi> and <hi>Chillness</hi> in the <hi>Air</hi>; which was observ'd just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <p>In EARTHQUAKES the <hi>tremu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Motion</hi> sometimes extends so very far, that, tho' it seems high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly probable that the <hi>Shake</hi> that is given to one part of the <hi>Earth</hi> by the <hi>Firing</hi> and <hi>Explosion</hi> of <hi>Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneal Exhalations,</hi> (if that be the true and only cause of EARTH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUAKES) is not capable of reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near so far as divers EARTH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUAKES have done, but that the <hi>Fire</hi> passes through some little <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneal</hi> Clefts, or Channels, or
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:61138:208"/>
hidden Conveyances, from one great Cavity or Mine to another; yet 'tis not improbable, but that the <hi>vehemently tremulous Motion</hi> does oftentimes reach a very great way beyond the places where the <hi>Explosions</hi> were made. Since, tho' <hi>Seneca</hi> would confine the Extent of EARTHQUAKES to two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Miles, yet Observations made in this and the last Century war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant us to allow them a far greater spread.</p>
               <p>The Learned <hi>Iosephus Acosta</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that in the Kingdom of <hi>Peru,</hi> in the Year 1586. an EARTH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUAKE reached along the Shoar of the <hi>Pacifick</hi> Sea 160 Leagues; And adds, that sometimes it has in those parts run on from South to North 300 Leagues. And in the beginning of this our Age (<hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1601) good Writers relate a much larger EARTHQUAKE to have happened, since it reached from <hi>Asia</hi> to that <hi>Sea</hi> that washes the <hi>French</hi> Shoars, and, besides

some <hi>Asiatick</hi> Regions, shock <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary, Germany, Italy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and consequently a great part of <hi>Europe.</hi> And if that part of the Narrative be certain, which relates, that this lasted not much above a quarter of an Hour, it will be the more likely, that this EARTH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUAKE shook great Tracts of Land beyond those places, to which the <hi>fired Matter,</hi> passing from one Cavity to another, could reach in so short a time: As you will the more easily guess, if you try, as I have done, that in Trains of <hi>Gun-powder</hi> it self, the <hi>Fire</hi> do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>That wonderful <hi>Light</hi> which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd during this HURRICANE, might be from the Collision of the <hi>Lucid Salts,</hi> with which the Sea-Water is so deeply impregnated: <hi>Light</hi> happily being nothing else

               <p>Not only the <hi>Winds,</hi> but the <hi>Currents</hi> are observ'd to change, and run round in <hi>Eddys,</hi> before the beginning of the Tempest.—It's likewise esteem'd a sure <hi>Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stique,</hi> that the <hi>Birds</hi> (led by an instinct of Nature) come down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand in Flocks from the <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> to secure themselves in the <hi>Vallies</hi> against the injury of the Weather.</p>
               <p>I believe, there might be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent use made of the <hi>Barometer</hi> for predicting of HURRICANES, and other Tempests, especially at Sea; since I am credibly inform'd, that a Person of Quality, who lives by the Sea-side, (though happily there may not be so considerable Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the gravity of the <hi>Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphere</hi> far off at Land) can by the <hi>Barometer</hi> almost infallibly foretel any great Tempest for several Hours before it begins.</p>

diffuses it self by degrees, and at last, covering the whole Face of the Heavens with a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopy of Darkness, causes horrible Storms, <hi>Thunder</hi> and <hi>Lightning,</hi> swells the raging Seas up to the Clouds, which pour them down in Deluges of Rain, falling rather in huge <hi>Cascades,</hi> and by Buckets-full, than Drops; sometimes together with Hailstones of prodigious bulk: So variable and unsteady are the TORNADO-Winds, so little obliged to any certain Law, that they commonly shift all the <hi>Points</hi> of the <hi>Compass</hi> in the space of an hour, blowing in such sudden and impetuous Gusts, that a Ship which was ready to overset on one side, is no less dangerous assaulted on the other; sometimes they shift without intermission, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while they blow in Starts, so that you shall have a perfect Calm between every puff: Let a Fleet of Ships sail as near as they can without falling foul on each other,
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:61138:218"/>
and they shall have several and contrary Winds: You shall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd with many of them in the same Day, most towards the Coasts of <hi>Africk,</hi> for half an hour or three quarters at a time: And were they equally lasting, as impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, few would be invited thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the <hi>Guiny</hi> Gold, or venture to cross the <hi>Line</hi> for the richest Merchandise of the <hi>East.</hi>

               <head>Observations concerning ISLANDS.</head>
               <p>WE must in the first place di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish between <hi>Original Islands</hi> and <hi>Factitious Islands</hi>; Those I call <hi>Factitious,</hi> that are not of the same Date and Antiquity with the <hi>Sea,</hi> but have been made some at one time, some at another, by accidental Causes, as the Aggestion of <hi>Sands</hi> and <hi>Sandbeds,</hi> or the <hi>Sea</hi> leaving the tops of some shallow places that lie high, and yet flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the lower Skirts of them; These make sandy and plain I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SLANDS, that have no high Land in them, and are but mock-I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SLANDS in Effect. <hi>Others</hi> are made by divulsion from some <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,</hi> when an <hi>Isthmus</hi> or the Neck of a <hi>Promontory</hi> running into the <hi>Sea,</hi> sinks or falls in, by an <hi>Earthquake</hi> or otherwise, and the <hi>Sea</hi> entring in at the gap passeth through, and makes that <hi>Promonto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> or Country become an ISLAND.
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:61138:222"/>
Thus the ISLAND <hi>Sicily</hi> is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to have been made, and all <hi>Africa</hi> might be an ISLAND, if the <hi>Isthmus</hi> between the <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean</hi> and the <hi>Red Sea</hi> should sink down. And these ISLANDS may have Rocks and Mountains in them, if the Land had so before. Lastly, there are ISLANDS that have been said to rise from the bottom of the <hi>Sea</hi>; History men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions such in both the <hi>Archipelago</hi>'s, <hi>Aegean</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi>; and this seems to argue that there are great Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Tracts of <hi>Earth</hi> that he loose at the bottom of the <hi>Sea,</hi> or that are not incorporated with the Ground.</p>
               <p>But besides these ISLANDS and the several Sorts of them, there are others which I call <hi>Original</hi>: because they could not be produc'd in any of the forementioned ways, but are of the same Origin and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity with the Channel of the <hi>Sea</hi>; and such are the generality of our ISLANDS; They were not
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:61138:222"/>
made of heaps of <hi>Sands,</hi> nor torn from any <hi>Continent,</hi> but are as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient as the <hi>Continents</hi> themselves, Namely, ever since the <hi>Deluge,</hi> the common Parent of them both. Nor is there any difficulty to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand how ISLANDS were made at the Dissolution of the <hi>Earth,</hi> any more than how CONTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NENTS were made; for I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SLANDS are but lesser CONTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NENTS, or CONTINENTS grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ISLANDS; and according as CONTINENTS were made of greater Masses of <hi>Earth</hi> or greater Fragments standing above the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, so ISLANDS were made of less, but so big always, and in such a posture, as to bear their tops a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Water. Yet though they agree thus far, there is a particular difference to be taken notice of as to their <hi>Origin</hi>; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or the CONTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NENTS were made of those three or four primary Masses into which the falling <hi>Orb</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> was divided, but the ISLANDS were
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:61138:223"/>
made of the Fractures of these, and broken off by the fall from the Skirts and Extremities of the CONTINENTS; we noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that when those great Masses and primary Fragments came to dash upon the <hi>Abysse</hi> in their fall, the sudden stop of the Motion, and the weighty Bulk of the descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fragment broke off all the Edges and Extremities of it, which Edges and Extremities broken off made the ISLANDS; And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly we see that they generally lie scatter'd along the sides of the Continents, and are but <hi>Splinters,</hi> as it were, of those greater Bodies. 'Tis true, besides these, there were an infinite Number of other pieces brake off that do not appear, some making <hi>Rocks</hi> under Water, some <hi>shal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ows</hi> and <hi>Banks</hi> in the <hi>Sea</hi>; but the greatest of them when they fell either one upon another, or in such a posture as to prop up one another, their Heads and higher
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:61138:223"/>
parts would stand out of the Water and make ISLANDS.</p>
               <p>Thus I conceive the ISLANDS of the <hi>Sea</hi> were at first produc'd; we cannot wonder therefore that they should be so numerous, or fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> more numerous than the <hi>Continents</hi>; These are the Parents, and those are the Children; Nor can we wonder to see along the sides of the <hi>Continents</hi> several ISLANDS or Sets of ISLANDS, sown, as it were, by handfuls, or laid in Trains; for the manner of their Generation would lead us to think, they would be so plac'd. So the <hi>American</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SLANDS lie scatter'd upon the Coast of that <hi>Continent</hi>; the <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divian</hi> and <hi>Philippine</hi> upon the <hi>East-Indian</hi> Shoar, and the <hi>Hespe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides</hi> upon the <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As concerning the Situation of ISLANDS, whether Comodious or not, this, saith <hi>Peter He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I find in <hi>Machiavel,</hi> that for a City whose People covet no Empire but their own Towns, a Barren place is better than a Fruitful; because in such Seats they are compell'd to Work and Labour, whereby they are freed from Idleness, and by Consequence from Luxury: But for a City whose Inhabitants desire to enlarge their Confines, a fertile place was rather to be chosen than a Barren, as being more able to nourish Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of People. The like <hi>Pet. Heylin</hi> says of ISLANDS. If a <hi>Prince</hi> desire rather to keep than
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:61138:224"/>
augment his Dominions, no place fitter for his Abode than an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SLAND; as being by it self and Nature sufficiently desensible. But if a King be minded to add conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to his Empire, an ISLAND is no fit Seat for him; because, partly by the uncertainty of Winds and Seas, partly by the length and tediousness of the ways, he is not so well able to supply and keep such Forces as he hath on the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.</hi> An Example hereof is <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which hath even to admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion repelled the most puissant Monarch of <hi>Europe</hi>; but for the Causes above mentioned, cannot shew any of her <hi>Conquests</hi> on the <hi>firm Land,</hi> though she hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted and atchieved as many glorious Exploits, as any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey in the World. <hi>PET.

               <p>The Ingenious <hi>Dr. Sprat,</hi> now Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> observes, that the chief Design of the <hi>Antient

English</hi> was the glory of spreading their Victories on the <hi>Continent:</hi> But this, says he, was a Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous mistake: For by their very <hi>Conquests,</hi> if they had maintain'd them, this ISLAND had been ruin'd, and had only become a <hi>Province</hi> to a greater <hi>Empire.</hi> But now it is rightly understood, that the <hi>English</hi> Greatness will never be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported or increas'd in this Age, by any other Wars but those at <hi>Sea.

               <p>ISLANDERS are for the most part longer liv'd, than those that dwell in Continents: For they live not so long in <hi>Russia,</hi> as in the <hi>Orcades</hi>; nor so long in <hi>Africa,</hi> though under the same <hi>Parallel,</hi> as in the <hi>Canaries,</hi> and <hi>Tercera</hi>'s; And the <hi>Iaponians</hi> are longer liv'd, than the <hi>Chineses</hi>; though the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses</hi> are mad upon long life.
