            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

death of <hi>Caius Caligula,</hi> the Consuls and Senate of
<hi>Rome</hi> entred into a consultation, how they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
the Common-wealth to her ancient freedom,
which by the <hi>Caesars</hi> had been taken from them. So
that the taking in of an Emperour, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of <hi>Claudius</hi> for Emperour, was directly against
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45725:3"/>
the wills and resolution of the Consuls and Senate;
yet these anciently for many hundred yeares had
the chiefe power of Government; But see the way
of <hi>Claudius</hi> his coming to the Empire; during the
<hi>Inter-regnum, Claudius</hi> being frighted with the news
of <hi>Caligula's</hi> death, and fearing himselfe might be
enquired for upon suspition with-drew, and hid
himselfe behind the Hangings, or covering of a
doore; where a Souldier seeing his feet, and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to know what he was drew him forth, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
knowledge of him saluted him Emperour,
though even then for feare falling downe low be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him. This one Souldier brought him forth to
his fellow Souldiers, who lifted him up as Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
and thus while the Senate was slow in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their purposes, and differences grew among
them, <hi>Claudius,</hi> who was sent for by the Senate to
give in his councell concerning the common free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
undertooke the Empire. Thus in one Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
at first, and then in more, was the foundation
of <hi>Claudius</hi> his Emperiall power, against the will,
consultations, and endeavours of Consuls and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.
And for <hi>Nero</hi> (his Successor) <hi>Britannicus,</hi> who
was nearer of kin to <hi>Claudius,</hi> being his Son, was
kept in by the cunning of <hi>Neroes</hi> mother, and by
the same craft <hi>Nero</hi> being brought forth to the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery,
was first saluted Emperour by them. This
sentence of the Souldiers was followed with the
consent of the Senate, and then it was not scrupled
in the Provinces; so that the Souldiery was also the
foundation of <hi>Neroes</hi> Empire. Thus we see Rulers
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45725:4"/>
put by Souldiers into that power which is said
by the Scripture to be ordained of God; and
even to these Rulers men must be subject for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
            <p>But passing from the Romane state to our owne,
sure we are that in this Nation many persons have
beene setled in supreame power and authority by
meere force without title of inheritance, or just
conquest. And it hath been observed by some that
accurately have looked into our story, that not any
three immediately succeeding each other, come to
the Crowne by true lineall succession and order of
blood. Neither is there any great difficulty in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, untill we come to Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> whose title
being by an incestuous marriage, these observers say
that Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> should have raigned in her
stead; However, we are cleerly told by story, that
five Kings on a row (of which the Conqueror was the
first) had no title at all by lineall descent and prox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imity
of blood. The first came in by force; The
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45725:4"/>
second and third had an elder Brother living when
they came to the Crowne; The fourth raigned
when his Predecessor had a Daughter, and Heire
living which was <hi>Mawd</hi> the Empresse; The fifth
being the Son of that Empresse, raigned while his
Mother was alive, by whom his Title came. But
leaving these, and <hi>Edward</hi> the third who raigned
in his Fathers life time, and the three <hi>Henries;</hi>
fourth, fifth, and sixt, who raigned upon the <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castrian</hi>
(that is a younger Brothers) Title, Let
us more particularly consider <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh;<note place="margin">See Speed in <hi>H.</hi> 7. n. 1. &amp; Seq.</note>
This <hi>Henry</hi> came in with an Army, and by meere
power was made King in the Army, and by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
so that in the very field where he got the
Victory, the Crowne was set upon his head, and
there he gave Knight-hood to divers; And upon
this foundation of military power, he got himselfe
afterwards to be solemnely Crowned at <hi>Westminster.</hi>
And soone after upon authority thus gotten, he
called a Parliament, and in that Parliament was the
Crowne entailed upon him and his Heires. Thus
both his Crowne and his Parliament were founded
upon power; As for any right Title, he could have
none; for he came from a Bastard of <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi>
which though legitimated by Parliament for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Inheritances, yet expressely was excluded from
right to the Crowne. And for his wives Title, that
came in after his Kingship, and his Parliament,
which before had setled the Crowne upon him and
his Heirs. And he was so farre from exercising au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in her right, that her name is not used in any
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45725:5"/>
Lawes as Queene <hi>Maries</hi> was, both before and after
her marriage with the Spanish King. Now this
and the rest who came in by meere power without
Title of inheritance, being in their opinion who are
now unsatisfied, to be held unlawfull, yet the maine
body of this Nation did obey them, whilst they ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
yea doth yield subjection to their Lawes to this
very day. And the learned in the Lawes doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
plead, judge, justify, and condemne accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to these Lawes; So that herein the very voyce
of the Nation with one consent seemes to speake
aloud; That those whose Title is held unlawfull,
yet being possest of authority may lawfully be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed.</p>
            <p>And hereunto Divines and Casuists give their
concurrence; among them one that is resolute both
for Monarchy and lineall Succession, thus expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
his judgement, both for seeking of right and
justice from an usurper (whom he calleth a Tyrant,
in regard of an unjust Title, not in respect of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranicall
oppression) and for obeying his commands.

For the power is onething which is of God, and
the getting and the use of the power is another; And
after: The beginning of <hi>Nimrods</hi> power was, indeed
evill, as to the getting and usurping power, because
abusing his strength, force, and wealth, he violently
subbued others, and compelled them to obey; but not
the power or force wherewith he seemed to be indued
by God above others; <hi>And another more plainely.</hi> When
a question is made whom we should obey; it must not be
lookt at what he is that exerciseth the power, or by what
right or wrong he hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

For if any man doth excell in power, it is now out of
doubt, that he received that power of God; Wherefore
without all exception thou must yield thy self up to him,

use to enquire by what right those which have command

us, that they are in preheminence. For they did not get

chiefe pillars of the reformed Churches) It shall not
here be scrupulously disputed by what right or by what
wrong Princes have gotten their power. This rather is
to be done that we reverence the PRESENT Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates.
For this Epistle was written when the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi>
had now gotten the Empire of the world, which
we know they did possesse by force; and that afterwards
the Emperours by policies nothing better drew to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
an universall power. Yet <hi>Paul</hi> doth command
that Magistrates without all exception must be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed.</p>
            <p>And indeed how can it be otherwise? for when a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45725:6"/>
person or persons have gotten Supreme power, and
by the same excluded all other from authority, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that authority which is thus taken by power
must be obeyed, or else all authority and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
must fall to the ground; &amp; so confusion (which
is worse then tituler Tyranny) be admitted into
a Common-wealth; And (according to the doctrine
of King <hi>Iames</hi>) the King being for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
and not the Common-wealth for the King,
the end should be destroyed for the meanes, the
whole for a part. If a Masters mate had throwne the
Master over Board, and by power would suffer no
other to guide the Ship but himselfe; if the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
will not obey him commanding aright for the
safe guiding of the Ship, the Ship must needs perish
and themselves with it.</p>

by striving against a prevalent power. Therefore as
that which hath the lesse ill consequences, not ours
only, but generally all Nations have given obedience
to power; and both sought and received Lawes and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45725:7"/>
Government from those, that have overpowred
them. But indeed the question is properly here what
is lawfull, and not what ill consequences the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of man may worke upon that which is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
And as to the lawfulnesse, we have seen before
what Scripture, Divines, Reason, and general practice
have resolved, and taught.</p>
            <p>And whereas some speake of a time for set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement,
they indeed doe rather speake for a
time of unsettlement; for they will have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>settlement
first, and a setlement after. And whereas
like doth produce its like; yet they would have an
unsetlement to beget a setlement. They would have
confusion, distraction, destruction to bring forth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and safety. But the former Scriptures speake
not of the future, but of the present time; not of
obeying those that shall be powers, and shall be in
authority; but the powers that are, and those that
are in authority. Neither doe the Casuists and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
speake of obedience to those that shall be set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
but those that are in actuall possession of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
Neither did our Ancestors in the former exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
defer obedience to the Kings that came in by
power without Title; but gave it presently, being
presently vested and possessed of authority. Besides,
let it be considered whether that may not be called
a settlement, how soone soever it is, when there is
such a way setled that men may have Justice if
they will, and may enjoy that maine end of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracie,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45725:7"/>

            <p>And indeed when one is in possession by power,
and another pretends a Title, what can the maine

and States men have beene found ignorant of the
former observations, of the not succeeding three
in order of blood since the Conquest; and then how
should the Common people know it? Yet further,
even Peeres, chiefe Cities, Parliaments, and all
having to one in every three, thus subjected them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
upon termes of power and not of right;
what can be expected but that what hath been done,
may or shall be done hereafter? especially when
in this present age obedience is given to the Lawes
and Commands of those Princes. But some say
that there are Oathes that justifie disobedience to
the present Government. Surely Oathes are sacred
bonds and reverent obligements, and where they
doe not themselves leave or make us free, we are
not to cut or breake them in pieces; Yet concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
these there are faults on both hands: On the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45725:8"/>
one side the slighting of an Oath, (and such is the
comparing it with an Almanack) which is a light
aswell as an unproper comparison; except it were
such an Oath as was made onely for a yeare; But
we finde some part of the Vow and Covenant to
speake of all the dayes of our lives, which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
may lye on many of the takers for many years;
True it is that the obligation of some things may
end, because they can no longer be kept, as that of
the Kings person;<note place="margin">Regula juris. Impossibilium <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

no obligation: but will any man that understands,
and savours Religion and Piety, say that the clauses
which concerne Religion and Piety are expired?
Did we promise to God in our severall places and
callings, to extripate Profanenesse, Heresie, and
Blasphemy, and to endeavour a reformed life in
our selves and ours; onely till our Enemies were
overcome, and then to make an end? What were
this but to say unto God, If thou wilt deliver us,
we will be bound to thee till we are delivered and
no longer? Would this invite God to deliver us
from our enemies, or rather to keepe our Enemies
still in strength against us? least we being delivered
from our Enemies should not serve him in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
and holinesse all our lives. Surely this is too
like that course of carnall <hi>Israel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 78. 34.</note> of whom it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<hi>When he slew them, then they sought him,

               <note place="margin">Octob. 6. 1643</note>
            </p>
            <p>But on the other side there are other faults; such
are the urging of an Oath or Covenant against ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and not against friends in one and the same
Action; and if not altogether so, yet a slight and
diminishing charge of it upon one, and a vehement
and aggravating charge of it upon the other. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fault may be, a stiffe insisting on one part, and
a neglect, or at least silence in another part; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
when by event two parts of it come to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent,
to chuse and inforce the keeping of the
lighter or lesse necessary part, and to give way to
the losse and not keeping of the greater. There is
another, in racking an Oath or Covenant, to make
it speake that which it meant not. And here it
were good to consider, whether there be any clause
in any Oath or Covenant, which in a faire and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sence forbids obedience to the commands of
the present Government and Authority, much lesse
when no other can be had, and so the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth

that is not an Heire, how can it binde to an Heire

need not so much aske of Lawyers and learned
persons,<note place="margin">Iusjurandum in foro conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae semper est interpretandum juxta mentem jurantis; at info<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro exteriori seu ju diciali semper est judicandum secundum com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munem sensum, quem ipsa verba reddunt, &amp; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem hominum usum.</note> as of men of ordinary knowledge, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

the word Successor is taken for him that actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
succeeds in Government, and not for him that
is actually excluded. And as in Language the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

so that meaning is to be understood as most

like that betweene <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Absalom,</hi> where <hi>David</hi>
had an Army in veiw that might, and did overcome.
And next, That a course of Justice, or giving right is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and through the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
And this being the present state of the Nation, let
us examine whether it be lawfull to Act in such a State?
True it is that some hold it wisedome, and some hold
it duty, to be quiet, and not to Act. But, first, it hath bin
proved before that obedience to such a power in good
things is lawfull. Now if obedience in good things be
law full, then Acting for Justice and Order being good
things, and commanded, it is lawfull to obey that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if all should not Act, I think the not Actors
would fall short of their supposed and intended quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and the wisedome they placed in it: For by non-Acting
in the way of justice the whole (and themselves
among the rest) would lye open to Injustice spoyle and
destruction, and so be far from quietnesse. And indeed
what reason is it, that those that will not Act, because
they hold it unlawfull, should expect that others should
doe an unlawfull Act to benefit them? And why should
others give right to them that will not give right to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:45725:10"/>
Thirdly, It is cleared in this discourse, that those who
have gotten to be powers (though by force) yet ought
to give justice to those whose Goverment they
have undertaken. And againe, That the people may
lawfully demand it. But is it possible that one or a few
persons in supreme power can distribute justice to a
whole Nation without subordinate Agents? So that to
say, None may lawfully Act under the supreme power
in distributing of Justice, and Government, were to
say upon the matter, That he should give no ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and that the people should have no justice at all.
And then how absurd is it to teach that the people
may lawfully seeke justice of him, which they cannot
receive? and that he is bound to give justice, but none
are allowed by whom he may give it?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This Doctrine of not Acting is the very
Doctrine of Levelling. For when no man may Act to
give justice, may not every man take freely from his
Neighbour, what he list, and so levell the Rich with
the Poor? unlesse this make it unlike, because worse
then Levelling, That those who have most force, will
have most; yea some all, and others nothing; and so to
avoid Acting under a supposed Tyrannical Government
unto justice and order; there shall be Tyrants in every
place or parish, who shall Act to disorder and oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and no property, justice, nor Government at all left
amongst us. And surely I thinke <hi>David</hi> out of his love to
Israel would not have wished such an Estate, to Israel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Absalom,</hi> had he the whole in possession, and himselfe
no force on foote to recover it; nor would he have desir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
such an unsettlement to procure his settlement. And
hence ariseth that which they call an Interpretative con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the people; because it is understood and supposed
that every rational man doth consent, that there should
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45725:10"/>
be order, property and right given to every Member of
a Common-Wealth under a Tyrant, rather then all to
be under confusion oppression, Robberies, &amp; Murders.</p>
            <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">Ezra 7. 25.</note> how could <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> justifie their

Yet <hi>Ezra</hi> was authorized by him to set Magistrates,<note place="margin">Ezra 10. 7, 8.</note> fine

that he was Governour there about twelve yeares, and
he gave his Brother <hi>Hanani</hi> and <hi>Hanaiah</hi> Ruler of the

and others Acted under him. We finde also that at

               <hi>No man may punish or condemn ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
even with a just punishment, except he have publique
power, which a Tyrant cannot give. But in this there must be
a consideration or subdistinction. For in rigor this is true as
to the Tyrants part; yet it so happens that the Common-wealth
because it cannot resist him, doth tolerate him, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
it selfe to be Governed by him; and doth tacitely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and will that justice be administred by him, for the
reason already touched, because it is a lesse evill to be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned

things aforesaid, because the consent of the Common-wealth

Because his sentences, and just commands although they
have not force from a Tyrannicall power, yet they have it
from elsewhere. First, and inchoatively from the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which such a State of things being supposed, doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate
that obedience must be given for the Common good,
otherwise all will be full of Thefts and Roberies. Secondly,
and compleately from the Common-wealth; and that either
because while that State endures, it gives authority to
him by a tacite consent, while it will's that he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister
justice, and use his usurped Office in a due
maner, or rather because it doth tacitely approve his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and Acts being agreeable to the Lawes and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good, and will's that his just sentences, whereby the
suites of the people are decided, and the guilty are punished,
shall be valid and binde the subjects; for except they were
valid and did binde, no man would obey, but onely in shew
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45725:11"/>
but every man would secretly doe the contrary with a
great inconvenience to the Common-wealth. Now the
Common-wealth may give this force to the sentences,
and Acts of a Tyrant, because it is superiour to all single
persons, though it be opprest with Tyranny, and may
account the just sentence of a Tyrant as its owne.</p>

of murder, and be bound to restitution, if he put to death
guilty persons, or deprive them of their goods accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Law? I answer negatively; Because the
Common-wealth doth tacitely give him authority here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
while it doth consent, and desire, that this should
be done by him.</p>
            <p>Thus is the authority of Acting in this case groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon a tacite or implyed consent, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
is the very dictate of nature or common reason,
because it is better to have some justice then none
at all, some coercive power and Government, then
that all be left to disorder, violence, and confusion.
I will shut up all with the result of a disputation

they seeme to proceed from a judgement
cleare and free from the Byas of affection. Yea his
judgement herein did swim against the streame of
his affection; for he perswades an obedience to the
Government of a Governor that he loved not. And

The people are bound in conscience to agree unto,

that a Tyrant being powerfull in strength, and

               </note> When a Tyrant doth now peacebly govern
and cannot be repelled, it would be a great scandall
and perturbation to the Common-wealth not to obey
him. And it is thus proved; In the common opinion of
Doctors there is this difference betweene an expresse
consent of the Common-wealth and an interpretative,
that an expresse consent is required to choose a person,
and make him a true Prince; But that Subjects be
bound to obey, even one that is not a true Prince, an
interpretative consent is sufficient, because the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
good of their Common-wealth doth require it.
For rationally and prudently people are judged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to those things that are necessary for their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth;
But in this case (as it is plaine) it is
most expedient for the peace and good of the Common-wealth
that people should obey such a Tyrant. Therefore

               <p>I have (I confesse) in this subject gone out of the
ordinary path of my employments in medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and writing, but I did it occasionally out of
zeale to peace; and that which I beleeve to be
truth; being very sorry to see well meaning and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45725:14"/>
(I hope) pious persons, by not obeying, swiftly
and resolutely to goe out of the way of Peace, and
(as I suppose) of truth; At least it seemed to me
a sad thing that those who had not searched the
grounds of that which they held to be truth, yet
did certainely endanger the losse of peace for that
which they had not searched, and by searching
found certainely to be truth. Yet I wonder not
much if truth in this point be not commonly
knowne in this Nation, since amongst the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
in this Nation for these last fourescore years
there hath been little debate of it. But having ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
the substance and summe of those grounds
which in my judgement make out this truth, That
it is lawfull to obey the present Government, and
having shewed that this truth hath beene anciently
held and is not newly invented to serve present
turnes, and that either it may be beleeved, or at least
not condemned, unheard and unknowne, I shall
now desire leave to retire and return to my more
proper worke, whereof I have so much in my
hands that I cannot well expect a life now come
farre into the yeare accounted to be the terme of
life should have time to dispatch. If the grounds
proposed be sound (as we have seene them thought
so by men of great judgement) I hope they will
stand against all waves and winds, and they will
finde Patrons who have both strength of body and
minde to maintaine them; if they be proved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound,
I would not mainetaine them if I could.</p>
