            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>We have still the broken Materials of that first

and the dry Land appear'd. These things, Sir, I
propose and presume to prove in the following
Treatise, which I willingly submit to Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's
Iudgment and Censure: being very well satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
that if I had sought a Patron in all the List of
Kings, Your Contemporaries: Or in the Roll of
Your Nobles of either Order: I could not have
found a more competent Iudge in a Speculatitn of
this Nature. Your Majesty's Sagacity, and
happy Genius for Natural History, for Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Remarks upon the Earth, the Heavens,
and the Sea, is a better preparation for Inquiries of
this kind, than all the dead Learning of the
Schools.</p>
                  <p>Sir, This Theory in the full extent of it, is to
reach to the last Period of the Earth, and the End
of all things; But this first Volume takes in only so
much as is already past, from the Origin of the Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to this present time and state of Nature. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
in like manner the Changes and Revolutions of
Nature that are to come, and see thorough all suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Ages, will require a steddy and attentive Eye,
and a retreat from the noise of the World; Especially
so to connect the parts, and present them all under one
view, that we may see, as in a Mirrour, the several
faces of Nature, from First to Last, throughout
all the Circle of Successions.</p>
                  <p>Your Majesty having been pleas'd to give encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement

Your Gracious Acceptance. And 'tis our Interest,
as well as Duty, in Disquisitions of this Nature, to
Address our selves to Your Majesty, as the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

that would usurp upon the Fundamental privilege

suitable to the Greatness of a Princely Spirit, to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour

of Humane Knowledge, and the improvement
of Humane Nature. To be Good and Gracious,
and a Lover of Knowledge, are, methinks, two
of the most amiable things in this World; And that

                  <head>PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING given an account of this
whole Work in the first Chapter, and
of the method of either Book, whereof
this Volume consists, in their proper
places, there remains not much to be
said here to the Reader. This Theory
of the Earth may be call'd <hi>Sacred,</hi> because it is not the
common Physiology of the Earth, or of the Bodies
that compose it, but respects only the great Turns of
Fate, and the Revolutions of our Natural World: such
as are taken notice of in the Sacred Writings, and are
truly the Hinges upon which the Providence of this
Earth moves; or whereby it opens and shuts the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
successive Scenes whereof it is made up. This
<hi>English</hi> Edition is the same in substance with the <hi>Latin,</hi>
though, I confess, 'tis not so properly a Translation,
as a new Composition upon the same ground, there
being several additional Chapters in it, and several
new-moulded.</p>
                  <p>As every Science requires a peculiar Genius, so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
there is a Genius peculiarly improper for every
one; and as to Philosophy, which is the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the works of Nature, and the Providence that
governs them, there is no temper or Genius, in my
mind, so improper for it, as that which we call a <hi>mean</hi>
and <hi>narrow Spirit;</hi> and which the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <hi>Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Soul.</hi> This is a defect in the first make of some
Mens minds, which can scarce ever be corrected af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
either by Learning or Age. And as Souls
that are made little and incapacious cannot enlarge
their thoughts to take in any great compass of Times
<pb facs="tcp:41970:7"/>
or things; so what is beyond their compass, or above
their reach, they are apt to look upon as Fantastical,
or at least would willingly have it pass for such in the
World. Now as there is nothing so great, so large, so
immense, as the works of Nature, and the methods of
Providence, men of this complexion must needs be
very unfit for the contemplation of them. Who would
set a purblind Man at the top of the Mast to discover
Land? or upon an high Tower to draw a Landskip
of the Country round about? for the same reason,
short-sighted minds are unfit to make Philosophers,
whose proper business it is to discover and describe in
comprehensive Theories the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the World,
and the Causes of them.</p>
                  <p>This original disease of the Mind is seldom cur'd by
Learning which cures many others; Like a fault in the
first <hi>Stamina</hi> of the Body, it cannot easily be rectified
afterwards. 'Tis a great mistake to think that every
sort of Learning makes a Man a competent Judge of
Natural Speculations; We see unhappy examples to the
contrary amongst the Christian Fathers, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
in S. <hi>Austin,</hi> who was unquestionably a Man of Parts
and Learning, but interposing in a controversie where
his Talent did not lie, show'd his zeal against the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes</hi>
to very ill purpose, though he drew his Reasons
partly from Scripture. And if within a few Years, or
in the next Generation, it should prove as certain and
demonstrable, that the <hi>Earth is mov'd,</hi> as it is now,
that there are <hi>Antipodes;</hi> those that have been zealous
against it, and ingag'd the Scripture in the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
would have the same reason to repent of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness,
that S. <hi>Austin</hi> would have now, if he was
alive. 'Tis a dangerous thing to engage the authority
of Scripture in disputes about the Natural World, in
opposition to Reason; lest Time, which brings all
things to light, should discover that to be evidently
false which we had made Scripture to assert: And I
remember S. <hi>Austin</hi> in his Exposition upon <hi>Genesis,</hi> hath
laid down a rule to this very purpose, though he had
the unhappiness, it seems, not to follow it always him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
The reason also, which he gives there for his rule,

opinions, how shall they believe those same Books when they
tell them of the RESVRRECTION of the Dead, and
the World to come, if they find them to be fallaciously writ
in such things as lie within their certain Knowledge?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are not to suppose that any truth concerning
the Natural World can be an Enemy to Religion; for
Truth cannot be an Enemy to Truth, God is not divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
against himself; and therefore we ought not upon
that account to condemn or censure what we have not
examin'd or cannot disprove; as those that are of this
narrow Spirit we are speaking of, are very apt to do.
Let every thing be try'd and examin'd in the first place,
whether it be <hi>True</hi> or <hi>False;</hi> and if it be found false, 'tis
then to be consider'd, whether it be such a falsity as is
prejudicial to Religion or no. But for every new The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory
that is propos'd, to be alarm'd, as if all Religion
was falling about our Ears, is to make the World sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that we are very ill assur'd of the foundation it
stands upon. Besides, do not all Men complain, even
These as well as others, of the great ignorance of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind?
how little we know, and how much is still un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known?
and can we ever know more, unless some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
new be Discover'd? It cannot be old when it
comes first to light, when first invented, and first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd.
If a Prince should complain of the poorness of his
Exchequer, and the scarcity of Money in his Kingdom,
would he be angry with his Merchants, if they brought
him home a <hi>Cargo</hi> of good Bullion, or a Mass of Gold
out of a foreign Countrey? and give this reason only
for it, <hi>He</hi> would have no <hi>new Silver;</hi> neither should
any be Currant in his Dominions but what had his
own Stamp and Image upon it: How should this Prince
or his People grow rich? To complain of want, and
yet refuse all offers of a supply, looks very sullen, or very
fantastical.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:41970:8"/>
I might mention also upon this occasion another Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
and disposition in Men, which often makes them
improper for Philosophical Contemplations; not so
much, it may be, from the narrowness of their Spirit
and Understanding, as because they will not take time
to extend them. I mean Men of Wit and Parts, but of
short Thoughts, and little Meditation, and that are apt
to distrust every thing for a Fancy or Fiction that is
not the dictate of Sense, or made out immediately to
their Senses. Men of this Humour and Character call
such Theories as these, Philosophick Romances, and
think themselves witty in the expression; They allow
them to be pretty amusements of the Mind, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Truth or Reality. I am afraid if an Angel should
write the Theory of the Earth, they would pass the
same judgment upon it; Where there is variety of Parts
in a due Contexture, with something of surprizing apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the harmony and correspondency of them, this
they call a Romance; but such Romances must all
Theories of Nature, and of Providence be, and must
have every part of that Character with advantage, if
they be well represented. There is in them, as I may so
say, a <hi>Plot</hi> or <hi>Mystery</hi> pursued through the whole Work,
and certain Grand Issues or Events upon which the rest
depend, or to which they are subordinate; but these
things we do not make or contrive our selves, but
find and discover them, being made already by the
Great Author and Governour of the Universe: And
when they are clearly discover'd, well digested, and well
reason'd in every part, there is, methinks, more of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in such a Theory, at least a more masculine beauty,
than in any Poem or Romance; And that solid truth
that is at the bottom, gives a satisfaction to the Mind,
that it can never have from any Fiction, how artificial
soever it be.</p>
                  <p>To enter no farther upon this matter, 'tis enough to
observe, that when we make Judgments and Censures
upon general presumptions and prejudices, they are
made rather from the temper and model of our own
Spirits, than from Reason; and therefore, if we would
neither impose upon our selves, nor others, we must
<pb facs="tcp:41970:8"/>
lay aside that lazy and fallacious method of Censuring
by the Lump, and must bring things close to the test
of <hi>True</hi> or <hi>False,</hi> to explicit proof and evidence; And
whosoever makes such Objections against an <hi>Hypothesis,</hi>
hath a right to be heard, let his Temper and Genius be
what it will. Neither do we intend that any thing we
have said here, should be understood in another sence.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, This Theory being writ with a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
intention to justifie the Doctrines of the <hi>Vniversal
Deluge,</hi> and of a <hi>Paradisiacal</hi> state, and protect them
from the Cavils of those that are no well-wishers to
Sacred History, upon that account it may reasonably
expect fair usage and acceptance with all that are well-dispos'd;
And it will also be, I think, a great satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to them to see those pieces of most ancient Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
which have been chiefly preserv'd in Scripture,
confirm'd a-new, and by another Light, that of Nature
and Philosophy; and also freed from those miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
or misrepresentations which made them sit
uneasie upon the Spirits even of the best Men, that took
time to think. Lastly, In things purely Speculative,
as these are, and no ingredients of our Faith, it is free
to differ from one another in our Opinions and Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and so I remember S. <hi>Austin</hi> hath observ'd upon
this very subject of <hi>Paradise;</hi> Wherefore as we desire to
give no offence our selves, so neither shall we take any
at the difference of Judgment in others; provided this
liberty be mutual, and that we all agree to study
<hi>Peace, Truth</hi> and a <hi>good Life.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>INCE I was first inclin'd to the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Nature, and took pleasure to trace out
the Causes of Effects, and the dependance of one
thing upon another in the visible Creation, I
had always, methought, a particular curiosity
to look back into the Sources and ORIGINAL
of Things; and to view in my Mind, so far as I
was able, the Beginning and Progress of a RISING WORLD.</p>
                     <p>And after some Essays of this Nature, and, as I thought, not
unsuccessful, I carried on my enquiries further, to try whether
this <hi>Rising World,</hi> when form'd and finish'd, would continue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the same; in the same form, structure, and consistency;
or what changes it would successively undergo, by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
action of the same Causes that first produc'd it; And,
lastly, what would be its final Period and Consummation. This
whole Series and compass of things taken together, I call'd a
COURSE OF NATURE, or a SYSTEM OF NA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURAL
PROVIDENCE; and thought there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
belonging to the External World more fit or more worthy
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41970:12"/>
our study and meditation, nor any thing that would conduce
more to discover the ways of Divine Providence, and to shew us
the grounds of all true knowledge concerning Nature. And
therefore to clear up the several parts of this Theory, I was wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to lay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> aside a great many other Speculations, and all those
dry subtleties with which the Schools, and the Books of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
are usually fill'd.</p>
                     <p>But when we speak of a <hi>Rising World,</hi> and the Contemplation
of it, we do not mean this of the <hi>Great Universe;</hi> for who can
describe the Original of that vast Frame? But we speak of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lundry
World,</hi> This Earth and its dependencies, which rose out of a
Chaos about six thousand years ago; And seeing it hath faln to
our lot to act upon this Stage, to have our present home and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence
here, its seems most reasonable, and the place design'd
by Providence, where we should first imploy our thoughts to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the works of God and Nature. We have accordingly
therefore design'd in this Work to give an account of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
of the Earth, and of all the great and General Changes
that it hath already undergone, or is hence forwards to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,
till the Consummation of all Things. For if from those
Principles we have here taken, and that Theory we have begun
in these Two First Books, we can deduce with success and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
the Origin of the Earth, and those States of it that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
past; Following the same Thred, and by the conduct of
the same Theory, we will pursue its Fate and History through
future Ages, and mark all the great Changes and Conversions
that attend it <hi>while Day and Night shall last;</hi> that is, so long as it
continues an Earth.</p>
                     <p>By the States of the Earth that are already past, we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
chiefly <hi>Paradise</hi> and the <hi>Deluge;</hi> Names well known and
as little known in their Nature. By the Future States we und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the <hi>Conslagration,</hi> and what new Order of Nature may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
upon that, till the whole Circle of Time and Providence be
compleated. As to the first and past States of the Earth, we shall
have little help from the Ancients, or from any of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
for the discovery or description of them; We must often
tread unbeaten paths, and make a way where we do not find
one; but it shall be always with a Light in our hand, that we
may see our steps, and that those that follow us may not follow
us blindly. There is no Sect of Philosophers that I know of,
that ever gave an account of the Universal Deluge, or disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd,
from the Contemplation of the Earth, that there had been
such a thing already in Nature. 'Tis true, they often talk of
an alternation of <hi>Deluges</hi> and <hi>Conflagrations</hi> in this Earth, but they
speak of them as things to come; at least they give no proof or
argument of day that hath already destroyed the World. As to
<hi>Paradise,</hi> it seems to be represented to us by the <hi>Golden Age;</hi>
whereof the Ancients tell many stories, sometimes very luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant;
and sometimes very defective: For they did not so well
understand the difference betwixt the New-made Earth and the
Present, as to see what were the just grounds of the Golden Age,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41970:12"/>
or of Paradise: Tho' they had many broken Notions concerning
those things, As to the <hi>Conslagration</hi> in particular, This hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
been reckon'd One amongst the Opinions or Dogmata of
the Stoicks, <hi>That the World was to be destroy'd by Fire;</hi> and their
Books are full of this Notion; but yet they do not tell us the Causes
of the Conflagration, nor what preparations there are in Nature,
or will be, towards that great Change. And we may generally
observe this of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> that their Learning or Philosophy
consisted more in Conclusions, than in Demonstrations; They had
many Truths among them, whereof they did not know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the Premisses or the Proofs: Which is an argument to me,
that the knowledge they had, was not a thing of their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
or which they came to by fair Reasoning and observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon Nature, but was delivered to them from others by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and Ancient Fame, sometimes more publick, sometimes more
secret: These Conclusions they kept in Mind, and communicated
to those of their School, or Sect, or Posterity, without knowing,
for the most part, the just grounds and reasons of them.</p>
                     <p>'Tis the Sacred Writings of Scripture that are the best Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Antiquity, and to those we are chiefly beholden for the
History of the First Ages, whether Natural History or Civil. 'Tis
true, the Poets, who were the most Ancient Writers amongst
the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and serv'd them both for Historians, Divines, and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,
have deliver'd some things concerning the first Ages of
the World, that have a fair resemblance of Truth, and some affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
with those accounts that are given of the same things by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Authors, and these may be of use in due time and place; but
yet, lest any thing fabulous should be mixt with them, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
there is, we will never depend wholly upon their credit,
nor assert any thing upon the authority of the Ancients which is
not first prov'd by Natural Reason, or warranted by Scripture.</p>
                     <p>It seems to me very reasonable to believe, that besides the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of Religion, which are the principal subject and design of
the Books of Holy Scripture, there may be providentially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
in them the memory of things and times so remote, as
could not be retriev'd, either by History, or by the light of Nature;
and yet were of great importance to be known, both for their own
excellency, and also to rectifie the knowledge of men in other
things consequential to them: Such points may be, <hi>Our great
Epocha</hi> or the Age of the Earth, The Origination of Mankind,
The First and Paradisiacal State, The destruction of the Old World
by an Universal Deluge, The Longevity of its Inhabitants, The
manner of their preservation, and of their Peopling the Second
Earth; and lastly, The Fate and Changes it is to undergo. These
I always lookt upon as the Seeds of great knowledge, or heads of
Theories fixt on purpose to give us aim and direction how to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
the rest that depend upon them. But these heads, you see, are
of a mixt order, and we propose to our selves in this Work only
such as belong to the Natural World; upon which I believe the
trains of Providence are generally laid; And we must first consider
how God hath order'd Nature, and then how the Oeconomy of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41970:13"/>
the Intellectual World is adapted to it; for of these two parts consist
the full System of Providence. In the mean time, what subject can
be more worthy the thoughts of any serious person, than to view
and consider the Rise and Fall, and all the Revolutions, not of a
Monarchy or an Empire, of the <hi>Grecian</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> State, but of
an intire World.</p>
                     <p>The obscurity of these things, and their remoteness from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
knowledge will be made an argument by some, why we
should not undertake them; And by others, it may be, the very
same thing will be made an argument why we should; for my
part I think <hi>There is nothing so secret that shall not be brought to Light,</hi>
within the compass of <hi>Our World;</hi> for we are not to understand
that of the whole Universe, nor of all Eternity, our capacities do
not extend so far; But whatsoever concerns this Sublunary
World in the whole extent of its duration, from the Chaos to
the last period, this I believe Providence hath made us capable to
understand, and will in its due time make it known. All I say,
betwixt the first Chaos and the last Completion of Time and all
things temporary, This was given to the disquisitions of men;
On either hand is Eternity, before the World and after, which is
without our reach: But that little spot of ground that lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
those two great Oceans, this we are to cultivate, this we
are Masters of, herein we are to exercise our thoughts, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
and lay open the Treasures of the Divine Wisdom and
Goodness hid in this part of Nature and of Providence.</p>
                     <p>As for the difficult or obscurity of an argument, that does
but add to the pleasure of contesting with it, when there are hopes
of victory; and success does more than recompence all the pains.
For there is no sort of joy more greatful to the mind of Man,
than that which ariseth from the invention of Truth; especially
when 'tis hard to come by. Every Man hath a delight suited to
his Genius, and as there is pleasure in the right exercise of any
faculty, so especially in that of Right-reasoning; which is still
the greater, by how much the consequences are more clear, and
the chains of them more long: There is no Chase so pleasant,
methinks, as to drive a Thought, by good conduct, from one
end of the World to the other; and never to lose sight of it till it
fall into Eternity, where all things are lost as to our knowledge.</p>
                     <p>This Theory being chiefly Philosophical, Reason is to be our
first Guide; and where that falls short, or any other just occasion
offers it self, we may receive further light and confirmation from
the Sacred Writings. Both these are to be lookt upon as of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Original, God is the Author of both; He that made the
Scripture made also our Faculties, and twere a reflection upon
the Divine Veracity, for the one or the other to be false when
rightly us'd. We must therefore be careful and tender of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
these to one another, because that is, in effect, to oppose God
to himself. As for Antiquity and the Testimonies of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
we only make general reflections upon them, for illustration
rather than proof of what we propose; not thinking it proper for
an English Treatise to multiply citations out of Greek or Latin
Authors.</p>

                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:41970:13"/>
I am very sensible it will be much our interest, That the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of this Theory should be of an ingenuous and unprejudic'd
Temper; neither does it so much require Book-learning and Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larship,
as good natural sence to distinguish <hi>True</hi> and <hi>false,</hi> and
to discern what is well prov'd, and what is not. It often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
that Scholastick Education, like a Trade, does so fix a Man
in a particular way, that he is not fit to judge of any thing that lies
out of that way; and so his Learning becomes a clog to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
parts, and makes him more indocile, and more incapable
of new thoughts and new improvements, than those that have
only the Talents of Nature. As Masters of exercise had rather
take a Scholar that never learn'd before, than one that hath had
a bad Master; so generally one would rather chuse a Reader with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
art, than one ill-instructed; with Learning, but opinionative
and without judgment; yet it is not necessary they should want
either, and Learning well plac'd strengthens all the powers of the
Mind. To conclude, just reasoning and a generous love of Truth,
whether with or without Erudition, is that which makes us
most competent Judges what is True; and further than this, in
the perusal and examination of This Work, as to the Author as
much Candor as you please, but as to the Theory we require no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but attention and impartiality.</p>

                     <p>'TIS now more than Five Thousand Years since our World
was made, and though it would be a great pleasure to the
Mind, to recollect and view at this distance those first Scenes of
Nature: What the face of the Earth was when fresh and new,
and how things differ'd from the state we now find them in, the
speculation is so remote, that it seems to be hopeless, and beyond
the reach of Humane Wit. We are almost the last Posterity of
the First Men, and faln into the dying Age of the World; by
what footsteds or by what guide, can we trace back our way
to those First Ages, and the first order of things? And yet, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,
it is reasonable to believe, that Divine Providence, which
sees at once throughout all the Ages and Orders of the World,
should not be willing to keep Mankind finally and fatally ignorant
of that part of Nature and of the Universe, which is properly
their Task and Province to manage and understand. We are the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41970:14"/>
Inhabitants of the Earth, the Lords and Masters of it; and we are
endow'd with Reason and Understanding; doth it not then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
belong to us to examine and unfold the Works of God in
this part of the Universe, which is faln to our lot, which is our
heritage and habitation? And it will be found, it may be, upon
a stricter Enquiry, that in the present form and constitution of
the Earth, there are certain marks and Indications of its first
State; with which if we compare those things that are recorded
in Sacred History, concerning the first Chaos, Paradise, and an
Universal Deluge, we may discover, by the help of those Lights,
what the Earth was in its first Original, and what Changes have
since succeded in it.</p>
                     <p>And though we shall give a full account of the Origin of the
Earth in this Treatise, yet that which we have propos'd particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
for the Title and Subject of it, is to give an account of the
primaeval PARADISE, and of the Universal DELUGE,
Those being the two most important things that are explain'd by
the Theory we propose. And I must beg leave in treating of
these two, to change the Order, and treat first of the Deluge,
and then of Paradise: For though the State of Paradise doth
precede that of the Flood in Sacred History, and in the nature
of the thing, yet the explication of both will be more sensible,
and more effectual, if we begin with the Deluge; there being more
Observations and Effects, and those better known to us, that
may be refer'd to this, than to the other; and the Deluge being
once truly explain'd, we shall from thence know the Form and
Quality of the Ante-diluvian Earth. Let us then proceed to the
explication of that great and fatal Inundation, whose History is
well known; and according to <hi>Moses,</hi> the best of Historians, in
a few words is this—</p>
                     <p>Sixteen Hundred and odd years after the Earth was made, and
inhabited, it was over-flow'd, and destroy'd in a Deluge of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Not a Deluge that was National only, or over-run some
particular Country or Region, as <hi>Iudea</hi> or <hi>Greece,</hi> or any other,
but it overspread the face of the whole Earth, from Pole to Pole,
and from East to West, and that in such excess, that the Floods
over-reacht the Tops of the highest Mountains; the Rains de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
after an unusual manner, and the fountains of the <hi>Great
Deep</hi> being broke open; so as a general destruction and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vastation
was brought upon the Earth, and all things in it, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
and other living Creatures; excepting only <hi>Noah</hi> and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
who by a special Providence of God was preserv'd in a
certain Ark, or Vessel made like a Ship, and such kinds of living
Creatures as he took in to him. After these Waters had rag'd for
some time on the Earth, they began to lessen and shrink, and the
great waves and fluctuations of this <hi>Deep</hi> or <hi>Abysse,</hi> being quieted
by degrees, the Waters retir'd into their Chanels and Caverns
within the Earth; and the Mountains and Fields began to appear,
and the whole habitable Earth in that form and shape wherein we
now see it. Then the World began again, and from that little
Remnant preserv'd in the Ark, the present race of Mankind, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41970:14"/>
of Animals, in the known parts of the Earth, were propagated.
Thus perish'd the Old World, and the present arose from the
ruines and remains of it.</p>
                     <p>This is a short story of the greatest thing that every yet hapned
in the World, the greatest revolution and the greatest change in
Nature; and if we come to reflect seriously upon it, we shall find
it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to give an account of the
Waters that compos'd this Deluge, whence they came or whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they went. It it had been only the Inundation of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
or of a Province, or of the greatest part of a Continent, some
proportionable causes perhaps might have been found out; but a
Deluge overflowing the whole Earth: the whole Circuit and whole
Extent of it: burying all in Water, even the greatest Mountains:
in any known parts of the Universe, to find Water sufficient for
this Effect, as it is generally explained and understood, I think is
impossible. And that we may the better judge of the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
let us first compute how much Water would be requisite for
such a Deluge: or to lay the Earth, consider'd in its present
form, and the highest Mountains, under Water. Then let's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
whether such a quantity of Water can be had out of all the
stores that we know in Nature: And from these two we will
take our Ground and Rise, and begin to reflect, whether the World
hath not been hitherto mistaken in the common opinion and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of the general Deluge.</p>
                     <p>To discover how much Water would be requisite to make this
Deluge, we must first suppose enough to cover the plain surface of
the Earth, the Fields and lower Grounds; then we must heap up so
much more upon this, as will reach above the tops of the highest
Mountains; so as drawing a Circle over the tops of the highest
Mountains quite round the Earth, suppose from Pole to Pole,
and another to meet it round the middle of the Earth, all that
space or capacity contin'd within these Circles is to be fill'd up
with Water. This I confess will make a prodigious mass of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and it looks frightfully to the imagination; 'tis huge and
great, but 'tis extravagantly so, as a great Monster: It doth not
look like the work of God or Nature: However let's compute a
little more particularly how much this will amount to, or how
many Oceans of Water would be necessary to compose this great
Ocean rowling in the Air, without bounds or banks.</p>
                     <p>If all the Mountains were par'd off the Earth, and so the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of it lay even, or in an equal convexity every where with
the surface of the Sea, from this surface of the Sea, let us sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that the height of the Mountains may be a mile and a half;
or that we may not seem at all to favour our own opinion or
calculation, let us take a mile only for the perpendicular height
of the Mountains. Let us on the other side suppose the Sea to
cover half the Earth, as 'tis generally believ'd to do; and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
depth of it, taking one place with another, to be about a
quarter of a mile, or 250 paces. I say, taking one place with
another, for though the middle Chanel of the great Ocean be far
deeper, we may observe, that there is commonly a descent or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivity
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41970:15"/>
from the shore to the middle part of the Chanel, so that
one comes by degrees into the depth of it; and those shory parts
are generally but some fathoms deep. Besides, in arms of the Sea,
in Straits, and among Islands, there is commonly no great depth,
and some places are plain shallows. So as upon a moderate
computation, one place compar'd with another, we may take a
quarter of a mile, or about an hundred fathoms, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
measure of the depth of the Sea, if we were cast into a
Chanel of an equal depth every where. This being suppos'd,
there would need four Oceans to lie upon this Ocean, to raise it
up to the top of the Mountains, or so high as the Waters of the
Deluge rise; then four Oceans more to lie upon the Land, that
the Water there might swell to the same height; which together
make eight Oceans for the proportion of the Water requir'd in
the Deluge.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, there would not be altogether so much Water re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
for the Land as for the Sea, to raise them to an equal
height; because Mountains and Hills would fill up part of that
space upon the Land, and so make less Water requisite. But to
compensate this, and confirm our computation, we must consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in the first place, that we have taken a much less height of
the Mountains than is requisite, if we respect the Mediterraneous
Mountains, or those that are at a great distance from the Sea;
For their height above the surface of the Sea, computing the
declivity of the Land all along from the Mountains to the Sea-side
(and that there is such a declivity is manifest from the course
and descent of the Rivers) is far greater than the proportion we
have taken: The height of Mountains is usually taken from the
foot of them, or from the next Plain, which if it be far from the
Sea, we may reasonably allow as much for the declension of the
Land from that place to the Sea, as for the immediate height of
the Mountain; So, for instance, the Mountains of the Moon in
<hi>Africa,</hi> whence the <hi>Nile</hi> flows, and after a long course falls into
the Mediterranean Sea by <hi>Egypt,</hi> are so much higher than the
surface of that Sea, first, as the Ascent of the Land is from the
Sea to the foot of the Mountains, and then as the height of the
Mountains is from the bottom to the top: For both these are
to be computed when you measure the height of a Mountain, or
of a mountainous Land, in respect of the Sea: And the height of
Mountains to the Sea being thus computed, there would be need
of six or eight Oceans to raise the Sea alone as high as the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
In-land Mountains; And this is more than enough to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensate
the less quantity of Water that would be requisite upon
the Land. Besides, we must consider the Regions of the Air up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to be more capacious than a Region of the same thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in or near the Earth, so as if an Ocean pour'd upon the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the dry Land, supposing it were all smooth, would rise to
the height of half a quarter of a mile every where; the like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Water pour'd again at the height of the Mountains, would
not have altogether the same effect, or would not there raise the
mass half a quarter of a mile higher; for the surfaces of a Globe,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41970:15"/>
the farther they are from their Center, are the greater; and so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
the Regions that belong to them. And, lastly, we must
consider that there are some Countries or Valleys very low, and
also many Caverns or Cavities within the Earth, all which in this
case were to be first fill'd with Water. These things being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
and estimated, we shall find that notwithstanding the room
that Hills and Mountains take up on the dry Land, there would
be at least eight Oceans requir'd, or a quantity of Water eight times
as great as the Ocean, to bring an Universal Deluge upon the Earth,
as that Deluge is ordinarily understood and explained.</p>
                     <p>The proportion of Water for the Deluge being thus stated, the
next thing to be done, is to enquire where this Water is to be found;
if any part of the Sublunary World will afford us so much:
Eight Oceans floating in the Air, make a great bulk of Water, I
do not know what possible Sources to draw it from. There are
the Clouds above, and the Deeps below and in the bowels of the
Earth; and these are all the stores we have for Water; and <hi>Moses</hi>
directs us to no other for the Causes of the Deluge. <hi>The Fountains</hi> (he
saith) <hi>of the great Abysse were broken up, or burst asunder,</hi> and the
Rain descended for forty days, the <hi>Cataracts</hi> or <hi>Floodgates</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
being open'd. And in these two, no doubt, are contain'd the
causes of the great Deluge, as according to <hi>Moses,</hi> so also according
to reason and necessity; for our. World affords no other treasures
of Water. Let us therefore consider how much this Rain of Forty
Days might amount to, and how much might flow out of the
Abysse, that so we may judge whether these two in conjunction
would make up the Eight Oceans which we want.</p>
                     <p>As for the Rains, they would not afford us one Ocean, nor half
an Ocean, nor the tenth part of an Ocean, if we may trust to the
Observations made by others concerning the quantity of Water
that falls in Rain.<note place="margin">Cog. Phys. Mech. <hi>p.</hi> 221.</note> 
                        <hi>Mersennus</hi> gives us this account of it. <q>It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by our Observations, that a Cubical Vessel of Brass, whereof
we made use, is fill'd an inch and an half in half an hours time;
but because that sucks up no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>hing of the moisture as the Earth
doth, let us take an inch for half an hours Rain; whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
that in the space of 40 days and nights Rain, the Waters
in the Deluge would rise 160 feet,<note place="margin">At. 4 feet in 24 hours.</note> if the Rains were constant
and equal to ours, and that it rain'd at once throughout the face
of the whole Earth.</q> But the Rain of the Deluge, saith he,
should have been 90 times greater than this, to cover, for instance,
the Mountains of <hi>Armenia,</hi> or to reach 15 Cubits above them.
So that according to his computation, the 40 days Rain would
supply little more than the hundredth part of the Water requisite
to make the Deluge. 'Tis true, he makes the heighth of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
higher than we do; but, however, if you temper the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
on all sides as much as you please, the water that came
by this Rain would be a very inconsiderable part of what was
necessary for a Deluge. If it rain'd 40 days and 40 nights through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the face of the whole Earth, in the Northern and Southern
Hemisphere all at once, it might be sufficient to lay all the lower
grounds under water, but it would signifie very little as to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41970:16"/>
the over-flowing of the Mountains. Whence another Author up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the same occasion hath this passage.<note place="margin">Auct. cat. in <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 4.</note> 
                        <q>If the Deluge had been
made by Rains only, there would not have needed 40 days,
but 40 years Rain to have brought it to pass.</q> And if we should
suppose the whole middle Region condens'd into water, it would
not at all have been sufficient for this effect, according to that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
some make betwixt Air and Water; for they say, Air
turn'd into Water takes up a hundred times less room than it did
before. The truth is, we may reasonably suppose, that all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
of the middle Region were turn'd into water in this 40 days
and 40 nights Rain, if we admit, that this Rain was throughout
the whole Earth at once, in either Hemisphere, in every Zone, in
every Climate, in every Country, in every Province, in every
Field; and yet we see what a small proportion all this would
amount to.</p>
                     <p>Having done then with these Superiour Regions, we are next
to examine the Inferiour, and the treasures of water that may be
had there. <hi>Moses</hi> tells us, that the Fountains of the great Abysse
were broke open, or <hi>clove asunder,</hi> as the word there us'd doth,
imply; and no doubt in this lay the great mystery of the Deluge,
as will appear when it comes to be rightly understood and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd;
but we are here to consider what is generally understood
by the <hi>great Abysse,</hi> in the common explication of the Deluge;
and 'tis commonly interpreted either to be the Sea, or Subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
waters hid in the bowels of the Earth: These, they say,
broke forth and rais'd the waters, caus'd by the Rain, to such an
height, that together they overflowed the highest Mountains.
But whether or how this could be, deserves to be a little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd.</p>
                     <p>And in the first place; the Sea is not higher than the Land,
as some have formerly imagin'd; fansying the Sea stood, as it
were, upon a heap, higher than the shore; and at the Deluge a
relaxation being made, it overflow'd the Land. But this conceit
is so gross, and so much against reason and experience, that none
I think of late have ventur'd to make use of it. And yet on the
other hand, if the Sea lie in an equal convexity with the Land, or
lower generally than the shore, and much more than the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
as it is certainly known to do, what could the Sea contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to the Deluge? It would keep its Chanel, as it doth now;
and take up the same place. And so also the Subterraneous wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
would lie quiet in their Cells? whatsoever Fountains or
passages you suppose, these would not issue out upon the Earth,
for water doth not ascend, unless by force. But lets imagine then
that force us'd and appli'd, and the waters both of the Sea and
Caverns under ground drawn out upon the surface of the Earth,
we shall not be any whit the nearer for this; for if you take
these waters out of their places, those places must be fill'd again
with other waters in the Deluge; so as this turns to no account
upon the whole. If you have two Vessels to fill, and you empty
one to fill the other, you gain nothing by that, there still remains
one Vessel empty, you cannot have these waters both in the Sea
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41970:16"/>
and on the Land, both above ground and under; nor can you
suppose the Chanel of the Sea would stand gaping without water,
when all the Earth was overflow'd, and the tops of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
cover'd. And so for Subterraneous Cavities, if you suppose
the water pumpt out, they would suck it in again when the
Earth came to be laid under water; so that upon the whole, if you
thus understand the <hi>Abysse</hi> or <hi>great Deep,</hi> and the breaking open
its <hi>Fountains</hi> in this manner, it doth us no service as to the Deluge,
and where we expected the greatest supply, there we find none
at all.</p>
                     <p>What shall we do then? whither shall we go to find more than
seven Oceans of water that we still want? We have been above
and below; we have drain'd the whole middle Region, and we
have examin'd the Deeps of the Earth; they must want for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they say, if they give us any; And, besides, if the Earth
should disgorge all the water that it hath in its bowels, it would
not amount to above half an Ocean, which would not at all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
our occasions. Must we not then conclude, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
explication of the Deluge makes it impossible? there being no
such quantity of water in Nature as they make requisite for an
universal Deluge. Yet to give them all fair play, having examin'd
the waters above the Earth or in the Air, the waters upon the
Earth, and the waters under the Earth; let us also consider if
there be not waters above the Heavens, and if those might not
be drawn down for the Deluge. <hi>Moses</hi> speaks of waters <hi>above the
firmament,</hi> which though it be generally understood of the middle
Region of the Air, yet some have thought those to be waters plac'd
above the highest Heavens, or <hi>Super-celestial</hi> waters: and have
been willing to make use of them for a supply, when they could
not find materials enough under the Heavens to make up the great
mass of the Deluge. But the Heavens above, where these waters
lay, are either solid, or fluid; if solid, as Glass or Crystal, how
could the waters get through 'em to descend upon the Earth? If
fluid, as the Air or Aether, how could the waters rest upon them?
For Water is heavier than Air or Aether; So that I am afraid those
pure Regions will prove no fit place for that Element, upon any
account. But supposing these waters there, how imaginary so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
and that they were brought down to drown the World in
that vast quantity that would be necessary, what became of them,
when the Deluge ceas'd; Seven or eight Oceans of water, with
the Earth wrapt up in the middle of them, how did it ever get
quit of them? how could they be dispos'd of when the Earth
was to be dri'd, and the World renew'd? It would be a hard task
to lift them up again among the Spheres, and we have no room for
them here below. The truth is, I mention this opinion of the
Heavenly waters, because I would omit none that had ever been
made use of to make good the common explication of the Deluge;
but otherwise, I think, since the System of the World hath been
better known, and the Nature of the Heavens, there are none
that would seriously assert these Super-celestial waters, or, at least,
make use of them so extravagantly, as to bring them down hither
for causes of the Deluge.</p>
                     <p>

We have now employ'd our last and utmost endeavours to find
out waters for the vulgar Deluge, or for the Deluge as common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understood; and you see with how little success; we have
left no corner unsought, where there was any appearance or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of water to be found, and yet we have not been able to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
the eighth part of what was necessary upon a moderate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
May we not then with assurance conclude, that the
World hath taken wrong measures hitherto in their notion and
explication of the general Deluge? They make it impossible and
unintelligible upon a double account, both in requiring more wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than can be found, and more than can be dispos'd of, if it
was found: or could any way be withdrawn from the Earth
when the Deluge should cease. For if the Earth was encompass'd
with eight Oceans of water heapt one upon another, how these
should retire into any Chanels, or be drain'd off, or the Earth
any way disengag'd from them, is not intelligible; and that in so
short a time as some months: For the violence of the Deluge
lasted but four or five months, and in as many months after the
Earth was dry and habitable. So as upon the whole enquiry,
we can neither find source nor issue, beginning nor ending, for
such an excessive mass of Waters as the Vulgar Deluge requir'd;
neither where to have them, nor if we had them, how to get
quit of them. And I think men cannot do a greater injury or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
to Sacred History, than to give such representations of
things recorded there, as make them unintelligible and incredible;
And on the other hand, we cannot deserve better of Religion and
Providence, than by giving such fair accounts of all things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
by them, or belonging to them, as may silence the Cavils
of Atheists, satisfie the inquisitive, and recommend them to the
belief and acceptance of all reasonable persons.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. III. All Evasions answered; That there was no new Creation of
waters at the Deluge: And that it was not particular or
National, but extended throughout the whole Earth. A
prelude and preparation to the true Account and Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of it: The method of the first Book.</head>
                     <p>THough in the preceding Chapter we may seem to have given
a fair trial to the common opinion concerning the state of
the Deluge, and might now proceed to sentence of condemnation:
yet having heard of another plea, which some have us'd in its
behalf, and another way found out by recourse to the Supream
Power, to supply all defects, and to make the whole matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41970:17"/>
we will proceed no further till that be consider'd; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very willing to examine whatsoever may be offer'd, in that
or any other way, for resolving that great difficulty which we
have propos'd, concerning <hi>the quantity of water requisite for such a
Deluge.</hi> And to this they say in short, that <hi>God Almighty created
waters on purpose to make the Deluge, and then annihilated them again
when the Deluge was to cease;</hi> And this, in a few words, is the
whole account of the business. This is to out the knot when we
cannot loose it; They shew us the naked arm of Omnipotency;
such Arguments as these come like lightning, one doth not know
what Armour to put on against them, for they pierce the more,
the more they are resisted: We will not therefore oppose any
thing to them that is hard and stubborn, but by a soft answer
deaden their force by degrees.</p>
                     <p>And I desire to mind those persons in the first place of what
S. <hi>Austin</hi> hath said upon a like occasion, speaking concerning those
that disprov'd the opinion of waters above the Heavens (which
we mention'd before) by natural Reasons. <q>We are not, saith
he, to refute those persons, by saying, that according to the
Omnipotence of God, to whom all things are possible, we ought
to believe there are waters there as heavy as we know and feel
them here below; for our business is now to enquire according
to his Scripture, how God hath constituted the Nature of
things, and not what he could do or work in these things,
by a miracle of Omnipotency.</q> I desire them to apply this
to the present argument for the first answer.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, let them consider, that <hi>Moses</hi> hath assign'd causes of
the Deluge; <hi>Forty days Rain, and the disruption of the Abysse;</hi> and
speaks nothing of a new creation of water upon that occasion.
Those were causes in Nature which Providence had then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
for this extraordinary effect, and those the Divine Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
refers us to, and not to any productions out of nothing. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
<hi>Moses</hi> makes the Deluge increase by degrees with the Rain,
and accordingly makes it cease by degrees, and that the waters
<hi>going and returning,</hi> as the waves and great commotions of the Sea
use to do, retir'd leisurely from the face of the Earth, and settled
at length in their Chanels. Now this manner of the beginning
or ceasing of the Deluge doth not at all agree with the instanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
actions of Creation and Annihilation.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 6.</note> let them consider, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> hath also assign'd <hi>Causes</hi>
of the Deluge; namely the particular constitution of the Earth
and Heavens before the Flood; by <hi>reason whereof,</hi> he saith, <hi>the
World that was then, perisht in a Deluge of water.</hi> And not by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of a new creation of water. His words are these, <q>The
Heavens and the Earth were of old, consisting of water, and by
water; whereby, or by reason whereof, the World that then
was, being overflowed with water, perished.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, they are to consider, that as we are not rashly to have
recourse to the Divine Omnipotence upon any account, so espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
not for new Creations; and least of all for the creation of
new matter. The matter of the Universe was created many Ages
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41970:18"/>
before the Flood, and the Universe being full, if any more was
created, then there must be as much annihilated at the same time
to make room for it; for Bodies cannot penetrate one anothers
dimensions, nor be two or more within one and the same space.
Then on the other hand, when the Deluge ceas'd, and these waters
were annihilated, so much other matter must be created again to
take up their places: And methinks they make very bold with the
Deity, when they make him do and undo, go forward and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by such countermarches and retractions, as we do not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
impute to the wisdom of God Almighty.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, I shall not think my labour lost, if it be but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd,
that we have so far clear'd the way in this controversie, as
to have brought it to this issue; That either there must be new
waters created on purpose to make a Deluge, or there could be
no Deluge, as 'tis vulgarly explain'd; there not being water suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
in Nature to make a Deluge of that kind. This, I say, is a
great step, and, I think, will satisfie all parties, at least all that
are considerable; for those that have recourse to a New Creation
of waters, are of two sorts, either such as do it out of laziness
and ignorance, or such as do it out of necessity, seeing they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be had otherwise; as for the first, they are not to be valu'd
or gratifi'd; and as for the second, I shall do a thing very accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to them, if I free them and the argument from that necessity,
and show a way of making the Deluge fairly intelligible, and
accountable without the creation of new waters; which is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of this Treatise. For we do not tye this knot with an Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to puzzle and perplex the Argument finally with it, but the
harder it is ty'd, we shall feel the pleasure more sensibly when
come to loose it.</p>
                     <p>It may be when they are beaten from this new Creation of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
they will say the Element of Air was chang'd into water, and
that was the great store-house for the Deluge. Forty days Rain
we allow, as <hi>Moses</hi> does, but if they suppose any other transele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,
it neither agrees with <hi>Moses</hi>'s Philosophy, nor S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s;
for then the <hi>opening of the Abysse</hi> was needless, and the form and
constitution of the Antediluvian <hi>Heavens</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> which S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
refers the Deluge to, bore no part in the work; it might have
been made, in that way, indifferently under any Heavens or
Earth. Besides they offend against S. <hi>Austin</hi>'s rule in this method
too; for I look upon it as no less a miracle to turn Air into Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
than to turn Water into Wine. <hi>Air,</hi> I say, for Vapours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
are but water made volatile, but pure Air is a body of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Species, and cannot by any compression or condensation,
so far as is yet known, be chang'd into water. And lastly, if the
whole Atmosphere was turn'd into water, 'tis very probable it
would make no more than 34 foot or thereabouts; for so much
Air or Vapours as is of the same weight with any certain quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of water, 'tis likely, if it was chang'd into water, would also
be of the same bulk with it, or not much more: Now according
to the doctrine of the Gravitation of the Atmosphere, 'tis found
that 34 foot of water does counterbalance a proportionable Cylin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41970:18"/>
of Air reaching to the top of the Atmosphere; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
if the whole Atmosphere was converted into water, it
would make no more than eleven or twelve yards water about the
Earth; which the cavities of the Earth would be able in a good
measure to suck up, at least this is very inconsiderable as to our
eight Oceans. And if you would change the higher Regions into
water too, what must supply the place of that Air which you
transform into water, and bring down upon the Earth? There
would be little left but Fire and Aether betwixt us and the Moon,
and I am afraid it would endanger to suck down the Moon too
after it. In a word, such an explication as this, is both, purely
imaginary, and also very operose, and would affect a great part of
the Universe; and after all, they would be as hard put to't to get
rid of this water, when the Deluge was to cease, as they were at
first to procure it.</p>
                     <p>Having now examin'd and answered all the pleas, from first to
last, for the vulgar Deluge, or the old way of explaining it, we
should proceed immediately to propose another method, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
ground for an universal Deluge, were it not that an opinion
hath been started by some of late, that would in effect supplant
both these methods, old and new, and take away in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
the subject of the question. Some modern Authors obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
what straits they have been put to in all Ages, to find
out water enough for <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood, have ventur'd upon an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
more brisk and bold, than any of the Ancients durst
venture upon: They say, <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood was not Universal, but a
National Inundation, confin'd to <hi>Iudaea,</hi> and those Countries
thereabouts; and consequently, there would not be so much
water necessary for the cause of it, as we have prov'd to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for an Universal Deluge of that kind. Their inference is
very true, they have avoided that rock, but they run upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
no less dangerous; to avoid an objection from reason they
deny matter of fact, and such matter of fact as is well attested by
History, both Sacred and prophane. I believe the Authors that
set up this opinion, were not themselves satisfied with it: but see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
insuperable difficulties in the old way, they are the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable
in chusing, as they thought, of two evils the less.</p>
                     <p>But the choice methinks, is as bad on this hand, if all things
be considered; <hi>Moses</hi> represents the Flood of <hi>Noah</hi> as an overthrow
and destruction of the whole Earth; and who can imagine, that in
sixteen or seventeen hundred years time (taking the lower Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology)
that the Earth had then stood, mankind should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated
no further than <hi>Iudae,</hi> or some neighbouring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
thereabouts. After the Floo, when the World was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd
again by eight persons, they had made a far greater progress
in <hi>Asia, Europe</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> within the same space of years, and
yet 'tis likely they were more fruitful in the first Ages of the
World, than after the Flood; and they liv'd six, seven, eight, nine
hundred years a piece, getting Sons and Daughters. Which lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gevity
of the first Inhabitants of the Earth seems to have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially
design'd for the quicker multiplication and propagation
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41970:19"/>
of mankind; and mankind thereby would become so numerous
within sixteen hundred years, that there seems to me to be a greater
difficulty from the multitude of the people that would be b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>fore
the Flood, than from the want of people. For if we a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>low the
first couple at the end of one hundred years, or of the first Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury,
to have left ten pair of Breeders, which is no hard supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
there would arise from these, in fifteen hundred years, a
greater number than the Earth was capable of; allowing every pair
to multiply in the same decuple proportion the first pair did. But
because this would rise far beyond the capacities of this Earth,
let us suppose them to increase, in the following Centuries, in a
quintuple proportion only, or, if you will, only in a quadruple;
and then the Table of the multiplication of mankind from the
Creation to the Flood, would stand thus;

This product is too excessive high, if compar'd with the present
number of men upon the face of the Earth, which I think is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
estimated to be betwixt three and four hundred millions;
and yet this proportion of their increase seems to be low enough,
if we take one proportion for all the Centuries; for, in reality,
the same measure cannot run equally through all the Ages, but
we have taken this as moderate and reasonable betwixt the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and the lowest; but if we had taken only a triple propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it would have been sufficient (all things consider'd) for
purpose. There are several other ways of computing this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and some more particular and exact than this is, but which
way soever you try, you shall find the product great enough for
the extent of this Earth; and if you follow the Septuagint Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
it will still be far higher. I have met with three or four
different Calculations, in several Authors, of the number of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
before the Hood, and never met with any yet, but what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
the number of the people that are at present upon the face
of the Earth. So as it seems to me a very groundless and forc'd
conceit to imagine, that <hi>Iudaea</hi> only, and some parts about it in
<hi>Asia,</hi> were stor'd with people when the Deluge was brought upon
the old World. Besides if the Deluge was confin'd to those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
I do not see but the Borderers might have escap'd, shifting a
little into the adjoyning places where the Deluge did not reach.
But especially what needed so much a-do to build an Ark to save
<hi>Noah</hi> and his Family, if he might have sav'd himself, and them,
only by retiring into some neighbouring Countrey; as <hi>Lot</hi> and his
family sav'd themselves, by withdrawing from <hi>Sodom</hi> when the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41970:19"/>
City was to be destroyed? Had not this been a far easier thing;
and more compendious, than the great Preparations he made of a
large Vessel, with Rooms for the Reception and Accommodation of
Beasts and Birds? And now I mention Birds, why could not they
at least have flown into the next dry Country? they might have
pearch'd upon the Trees, and the tops of the Mountains by the
way to have rested themselves if they were weary, for the Waters
did not all of a sudden rise to the Mountains tops.</p>
                     <p>I cannot but look upon the Deluge as a much more considerable
thing than these Authors would represent it, and as a kind of
dissolution of Nature. <hi>Moses</hi> calls it a destroying of the <hi>Earth,</hi> as
well as of Mankind, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 13. And the Bow was set in the
Cloud to seal the Covenant, <hi>that he would destroy the Earth no more,
Gen.</hi> 9. 11. or that there should be no more a Flood <hi>to destroy the
Earth.</hi> And 'tis said, <hi>verse</hi> 13. that the Covenant was made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and the Earth, or this frame of Nature, that it should
perish no more by Water. And the Rain-bow, which was a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and pledge of this Covenant, appears not only in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> or
some other <hi>Asiatick</hi> Provinces, but to all the Regions of the Earth,
who had an equal share and concern in it. <hi>Moses</hi> saith also the
Fountains of the grear Abyss were burst asunder to make the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge,
and what means this Abyss and the bursting of it, if restrain'd
to <hi>Iudaea,</hi> or some adjacent Countries? What appearance is there
of this Disruption <hi>there,</hi> more than in other Places? Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,<note place="margin">2 Epist. c. 5, 6.</note>
S. <hi>Peter</hi> plainly implies, that the Antediluvian Heavens and
Earth perish'd in the Deluge; and opposeth the present Earth
and Heavens to them, as different and of another constitution:
and saith, that these shall perish by Fire, as the other perish'd by
Water. So he compares the Conflagration with the Deluge, as
two general dissolutions of Nature, and one may as well say, that
the Conflagration shall be only National, and but two or three
Countries burnt in that last Fire, as to say that the Deluge was so.
I confess that discourse of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> concerning the several States of
the World, would sufficiently convince me, if there was nothing
else, That the Deluge was not a particular or National Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but a <hi>mundane</hi> change, that extended to the whole Earth, and
both to the (lower) Heavens and Earth.</p>
                     <p>All Antiquity, we know, hath spoke of these Mundane Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or Periods, that the World should be successively destroy'd by
Water and Fire; and I do not doubt but that this Deluge of <hi>Noah</hi>'s,
which <hi>Moses</hi> describes, was the first and leading instance of this
kind: and accordingly we see that after this Period, and after the
Flood, the blessing for multiplication, and for replenishing the
Earth with Inhabitants, was as solemnly pronounc'd by God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
as at the first Creation of Man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 1. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 28.
These considerations, I think, might be sufficient to give us assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from Divine Writ of the universality of the Deluge, and yet
<hi>Moses</hi> affords us another argument as demonstrative as any, when
in the History of the Deluge, he saith, <hi>Gen. 7. 19. The waters ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
prevailed upon the Earth, and all the high Hills that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the whole Heavens were covered.</hi> All the high Hills, he saith,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41970:20"/>
                        <hi>under the whole Heavens,</hi> then quite round the Earth; and if the
Mountains were cover<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d quite round the Earth, sure the Plains
could not scape. But to argue with them upon their own grounds;
Let us suppose only the <hi>Asiatick</hi> and <hi>Armenian</hi> Mountains covered
with these waters, this they cannot deny; then unless there was a
miracle to keep these waters upon heaps, they would flow through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Earth; for these Mountains are high enough to make them
fall every way, and make them joyn with our Seas that environ
the Continent. We cannot imagine Hills and Mountains of water
to have hung about <hi>Iudaea,</hi> as if they were congeal'd, or mass of
water to have stood upon the middle of the Earth like one great
drop, or a trembling Jelly, and all the places about it dry and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch'd.
All liquid bodies are dissusive; for their parts being in
motion have no tye or connexion one with another, but glide and
fall off any way, as gravity and the Air presseth them; so the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of water doth always conform into a Spherical convexity with
the rest of the Globe of the Earth, aud every part of it falls as
near to the Center as it can; wherefore when these waters began
to rise at first, long before they could swell to the heighth of the
Mountains, they would diffuse themselves every way, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
all the Valleys and Plains, and lower parts of the Earth would
be filled throughout the whole Earth, before they could rise to the
tops of the Mountains in any part of it: And the Sea would be all
raised to a considerble heighth before the Mountains could be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.
For let's suppose, as they do, that this water fell not
throughout the whole Earth, but in some particular Country, and
there made first a great Lake; this Lake when it begun to swell
would every way discharge it self by any descents or declivities of
the ground, and these issues and derivations being once made, and
supplied with new waters pushing them forwards, would continue
their course till they arriv'd at the Sea; just as other Rivers do, for
these would be but so many Rivers rising out of this Lake, and
would not be considerably deeper and higher at the Fountain than
in their progress or at the Sea. We may as well then expect that
the <hi>Leman</hi>-Lake, for instance, out of which the <hi>Rhone</hi> runs, should
swell to the tops of the <hi>Alpes</hi> on the one hand, aud the Mountains
of <hi>Switzerland</hi> and <hi>Burgundy</hi> on the other, and then stop, without
overflowing the plainer Countries that lie beyond them; as to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that this Diluvian Lake should rise to the Mountains tops in
one place, and not diffuse it self equally into all Countries about,
and upon the surface of the Sea: in proportion to its heighth and
depth in the place where it first fell or stood.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for Sacred History. The universality of the Deluge
is also attested by profane History; for the fame of it is gone
through the Earth, and there are Records or Traditions concerning
it, in all parts of this and the new-found World. The <hi>Americans</hi> do
acknowledge and speak of it in their Continent,<note place="margin">Mart.</note> as <hi>Acosta</hi> witnesseth,
and <hi>Laet</hi> in their Histories of them.<note place="margin">Mart.</note> The <hi>Chineses</hi> have the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, which is the farthest part of our Continent; and the
nearer and Western parts of <hi>Asia</hi> is acknowledg'd the proper seat of
it. Not to mention <hi>Deucallon</hi>'s Deluge in the <hi>European</hi> parts, which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41970:20"/>
seems to be the same under a disguise: So as you may trace the
Deluge quite round the Globe in profane History; and which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
every one of these people have a tale to tell, some one
way, some another, concerning the restauration of mankind; which
is an argument that they thought all mankind destroy'd by that
Deluge. In the old dispute between the <hi>Scythians</hi> and the <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
for Antiquity, which <hi>Iustin</hi> mentions, they refer to a former
destruction of the World by Water or Fire, and argue whether
Nation first rise again, and was original to the other. So the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians,
Assyrians, Phoenicians</hi> and others, mention the Deluge in
their stories. And we cannot without offering violence to all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
and Authority, Divine and Humane, deny that there hath
been an universal Deluge upon the Earth; and if there was an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Deluge, no question it was that of <hi>Noah</hi>'s and that which
<hi>Moses</hi> describ'd, and that which we treat of at present.</p>
                     <p>These considerations, I think, are abundantly sufficient to silence
that opinion, concerning the limitation and restriction of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
to a particular Country or Countries. It ought rather to be
lookt upon as an Evasion indeed than Opinion, seeing the Authors
do not offer any positive argument for the proof of it, but depend
only upon that negative argument, That an universal Deluge is a
thing unintelligible. This stumbling-stone we hope to take away
for the future, and that men shall not be put to that unhappy
choice, either to deny matter of fact well attested, or admit an
effect, whereof they cannot see any possible causes. And so having
stated and propos'd the whole difficulty, and try'd all ways offer'd
by others, and found them ineffectual, let us now apply our selves
by degrees to unty the knot.</p>
                     <p>The excessive quantity of water is the great difficulty, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
of it afterwards. Those eight Oceans lay heavy upon my
thoughts, and I cast about every way to find an expedient, or to
find some way whereby the same effect might be brought to pass
with less Water, and in such a manner, that that Water might
afterwards conveniently be discharg'd. The first thought that
came into my mind upon that occasion, was concerning the form
of the Earth, which I imagin'd might possibly at that time be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from what it is at present, and come nearer to plainness
and equality in the surface of it, and so might the more easily be
overflow'd, and the Deluge perform'd with less water. This opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
concerning the plainness of the first Earth, I also found in
Antiquity, mention'd and refer'd to by several Interpreters in their
Commentaries upon <hi>Genesis,</hi> either upon occasion of the Deluge,
or of that Fountain which is said, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 6. to have watered the
face of the whole Earth: And a late eminent person, the honour of
his profession for Integrity and Learning, in his discourse concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Origination of mankind,</hi> hath made a like judgment of the
State of the Earth before the Deluge, that the face of it was more
smooth and regular than it is now. But yet upon second thoughts,
I easily see that this alone would not be sufficient to explain the
Deluge, nor to give an account of the present from of the Earth,
unequal and Mountainous as it is. 'Tis true this would give a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41970:21"/>
great advantage to the waters, and the Rains that fell for forty
days together would have a great power over the Earth, being plain
and smooth; but how would these waters be dispos'd of when
the Deluge ceas'd? or how could it ever cease? Besides, what
means the disruption of the great <hi>Deep,</hi> or the great <hi>Abysse,</hi> or what
answers to it upon this supposition? This was assuredly of no less
consideration than the Rains, nay, I believe, the Rains were but
preparatory in some measure, and that the violence and consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Deluge depended upon the disruption of the great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bysse.
Therefore I saw it necessary, to my first thought, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the smoothness and plainness of the Ante-diluvian Earth, to
add a second, concerning the disruption and dissolution of it; for
as it often happens in Earthquakes, when the exteriour Earth is
burst asunder, and a great Flood of waters issues out, according to
the quantity and force of them, an Inundation is made in those
parts, more or less; so I thought, if that Abysse lay under ground
and round the Earth, and we should suppose the Earth in this
manner to be broken in several places at once, and as it were a
general dissolution made, we might suppose that to make a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Deluge, as well as a particular dissolution often makes a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.
But I will not anticipate here the explication we intend
to give of the universal Deluge in the following Chapters, only by
this previous intimation we may gather some hopes, it may be, that
the matter is not so desperate as the former representation might
possibly make us fansie it.</p>
                     <p>Give me leave to add farther in this place, that it hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
by several, from the contemplation of Mountains and Rocks
and Precipices, of the Chanel of the Sea, and of Islands, and of
Subterraneous Caverns, that the surface of the Earth, or the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Region which we inhabit, hath been broke, and the parts of
it dislocated: And one might instance more particularly in several
parcels of Nature, that retain still the evident marks of fraction
and ruine; and by their present form and posture show, that they
have been once in another state and situation one to another. We
shall have occasion hereafter to give an account of these <hi>Phaenomena,</hi>
from which several have rightly argu'd and concluded some gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
rupture or ruine in the superficial parts of the Earth. But this
ruine, it is true, they have imagin'd and explain'd several ways,
some thinking that it was made the <hi>third day</hi> after the foundation
of the Earth; when they suppose the Chanel of the Sea to have
been form'd, and Mountains and Caverns at the same time; by a
violent depression of some parts of the Earth, and an extrusion and
elevation of others to make them room. Others suppose it to have
come not all at once, but by degrees, at several times, and in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Ages, from particular and accidental causes, as the Earth
falling in upon Fires under ground, or water eating away the
lower parts, or Vapours and Exhalations breaking out, and tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Earth. 'Tis true, I am not of their opinion in either of
these Explications; and we shall show at large hereafter, when we
have propos'd and stated our own Theory, how incompetent such
causes are to bring the Earth into that form and condition we
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41970:21"/>
now find it in. But in the mean time, we may so far make use
of these Opinions in general, as not to be startled at this Doctrine,
concerning the breaking or dissolution of the exteriour Earth; for
in all Ages the face of Nature hath provok'd men to think of and
observe such a thing. And who can do otherwise, to see the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
displac'd and disorder'd, as they seem to lie at present; the
heaviest and grossest bodies in the highest places, and the liquid and
volatile kept below; an huge mass of Stone or Rock rear'd into
the Air, and the water creeping at its feet; whereas this is the more
light and active body, and by the law of Nature should take place
of Rocks and Stones? So we see, by the like disorder, the Air
thrown down into Dungeons of the Earth, and the Earth got up
among the Clouds; for there are the tops of the Mountains, and
under their roots in Holes and Caverns the Air is often detain'd.
By what regular action of Nature can we suppose things first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
in this posture and form? not to mention how broke and
torn the inward substance of the Earth is, which of it self is an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
mass, close and compact: but in the condition we see it, it
lies hollow in many places, with great vacuities intercepted betwixt
the portions of it; a thing which we see happens in all ruines more
or less, especially when the parts of the ruines are great and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible.
Then what can have more the figure and meen of a ruine,
than Crags and Rocks and Cliffs, whether upon the Sea shore, or
upon the sides of Mountains; what can be more apparently broke,
than they are; and those lesser Rocks, or great bulky Stones that
lie often scatter'd near the feet of the other, whether in the Sea, or
upon the Land, are they not manifest fragments, and pieces of
those greater masses? Besides, the posture of these Rocks, which
is often leaning or recumbent, or prostrate, shows to the eye, that
they have had a fall, or some kind of dislocation from their Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
site. And the same thing may be observed in the Tracts and
Regions of the Earth, which very seldom for ten miles together
have any regular surface or continuity one with another, but lie
high and low, and are variously inclin'd sometimes one way, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
another, without any rule or order. Whereas I see no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
but the surface of the Land should be as regular as that of the
water, in the first production of it: And the Strata or beds with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
lie as even. This I am sure of, that this disposition of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and the parts of the Earth, outward and inward, hath
something irregular and unnatural in it, and manifestly shews us
the marks or footsteps of some kind of ruine and dissolution; which
we shall shew you, in its due place, happen'd in such a way, that
at the same time a general Flood of waters would necessarily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run
the face of the whole Earth. And by the same fatal blow,
the Earth fell out of that regular form, wherein it was produc'd
at first, into all these irregularities which we see in its present form
and composition; so that we shall give thereby a double satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the mind, both to shew it a fair and intelligible account of
the general Deluge, how the waters came upon the Earth, and
how they return'd into their Chanels again, and left the Earth
habitable; and likewise to shew it how the Mountains were brought
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41970:22"/>
forth, and the Chanel of the Sea discover'd: How all those ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualities
came in the body or face of the Earth, and those empty
Vaults and Caverns in its bowels; which things are no less matter
of admiration than the Flood it self.</p>
                     <p>But I must beg leave to draw a Curtain before the Work for a
while, and to keep your patience a little in suspence, till materials
are prepar'd, and all things ready to represent and explain what we
have propos'd. Yet I hope in the mean time to entertain the mind
with scenes no less pleasing, though of quite another face and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
for we must now return to the beginning of the World, and
look upon the first rudiments of Nature, and that dark but fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
womb, out of which all things sprang, I mean the <hi>Chaos:</hi> For
this is the matter which we must next work upon, and it will be
no unpleasing thing to observe, how that rude mass will shoot it
self into several forms, one after another, till it comes at length
to make an habitable World. The steddy hand of Providence,
which keeps all things in weight and measure, being the invisible
guide of all its motions. These motions we must examine from
first to last, to find out what was the form of the Earth, and what
was the place or situation of the Ocean, or the great Abyss, in
that first state of Nature: Which two things being determin'd,
we shall be able to make a certain judgment, what kind of disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
that Earth was capable of, and whether from that dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
an Universal Deluge would follow, with all the consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of it.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, for the ease and satisfaction of the Reader,
we will here mark the order and distribution of the first Book,
which we divide into Three Sections; whereof the First is these
Three Chapters past: in the Second Section we will shew, that the
Earth before the Deluge was of a different frame and form from
the present Earth; and particularly of such a form as made it sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to a dissolution: And to such a dissolution, as did necessarily
expose it to an Universal Deluge. And in this place we shall
apply our discourse particularly to the explication of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood,
and that under all its conditions, of the height of the waters, of
their universality, of the destruction of the World by them, and
of their retiring afterwards from the Earth; and this Section
will consist of the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
In the Third Section we prove the same dissolution from the
effects and consequences of it, or from the contemplation of the
present face of the Earth: And here an account is given of the
Origin of Mountains, of subterraneous Waters and Caverns, of
the great Chanel of the Sea, and of the first production of Islands;
and those things are the Contents of the Ninth, Tenth and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Chapters. Then, in the last Chapter, we make a general
review of the whole Work, and a general review of Nature;
that, by comparing them together, their full agreement and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency
may appear. Here several collateral arguments are
given for confirmation of the preceeding Theory, and some reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are made upon the state of the other Planets compar'd with
the Earth. And lastly, what accounts soever have been given by
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41970:22"/>
others of the present form and irregularities of the Earth, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd
and shew'd insufficient. And this seemeth to be all that
is requisite upon this subject.</p>

                  <div n="4" type="chapter">
                     <head>CHAP. IV. That the Earth and Mankind had an Original, and were
not from Eternity: Prov'd against Aristotle. The first
proposition of our Theory laid down, viz. That the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diluvian
Earth was of a different form and construction
from the present. This is prov'd by Divine Authority,
and from the nature and form of the Chaos, out of which
the Earth was made.</head>
                     <p>WE are now to enquire into the Original of the Earth, and
in what form it was built at first, that we may lay our
foundation for the following Theory, deep and sure. It hath been
the general opinion and consent of the Learned of all Nations, that
the Earth arose from a Chaos. This is attested by History, both
Sacred and Profane; only <hi>Aristotle,</hi> whom so great a part of the
Christian World have made their Oracle or Idol, hath maintain'd
the Eternity of the Earth, and the Eternity of Mankind; that
the Earth and the World were from Everlasting, and in that very
form they are in now, with Men and Women and all living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
Trees and Fruit, Metals and Minerals, and whatsoever is of
Natural production. We say all these things arose and had their
first existence or production not six thousand years ago; He saith,
they have subsisted thus for ever, through an infinite Series of past
Generations, and shall continue as long, without first or last: And
if so, there was neither Chaos, nor any other beginning to the
Earth. This takes away the subject of our discourse, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must first remove this stone but of the way, and prove that
the Earth had an Original, and that from a Chaos, before we
shew how it arose from a Chaos, and what was the first habitable
form that it setled into.</p>
                     <p>We are assur'd by Divine Authority, that the Earth and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
had a beginning; <hi>Moses</hi> saith, <hi>In the beginning God made the
Heavens and the Earth.</hi> Speaking it as of a certain Period or Term
from whence he counts the Age of the World. And the same <hi>Moses</hi>
tells us, that <hi>Adam</hi> was the first Man, and <hi>Eve</hi> the first Woman, from
whom sprung the race of Mankind; and this within the compass
of six thousand years. We are also assured from the Prophets, and
our Christian Records, that the world shall have an end, and that
by a general Conflagration, when all Mankind shall be destroy'd,
with the form and all the furniture of the Earth. And as this
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41970:23"/>
proves the second part of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Doctrine to be false imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
so doth it the first, by a true consequence; for what hath
an end had a beginning, what is not immortal, was not Eternal;
That which exists by the strength of its own Nature at first, the
same Nature will enable to exist for ever; and indeed what exists
of it self, exists necessarily; and what exists necessarily, exists eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</p>
                     <p>Having this infallible assurance of the Origin of the Earth and
of Mankind, from Scripture, we proceed to refute the same Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s by Natural Reason. And we will first consider the
form of the Earth, and then Mankind; and shew from plain evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and observation, neither of them to have been Eternal. 'Tis
natural to the mind of Man to consider that which is compound,
as having been once more simple; whether that composition be a
mixture of many ingredients, as most Terrestrial Bodies are, or
whether it be Organical; but especially if it be Organical: For a
thing that consists of a multitude of pieces aptly joyn'd, we cannot
but conceive to have had those pieces, at one time or another, put
together. 'Twere hard to conceive an eternal Watch, whose pieces
were never separate one from another, nor ever in any other form
than that of a Watch. Or an eternal House, whose materials
were never asunder, but always in the form of an House. And
'tis as hard to conceive an <hi>Eternal Earth,</hi> or an <hi>Eternal World:</hi>
These are made up of more various substances, more ingredients,
and into a far greater composition; and the living part of the World,
Plants and Animals, have much more variety of parts and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farious
construction, than any House, or any other artificial thing:
So that we are led as much by Nature and necessity to conceive this
great Machine of the World, or of the Earth, to have been once
in a state of greater simplicity than now it is, as to conceive a Watch,
an House, or any other structure, to have been once in its first and
simple materials. This I speak without reference to immediate
Creation, for <hi>Aristotle</hi> did not own any such thing, and therefore
the argument stands good against him, upon those grounds and
notions that he goes, yet I guess what answer would be made by
him or his followers to this argumentation; They would say there
is not the same reason for Natural things, as for Artificial, though
equally compounded. Artificial things could not be from Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
because they suppose Man, by whose Art they were made,
pre existent to them; the work-man must be before the work, and
whatsoever hath any thing before it, is not Eternal. But may not
the same thing be said of Natural things? do not most of them
require the action of the Sun, and the influence of the Heavens
for their production, and longer preparations than any Artificial
things do? Some Years or Ages would be necessary for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
and maturation of Metals and Minerals; Stones them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
at least some sorts of them, were once liquors or fluid masses;
and all Vegetable productions require the heat of the Sun, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispose
and excite the Earth, and the Seeds. Nay, according to
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> 'tis not Man by himself that begets a Man, but the Sun is
his Coadjutor. You see then 'twas as necessary that the Sun, that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41970:23"/>
great Workman of Nature, should pre-exist to Natural things, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d
in or upon the Earth, as that Man should pre-exist to Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial.
So that the Earth under that form and constitution it now
hath, could no more be Eternal, than a Statue or Temple, or any
work of Art.</p>
                     <p>Besides, that form, which the Earth is under at present, is in some
sort preter-natural, like a Statue made and broken again; and so
hath still the less appearance or pretence of being Eternal. If the
Elements had lain in that order to one another, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath
dispos'd them, and as seems to be their first disposition; the Earth
altogether in a mass in the middle, or towards the Centre; then
the Water in a Spherical mass about that; the Air above the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and then a Sphere of Fire, as he fansied, in the highest Circle
of the Air: If they had lain, I say, in this posture, there might
have been some pretence that they had been Eternally so; because
that might seem to be their Original posture, in which Nature had
first plac'd them. But the form and posture we find them in at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
is very different, and according to his Doctrine must be look'd
upon as unnatural and violent; and no violent state by his own
Maxim, can be perpetual, or can have been so.</p>
                     <p>But there is still a more pressing consideration against this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
If this present state and form of the Earth had been from
Eternity, it would have long ere this destroy'd it self, and chang'd
it self: the Mountains sinking by degrees into the Vallies, and into
the Sea, and the Waters rising above the Earth; which form it
would certainly have come into sooner or later, and in it continu'd
drown'd and uninhabitable, for all succeeding Generations. For
'tis certain, that the Mountains and higher parts of the Earth grow
lesser and lesser from Age to Age; and that from many causes,
sometimes the roots of them are weaken'd and eaten by Subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
Fires, and sometimes they are torn and tumbled down by
Earthquakes, and fall into those Caverns that are under them;
and though those violent causes are not constant, or universal, yet
if the Earth had stood from Eternity, there is not a Mountain would
have escap'd this fate in one Age or other. The course of these
exhalations or Fires would have reach'd them all sooner or later,
if through infinite Ages they had stood expos'd to them. But there
are also other causes that consume them insensibly, and make them
sink by degrees; and those are chiefly the Winds, Rains, and Storms,
and heat of the Sun without; and within, the soaking of Water
and Springs, with streams and currents in their veins and crannies.
These two sorts of causes would certainly reduce all the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of the Earth, in tract of time, to equality; or rather lay
them all under Water: For whatsoever moulders or is washt away
from them, is carried down into the lower grounds, and into the
Sea, and nothing is ever brought back again by any circulation:
Their losses are not repair'd, nor any proportionable recruits made
from any other parts of Nature. So as the higher parts of the
Earth being continually spending, and the lower continually gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they must of necessity at length come to an equality; and the
Waters that lie in the lower parts and in the Chanels, those Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41970:24"/>
and Valleys being fill'd up with Earth, would be thrust out
and rise every where upon the surface of the Earth; Which new
post when they had once seiz'd on, they would never quit it, nor
would any thing be able to dispossess them; for 'tis their natural
place and situation which they always tend to, and from which
there is no progress nor regress in a course of Nature. So that the
Earth would have been, both now, and from innumerable Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
before this, all under water and uninhabitable; if it had
stood from everlasting, and this form of it had been its first origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
form.</p>
                     <p>Nor can he doubt of this argumentation, that considers the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence
of it, and will allow time enough for the effect. I do not
say the Earth would be reduc'd to this uninhabitable form in ten
thousand years time, though I believe it would: but take twenty,
if you please, take an hundred thousand, take a million, 'tis all
one, for you may take the one as easily as the other out of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
and they make both equally against their supposition. Nor
is it any matter how little you suppose the Mountains to decrease,
'tis but taking more time, and the same effect still follows. Let
them but waste as much as a grain of Mustardseed every day, or
a foot in an Age, this would be more than enough in ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Ages to consume the tallest Mountain upon Earth. The Air
alone, and the little drops of Rain have defac'd the strongest and
the proudest monuments of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans;</hi> and allow
them but time enough, and they will of themselves beat down the
Rocks into the Sea, and the Hills into the Valleys. But if we add to
these all those other foremention'd causes that work with more
violence, and the weight of the Mountains themselves, which upon
any occasion offer'd, is ready to sink them lower, we shall shorten
the time, and make the effect more sure.</p>
                     <p>We need add no more here in particular, Against this <hi>Aristote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
Doctrine, that makes the present form of the Earth to have
been from Eternity; for the truth is, this whole Book is one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
argument against that Opinion; shewing that it hath <hi>de facto</hi>
chang'd its form; both in that we have prov'd that it was not
capable of an universal Deluge in this form, and consequently was
once under another; and also in that we shall prove at large here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
throughout the Third and Fourth Sections, that it hath been
broken and dissolv'd. We might also add one consideration more,
that if it had stood always under this form, it would have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Fire, if it had not been under Water; and the Conflagration,
which it is to undergo, would have overtaken it long ere this.
For S. <hi>Peter</hi> saith, the Heavens and the Earth that are now, as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to the Ante-diluvian, and considered in their present form
and constitution, are fitted to be consum'd by Fire. And whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
understands the progress and revolutions of Nature, will see
that neither the present form of the Earth, nor its first form, were
permanent and immutable forms, but transient and temporary by
their own frame and constitution; which the Author of Nature,
after certain periods of time, had design'd for change and for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:41970:24"/>
Thus much for the body of the Earth, that it could not have
been from Eternity, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> pretended, in the form it hath. Now
let's consider the Origination of Mankind; and that we shall find
could much less be Eternal than the other; for whatsoever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd
the form of the Earth, would also destroy Mankind; and

                        </gap>s, there are many particular marks and arguments, that the
Generations of Men have not been from Everlasting. All History, and
all monuments of Antiquity of what kind soever, are but of a few
thousand of years date; we have still the memory of the golden Age,
of the first state of Nature, and how mortals liv'd then in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
and simplicity. The invention of Arts, even those that are
necessary or useful to humane life, hath been within the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Men: How imperfect was the Geography of the Ancients,
how imperfect their knowledge of the Earth, how imperfect their
Navigation? Can we imagine, if there had been Men from Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting,
a Sea as now, and all materials for Shipping as much as
we have, that men could have been so ignorant, both of the Land
and of the Sea, as 'tis manifest they have been till of late Ages?
They had very different fancies concerning the figure of the Earth.
They knew no Land beyond our Continent, and that very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
too; and the Torrid Zone they thought utterly uninhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.
We think it strange, taking that short date of the World,
which we give it, that Men should not have made more progress in
the knowledge of these things; But how impossible is it then, if
you suppose them to have been from Everlasting? They had the
same wit and passions that we have, the same motives that we
have, can we then imagine, that neither the ambition of Princes,
nor interest or gain in private Persons, nor curiosity and the desire
of Knowledge, nor the glory of discoveries, nor any other passion
or consideration could ever move them in that endless time, to try
their fortunes upon the Sea, and know something more of the
World they inhabited? Though you should suppose them gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
stupid, which there is no reason to do, yet in a course of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Generations, there would be some great Genio's, some extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
persons that would attempt things above the rest. We
have done more within the compass of our little World, which we
can but count (as to this) from the general Deluge, than those
Eternal Men had done in their innumerable Ages foregoing.</p>
                     <p>You will say it may be, they had not the advantages and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
for Navigation as we have, and for discoveries; because
the use of the Loadstone, and the Mariners Needle was not then
known. But that's the wonder, that either that invention, or any
other should not be brought to light till t'other day, if the World
had stood from Eternity. I say this or any other practical inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for such things when they are once found out and known,
are not easily lost again, because they are of daily use. And 'tis
in most other practical Arts as in Navigation, we generally know
their Original and History: who the Inventors, and by what degrees
improv'd, and how few of them brought to any perfection till of
late Ages. All the Artificial and Mechanical World is, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
new; and what you may call the <hi>Civil World</hi> too is in a great
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41970:25"/>
measure so. What relates to Government, and Laws; to Wars
and Discipline; we can trace these things to their Origin, or very
near it. The use of Money and of Coins, nay the use of the very
Elements; for they tell us of the first invention of Fire by <hi>Prome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>us,</hi>
and the imploying of Wind or Water to turn the Mills and
grind their Corn was scarce known before the <hi>Romans;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Plin. l. 7. c. 56.</note> and that we
may think nothing Eternal here, they tell us the Ages and Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies
of their very Gods. The measures of Time for the common
uses of life, the dividing it into Hours, with the Instruments for
those purposes, are not of an unknown date: Even the Arts for
preparing Food and Clothing, Medicines and medicaments, Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Civil and Military, Letters and Writing, which are the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of the World Civil: These, with all their retinue of lesser
Arts and Trades that belong to them, History and Tradition tell
us, when they had their beginning, or were very imperfect; and
how many of their Inventors and Inventresses were deifi'd. The
World hath not stood so long but we can still run it up to those
Artless Ages, when mortals liv'd by plain Nature; when there was
but one Trade in the World, one Calling, to look to their Flocks;
and afterwards to Till the Ground, when Nature grew less libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral:
And may we not reasonably think this the beginning of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
or very near it? If Man be a creature both naturally sagaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to find out its own conveniencies, and naturally sociable and
inclin'd to live in a Community, a little time would make them
find out and furnish themselves with what was necessary in these
two kinds, for the conveniencies of single life, and the convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of Societies; they would not have liv'd infinite Ages unprovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of them. If you say <hi>Necessity</hi> is the mother of Arts and Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and there was no necessity before, and therefore these things
were so slowly invented. This is a good answer upon our suppo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that the World began but some Ages before these were found
out, and was abundant with all things at first; and Men not very
numerous, and therefore were not put so much to the use of their
wits, to find out ways for living commodiously. But this is no
answer upon their supposition; for if the World was Eternal and
Men too, there were no first Ages, no new and fresh Earth; Men
were never less numerous, nor the Earth more fruitful; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
there was never less necessity at any time than is now.
This also brings to mind another argument against this opinion
<hi>(viz.)</hi> from the gradual increase of Mankind. 'Tis certain the
World was not so populous one or two thousand years since, as it is
now, seeing 'tis observ'd, in particular Nations, that within the
space of two or three hundred years, notwithstanding all casualties,
the number of Men doubles. If then the Earth had stood from
Everlasting, it had been over-stockt long ere this, and would not
have been capable to contain its Inhabitants many Ages and Millions
of Ages ago. Whereas we find the Earth is not yet sufficiently
Inhabited, and there is still room for some Millions. And we must
not flie to universal Deluges and Conflagrations to destroy Mankind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for besides that the Earth was not capable of a Deluge in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
form, nor would have been in this form after a Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41970:25"/>
                        <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth not admit of these universal changes, nor any
that hold the form of the Earth to be Eternal. But to return to our
Arts and Inventions.</p>
                     <p>We have spoken of practical Arts and Inventions useful in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
life; then for Theoretical Learning and Sciences, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
yet finish'd or compleat in these; and what is known hath
been chiefly the production of latter Ages. How little hath been
discover'd till of late, either of our own Bodies, or of the body of
the Earth, and of the functions or motions of nature in either?
What more obvious, one would think, than the Circulation of
the Bloud? What can more excite our curiosity than the flowing
and ebbing of the Sea? Than the nature of Metals and Minerals?
These are either yet unknown, or were so at least till this last Age;
which seems to me to have made a greater progress than all Ages
before put together, since the beginning of the World. How
unlikely is it then that these Ages were Eternal? That the Eternal
Studies of our Forefathers could not effect so much as a few years
have done of late? And the whole mass of knowledge in this
Earth doth not seem to be so great, but that a few Ages more,
with two or three happy Genius's in them, may bring to light all
that we are capable to understand in this state of mortality.</p>
                     <p>To these arguments concerning the novelty of the Earth, and
the Origin of Mankind, I know there are some shuffling excuses
made, but they can have little effect upon those instances we have
chosen. And I would ask those Eternalists one fair question, What
mark is there that they could expect or desire of the novelty of a
World, that is not found in this? Or what mark is there of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
that is found in this? If then their opinion be without any
positive argument, and against all appearances in Nature, it may
be justly rejected as unreasonable upon all accounts. 'Tis not the
bold asserting of a thing that makes it true, or that makes it cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
against evidence. If one should assert that such an one had
liv'd from all Eternity, and I could bring witnesses that knew him
a sucking Child, and others that remembred him a School-boy, I
think it would be a fair proof, that the Man was not Eternal. So
if there be evidence, either in Reason or History, that it is not
very many Ages since Nature was in her minority, as appears by
all those instances we have given above; some whereof trace her
down to her very infancy: This, I think, may be taken for a good
proof that she is not Eternal. And I do not doubt, but if the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the World was writ Philosophically, giving an account of the
several states of Mankind in several Ages, and by what steps or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
they came from their first rudeness or simplicity to that order
of things, both intellectual and Civil, which the World is advanc'd
to at present, That alone would be a full conviction, that the Earth
and Mankind had a beginning. As the story of <hi>Rome,</hi> how it rise
from a mean Original, by what degrees it increas'd, and how it
chang'd its form and government till it came to its greatness, doth
satisfie us very well, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was not Eternal.</p>
                     <p>Thus much concerning the Temporal Original of the Earth. We
are now to consider the manner of it, and to shew how it rise from
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41970:26"/>
a Chaos. I do not remember that any of the Ancients that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the Earth to have had an Original, did deny that Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
to have been from a Chaos. We are assur'd of both from
the authority of <hi>Moses,</hi> who saith, that in the beginning the Earth
was <hi>Tohu Bohu,</hi> without form and void; a fluid, dark, confus'd
mass, without distinction of Elements; made up of all variety of
parts, but without Order, or any determinate Form; which is the
true description of a Chaos: And so it is understood by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
consent of Interpreters, both Hebrew and Christian. We
need not therefore spend any time here to prove, that the Origin
of the Earth was from a Chaos, seeing that is agreed on by all that
give it any Origin. But we will proceed immediately to examine
into what form it first rise when it came out of that Chaos; or
what was the primaeval form of the Earth, that continued till the
Deluge, and how the Deluge depended upon it, and upon its disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
                     <p>And that we may proceed in this enquiry by such easie steps as
any one may readily follow, we will divide it into Three Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
whereof the first is this in general; <hi>That the Form of the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diluvian
Earth, or of the Earth that rise first from the Chaos, was diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from the Form of the present Earth.</hi> I say <hi>different in general,</hi>
without specifying yet what its particular form was, which shall
be exprest in the following Proposition.</p>
                     <p>This First Proposition we have in effect prov'd in the Second
Chapter: where we have shewn, that if the Earth had been always
in this form, it would not have been capable of a Deluge; seeing
that could not have been effected without such an infinite mass of
water as could neither be brought upon the Earth, nor afterwards
any way removed from it. But we will not content our selves
with that proof only, but will prove it also from the nature of
the Chaos, and the manifest consequences of it. And because this
is a leading Proposition, we think it not improper to prove it also
from Divine Authority, there being a pregnant passage to this
purpose in the writings of S. <hi>Peter.</hi> Where treating of this very
subject, the Deluge, He manifestly puts a difference between the
Ante-diluvian Earth and the present Earth, as to their form and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.
The Discourse is in the Second Epistle of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> the
Third Chapter, where certain Deists, as they seem to have been,
laught at the Prophecy of the day of Judgment, and of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration
of the World, using this argument against it, <hi>That since
the Fathers fell asleep, all things have continued as they were from the
beginning.</hi> All external Nature hath continued the same without
any remarkable change or alteration, and why should we believe
(say they) there will be any? What appearance or what founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is there of such a revolution, that all Nature will be dissolv'd,
and the Heavens and the Earth consum'd with Fire, as your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
pretend? So from the permanency and immutability of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hitherto, they argu'd its permanency and immutability for the
future. To this the <hi>Apostle</hi> answers, that they are willing to forget
that the Heavens and the Earth of old had a particular form and
constitution as to Water, by reason whereof the World that then
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41970:26"/>
was, perisht by a Deluge. And the Heavens and the Earth that
are now, or since the Deluge, have a particular constitution in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to Fire, by reason whereof they are expos'd to another sort
of destruction or dissolution, namely by Fire, or by an universal
Conflagration.<note place="margin">Chap. 3. ver. 5, 6, 7.</note> The words of the Apostle are these; <hi>For this they are
willingly ignorant of, that by the Word of God the Heavens were of old,
and the Earth, consisting of Water, and by Water;</hi> or (as we render it)
<hi>standing out of the Water, and in the Water: whereby the World that
then was, being overslow'd with Water, perisht. But the Heavens and
the Earth that are now, by the same Word are kept in store, reseru'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Fire against the day of Iudgment.</hi> We shall have occasion, it may
be, hereafter to give a full illustration of these words; but at present
we shall only take notice of this in general, that the Apostle here
doth plainly intimate some difference that was between the old
World and the present World, in their form and constitution; or
betwixt the Ante-diluvian and the present Earth, by reason of which
difference, that was subject to perish by a Deluge, as this is subject
to perish by Conflagration. And as this is the general Air and
Importance of this discourse of he Apostle's, which every one at
first sight would discover; so we may in several particular ways
prove from it our first Proposition, which now we must return to;
<hi>(viz.) That the form and constitution of the Ante-diluvian Earth was
different from that of the present Earth.</hi> This may be infer'd from
the Apostle's discourse, first, because he makes an opposition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
these two Earths, or these two natural Worlds; and that not
only in respect of their fate, the one perishing by Water, as the
other will perish by Fire, but also in respect of their different dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
and constitution leading to this different fate; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
his <hi>fifth verse</hi> is superfluous, and his Inference in the <hi>sixth</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded;
you see he premiseth in the <hi>fifth verse</hi> as the ground of
his discourse, what the constitution of the Ante-diluvian Heavens
and Earth was, and then infers from it in the <hi>sixth</hi> verse, that they
therefore perisht in a Deluge of Water. Now if they had been the
same with ours, there had neither been any ground for making
an opposition betwixt them, nor any ground of making a contrary
inference as to their fate. Besides, in that he implies that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the Ante-diluvian Earth was such, as made it subject
to a Deluge; he shews that it was different from the constitution
of the present Earth; for the form of that is such, as makes it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
incapable of a Deluge, as we have shewn in the second Chapter.
Then we are to observe further, that when he saith <hi>(verse 6.)</hi> that
the first World perish'd in a Deluge, or was destroy'd by it; this is
not to be understood of the Animate World only, Men and living
Creatures, but of the Natural World, and the frame of it; for he
had describ'd it before by the Heavens and the Earth, which make
the Natural World. And the objection of the Atheists, or Deists
rather, which he was to answer, proceeded upon the Natural
World. And lastly, this perishing of the World in a Deluge, is set
against, or compar'd with the perishing of the World in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration,
when the frame of Nature will be dissolv'd. We must
therefore, according to the tenor of the Apostle's arguing, suppose,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41970:27"/>
that the Natural World was destroy'd or perish'd in the Deluge;
and seeing it did not perish as to matter and substance, it must be
as to the form, frame, and composition of it, that it perish'd; and
consequently, the present Earth is of another form and frame from
what it had before the Deluge; which was the thing to be proved.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, Let us consider what it is the Apostle tells these Scoffers
that they were ignorant of: Not that there was a Deluge, they
could not be ignorant of that; nor doth he tell them that they were;
But he tells them that they were ignorant that the Heavens and
the Earth of old were so and so constituted, after a different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
than they are now, and that the state of Nature was chang'd
at the Deluge, it they had known or attended to this, they had
made no such objection, nor us'd any such argument as they did
against the future Conflagration of the World. They pretended
that there had been no change in Nature since the beginning, and
the Apostle in answer tells them, that they are willingly ignorant
of the first constitution of the Heavens, and the Earth, and of that
change and dissolution that happen'd to them in the Deluge; and
how the present Heavens and Earth have another constitution,
whereby in like manner they are expos'd, in God's due time, to be
consum'd or dissolv'd by Fire. This is the plain, easie and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
import of the Apostle's discourse; thus all the parts of it are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent,
and the sence genuine and apposite, and this is a full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of our first and general assertion, That <hi>the Ante-diluvian
Earth was of another form from the present Earth.</hi> This hath been
observ'd formerly by some of the Ancients from this Text, but that
it hath not been generally observ'd, was partly because they had
no Theory to back such an interpretation, and make it intelligible;
and partly because they did not observe, that the Apostle's dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
here was an argumentation, and not a bare affirmation, or
simple contradiction to those that rais'd the scruple; 'tis an answer
upon a ground taken, he premiseth and then infers; in the <hi>fifth</hi>
and <hi>sixth</hi> Verses, concerning the Deluge; and in the <hi>seventh,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Conflagration. And when I had discover'd in my
thoughts from the consideration of the Deluge, and other natural
reasons, that the Earth was certainly once in another form, it was
a great assurance and confirmation to me, when I reflected on this
place of S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s; which seems to be so much directed and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for the same purpose, or to teach us the same conclusion, that
though I design'd chiefly a Philosophical Theory of these things,
yet I should not have thought we had been just to Providence, if
we had neglected to take notice of this passage and Sacred evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
which seems to have been left us on purpose, to excite our
enquiries, and strengthen our reasonings, concerning the first state
of things. Thus much from Divine Authority: We proceed now
to prove the same Proposition from Reason and Philosophy, and
the contemplation of the Chaos, from whence the first Earth
arose.</p>
                     <p>We need not upon this occasion make a particular description
of the Chaos, but only consider it as a Fluid Mass, or a Mass of all
sorts of little parts and particles of matter mixt together, and floa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41970:27"/>
in confusion, one with another. 'Tis impossible that the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of this mass should be of such a form and figure, as the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of our present Earth is. Or that any concretion or consistent
state which this mass could flow into immediately, or first settle in,
could be of such a form and figure as our present Earth. The first
of these Assertions is of easie proof; for a fluid body, we know,
whether it be water or any other liquor, always casts it self into a
smooth and spherical surface; and if any parts, by chance, or by
some agitation, become higher than the rest, they do not continue
so, but glide down again every way into the lower places, till they
all come to make a surface of the same height, and of the same di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
every where from the Center of their gravity. A mountain
of water is a thing impossible in Nature, and where there are no
Mountains there are no Valleys. So also a Den or Cave within the
water that hath no walls but the liquid Element, is a structure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to Art or Nature; all things there must be full within, and
even and level without, unless some External force keep them by
violence in another posture. But is this the form of our Earth,
which is neither regularly made within nor without? The surface
and exteriour parts are broken into all sorts of inequalities, Hills
and Dales, Mountains and Valleys; and the plainer tracts of it lie
generally inclin'd or bending one way or other, sometimes upon
an easie descent, and other times with a more sensible and uneasie
steepiness; and though the great Mountains of the Earth were
taken all away, the remaining parts would be more unequal than
the roughest Sea; whereas the face of the Earth should resemble
the face of the calmest Sea, if it was still in the form of its first
mass. But what shall we say then to the huge Mountains of the
Earth, which lie sometimes in lumps or clusters heapt up by one
another, sometimes extended in long ridges or chains for many
hundred miles in length? And 'tis remarkable, that in every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
and in every ancient and original Island, there is either such
a cluster, or such a chain of Mountains. And can there be any
more palpable demonstrations than these are, that the surface of
the Earth is not in the same form that the surface of the Chaos
was, or that any fluid mass can stand or hold it self in?</p>
                     <p>Then for the form of the Earth within or under its surface, 'tis
no less impossible for the Chaos to imitate that; for 'tis full of cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and empty places, of dens and broken holes, whereof some are
open to the Air, and others cover'd and enclosed wholly within
the ground. These are both of them unimitable in any liquid
substance, whose parts will necessarily flow together into one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
mass, and cannot be divided into apartments and separate
rooms, nor have vaults or caverns made within it; the walls would
sink, and the roof fall in: For liquid bodies have nothing to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their parts, nor any thing to cement them; they are all loose
and incoherent, and in a perpetual flux: Even an heap of Sand
or fine Powder will suffer no hollowness within them, though
they be dry substances, and though the parts of them being rough,
will hang together a little, and stand a little upon an heap; but
the parts of liquors being glib, and continually in motion, they fall
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41970:28"/>
off from one another, which way soever gravity inclines them, and
can neither have any hills or eminencies on their surface, nor any
hollowness within their substance.</p>
                     <p>You will acknowledge, it may be, that this is true, and that
a liquid mass or Chaos, while it was liquid, was incapable of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the outward or inward form of the Earth; but when it came
to a concretion, to a state of consistency and firmness, then it might
go, you'll say, into any form. No, not in its first concretion, nor in
its first state of consistence; for that would be of the same form
that the surface of it was when it was liquid; as water, when it
congeals, the surface of the Ice is smooth and level, as the surface
of the water was before; so Metals, or any other substances melted,
or Liquors that of themselves grow stiff and harden, always settle
into the same form which they had when they were last liquid,
and are always solid within, and smooth without, unless they
be cast in a mould, that hinders the motion and flux of the parts.
So that the first concrete state or consistent surface of the Chaos,
must be of the same form or figure with the last liquid state it was
in; for that is the mould, as it were, upon which it is cast; as
the shell of an Egg is of a like form with the surface of the liquor
it lies upon. And therefore by analogy with all other liquors and
concretions, the form of the Chaos, whether liquid or concrete,
could not be the same with that of the present Earth, or like it:
And consequently, that form of the first or primigenial Earth which
rise immediately out of the Chaos, was not the same, nor like to
that of the present Earth. Which was the first and preparatory Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
we laid down to be prov'd. And this being prov'd by the
authority both of our Reason and our Religion, we will now
proceed to the Second which is more particular.</p>

if you travel it all over, you will not meet with a Mountain or a Rock,
yet well provided of all reqnisite things for an habitable World; and
the same indeed with the Earth we still inhabit, only under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
form. And this is the great thing that now comes into debate,
the great Paradox which we offer to be examin'd, and which we
affirm, That the Earth in its first rise and formation from a Chaos;
was of the form here describ'd, and so continu'd for many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of years.</p>
                     <p>To examine and prove this, we must return to the beginning of
the World, and to that Chaos out of which the Earth and all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary
things arose: 'Tis the motions and progress of this which
we must now consider, and what form it setled into when it first
became an habitable World.</p>
                     <p>Neither is it perhaps such an intricate thing as we imagine at
first sight, to trace a Chaos into an habitable World; at least there
is a particular pleasure to see things in their Origin, and by what
degrees and successive changes they rise into that order and state
we see them in afterwards, when compleated. I am sure, if ever
we would view the paths of Divine Wisdom, in the works and
in the conduct of Nature, we must not only consider how things
are, but how they came to be so. 'Tis pleasant to look upon a
Tree in the Summer, cover'd with its green Leaves, deckt with
Blossoms, or laden with Fruit, and casting a pleasing shade under
its spreading Boughs; but to consider how this Tree with all its
furniture, sprang from a little Seed; how Nature shap'd it, and
fed it, in its infancy and growth; added new parts, and still ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
it by little and little, till it came to this greatness and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
this, methinks, is another sort of pleasure, more rational,
less common, and which is properly the contemplation of Divine
Wisdom in the works of Nature. So to view this Earth, and this
Sublunary World, as it is now compleat, distinguisht into the
several orders of Bodies of which it consists, every one perfect and
admirable in its kind; this is truly delightful, and a very good
entertainment of the mind; But to see all these in their first Seeds,
as I may so say; to take in pieces this frame of Nature, and melt
it down into its first principles; and then to observe how the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Wisdom wrought all these things out of confusion into order,
and out of simplicity into that beautiful composition we now see
them in; this, methinks, is another kind of joy, which pierceth
the mind more deep, and is more satisfactory. And to give our
selves and others this satisfaction, we will first make a short represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Chaos, and then shew, how, according to Laws esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41970:29"/>
in Nature by the Divine Power and Wisdom, it was wrought
by degrees from one from into another, till it setled at length into
an habitable Earth; and that of such a frame and structure, as we
have describ'd in this second Proposition.</p>
                     <p>By the Chaos I understand the matter of the Earth and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
without from or order; reduc'd into a fluid mass, wherein
are the materials and ingredients of all bodies, but mingled in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
one with another. As if you should suppose all sorts of
Metals, Gold, Silver, Lead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> melted down together in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
mass, and so mingled, that the parts of no one Metal could
be discern'd as distinct from the rest, this would be a little Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Chaos: Suppose then the Elements thus mingled, Air, Water
and Earth, which are the principles of all Terrestrial Bodies; mingled,
I say, without any order of higher or lower, heavier or lighter,
solid or volatile, in such a kind of confus'd mass as is here repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
in this first Scheme.</p>
                     <figure>
                        <p>pag. 36 fig. 1</p>
                     </figure>
                     <p>Let this then represent to us the Chaos; in which the first change
that we should imagine to happen would be this, that the heaviest
and grossest parts would sink down towards the middle of it, (for
there we suppose the center of its gravity) and the rest would float
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41970:29"/>
above. These grosser parts thus sunk down and compress'd more
and more, would harden by degrees, and constitute the interiour
parts of the Earth. The rest of the mass, which swims above,
would be also divided by the same principle of gravity into two
orders of Bodies, the one liquid like Water, the other Volatile like
Air. For the more fine and active parts disentangling themselves
by degrees from the rest, would mount above them; and having
motion enough to keep them upon the wing, would play in those
open place where they constitute that body we call AIR. The
other parts being grosser than these, and having a more languid motion
could not fly up separate from one another, as these did, but setled
in a mass together, under the Air, upon the body of the Earth,
composing not only Water strictly so called, but the whole mass of
liquors, or liquid bodies, belonging to the Earth. And these first
separations being thus made, the body of the Chaos would stand
in that form which it is here represented in by the second Scheme.</p>
                     <figure>
                        <p>pag. 37 fig: 2.</p>
                     </figure>
                     <p>The liquid mass which encircled the Earth, was not, as I noted
before, the mere Element of Water, but a collection of all Liquors
that belong to the Earth. I mean of all that do originally belong
to it. Now seeing there are two chief kinds of Terrestrial Liquors,
those that are fat, oily, and light; and those that are lean and more
Earthy, like common Water; which two are generally found in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41970:30"/>
compound liquors; we cannot doubt but there were of both sorts
in this common mass of liquids. And it being well known, that
these two kinds mixt together, if left to themselves and the general
action of Nature, separate one from another when they come to
settle, as in Cream and thin Milk, Oil and Water, and such like;
we cannot but conclude, that the same Effect would follow here,
and the more oily and light part of this mass would get above the
other, and swim upon it. The whole mass being divided into two
lesser masses, and so the Globe would stand as we see it in this
Third Figure.</p>
                     <figure>
                        <p>pag: 38. fig: 3.</p>
                     </figure>
                     <p>Hitherto the changes of the Chaos are easie and unquestionable,
and would be dispatcht in a short time; we must now look over
again these two great masses of the <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> and consider
how their impurities or grosser parts would be dispos'd of; for
we cannot imagine but they were both at first very muddy and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure:
And as the Water would have its sediment, which we are
not here concern'd to look after, so the great Regions of the Air
would certainly have their sediment too; for the Air was as yet thick,
gross, and dark; there being an abundance of little Terrestrial par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
swimming in it still, after the grossest were sunk down; which,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41970:30"/>
by their heaviness and lumpish figure, made their way more easily
and speedily. The lesser and lighter which remain'd, would sink
too, but more slowly, and in a longer time: so as in their descent
they would meet with that oily liquor upon the face of the Deep,
or upon the watery mass, which would entangle and stop them
from passing any further; whereupon mixing there with that uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
substance, they compos'd a certain slime, or fat, soft, and light
Earth, spread upon the face of the Waters; as 'tis represented in
this fourth Figure.</p>
                     <figure>
                        <p>pag. 39. fig: 4.</p>
                     </figure>
                     <p>This thin and tender Orb of Earth increas'd still more and more,
as the little Earthy parts that were detain'd in the Air could make
their way to it. Some having a long journey from the upper
Regions, and others being very light would float up and down
a good while, before they could wholly disengage themselves and
descend. But this was the general rendezvous, which sooner or
later they all got to, and mingling more and more with that oily
liquor, they suckt it all up at length, and were wholly incorporate
together, and so began to grow more stiff and firm, making both
but one substance, which was the first concretion, or firm and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
substance that rise upon the face of the Chaos. And the
whole Globe stood in this posture, as in Figure the fifth.

                     <p>It may be, you will say, we take our liberty, and our own
time for the separation of these two liquors, the Oily and the
Earthy, the lighter and the heavier; and suppose that done before
the Air was clear'd of Earthy particles, that so they might be
catcht and stopt there in their descent. Whereas if all these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
were fallen out of the Air before that separation was made
in the liquid mass, they would fall down through the Water, as
the first did, and so no concretion would be made, nor any Earthy
crust form'd upon the face of the Waters, as we here suppose there
was. 'Tis true, there could be no such Orb of Earth form'd there,
if the Air was wholly purg'd of all its Earthy parts before the
Mass of liquids began to purifie it self, and to separate the Oily
parts from the more heavy: But this is an unreasonable and incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
supposition, if we consider, the mass of the Air was many
thousand times greater than the Water, and would in proportion
require a greater time to be purified; the particles that were in
the Regions of the Air having a long way to come before they
reacht the Watery mass, and far longer than the Oily particles had
to rise from any part of that mass to the surface of it. Besides we
may suppose a great many degrees of littleness and lightness in
these Earthy particles, so as many of them might float in the Air a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41970:32"/>
good while, like Exhalations, before they fell down. And lastly,
We do not suppose the separation of these two liquors wholly
made and finisht before the purgation of the Air began, though we
represent them so for distinction sake; Let them begin to purifie
at the same time, if you please, these parts rising upwards, and
those falling downwards, they will meet in the middle, and unite
and grow into one body, as we have describ'd. And this body or
new concretion would be increas'd daily, being sed and supply'd
both from above and below; and having done growing, it would
become more dry by degrees, and of a temper of greater consistency
and firmness, so as truly to resemble and be fit to make an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Earth, such as Nature intended it for.</p>
                     <p>But you will further object, it may be, that such an effect as
this would indeed be necessary in some degree and proportion, but
not in such a proportion, and in such quantity as would be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to make this crust or concrete Orb an habitable Earth. This
I confess appear'd to me at first a real difficulty, till I consider'd
better the great disproportion there is betwixt the Regions of the
Air and the Circumference of the Earth, or of that exteriour Orb
of the Earth, we are now a making; which being many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
times less in depth and extent than the Regions of the Air,
taken as high as the Moon, though these Earthy particles, we speak
of, were very thinly dispers'd through those vast tracts of the Air,
when they came to be collected and amass'd together upon the
surface of a far lesser Sphere, they would constitute a body of a
very considerable thickness and solidity. We see the Earth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
covered with Snow two or three feet deep, made up only
of little flakes or pieces of Ice, which falling from the middle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of the Air, and meeting with the Earth in their descent; are
there stopt and heapt up one upon another. But if we should sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
little particles of Earth to shower down, not only from
the middle Region, but from the whole capacity and extent of
those vast spaces that are betwixt us and the Moon, we could not
imagine but these would constitute an Orb of Earth some thousands
of times deeper than the greatest Snow; which being increas'd and
swoln by that oily liquor it fell into, and incorporated with, it
would be thick, strong, and great enough in all respects to render
it an habitable Earth.</p>
                     <p>We cannot doubt therefore but such a body as this would be
form'd, and would be sufficient in quantity for an habitable Earth.
Then for the quality of it, it will answer all the purposes of a
<hi>Rising World.</hi> What can be a more proper Seminary for Plants and
Animals, than a soil of this temper and composition? A finer and
lighter sort of Earth, mixt with a benign Juice, easie and obedient
to the action of the Sun, or of what other causes were employ'd
by the Author of Nature, for the production of things in the new-made
Earth. What sort or disposition of matter could be more
fit and ready to catch life from Heaven, and to be drawn into all
forms that the rudiments of life, or the bodies of living Creatures
would require? What soil more proper for vegetation than this
warm moisture, which could have no fault, unless it was too
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41970:33"/>
fertile and luxuriant? And that is no fault neither at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of a World. This I am sure of, that the learned amongst
the Ancients,<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> both <hi>Greeks, Egyptians, Phoenicians,</hi> and others, have
describ'd the primigenial soil, or the temper of the Earth, that
was the first subject for the Generation and Origin of Plants
and Animals after such a manner, as is truly express'd, and I
think with advantage, by this draught of the primigenial Earth.</p>
                     <p>Thus much concerning the matter of the first Earth. Let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
a little upon the form of it also, whether External or Internal;
both whereof do manifestly shew themselves from the manner of
its production or formation. As to the External form, you see it
is according to the Proposition we were to prove, <hi>smooth, regular
and uniform, without Mountains, and without a Sea.</hi> And the proof
we have given of it is very easie; The Globe of the Earth could
not possibly rise immediately from a Chaos into the irregular form
in which it is at present. The Chaos being a fluid mass, which we
know doth necessarily fall into a Spherical surface, whose parts are
equi-distant from the Center, and consequently in an equal and
even convexity one with another. And seeing upon the distinction
of a Chaos and separation into several Elementary masses, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
would naturally have a superiour place to the Earth, 'tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
that there could be no habitable Earth form'd out of the
Chaos, unless by some concretion upon the face of the Water.
Then lastly, seeing this concrete Orb of Earth upon the face of the
Water would be of the same form with the surface of the Water
it was spread upon, there being no causes, that we know of, to
make any inequality in it, we must conclude it equal and uniform,
and without Mountains, as also without a Sea; for the Sea and all
the mass of Waters was enclos'd within this exteriour Earth, which
had no other basis or foundation to rest upon.</p>
                     <p>The contemplation of these things, and of this posture of the
Earth upon the Waters, doth so strongly bring to mind certain
passages of Scripture, (which will recur in another place) that we
cannot, without injury to truth pass them by here in silence. Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
that have such a manifest resemblance and agreement to this
form and situation of the Earth, that they seem visibly to point at
it: such are those expressions of the Psalmist, <hi>God hath founded the
Earth upon the Seas.</hi> And in another Psalm, speaking of the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and power of God in the Creation, he saith, <hi>To him who alone
doth great wonders; to him that by wisdom made the Heavens; to him
that extended or stretched out the Earth above the Waters.</hi> What can
be more plain or proper to denote that form of the Earth that we
have describ'd, and to express particularly the inclosure of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
within the Earth, as we have represented them? He saith in
another place; <hi>By the Word of the Lord were the Heavens made; he
shut up the Waters of the Sea as in Bags,</hi> (for so the word is to be
render'd, and is render'd by all, except the <hi>English) and laid up the
Abysse as in store-houses.</hi> This, you see, is very conformable to that
System of the Earth and Sea, which we have propos'd here. Yet
there is something more express than all this in that remarkable
place in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> of <hi>Solomon,</hi> where <hi>Wisdom</hi> declaring her Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41970:33"/>
and Existence before the foundation of the Earth, amongst
other things,<note place="margin">Prov. 8. 27.</note> saith; <hi>When he prepared the Heavens, I was there: When
he drew an Orb over the surface of the Abysse;</hi> or when he set an Orb
upon the face of the Abysse. We render it in the <hi>English</hi> a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,</hi>
or <hi>Circle,</hi> but 'tis more truly rendred an Orb or Sphere; and
what Orb or Spherical Body was this, which at the formation of
the Earth was built and plac'd round about the Abyss; but that
wonderful Arch, whose form and production we have describ'd,
encompassing the mass of Waters,<note place="margin">Vid. Fig. 5. p. 40.</note> which in Scripture is often call'd
the Abysse or Deep? Lastly,<note place="margin">This Orb is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented by the Circle 1, and the Abysse by the Region 2.</note> This Scheme of the first Earth gives
light to that place we mention'd before of S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, where the first
Earth is said to <hi>consist of Water and by Water:</hi> and by reason there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was obnoxious to a Deluge. The first part of this character is
plain from the description now given: and the second will appear
in the following Chapter. In the mean time, concerning these
passages of Scripture, which we have cited, we may truly and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly
say, that though they would not, it may be, without a The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory
premis'd, have been taken or interpreted in this sence, yet this
Theory being premis'd, I dare appeal to any unprejudic'd person,
if they have not a fairer and easier, a more full and more emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
sence, when apply'd to that form of the Earth and Sea, we
are now speaking of, than to their present form, or to any other
we can imagine.</p>
                     <p>Thus much concerning the external form of the first Earth. Let
us now reflect a little upon the Internal form of it, which consists
of several Regions, involving one another like Orbs about the same
Center, or of the several Elements cast circularly about each other;
as it appears in the Fourth and Fifth Figure. And as we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the External form of this primae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>al Earth, to have been markt
and celebrated in the Sacred Writings; so likewise in the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
and Learning of the Ancients, there are several remains and
indications of this Internal form and composition of it. For 'tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable,
that the Ancients in treating of the Chaos, and in raising
the World out of it, rang'd it into several Regions or Masses, as
we have done; and in that order successively, rising one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as if it was a Pedigree or Genealogy. And those Parts and
Regions of Nature, into which the Chaos was by degrees divided,
they signified commonly by dark and obscure names, as the <hi>Night,
Tartarus, Oceanus,</hi> and such like, which we have express'd in their
plain and proper terms. And whereas the Chaos, when it was
first set on work, ran all into divisions, and separations of one Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from another, which afterwards were all in some measure
united and associated in this primigenial Earth; the Ancients ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
made <hi>Contention</hi> the principle that reign'd in the Chaos at
first, and then <hi>Love:</hi> The one to express the divisions, and the
other the union of all parties in this middle and common bond.
These, and such like notions which we find in the Writings of the
Ancients figuratively and darkly deliver'd, receive a clearer light,
when compar'd with this Theory of the Chaos; which represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
every thing plainly, and in its natural colours, is a Key to
their thoughts, and an illustration of their obscurer Philosophy,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41970:34"/>
concerning the Original of the World; as we have shewn at large
in the <hi>Latin</hi> Treatise.<note place="margin">Lib. 2.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is another thing in Antiquity,<note place="margin">Chap. 7.</note> relating to the form and
construction of the Earth, which is very remarkable, and hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
throughout all learned Nations and Ages. And that is the
comparison or resemblance of the Earth to an <hi>Egg.</hi> And this
is not so much for its External Figure, though that be true too:
as for the inward composition of it; consisting of several Orbs, one
including another, and in that order, as to answer the several Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
Regions of which the new-made Earth was constituted.
For if we admit for the <hi>Yolk</hi> a Central fire (which though very
reasonable, we had no occasion to take notice of in our Theory of
the Chaos) and suppose the Figure of the Earth <hi>Oval,</hi> and a little
extended towards the Poles, (as probably it was, seeing the Vortex
that contains it, is so) those two bodies do very naturally repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
one another; as in this Scheme, which represents the Interiour
faces of both, a divided <hi>Egg,</hi> or Earth. Where, as the two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<figure>
                           <p>Fig: 7. pag. 44.</p>
                        </figure>
Regions (A. B.) represent the Yolk and the Membrane that lies
next above it; so the Exteriour Region of the Earth (D.) is as the
Shell of the Egg, and the Abysse (C.) under it as the White that
lies under the Shell. And considering that this notion of the <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane
Egg,</hi> or that the World was <hi>Oviform,</hi> hath been the sence and
Language of all Antiquity,<note place="margin">Tell. Theor. Sac. lib. 2. c. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>Latins, Greeks, Persians, Egyptians,</hi> and
others, as we have shew'd elsewhere; I thought it worthy our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
in this place; seeing it receives such a clear and easie explication
from that Origin and Fabrick we have given to the first Earth, and
also reflects light upon the Theory it self, and confirms it to be no
fiction: This notion, which is a kind of Epitome or Image of it,
having been conserv'd in the most Ancient Learning.</p>
                     <p>Thus much concerning the first Earth, its production and form;
and concerning our Second Proposition relating to it: Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
prov'd by Reason, the laws of Nature, and the motions of the
Chaos; then attested by Antiquity, both as to the matter and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41970:34"/>
form of it; and confirm'd by Sacred Writers, we may take it now for
a well establisht truth, and proceed upon this supposition, <hi>That the
Ante-diluvian Earth was smooth and uniform, without Mountains or Sea,</hi>
to the explication of the universal Deluge.</p>
                     <p>Give me leave only before we proceed any further, to annex
here a short Advertisement, concerning the Causes of this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
structure of the first Earth. 'Tis true, we have propos'd the
Natural Causes of it, and I do not know wherein our Explication
is false or defective; but in things of this kind we may easily be too
credulous. And this structure is so marvellous, that it ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be consider'd as a particular effect of the Divine Art, than
as the work of Nature. The whole Globe of the Water vaulted
over, and the exteriour Earth hanging above the Deep, sustain'd
by nothing but its own measures and manner of construction: A
Building without foundation or corner-stone. This seems to be a
piece of Divine Geometry or Architecture; and to this, I think,
is to be refer'd that magnificent challenge which God Almighty
made to <hi>Iob;</hi>

                     <p>WE have now brought to light the Ante-diluvian Earth out
of the dark mass of the Chaos; and not only described
the surface of it,<note place="margin">Vid. Fig. 5. &amp; 6. pag. 40. &amp; 44.</note> but laid open the inward parts, to shew in what
order its Regions lay. Let us now close it up, and represent the
Earth entire, and in large proportions, more like an habitable
World; as in this Figure, where you see the smooth convex of
the Earth, and may imagine the great Abysse spread under it<note n="*" place="margin">As at the aperture a. a.</note>;
which two are to be the only subject of our further contemplation.</p>

                        <pb n="47" facs="tcp:41970:35"/>
In this smooth Earth were the first Scenes of the World, and
the first Generations of Mankind; it had the beauty of Youth and
blooming Nature, fresh and fruitful, and not a wrinkle, scar or
fracture in all its body; no Rocks nor Mountains, no hollow
Caves, nor gaping Chanels, but even and uniform all over. And
the smoothness of the Earth made the face of the Heavens so too;
the Air was calm and serene; none of those tumultuary motions
and conflicts of vapours, which the Mountains and the Winds
cause in ours: 'Twas suited to a golden Age, and to the first
innocency of Nature.</p>
                     <p>All this you'll say is well, we are got into a pleasant World in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
but what's this to the purpose? what appearance of a Deluge
here, where there is not so much as a Sea, nor half so much Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as we have in this Earth? or what appearance of Mountains;
or Caverns, or other irregularities of the Earth, where all is level
and united: So that instead of loosing the Knot, this ties it the
harder. You pretend to shew us how the Deluge was made, and
you lock up all the Waters within the womb of the Earth, and
set Bars and Doors, and a Wall of impenetrable strength and
thickness to keep them there. And you pretend to shew us the
original of Rocks and Mountains, and Caverns of the Earth, and
bring us to a wide and endless plain, smooth as the calm Sea.</p>
                     <p>This is all true, and yet we are not so far from the sight and
discovery of those things as you imagine; draw but the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and these Scenes will appear, or something very like them.
We must remember that S. <hi>Peter</hi> told us, that the Ante-diluvian
Earth perish'd, or was demolish'd; and <hi>Moses</hi> saith, the <hi>great Abysse</hi>
was broken open at the Deluge. Let us then suppose, that at a
time appointed by Divine Providence, and from Causes made ready
to do that great execution upon a sinful World, that this <hi>Abysse</hi> was
open'd, or that the frame of the Earth broke and fell down into
the <hi>Great Abysse.</hi> At this one stroke all Nature would be chang'd;
and this single action would have two great and visible Effects. The
one Transient, and the other permanent. First an universal Deluge
would overflow all the parts and Regions of the broken Earth;
during the great commotion and agitation of the Abysse, by the
violent fall of the Earth into it. This would be the first and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable
effect of this dissolution, and all that World would be
destroyed. Then when the agitation of the Abysse was asswag'd,
and the Waters by degrees were retir'd into their Chanels, and the
dry land appear'd, you would see the true image of the present
Earth in the ruines of the first. The surface of the Globe would be
divided into Land and Sea; the Land would consist of Plains and
Valleys and Mountains, according as the pieces of this ruine were
plac'd and dispos'd: Upon the banks of the Sea would stand the
Rocks, and near the shoar would be Islands, or lesse fragments
of Earth compass'd round by Water. Then as to Subterraneous
Waters, and all Subterraneous Caverns and hollownesses, upon this
supposition those things could not be otherwise; for the parts
would fall hollow in many places in this, as in all other ruines:
And seeing the Earth fell into this Abysse, the Waters at a certain
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41970:36"/>
height would flow into all those hollow places and cavities; and
would also sink and insinuate into many parts of the solid Earth.
And though these Subterraneous Vaults or holes, whether dry or
full of Water, would be more or less in all places, where the parts
fell hollow; yet they would be found especially about the roots of
the Mountains, and the higher parts of the Earth; for there the
sides bearing up one against the other, they could not lie so close at
the bottoms, but many vacuities would be intercepted. Nor are there
any other inequalities or irregularities observable in the present form
of the Earth; whether in the surface of it, or interiour construction,
whereof this <hi>hypothesis</hi> doth not give a ready, fair, and intelligible
account; and doth at one view represent them all to us, with
their causes, as in a glass: And whether that Glass be true, and
the Image answer to the Original, if you doubt of it, we will
hereafter examine them piece by piece. But in the first place, we
must consider the General Deluge, how easily and truly this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
represents and explains it, and answers all the properties
and conditions of it.</p>
                     <p>I think it will be easily allow'd, that such a dissolution of the
Earth as we have propos'd, and fall of it into the Abysse, would
certainly make an Universal Deluge; and effectually destroy the
old World, which perish'd in it. But we have not yet particularly
prov'd this dissolution, and in what manner the Deluge follow'd
upon it: And to assert things in gross never makes that firm im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
upon our understandings, and upon our belief, as to see
them deduc'd with their causes and circumstances; And therefore
we must endeavour to shew what preparations there were in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for this great dissolution, and after what manner it came to
pass, and the Deluge in consequence of it.</p>
                     <p>We have noted before, that <hi>Moses</hi> imputed the Deluge to the
disruption of the Abyss; and S. <hi>Peter,</hi> to the particular constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Earth, which made it obnoxious to be absorpt in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
so, that our explication so far is justifi'd. But it was below
the dignity of those Sacred Pen-men, or the Spirit of God that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
them, to shew us the causes of this disruption, or of this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorption;
this is left to the enquiries of men. For it was never
the design of Providence, to give such particular explications of
Natural things, as should make us idle, or the use of Reason un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary;
but on the contrary, by delivering great conclusions to
us, to excite our curiosity and inquisitiveness after the methods, by
which such things were brought to pass: And it may be there
is no greater trial or instance of Natural Wisdom, than to find out
the Chanel, in which these great revolutions of Nature, which we
treat on, flow and succeed one another.</p>
                     <p>Let us therefore resume that System of the Ante-diluvian Earth,
which we have deduc'd from the Chaos, and which we find to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s description, and <hi>Moses</hi> his account of the Deluge.
This Earth could not be obnoxious to a Deluge, as the Apostle sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
it to have been, but by a dissolution; for the Abysse was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd
within its bowels. And <hi>Moses</hi> doth in effect tell us, there was
such a dissolution; when he saith, <hi>The fountains of the great Abysse
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41970:36"/>
were borken open.</hi> For Fountains are broken open no otherwise than
by breaking up the ground that covers them? We must therefore
here inquire in what order, and from what causes the frame of
this exteriour Earth was dissolv'd, and then we shall soon see how,
upon that dissolution, the Deluge immediately prevail'd and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow'd
all the parts of it.</p>
                     <p>I do not think it in the power of humane wit to determine how
long this frame would stand, how many Years, or how many
Ages; but one would soon imagine, that this kind of structure
would not be perpetual, nor last indeed many thousands of Years,
if one consider the effect that the heat of the Sun would have upon
it and the Waters under it; drying and parching the one, and
raresying the other into vapours. For we must consider, that the
course of the Sun at that time, or the posture of the Earth to the
Sun, was such, that there was no diversity or alternation of
seasons in the Year, as there is now; by reason of which alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
our Earth is kept in an equality of temper, the contrary sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
balancing one another; so as what moisture the heat of the
Summer sucks out of the Earth, 'tis repaid in the Rains of the next
Winter; and what chaps were made in it, are fill'd up again, and
the Earth reduc'd to its former constitution. But if we should ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
a continual Summer, the Earth would proceed in driness still
more and more, and the cracks would be wider and pierce deeper
into the substance of it; And such a continual Summer there
was, at least an equality of seasons in the Ante-diluvian Earth, as
shall be prov'd in the follwing Book, concerning <hi>Paradise.</hi> In
the mean time this being suppos'd, let us consider what effect it
would have upon this Arch of the exteriour Earth, and the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
under it.</p>
                     <p>We cannot believe, but that the heat of the Sun, within the
space of some hundreds of years, would have reduc'd this Earth to
a considerable degree of driness in certain parts; and also have
much raresi'd and exhal'd the Waters beneath it: And consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the structure of that Globe, the exteriour crust, and the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
lying round under it, both expos'd to the Sun, we may fitly
compare it to an <hi>Aeolipile,</hi> or an hollow Sphere with Water in it,
which the heat of the Fire rarefies and turns into Vapours and
Wind. The Sun here is as the Fire, and the exteriour Earth is
as the Shell of the <hi>Aeolipile,</hi> and the Abysse as the Water within
it; now when the heat of the Sun had pierced through the Shell
and reach'd the Waters, it began to rarefie them, and raise them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Vapours; which rarefaction made them require more space and
room than they needed before, while they lay close and quiet. And
finding themselves pen'd in by the exteriour Earth, they press'd
with violence against that Arch, to make it yield and give way to
their dilatation and eruption. So we see all Vapours and Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
enclos'd within the Earth, and agitated there, strive to
break out, and often shake the ground with their attempts to get
loose. And in the comparison we us'd of an <hi>Aeolipile,</hi> if the mouth
of it be stopt that gives the vent, the Water raresi'd will burst the
Vessel with its force. And the resemblance of the Earth to an Egg,
<pb n="05" facs="tcp:41970:37"/>
which we us'd before, holds also in this respect; for when it heats
before the Fire, the moisture and Air within being rarefi'd, makes
it often burst the Shell. And I do the more willingly mention this
last comparison, because I observe that some of the Ancients, when
they speak of the doctrine of the <hi>Mundane Egg,</hi> say, that after a
certain period of time it was broken.</p>
                     <p>But there is yet another thing to be consider'd in this case; for
as the heat of the Sun gave force to these Vapours more and more,
and made them more strong and violent; so on the other hand,
it also weaken'd more and more the Arch of the Earth, that was
to resist them; sucking out the moisture that was the cement of
its parts, drying it immoderately, and chapping it in sundry places.
And there being no Winter then to close up and unite its parts,
and restore the Earth to its former strength and compactness, it
grew more and more dispos'd to a dissolution. And at length,
these preparations in Nature being made on either side, the force
of the Vapours increas'd, and the walls weaken'd, which should
have kept them in, when the appointed time was come, that All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
Providence had design'd for the punishment of a sinful World,
the whole fabrick brake, and the frame of the Earth was torn in
pieces, as by an Earthquake; and those great portions or fragments,
into which it was divided, fell down into the Abysse, some in one
posture, and some in another.</p>
                     <p>This is a short and general account how we may conceive the
dissolution of the first Earth, and an universal Deluge arising upon
it. And this manner of dissolution hath so many examples in
Nature every Age, that we need not insist farther upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of it. The generality of Earthquakes arise from like
causes, and often end in a like effect, a partial Deluge, or Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the place or Country where they happen; and of these we
have seen some instances even in our own times: But whensoever it
so happens that the Vapours and Exhalations shut up in the caverns
of the Earth, by rarefaction or compression come to be straitned,
they strive every way to set themselves at liberty, and often break
their prison, or the cover of the Earth that kept them in; which
Earth upon that disruption falls into the Subterraneous Caverns
that lie under it: And if it so happens that those Caverns are full of
Water, as generally they are, if they be great or deep, that City or
tract of Land is drown'd. And also the fall of such a mass of
Earth, with its weight and bulk, doth often force out the Water
so impetuously, as to throw it upon all the Country round about.
There are innumerable examples in History (whereof we shall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
some hereafter) of Cities and Countires thus swallow'd up,
or overflow'd, by an Earthquake, and an Inundation arising upon
it. And according to the manner of their fall or ruine, they either
remain'd wholly under water, and perpetually drown'd, as <hi>Sodom</hi>
and <hi>Gomorrha, Plato</hi>'s <hi>Atlantis, Bura</hi> and <hi>Helice,</hi> and other Cities
and Regions in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Asia;</hi> or they partly emerg'd, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
dry Land again; when (their situation being pretty high)
the Waters, after their violent agitation was abated, retir'd into
the lower places, and into their Chanels.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:41970:37"/>
Now if we compare these partial dissolutions of the Earth with
an universal dissolution, we may as easily conceive an Universal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
from an Universal Dissolution, as a partial Deluge from a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial.
If we can conceive a City, a Country, an Island, a Continent
thus absorpt and overflown; if we do but enlarge our thought and
imagination a little, we may conceive it as well of the whole Earth.
And it seems strange to me, that none of the Ancients should hit
upon this way of explaining the Universal Deluge; there being such
frequent instances in all Ages and Countries of Inundations made in
this manner, and never of any great Inundation made otherwise,
unless in maritime Countries, by the irruption of the Sea into
grounds that lie low. 'Tis true, they would not so easily imagine
this Dissolution, because they did not understand the true from of
the Ante-diluvian Earth; but, methinks, the examination of the
Deluge should have led them to the discovery of that: For observing
the difficulty, or impossibility of an Universal Deluge, without the
Dissolution of the Earth; as also frequent instances of these Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
accompany'd with Deluges, where the ground was hollow,
and had Subterraneous Waters; this, methinks, should have promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them to imagine, that those Subterraneous Waters were univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
at that time, or extended quite round the Earth; so as a disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of the exteriour Earth could not be made any where but it
would fall into Waters, and be more or less overflow'd. And
when they had once reacht this thought, they might conclude both
what the form of the Ante-diluvian Earth was, and that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
came to pass by the dissolution of it. But we reason with ease
about the finding out of things, when they are once found out;
and there is but a thin paper-wall sometimes between the great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
and a perfect ignorance of them. Let us proceed now to
consider, whether this supposition will answer all the conditions
of an Universal Deluge, and supply all the defects which we found
in other Explications.</p>
                     <p>The great difficulty propos'd, was to find Water sufficient to
make an Universal Deluge, reaching to the tops of the Mountains;
and yet that this Water should be transient, and after some time
should so return into its Chanels, that the dry Land would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
and the Earth become again habitable. There was that
double impossibility in the common opinion, that the quantity of
Water necessary for such a Deluge was no where to be found, or
could no way be brought upon the Earth; and then if it was
brought, could no way be remov'd again. Our explication quite
takes off the edge of this Objection; for, performing the same ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
with a far less quantity of Water, 'tis both easie to be found,
and easily remov'd when the work is done. When the exteriour
Earth was broke, and fell into the Abysse, a good part of it was
cover'd with Water by the meer depth of the Abysse it fell into,
and those parts of it that were higher than the Abysse was deep,
and consequently would stand above it in a calm Water, were
notwithstanding reacht and overtop'd by the waves, during the
agitation and violent commotion of the Abysse. For it is not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
what the commotion of the Abysse would be upon this
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41970:38"/>
dissolution of the Earth, nor to what height its waves would be
thrown, when those prodigious fragments were tumbled down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it. Suppose a stone of ten thousand weight taken up into the
Air a mile or two, and then let fall into the middle of the Ocean,
I do not believe but that the dashing of the water upon that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
would rise as high as a Mountain. But suppose a mighty
Rock or heap of Rocks to fall from that height, or a great Island,
or a Continent; these would expel the waters out of their places,
with such a force and violence, as to fling them among the highest
Clouds.</p>
                     <p>'Tis incredible to what height sometimes great Stones and Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
will be thrown, at the eruptions of fiery Mountains; and the
pressure of a great mass of Earth falling into the Abysse, though it
be a force of another kind, could not but impel the water with so
much strength, as would carry it up to a great height in the Air:
and to the top of any thing that lay in its way, any eminency, high
fragment, or new Mountain: And then rowling back again, it
would sweep down with it whatsoever it rusht upon, Woods,
Building, living Creatures, and carry them all headlong into the
great gulph. Sometimes a mass of water would be quite struck off
and separate from the rest, and tost through the Air like a flying
River; but the common motion of the waves was to climb up the
hills, or inclin'd fragments; and then return into the valleys and
deeps again, with a perpetual fluctuation going and coming, ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and descending, till the violence of them being spent by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
they setled at last in the places allotted for them; where
<hi>bounds are set that they cannot pass over, that they return not again to
cover the Earth.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 104. 6, 7, 8, 9.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Neither is it to be wonder'd, that the great Tumult of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and the extremity of the Deluge lasted for some months; for
besides, that the first shock and commotion of the Abysse was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
violent, from the general fall of the Earth, there were ever
and anon some secondary ruines; or some parts of the great ruine,
that were not well setled, broke again, and made new commotions:
And 'twas a considerable time before the great fragments that fell,
and their lesser dependencies could be so adjusted and fitted, as to
rest in a firm and immoveable posture: For the props and stays
whereby they lean'd one upon another, or upon the bottom of the
Abysse, often fail'd, either by the incumbent weight, or the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
impulses of the water against them; and so renew'd, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
the disorder and confusion of the Abysse. Besides, we are to
observe, that these great fragments falling hollow, they inclos'd
and bore down with them under their concave surface a great deal
of Air; and while the water compass'd these fragments, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow'd
them, the Air could not readily get out of those prisons, but
by degrees, as the Earth and Water above would give way; so as
this would also hinder the settlement of the Abysse, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring
of the Water into those Subterraneous Chanels, for some
time. But at length, when this Air had found a vent, and left its
place to the Water, and the ruines, both primary and secondary,
were setled and fix'd, then the Waters of the Abysse began to settle
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41970:38"/>
too, and the dry Land to appear; first the tops of the Mountains,
then the high Grounds, then the Plains and the rest of the Earth.
And this gradual subsidency of the Abysse (which <hi>Moses</hi> also hath
particularly noted) and discovery of the several parts of the Earth,
would also take up a considerable time.</p>
                     <p>Thus a new World appear'd, or the Earth put on its new form,
and became divided into Sea, and Land; and the Abysse, which
from several Ages, even from the beginning of the World, had lain
hid in the womb of the Earth, was brought to light and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd;
the greatest part of it constituting our present Ocean, and
the rest filling the lower cavities of the Earth: Upon the Land ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
the Mountains and the Hills, and the Islands in the Sea, and
the Rocks upon the shore. And so the Divine Providence, having
prepar'd Nature for so great a change, at one stroke dissolv'd the
frame of the old World, and made us a new one out of its ruines,
which we now inhabit since the Deluge. All which things being
thus explain'd, deduc'd, and stated, we now add and pronounce
our Third and last Proposition; <hi>That the disruption of the Abysse, or
dissolution of the primaeval Earth and its fall into the Abysse, was the
cause of the Universal Deluge, and of the destruction of the old World.</hi>

                     <p>WE have now given an account of the first great revolution
of Nature, and of the Universal Deluge, in a way that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible,
and from causes that answer the greatness of the effect;
We have suppos'd nothing but what is also prov'd, both as to the
first form of the Earth, and as to the manner of its Dissolution:
and how far from that would evidently and necessarily arise a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Deluge; which was that, which put a period to the old
World, and the first state of things. And though all this hath
been deduc'd in due order, and with connexion and consequence
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41970:39"/>
of one thing upon another, so far as I know, which is the true
evidence of a Theory; yet it may not be sufficient to command the
Assent and Belief of some persons, who will allow, it may be, and
acknowledge, that this is a fair <hi>Idea</hi> of a possible Deluge in general,
and of the destruction of a World by it; but this may be only an
<hi>Idea,</hi> they'll say; we desire it may be prov'd from some collateral
arguments, taken either from Sacred History, or from observation,
that this hath really been exemplified upon the Earth, and that
<hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood came to pass this way. And seeing we have design'd
this first Book chiefly for the Explication of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Deluge, I am
willing to add here a Chapter or two extraordinary upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion;
to shew, that what we have deliver'd is more than an <hi>Idea,</hi>
and that it was in this very way that <hi>Noah</hi>'s Deluge came to pass.
But they who have not this doubt, and have a mind to see the
issue of the Theory, may skip these two Chapters, if they please,
and proceed to the following, where the order is continued.</p>
                     <p>To satisfie then the doubtful in this particular, let us lay down
in the first place that conclusion which they seem to admit, <hi>viz.</hi>
That this is a possible and consistent Explication of an Universal
Deluge; and let's see how far this would go, if well consider'd,
towards the proof of what they desire, or towards the demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Deluge in particular. It is granted on both hands,
that here hath been an Universal Deluge upon the Earth, which
was <hi>Noah</hi>'s Deluge; and it is also granted, that we have given a
possible and consistent <hi>Idea</hi> of an Universal Deluge; Now we have
prov'd <hi>Chap. II.</hi> and <hi>III.</hi> that all other ways hitherto assign'd for the
Explication of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood are incongrous or impossible; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it came to pass in that possible and competent way which we
have propos'd. And if we have truly prov'd, in the foremention'd
Chapters, the impossibility or unintelligibility of it in all other ways,
this argumentation is undeniable. Besides, we may argue thus, as
it is granted that there hath been an Universal Deluge upon the
Earth; so I suppose it will be granted that there hath been but one:
Now the dissolution of the Earth, whensoever it happen'd, would
make one Universal Deluge, and therefore the only one, and the
same with <hi>Noah</hi>'s. That such a Dissolution as we have describ'd,
would make an Universal Deluge, I think, cannot be question'd;
and that there hath been such a dissolution, besides what we have
already alledg'd, shall be prov'd at large from natural Observations
upon the Form and Figure of the present Earth, in the <hi>Third</hi> Section
and last <hi>Chap.</hi> of this Book; In the mean time we will proceed to
History, both Sacred and Profane, and by comparing our Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
with those, give further assurance of its truth and reality.</p>
                     <p>In the first place, it agrees, which is most considerable, with
<hi>Moses</hi>'s Narration of the Deluge; both as to the matter and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of it. The matter of the Deluge <hi>Moses</hi> makes to be the Waters
from above, and the Waters from below; or he distinguishes the
Causes of the Deluge,<note place="margin">Gen. 7. 11.</note> as we do, into Superiour and Inferiour; and
the Inferiour causes he makes to be the disruption of the Abyss,
which is the principal part, and the great hinge of our Explication.
Then as to the manner of the Deluge, the beginning and the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41970:39"/>
ending, the increase and decrease, he saith it increas'd gradually,<note place="margin">ver. 17, 18, 19, 20. cap. 8. 3, 5.</note>
and decreas'd gradually, by <hi>going</hi> and <hi>coming;</hi> that is after many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
fluctuations and reciprocations of the waves, the waters of
the Abysse began to be more compos'd, and to retire into their
Chanels, whence they shall never return to cover the Earth again.
This agrees wholly with our Theory; we suppose the Abysse to
have been under an extream commotion and agitation by the fall
of the Earth into it, and this at first encreas'd more and more, till
the whole Earth was faln; Then continuing for some time at the
height of its rage, overwhelming the greatest Mountains, it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
decreas'd by the like degrees, leaving first the tops of the
Mountains, then the Hills and the Fields, till the Waters came to
be wholly drawn off the Earth into their Chanels.</p>
                     <p>It was no doubt a great oversight in the Ancients, to fansie the
Deluge like a great standing Pool of water, reaching from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the Valleys to the tops of the Mountains, every where alike,
with a level and uniform surface; by reason of which mistaken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Deluge, they made more water necessary to it than was
possible to be had, or being had, than it was possible to get quit of
again; for there are no Chanels in the Earth that could hold so
much water,<note place="margin">vid. St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> in loc.</note> either to give it, or to receive it. And the <hi>Psalmist</hi>
speaking of the Deluge, as it seems to me, notes this violent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
of the Abysse.<note place="margin">Psal. 104.</note> 
                        <hi>The Waters went up by the Mountains, came
down by the Valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">vers. 8, 9.</note> I
know some interpret that passage of the state of the waters in the
beginning, when they cover'd the face of the whole Earth, <hi>Gen. 1.
2.</hi> but that cannot be, because of what follows in the next Verse;
<hi>Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again
to cover the Earth.</hi> Which is not true, if the preceding words be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of the state of the waters at the beginning of the World;
for they did pass those bounds, and did return since that time to
cover the Earth, namely at the Deluge: But if these words be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to the time of the Deluge, and the state of the waters then,
'tis both a just description of the motion of the Abysse, and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true, that the waters since that time are so setled in their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels,
that they shall never overflow the Earth again. As we are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
by the promise made to <hi>Noah,</hi> and that illustrious pledge and
confirmation of it, the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> that the Heavens also shall never
pour out so much waters again; their state being chang'd as well
as that of the Earth, or Sea, from what they were before the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge.</p>
                     <p>But before we leave <hi>Moses</hi>'s Narration of the Deluge, we must
examine further, what is, or can be understood by his TEHOM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RABBA,<note place="margin">Gen. 7. 11.</note>
or <hi>great Abysse,</hi> which he saith was broken up at the
Deluge; for this will help us to discover, whether our Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be the same with his, and of the same Flood. And first we must
consider, whether by the <hi>Tehom-Rabba,</hi> or Mosaical Abysse, can be
understood the Sea or Ocean, under that form we see it in at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
and 'tis plain, methinks, that the Sea cannot be understood
by this great Abysse, both because the Sea is not capable upon any
disruption to make such an universal Deluge; and because the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41970:40"/>
of <hi>Moses,</hi> and his expressions concerning this Abysse, do not
agree to the Sea. Some of the Ancients indeed did imagine, that
the waters of the Sea were much higher than the Land, and stood,
as it were, on an heap; so as when these waters were let loose, they
overflow'd the Earth, and made a Deluge. But this is known to be
a gross mistake; the Sea and the Land make one Globe, and the
Waters couch themselves, as close as may be, to the Center of this
Globe in a Spherical convexity; so that if all the Mountains and
Hills were scal'd, and the Earth made even, the Waters would not
overflow its smooth surface; much less could they overflow it in
the form that it is now in, where the Shores are higher than the
Sea, the Inland parts than the Shores, and the Mountains still far
above all: So as no disruption of the Sea could make an universal
Deluge, by reason of its situation. But besides that, the quantity of
Water contain'd in the Sea is no way sufficient to make a Deluge in
the present form of the Earth; for we have shewn before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.
that Eight such Oceans as ours would be little enough for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
Then as to the expressions of <hi>Moses</hi> concerning this Abysse,
if he had meant the Sea by it, and that the Deluge was made by the
disruption of the Sea, why did he not say so? There is no mention
of the Sea in all the History of the Deluge: <hi>Moses</hi> had mention'd
the Sea before, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 10. and us'd a word that was common and
known to signifie the Sea; And if he had a mind to express the
same thing here, why should he not use the same word and the
same term? In an Historical relation we use terms that are most
proper and best known; but instead of that he useth the same term
here that he did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 2. when he saith, <hi>Darkness was upon the
face of the Abysse, or of the Deep,</hi> as we render it; there the Abysse
was open, or cover'd with darkness only, namely before the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Earth was form'd; Here the same Abysse is mention'd again,
but cover'd, by the formation of the Earth upon it; and the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this Abysse was broken or <hi>cloven asunder,</hi> and the Waters
gusht out that made the Deluge. This I am sure is the most natural
interpretation or signification of this word, according as it is us'd
in <hi>Moses</hi>'s writings. Furthermore, we must observe what <hi>Moses</hi>
saith concerning this Abysse, and whether that will agree with the
Sea or no; he saith the <hi>Fountains of the great Abysse were broken open;</hi>
now if by the great Abysse you understand the Sea, how are its
Fountains broken open? To break open a Fountain, is to break open
the ground that covers it, and what ground covers the Sea? So that
upon all considerations, either of the word that <hi>Moses</hi> here useth,
<hi>Tehom-Rabba,</hi> or of the thing affirmed concerning it, <hi>breaking open
its Fountains;</hi> or of the effect following the breaking open its Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
<hi>drowning of the Earth;</hi> from all these heads it is manifest, that
the Sea cannot be understood by the great Abysse, whose disrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was the cause of the Deluge.</p>
                     <p>And as the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Abysse cannot be the Sea, so neither can it
be those Subterraneous waters that are disperst in the Cells and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
of the Earth; for as they are now lodg'd within the Earth,
they are not one <hi>Abysse,</hi> but several Cisterns and Receptacles of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
in several places, especially under the roots of Mountains and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41970:40"/>
Hills; separate one from another, sometimes by whole Regions
and Countries interpos'd. Besides what Fountains, if they were
broken up, could let out this water, or bring it upon the face of
the Earth? When we sink a Mine, or dig a Well, the waters,
when uncover'd, do not leap out of their places, out of those Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities,
or at least, do not flow upon the Earth; 'Tis not as if you
open<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d a Vein, where the Bloud spirts out, and riseth higher than
its Source; but as when you take off the cover of a Vessel, the
water doth not fly out for that: So if we should imagine all the
Subterraneous Caverns of the Earth uncover'd, and the waters laid
bare, there they would lie unmov'd in their beds, if the Earth did
not fall into them to force them up. Furthermore, if these waters
were any way extracted and laid upon the surface of the ground,
nothing would be gain'd as to the Deluge by that, for as much
water would run into these holes again when the Deluge begun to
rise; so that this would be but an useless labour, and turn to no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
And lastly, These waters are no way sufficient for quantity
to answer to the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Abyss, or to be the principal cause of the
Deluge, as that was.</p>
                     <p>Now seeing neither the Sea, as it is at present, nor the Subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
Waters, as they are at present, can answer to the <hi>Mosaical
Abysse,</hi> we are sure there is nothing in this present Earth that can
answer to it. Let us then on the other hand compare it with that
Subterraneous Abyss, which we have found in the Ante-diluvian
Earth,<note place="margin">P. 40.</note> represented 5 <hi>Fig.</hi> 2. and examine their characters and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency:
First, <hi>Moses</hi>'s Abyss was cover'd, and Subterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
for the <hi>Fountains</hi> of it are said to have been cloven or burst
open; then it was vast and capacious; and thirdly, it was so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
as to be capable of a disruption, that would cause an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Deluge to the Earth. Our Ante-diluvian Abyss answers truly
to all these characters; 'twas in the womb of the Earth; the Earth
was founded upon those <hi>Waters,</hi> as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> saith; or they
were enclos'd within the Earth <hi>as in a Bag.</hi> Then for the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of it, it contained both all the Waters now in the Ocean, and
all those that are dispers'd in the Caverns of the Earth: And lastly,
it is manifest its situation was such, that upon a disruption or
dissolution of the Earth which cover'd it, an universal Deluge
would arise. Seeing then this answers the description, and all the
properties of the <hi>Mosaical Abysse,</hi> and nothing else will, how can
we in reason judge it otherwise than the same, and the very thing
intended and propos'd in the History of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Deluge under the
name of <hi>Tehom-Rabba,</hi> or the great Abyss, at whose disruption the
World was over-flow'd. And as we do not think it an unhappy
discovery to have found out (with a moral certainty) the feat of
the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Abyss, which hath been almost as much sought for,
and as much in vain, as the seat of <hi>Paradise;</hi> so this gives us a great
assurance, that the Theory we have given of a general Deluge, is
not a meer <hi>Idea,</hi> but is to be appropriated to the Deluge of <hi>Noah,</hi>
as a true explication of it.</p>
                     <p>And to proceed now from <hi>Moses</hi> to other Divine Writers;
That our Description is a reality, both as to the Ante-diluvian
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41970:41"/>
Earth, and as to the Deluge, we may further be convinc'd from
S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s discourse concerning those two things.<note place="margin">2 Epist. 3. 6.</note> S. <hi>Peter</hi> saith, that
the constitution of the Ante-diluvian Earth was such, in reference
to the Waters, that by reason of that it was obnoxious to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge;
we say these Waters were the great <hi>Abysse</hi> it stood upon,
by reason whereof that World was really expos'd to a Deluge, and
overwhelm'd in it upon the disruption of, this Abyss, as <hi>Moses</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.
'Tis true, S. <hi>Peter</hi> doth not specifie what those waters
were, nor mention either the Sea, or the Abyss; but seeing <hi>Moses</hi>
tells us, that it was by the waters of the Abyss that the Earth was
overwhelm'd, S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s waters must be understood of the same Abyss,
because he supposeth them the cause of the same Deluge. And, I
think, the Apostle's discourse there cannot receive a better illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than from <hi>Moses</hi>'s History of the Deluge. <hi>Moses</hi> distinguishes
the Causes of the Flood into those that belong to the Heavens, and
those that belong to the Earth; the Rains and the Abyss: S. <hi>Peter</hi>
also distinguisheth the causes of the Deluge into the constitution of
the Heavens, in reference to its waters; and the constitution of the
Earth, in reference to its waters; and no doubt they both aim at
the same causes, as they refer to the same effect; only <hi>Moses</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
the immediate Causes, the Rains and the Waters of the
Abyss; and S. <hi>Peter</hi> mentions the more remote and fundamental
causes, that constitution of the Heavens, and that constitution of
the Earth, in reference to their respective Waters, which made
that world obnoxious to a Deluge: And these two speaking of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>'s
Deluge, and agreeing thus with one another, and both with
us, or with the Theory which we have given of a General De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge,
we may safely conclude, that it is no imaginary <hi>Idea,</hi> but a
true account of that Ancient Flood, whereof <hi>Moses</hi> hath left us the
History.</p>
                     <p>And seeing the right understanding of the <hi>Mosaical Abysse</hi> is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
alone to prove all we have deliver'd concerning the Deluge,
as also concerning the frame of the Ante-diluvian Earth, give me
leave to take notice here of some other places of Scripture, which
we mention'd before, that seem manifestly to describe this fame
form of the Abyss with the Earth above it, <hi>Psal. 24. 2. He founded
the Earth upon the Seas,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">4 Esdr. 16. 58.</note> 
                        <hi>and establish'd it upon the Floods;</hi> and <hi>Psal. 136.
6. He stretched out the Earth above the Waters.</hi> Now this Foundation
of the Earth upon the Waters, or <hi>extension</hi> of it above the Waters,
doth most aptly agree to that structure and situation of the Abyss
and the Ante-diluvian Earth,<note place="margin">Chap. 6.</note> which we have assign'd them, and
which we have before describ'd; but very improperly and forc'dly
to the present form of the Earth and the Waters. In that second
place of the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> the word may be render'd either, he <hi>stretch'd,</hi>
as we read it, or he <hi>fixt and consolidated</hi> the Earth above the Waters,
as the Vulgate and Septuagint translate it: For 'tis from the same
word with that which is used for the <hi>Firmament, Gen.</hi> 1. So that
as the Firmament was extended over and around the Earth, so was
the Earth extended over and about the Waters, in that first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of things; and I remember some of the Ancients use this
very comparison of the Firmament and Earth, to express the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41970:41"/>
situation of the <hi>Paradisiacal</hi> Earth in reference to the Sea or Abysse.</p>
                     <p>There is another remarkable place in the <hi>Psalms,</hi> to shew the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the Waters in the first Earth; <hi>Psal. 33. 7. He gathereth
the Waters of the Sea as in a Bag, he layeth up the Abysses in store-houses.</hi>
This answers very fitly and naturally to the place and disposition of
the Abysse which it had before the Deluge, inclos'd within the
vault of the Earth, as in a <hi>Bag</hi> or in a <hi>Store house.</hi> I know very well
what I render here in a <hi>Bag,</hi> is render'd in the <hi>English, as an heap;</hi>
but that translation of the word seems to be grounded on the old
Error, that the Sea is higher than the Land, and so doth not make
a true sence. Neither are the two parts of the Verse so well suited
and consequent one to another, if the first express an high situation
of the Waters, and the second a low one. And accordingly, the
Vulgate, Septuagint, and Oriental Versions and Paraphrase, as also
<hi>Symmachus,</hi> St. <hi>Ierome,</hi> and <hi>Basil,</hi> render it as we do here, <hi>in a Bag,</hi>
or by terms equivalent.</p>
                     <p>To these passages of the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> concerning the form of the
Abysse and the first Earth, give me leave to add this general remark,
that they are commonly ushered in, or followed, with something
of Admiration in the Prophet. We observ'd before, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the first Earth, after such a wonderful manner, being a
piece of Divine Architecture, when it was spoken of in Scripture,
it was usually ascrib'd to a particular Providence, and accordingly
we see in these places now mention'd, that it is still made the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of praise and admiration: In that 136 <hi>Psalm</hi> 'tis reckon'd
among the wonders of God, <hi>Vers. 4, 5, 6, Give praise to him who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
doth great wonders; To him that by wisdom made the Heavens: To
him that stretched out the Earth above the Waters.</hi> And in like manner,
in that 33 <hi>Psalm,</hi> 'tis joyn'd with the forming of the Heavens, and
made the subject of the Divine Power and Wisdom: <hi>Vers. 6, 7, 8, 9.
By the word of the Lord were the Heavens made, and all the Host of them
by the breath of his mouth; He gathereth the Waters of the Sea together,
as in a Bag, he layeth up the Abysse in Store-houses. Let all the Earth
fear the Lord; Let all the Inhabitants of the World stand in awe of him;
For he spake, and it was; he commanded, and it stood fast.</hi> Namely,
all things stood in that wonderful posture in which the <hi>Word</hi> of his
Power and Wisdom had establisht them. <hi>David</hi> often made the
works of Nature, and the External World, the matter of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations,
and of his praises and Philosophical Devotions; reflecting
sometimes upon the present form of the World, and sometimes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the primitive form of it: And though Poetical expressions, as the
<hi>Psalms</hi> are, seldom are so determinate and distinct, but that they
may be interpreted more than one way, yet, I think, it cannot but
be acknowledg'd that those expressions and passages that we have
instanc'd in, are more fairly and aptly understood of the Ancient
form of the Sea, or the Abysse, as it was enclos'd within the Earth,
than of the present form of it in an open Chanel.</p>
                     <p>There are also in the Book of <hi>Iob</hi> many noble reflections upon the
works of Nature, and upon the formation of the Earth and the
Abysse; whereof that in <hi>Chap. 26. 7. He stretcheth out the North over
the Empty places, and hangeth the Earth upon nothing,</hi> seems to parallel
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41970:42"/>
the expression of <hi>David; He stretched out the Earth upon the Waters;</hi>
for the word we render the <hi>empty place</hi> is TOHU, which is appli'd
to the Chaos and the first Abysse, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 2. and the <hi>hanging the
Earth upon nothing</hi> is much more wonderful, if it be understood of
the first habitable Earth, that hung over the Waters, sustain'd by
nothing but its own peculiar form, and the libration of its parts,
than if it be understood of the present Earth, and the whole body
of it; for if it be in its Center or proper place, whither should it
sink further, or whither should it go? But this passage, together
with the foregoing and following Verses, requires a more critical
examination than this Discourse will easily bear.</p>
                     <p>There is another remarkable Discourse in <hi>Iob,</hi> that contains ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things to our present purpose, 'tis <hi>Chap.</hi> 38. where God reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<hi>Iob</hi> with his ignorance of what pass'd at the beginning of the
World, and the formation of the Earth, <hi>Vers. 4, 5, 6. Where wast
thou when I laid the foundations of the Earth? Declare if thou hast un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding:
Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest; or
who hath stretched the line upon it? Whereupon are the foundations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
fastned, or who laid the corner-stone?</hi> All these questions have far
more force and Emphasis, more propriety and elegacy, if they be
understood of the first and Ante-diluvian form of the Earth, than if
they be understood of the present; for in the present form of the
Earth there is no Architecture, no structure, no more than in a
ruine; or at least none comparatively to what was in the first form
of it. And that the exterior and superficial part of the Earth is
here spoken of, appears by the <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>line</hi> appli'd to it; but what
rule or regularity is there in the surface of the present Earth? what
line was us'd to level its parts? But in its original construction when
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>it lay smooth and regular in its surface, as if it had been drawn by
rule and line in every part; and when it hung pois'd upon the
Deep, without pillar or foundation stone, then just proportions
were taken, and every thing plac'd by weight and measure: And
this, I doubt not, was that artificial structure here alluded to, and
when this work was finisht,<note place="margin">ver. 7.</note> then <hi>the morning Stars sang together, and
all the sons of God shouted for joy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus far the questions proceed upon the form and construction
of the first Earth; in the following <hi>verses (8, 9, 10, 11.)</hi> they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
upon the demolition of that Earth, the opening the Abysse,
and the present state of both. <hi>Or who shut up the Sea with doors when
it brake forth, as if it had issu'd out of a womb?</hi> Who can doubt but
this was at the breaking open of the <hi>Fountains of the Abysse,</hi> Gen. 7.
11. when the waters gusht out, as out of the great womb of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and by reason of that confusion and perturbation of Air and
Water that rise upon it, a thick mist and darkness was round the
Earth, and all things as in a second Chaos, <hi>When I made the cloud the
garment thereof, and thick darkness a swadling band for it, and brake up
for it my decreed place, and made bars and doors.</hi> Namely, (taking the
words as thus usually render'd) the present Chanel of the Sea was
made when the Abysse was broke up, and at the same time were
made the shory Rocks and Mountains which are the bars and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries
of the Sea. <hi>And said hitherto shalt thou come, and no further,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41970:42"/>
and here shall thy proud waves be stay'd.</hi> Which last sentence shows,
that this cannot be understood of the first disposition of the waters
as they were before the Flood, for their proud waves broke those
bounds, whatsoever they were, when they overflow'd the Earth in
the Deluge. And that the <hi>womb</hi> which they broke out of was the
great Abyss,<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">

                        </note> the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrase in this place doth expresly
mention; and what can be understood by <hi>the womb of the Farth,</hi>
but that Subterraneous capacity in which the Abyss lay? Then that
which followeth, is a description or representation of the great
Deluge that ensu'd, and of that disorder in Nature, that was then, and
how the Waters were setled and Bounded afterwards. Not unlike
the description in the 104 <hi>Psalm, vers.</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9. and thus much for
these places in the book of <hi>Iob.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There remains a remarkable discourse in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> of <hi>Solomon,</hi>
relating to the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Abysse, and not only to that, but to the
Origin of the Earth in general; where <hi>Wisdom</hi> declares her anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
and pre-existence to all the works of this Earth, <hi>Chap. 8. ver.
23. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. I was set up from everlasting, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
ere the Earth was. When there were no Deeps or Abysses, I was
brought forth; when no fountains abounding with water.</hi> Then in the
27. verse, <hi>When he prepared the Heavens, I was there; when he set a
Compass upon the face of the Deep or Abysse. When he established the
Clouds above, when he strengthned the fountains of the Abysse.</hi> Here is
mention made of the <hi>Abysse,</hi> and of <hi>the Fountains of the Abysse,</hi> and
who can question, but that the Fountains of the Abyss here, are
the same with the Fountains of the Abyss which <hi>Moses</hi> mentions,
and were broken open, as he tells us, at the Deluge? Let us ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
therefore what form <hi>Wisdom</hi> gives to this Abyss, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to the <hi>Mosaical:</hi> And here seem to be two expressions that
determine the form of it, <hi>vers. 28. He strengthned the fountains of the Abysse,</hi> that is, the cover of those Fountains, for the Fountains
could be strengthned no other way than by making a strong cover
or Arch over them. And that Arch is exprest more fully and
distinctly in the foregoing <hi>verse, When he prepar'd the Heavens, I
was there; when he set a</hi> Compass <hi>on the face of the Abysse;</hi> we ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it <hi>Compass,</hi> the word signifies a Circle or Circumference, or an
Orb or Sphere. So there was in the beginning of the World a
Sphere Orb or Arch set round the Abyss, according to the restimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> who was then present. And this shews us both the
form of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Abyss, which was included within this Vault:
and the form of the habitable Earth, which was the outward sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of this Vault, or the cover of the Abyss that was broke up at
the Deluge.</p>
                     <p>And thus much, I think, is sufficient to have noted out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
concerning the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Abyss, to discover the form, place
and situation of it; which I have done the more largely, because
that being determin'd, it will draw in easily all the rest of our The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory
concerning the Deluge. I will now only add one or two ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Observations, and so conclude this discourse; The first Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
is concerning the Abyss; namely, That the <hi>opening and
shutting of the Abysse,</hi> is the great hinge upon which Nature turns in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41970:43"/>
this Earth: This brings another face of things, other Scenes and a
New World upon the stage: And accordingly it is a thing often
mention'd and alluded to in Scripture, sometimes in a Natural,
sometimes in a Moral or Theological sence; and in both sences, our
Saviour shuts and opens it as he pleaseth. Our Saviour, who is
both Lord of Nature and of Grace, whose Dominion is both in
Heaven and in Earth, hath a double Key; that of the Abyss, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
Death and Hell are in his power,<note place="margin">Iob 11. 10, 12, 14.</note> and all the revolutions of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are under his Conduct and Providence;<note place="margin">Apoc. 1. 18. 20. 1, 2, 3. 21. 1.</note> And the Key of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
whereby he admits or excludes from the City of God, and the
Kingdom of Heaven whom he pleaseth.<note place="margin">Apoc. 3. 7.</note> Of those places that refer
to the shutting and opening the Abyss in a natural sence,<note place="margin">Isa. 22. 22.</note> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but particularly take notice of that in <hi>Iob, Chap. 12. ver. 14, 15.
God breaketh down,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">&amp; Chap. 11. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up man,
and there can be no opening: Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and
they dry up; also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the Earth.</hi>
Though these things be true of God in lesser and common instances,
yet to me it is plain, that they principally refer to the Deluge, the
opening and shutting the Abyss, with the dissolu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ion or subversion
of the Earth thereupon; and accordingly they are made the great
effects of the Divine Power and Wisdom in the foregoing Verse,
<hi>With God is wisdom and strength,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Verse 13.</note> 
                        <hi>he hath counsel and understanding;
Behold, he breaketh down,</hi> &amp;c. And also in the conclusion 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
again,<note place="margin">Verse 6.</note> 
                        <hi>With him is strength and wisdom;</hi> which solemnity
would scarce have been us'd for common instances of his power.
When God is said to build or pull down, and no body can build
again, 'tis not to be understood of an House or a Town, God builds
and unbuilds Worlds; and who shall build up that Arch that
was broke down at the Deluge? Where shall they lay the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
or how shall the Mountains be rear'd up again to make part
of the Roof? This is the Fabrick, which when God breaketh down,
none can build up again. <hi>He withholdeth the waters and they dry up:</hi>
As we shew'd the Earth to have been immoderately chapt and parcht
before its dissolution. <hi>He sendeth them forth and they overturn the
Earth.</hi> What can more properly express the breaking out of the
waters at the disruption of the Abyss? and the subversion or disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of the Earth in consequence of it? 'Tis true this last passage
may be applied to the breaking out of waters in an ordinary Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,
and the subversion of some part of the Earth, which often
follows upon it; but it must be acknowledg'd, that the sence is more
weighty, if it be refer'd to the great Deluge; and the great Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
which laid the World in ruines and in water. And Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical
descriptions in Sacred Writings, like Prophecies, have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
a lesser and a greater accomplishment and interpretation.</p>
                     <p>I could not pass by this place without giving this short Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it. We proceed now to the second Observation, which is
concerning the stile of Scripture, in most of those places we have
cited, and others upon the same subject. The reflections that are
made in several parts of the Divine Writings, upon the Origin of
the World, and the formation of the Earth, seem to me to be writ
in a stile-something approaching to the nature of a Prophetical stile,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41970:43"/>
and to have more of a Divine Enthusiasm and Elocution in them,
than the ordinary text of Scripture; the expressions are lofty, and
sometimes abrupt, and often figurative and disguis'd, as may be
observ'd in most of those places we have made use of, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
in that speech of <hi>Wisdom, Prov.</hi> 8. where the 26. <hi>verse</hi> is so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure,
that no two Versions that I have yet met with, whether An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
or Modern, agree in the Translation of that Verse. And
therefore though I fully believe that the construction of the first
Earth is really intended in those words, yet seeing it could not be
made out clear without a long and critical discussion of them, I did
not think that proper to be insisted upon here. We may also observe,
that whereas there is a double form or composition of the Earth,
that which it had at first, or till the Deluge, and that which it hath
since; sometimes the one, and sometimes the other may be glanc'd
upon in these Scripture phrases and descriptions; and so there
may be in the same discourse an intermixture of both. And
it commonly happens so in an Enthusiastick or Prophetick stile,
that by reason of the eagerness and trembling of the Fancy, it doth
not always regularly follow the same even thread of discourse, but
strikes many times upon some other thing that hath relation to it,
or lies under or near the same view. Of this we have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
examples in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> and in that Prophecy of our
Saviour's, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. concerning the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and
of the World. But notwithstanding any such unevenness or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctness
in the stile of those places which we have cited concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Origin and form of the Earth, we may at least make this
remark, that if there never was any other form of the Earth but
the present, nor any other state of the Abysse, than what it is in
now, 'tis not imaginable, what should give occasion to all those
expressions and passages that we have cited; which being so strange
in themselves and paradoxical, should yet so much favour, and so
fairly comply with our suppositions.<note place="margin">Tell. Theor. lib. 2. c. 6.</note> What I have observ'd in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place, in treating of <hi>Paradise,</hi> that the expressions of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fathers were very extravagant, if <hi>Paradise</hi> was nothing but a
little plot of ground in <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> as many of late have fansied;
may in like manner be observ'd concerning the ancient Earth and
Abysse, if they were in no other form, nor other state than what
they are under now, the expressions of the Sacred Writers concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them are very strange and inaccountable, without any suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
ground, that we know, or any just occasion for such uncouth
representations. If there was nothing intended or refer'd to in
those descriptions, but the present form and state of the Earth,
that is so well known, that in describing of it there would be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
dark or mysterious, nor any occasion for obscurity in the
stile or expression, whereof we find so much in those. So as, all
things consider'd, what might otherwise be made an exception to
some of these Texts alledg'd by us, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are too obscure,
becomes an argument for us: as implying that there is something
more intended by them, than the present and known form of the
Earth. And we having propos'd another form and structure of the
Earth, to which those characters suit and answer more easily, as this
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41970:44"/>
opens and gives light to those difficult places, so it may be reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
concluded to be the very sence and notion intended by the holy
Writers.</p>
                     <p>And thus much, I think, is sufficient to have observ'd out of
Scripture, to verifie our Explication of the Deluge, and our Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of it to <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood, both according to the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Flood, and according to many occasional reflections and
discourses dispers'd in other places of Scripture, concerning the
same Flood, or concerning the Abysse and the first form of the
Earth. And though there may be some other passages of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
aspect, they will be of no force to disprove our conclusions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they respect the present form of the Earth and Sea; and also
because expressions that deviate more from the common opinion,
are more remarkable and more proving; in that there is nothing
could give occasion to such, but an intention to express the very
truth. So, for instance, if there was one place of Scripture that
said <hi>the Earth was mov'd,</hi> and several that seem'd to imply, that the
<hi>Sun</hi> was mov'd, we should have more regard to that one place for
the motion of the Earth, than to all the other that made against it;
because those others might be spoken and understood according to
common opinion and common belief, but that which affirm'd the
motion of the Earth, could not be spoke upon any other ground,
but only for truth and instruction sake. I leave this to be appli'd
to the present subject.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for the Sacred Writings. As to the History of the
ancient Heathens, we cannot expect an account or Narration of
<hi>Noah's</hi> Flood, under that name and notion; but it may be of use
to observe two things out of that History. First, that the Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
recorded there came generally to pass in the manner we have
describ'd the Universal Deluge; namely, by Earthquakes and an
eruption of Subterraneous waters, the Earth being broken and fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in: and of this we shall else-where give a full account out of
their Authors. Secondly, that <hi>Deucalion</hi>'s Deluge in particular,
which is suppos'd by most of the Ancient Fathers to represent
<hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood, is said to have been accompained with a gaping or
disruption of the Earth;<note place="margin">Bibl. lib. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Apollodorus</hi> saith, that the Mountains of
<hi>Thessaly</hi> were divided asunder, or separate one from another at that
time: And <hi>Lucian (de deâ Syriâ)</hi> tells a very remarkable story to
this purpose, concerning <hi>Deucalion</hi>'s Deluge, and a ceremony ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
in the Temple of <hi>Hieropolis,</hi> in commemoration of it; which
ceremony seems to have been of that nature, as impli'd that there
was an opening of the Earth at the time of the Deluge, and that the
waters subsided into that again when the Deluge ceas'd. He saith,
that this Temple at <hi>Hieropolis</hi> was built upon a kind of Abysse, or
had a bottomless pit, or gaping of the Earth in one part of it, and
the people of <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> and the Countries the eabouts twice
a year repair'd to this Temple, and brought with them every one a
vessel of water, which they pour'd out upon the floor of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and made a kind of an Inundation there in memory of <hi>Deuca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi>'s
Deluge; and this water sunk by degrees into a Chasm or open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Rock, which the Temple stood upon, and so left the floor
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41970:44"/>
dry again. And this was a rite solemnly and religiously perform'd
both by the Priests and by the People. If <hi>Moses</hi> had left such a
Religious rite among the <hi>Iews,</hi> I should not have doubted to have
interpreted it concerning his Abysse, and the retiring of the waters
into it; but the actual disruption of the Abysse could not well be
represented by any ceremony. And thus much concerning the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
question, and the true application of our Theory to <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood.</p>

far the Deluge may be lookt upon as the effect of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary

                     <p>WE have now proved our Explication of the Deluge to be
more than an <hi>Idea,</hi> or to be a true piece of Natural Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and it may be the greatest and most remarkable that hath yet
been since the beginning of the World. We have shown it to be
the real account of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood, according to Authority both Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and Humane; and I would willingly proceed one step further,
and declare my thoughts concerning the manner and order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood came to pass; in what method all those things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
and succeeded one another, that make up the History of it,
as causes or effects, or other parts or circumstances: As how the
Ark was born upon the waters, what effect the Rains had, at what
time the Earth broke, and the Abysse was open'd; and what the
condition of the Earth was upon the ending of the Flood, and such
like. But I desire to propose my thoughts concerning these things
only as conjectures, which I will ground as near as I can upon Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
and Reason, and am very willing they should be rectifi'd
where they happen to be amiss. I know how subject we are to
mistakes in these great and remote things, when we descend to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars;
but I am willing to expose the Theory to a full trial, and
to shew the way for any to examine it, provided they do it with
equity and sincerity. I have no other design than to contribute my
endeavours to find out the truth in a subject of so great importance,
and wherein the World hath hitherto had so little satisfaction:
And he that in an obscure argument proposeth an <hi>Hypothesis</hi> that
reacheth from end to end, though it be not exact in every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
'tis not without a good effect; for it gives aim to others to take
their measures better, and opens their invention in a matter which
otherwise, it may be, would have been impenetrable to them: As
he that makes the first way through a thick Forest, though it be
not the streightest and shortest, deserves better, and hath done
more, than he that makes it streighter and smoother afterwards.</p>
                     <p>Providence that ruleth all things and all Ages, after the Earth
had stood above sixteen hundred Years, thought fit to put a period
to that World; and accordingly, it was reveal'd to <hi>Noah,</hi> that for
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41970:45"/>
the wickedness and degeneracy of men, God would destroy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
with the <hi>Earth (Gen. 6. 13.)</hi> in a Deluge of water; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he was commanded, in order to the preserving of Himself
and Family, as a stock for the new World, to build a great Vessel
or Ark, to float upon the waters, and had instructions given him
for the building of it both as to the matter and as to the form.
<hi>Noah</hi> believed the word of God, though against his senses, and all
external appearances, and set himself to work to build an Ark, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the directions given, which after many years labour was
finish'd; whilst the incredulous World, secure enough, as they
thought against a Deluge, continu'd still in their excesses and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies,
and laught at the admonition of <hi>Noah,</hi> and at the folly of
his design of building an extravagant Machine, a floating house, to
save himself from an imaginary Inundation; for they thought it no
less, seeing it was to be in an Earth where there was no Sea, nor
any Rain neither in those parts, according to the ordinary course of
Nature, as shall be shown in the second Book of this Treatise.</p>
                     <p>But when the appointed time was come, the Heavens began to
melt, and the Rains to fall, and these were the first surprizing cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and preparatives to the Deluge; They fell, we suppose, (tho
we do not know how that could proceed from natural causes)
throughout the face of the whole Earth; which could not but have
a considerable effect on that Earth, being even and smooth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Hills and eminencies, and might lay it all under water to some
depth; so as the Ark, if it could not float upon those Rain-waters,
at least taking the advantage of a River, or a Dock or Cistern
made to receive them, it might be a float before the Abysse was
broken open. For I do not suppose the Abysse broken open before
any Rain fell; And when the opening of the Abysse and of the
Flood-gates of Heaven are mention'd together, I am apt to think
those Flood-gates were distinct from the common Rain, and were
something more violent and impetuous. So that there might be
preparatory Rains before the disruption of the Abysse: and I do not
know but those Rains, so covering up and enclosing the Earth on
every side, might providentially contribute to the disruption of
it; not only by softning and weakning the Arch of the Earth in
the bottom of those cracks and Chasms which were made by the
Sun, and which the Rain would first run into, but especially by
stopping on a sudden all the pores of the Earth, and all evaporation,
which would make the vapors within struggle more violently, as we
get a Fever by a Cold; and it may be in that struggle, the Doors and
the Bars were broke, and the great Abysse gusht out, as out of a womb.</p>
                     <p>However, when the Rains were faln, we may suppose the face
of the Earth cover'd over with water; and whether it was these
waters that S. <hi>Peter</hi> refers to, or that of the Abysse afterwards, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell, when he saith in his first Epistle, <hi>Chap. 3. 20. Noah</hi> and his
Family <hi>were sav'd by water;</hi> so as the water which destroy'd the rest
of the World, was an instrument of their conservation, in as much
as it bore up the Ark, and kept it from that impetuous shock,
which it would have had, if either it had stood upon dry land
when the Earth fell, or if the Earth had been dissolv'd without
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41970:45"/>
any water on it or under it. However, things being thus prepar'd,
let us suppose the great frame of the exteriour Earth to have broke
at this time, or the Fountains of the great Abyss, as <hi>Moses</hi> saith, to
have been then open'd, from thence would issue, upon the fall of
the Earth, with an unspeakable violence, such a Flood of waters
as would over-run and overwhelm for a time all those fragments
which the Earth broke into, and bury in one common Grave all
Mankind, and all the Inhabitants of the Earth. Besides, if the
<hi>Flood-gates</hi> of Heaven were any thing distinct from the Forty days
Rain, their effusion, 'tis likely, was at this same time when the
Abyss was broken open; for the sinking of the Earth would make
an extraordinary convulsion of the Regions of the Air, and that
crack and noise that must be in the falling World, and in the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lision
of the Earth and the Abyss, would make a great and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Concussion above, which things together, must needs so shake,
or so squeeze the Atmosphere, as to bring down all the remaining
Vapours; But the force of these motions not being equal through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole Air, but drawing or pressing more in some places
than in other, where the Center of the Convulsion was, there would
be the chiefest collection, and there would fall, not showers of Rain,
or single drops, but great spouts or caskades of water; and this is
that which <hi>Moses</hi> seems to call, not improperly, the <hi>Gataracts</hi> of
Heaven, or the <hi>Windows of Heaven being set open.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus the Flood came to its height; and 'tis not easie to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to our selves this strange Scene of things, when the Deluge was
in its fury and extremity; when the Earth was broken and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
up in the Abyss, whose raging waters rise higher than the
Mountains, and fill'd the Air with broken waves, with an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
mist, and with thick darkness, so as Nature seem'd to be in a
second Chaos; and upon this Chaos rid the distrest Ark, that bore
the small remains of Mankind. No Sea was ever so tumultuous,
as this, nor is there any thing in present Nature to be compar'd
with the disorder of these waters; All the Poetry, and all the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perboles
that are us'd in the description of Storms and raging Seas,
were literally true in this, if not beneath it. The Ark was really
carry'd to the tops of the highest Mountains, and into the places of
the Clouds, and thrown down again into the deepest Gulfs; and to
this very state of the Deluge and of the Ark, which was a Type
of the Church in this World, <hi>David</hi> seems to have alluded in the
name of the Church, <hi>Psal. 42. 7. Abysse calls upon Abysse at the noise of
thy Cataracts or water-spouts; all thy waves and billows have gone over
me.</hi> It was no doubt an extraordinary and miraculous Providence,
that could make a Vessel, so ill man'd, live upon such a Sea; that
kept it from being dasht against the Hills, or overwhelm'd in the
Deeps. That Abyss which had devour'd and swallow'd up whole
Forests of Woods, Cities, and Provinces, nay the whole Earth,
when it had conquer'd all, and triumph'd over all, could not
destroy this single Ship.<note place="margin">Dion. Argonaut. l. 1. v. 47.</note> I remember in the story of the <hi>Argonau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
when <hi>Iason</hi> set out to fetch the Golden Fleece, the Poet saith,
all the Gods that day look'd down from Heaven to view the Ship;
and the <hi>Nymphs</hi> stood upon the Mountain-tops to see the noble Youth
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41970:46"/>
of <hi>Thessaly</hi> pulling at the Oars; We may with more reason suppose
the good Angels to have look'd down upon this Ship of <hi>Noah</hi>'s; and
that not out of couriosity, as idle spectators, but with a passionate
concern for its safety and deliverance. A Ship whose <hi>Cargo</hi> was
no less than a whole World; that carry'd the fortune and hopes
of all posterity, and if this had perish'd, the Earth for any thing
we know, had been nothing but a Desart, a great ruine, a dead
heap of Rubbish, from the Deluge to the Conflagration. But
Death and Hell, the Grave, and Destruction have their bounds.
We may entertain our selves with the consideration of the face of
the Deluge, and of the broken and drown'd Earth, in this Scheme
with the floating Ark, and the guardian Angels.</p>

                        <p>pag. 68.</p>

                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:41970:46"/>
Thus much for the beginning and progress of the Deluge. It
now remains only that we consider it in its decrease, and the state
of the Earth, after the waters were retir'd into their Chanels, which
makes the present state of it. <hi>Moses</hi> saith, God brought a wind
upon the waters, and the tops of the Hills became bare, and then
the lower grounds and Plains by degrees; the waters being sunk
into the Chanels of the Sea, and the hollowness of the Earth, and
the whole Globe appearing in the form it is now under. There
needs nothing be added for explication of this, 'tis the genuine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of the Theory we have given of the Deluge; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this wind was a descending wind to depress and keep down the
swellings and inequalities of the Abyss, or whether it was only to
dry the Land as fast as it appear'd, or might have both effects, I
do not know; But as nothing can be perpetual this is violent, so
this commotion of the Abyss abated after a certain time, and the
great force that impell'd the waters, decreasing, their natural gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
began to take effect, and to reduce them into the lowest places,
at an equal height, and in an even surface, and level one part with
another: That is, in short, the Abyss became our Sea, fixt within
its Chanel,<note place="margin">Iob 38. 10, 11.</note> and bounded by Rocks and Mountains: <hi>Then was the
decreed place establisht for it, and Bars and Doors were set; then was it
said, hitherto shalt thou come, and no further, and here shall thy proud
waves be stopt.</hi> And the Deluge being thus ended, and the waters
setled in their Chanels, the Earth took such a broken Figure as is
represented in those larger Schemes, <hi>p.</hi> 100. And this will be the
form and state of it till its great change comes in the Conflagration,
when we expect <hi>a New Heaven and a New Earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to pursue this prospect of things a little further; we may
easily imagine, that for many years after the Deluge ceast; the face
of the Earth was very different from what it is now, and the Sea
had other bounds than it hath at present. I do not doubt but
the Sea reacht much further in-land, and climb'd higher upon
the sides of the Mountains; And I have observ'd in many places,
a ridge of Mountains some distance from the Sea, and a Plain from
their roots to the shore; which Plain no doubt was formerly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
by the Sea, bounded against those Hills as its first and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Ramparts, or as the ledges or lips of its Vessel. And it seems
probable, that the Sea doth still grow narrower from Age to Age,
and sinks more within its Chanel and the bowels of the Earth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as it can make its way into all those Subterraneous Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and crowd the Air out of them. We see whole Countries of
Land gain'd from it, and by several indications, as ancient Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
left dry and useless, old Sea-marks far within the Land, pieces
of Ships, Anchors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> left at a great distance from the present
shores; from these signs, and such like, we may conclude that the
Sea reach'd many places formerly that now are dry Land, and at
first I believe was generally bound in on either side with a chain of
Mountains. So I should easily imagine the Mediterranean Sea, for
instance, to have been bounded by the continuation of the <hi>Alps</hi>
through <hi>Dauphiné</hi> and <hi>Languedock</hi> to the <hi>Pyreneans,</hi> and at the other
end by the <hi>Darmatick</hi> Mountains almost to the Black Sea. Then
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41970:47"/>
                        <hi>Atlas major</hi> which runs along with the Mediterranean from <hi>Aegypt</hi>
to the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean, and now parts <hi>Barbary</hi> and <hi>Numidia</hi> may
possibly have been the Ancient Barriere on the <hi>Africk</hi> side. And in
our own Island I could easily figure to my self, in many parts of it,
other Sea-bounds than what it hath at present; and the like may be
observ'd in other Countries.</p>
                     <p>And as the Sea had much larger bounds for some time after the
Deluge, so the Land had a different face in many respects to what
it hath now; for we suppose the Valleys and lower grounds,
where the descent and derivation of the water was not so easie, to
have been full of Lakes and Pools for a long time; and those were
often converted into Fens and Bogs, where the ground being spongy,
suckt up the water, and the loosen'd Earth swell'd into a soft and
pappy substance; which would still continue so, if there was any
course of water sensible or insensible, above or within the ground,
that fed this moist place: But if the water stood in a more firm
Basin, or on a soil which for its heaviness or any other reason
would not mix with it, it made a Lake or clear Pool. And we
may easily imagine there were innumerable such Lakes, and Bogs
and fastnesses for many years after the Deluge, till the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to be pretty well stockt with people, and humane industry
cleans'd and drain'd those unfruitful and unhabitable places. And
those Countries that have been later cultivated, or by a lazier
people, retain still, in proportion to their situation and soil, a
greater number of them.</p>
                     <p>Neither is it at all incongruous or inconvenient to suppose, that
the face of the Earth stood in this manner for many years after
the Deluge; for while Mankind was small and few, they needed
but a little ground for their seats or sustenance; and as they grew
more numerous, the Earth proportionably grew more dry, and
more parts of it fit for habitation.<note place="margin">De Leg. li. 3.</note> I easily believe that <hi>Plato</hi>'s ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
or tradition is true, that Men at first, after the Flood,
liv'd in the Up-lands and sides of the mountains, and by degrees
sunk into the Plains and lower Countries, when Nature had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
them for their use, and their numbers requir'd more room.
The History of <hi>Moses</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Gen. 11.</note> that sometime after the Deluge, <hi>Noah</hi>
and his posterity, his Sons and his Grand-children, chang'd their
quarters, and fell down into the Plains of <hi>Shiner,</hi> from the sides of
the Hills where the Ark had rested; and in this Plain was the last
general rendezvous of Mankind; so long they seem to have kept
in a body, and from thence they were divided and broken into
companies, and disperst, first, into the neighbouring Countries, and
then by degrees throughout the whole Earth; the several successive
Generations, like the waves of the Sea when it flows, over-reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one another, and striking out further and further, upon the
face of the Land. Not that the whole Earth was peopled by an
uniform propagation of Mankind every way, from one place, as
a common center: like the swelling of a Lake upon a Plain: for
sometimes they shot out in length, like Rivers: and sometimes they
shew into remote Countreys in Colonies, like swarms from the
Hive, and setled there, leaving many places uninhabited betwixt
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41970:47"/>
them and their first home. Sea-shores and Islands were generally
the last places inhabited: for while the memory or story of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
was fresh amongst them, they did not care for coming so near
their late Enemy: or, at least, to be enclos'd and surrounded by his
forces.</p>
                     <p>And this may be sufficient to have discours'd concerning all the
parts of the Deluge, and the restitution of the Earth to an habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
form, for the further union of our Theory with the History of
<hi>Moses;</hi> There rests only one thing in that History to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, which may be thought possibly not to agree so well with
our account of the Deluge; namely, that <hi>Moses</hi> seems to shut up
the Abysse again at the end of the Deluge, which our Explication
supposeth to continue open. But besides that half the Abysse is still
really cover'd, <hi>Moses</hi> saith the same thing of the <hi>windows of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
that they were shut up too; and he seemeth in both to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
only the cessation of the Effect which proceeded from their
opening: For as <hi>Moses</hi> had ascrib'd the Deluge to the opening of
these two, so when it was to cease, he saith, these two were shut
up; as they were really put into such a condition, both of them,
that they could not continue the Deluge any longer, nor over be
the occasion of a second; and therefore in that sence, and as to that
effect were for ever shut up. Some may possibly make that also an
Objection against us, that <hi>Moses</hi> mentions and supposes the <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>
at the Deluge, for he saith, the waters reached fifteen Cubits
above the tops of them; whereas we suppose the Ante-diluvian
Earth to have had a plain and uniform surface, without any inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Hills and Valleys. But this is easily answer'd, 'twas in the
height of the Deluge that <hi>Moses</hi> mention'd the Mountains, and we
suppose them to have risen then or more towards the beginning of
it, when the Earth was broke; and these Mountains continuing
still upon the face of the Earth, <hi>Moses</hi> might very well take them
for a standard to measure and express to Posterity the height of the
waters, though they were not upon the Earth when the Deluge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.
Neither is there any mention made, as is observ'd by some, of
Mountains in Scripture, or of Rain, till the time of the Deluge.</p>
                     <p>We have now finisht our account of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood, both general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and particularly; and I have not wittingly omitted or conceal'd
any difficulty that occur'd to me, either from the History, or from
abstract reason: Our Theory, so far as I know, hath the consent
and authority of both: And how far it agrees and is demonstrable
from natural observation, or from the form and <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of this
Earth, as it lies at present, shall be the subject of the remaining
part of this First Book. In the mean time I do not know any thing
more to be added in this part, unless it be to conclude with an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement
to prevent any mistake or misconstruction, as if this
Theory, by explaining the Deluge in a natural way, in a great
measure, or, by natural causes, did detract from the power of God,
by which that great judgment was brought upon the World in a
Providential and miraculous manner.</p>
                     <p>To satisfie all reasonable and intelligent persons in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
I answer and declare, first, That we are far from excluding
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41970:48"/>
Divine Providence, either ordinary or extraordinary, from the
causes and conduct of the Deluge. I know a Sparrow doth not
fall to the ground without the will of our Heavenly Father, much
less doth the great World fall in pieces without his good pleasure
and superintendency. In him all things live, move, and have their
being; Things that have Life and Thought have it from him, he is
the Fountain of both: Things that have motion only, without
Thought, have it also from him: And what hath only naked
Being, without Thought or Motion, owe still that Being to
him. And these are not only deriv'd from God at first, but every
moment continued and conserv'd by him. So intimate and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
is the dependance of all things upon the Divine Will and
Power.</p>
                     <p>In the second place, they are guilty, in my Judgment, of a great
Error or indiscretion, that oppose the course of Nature to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
St. <hi>Paul</hi> says <hi>(Act. 14. 17.)</hi> God hath not left us without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
in that he <hi>gives us Rain from Heaven;</hi> yet Rains proceed from
natural causes, and fall upon the Sea as well as upon the Land. In
like manner,<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 21.</note> our Saviour makes those things instances of Divine
Providence, which yet come to pass in an ordinary course of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
In that part of his excellent Sermon upon the Mount, that
concerns Providence.<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 24.</note> He bids them <hi>Consider the Lilies how they grow,
they toil not, neither do they spin, and yet</hi> Solomon <hi>in all his glory was
not arrayed like one of these;</hi> He bids them also <hi>consider the Ravens,
they neither sow nor reap, neither have they Store-house nor Barn, and God
feedeth them.</hi> The Lilies grow, and the Ravens are fed according
to the ordinary course of Nature, and yet they are justly made ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
of Providence by our Saviour; nor are these things less
Providential, because constant and regular; on the contrary, such
a disposition or establishment of second causes, as will in the best
order, and for a long succession, produce the most regular effects,
assisted only with the ordinary concourse of the first cause, is a
greater argument of wisdom and contrivance, than such a disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of causes as will not in so good an order, or for so long a time
produce regular effects, without an extraordinary concourse and
interposition of the First cause. This, I think, is clear to every man's
judgment. We think him a better Artist that makes a Clock that
strikes regularly at every hour from the Springs and Wheels which
he puts in the work, than he that hath so made his Clock that he
must put his finger to it every hour to make it strike: And if one
should contrive a piece of Clock-work so that it should beat all the
hours, and make all its motions regularly for such a time, and that
time being come, upon a signal given, or a Spring toucht, it should
of its own accord fall all to pieces; would not this be look'd upon
as a piece of greater Art, than if the Workman came at that time
prefixt, and with a great Hammer beat it into pieces? I use these
comparisons to convince us, that it is no detraction from Divine
Providence, that the course of Nature is exact and regular, and
that even in its greatest changes and revolutions it should still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire
and be prepar'd to answer the ends and purposes of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Will in reference to the <hi>Moral</hi> World. This seems to me to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41970:48"/>
the great Art of Divine Providence, so to adjust the two Worlds,
Humane and Natural, Material and Intellectual, as seeing thorough
the possibilities and futuritions of each, according to the first state
and circumstances he puts them under, they should all along cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respond
and fit one another, and especially in their great Crises
and Periods.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Besides the ordinary Providence of God in the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
course of Nature, there is doubtless an extraordinary Providence
that doth attend the greater Scenes and the greater revolutions of
Nature. This methinks, besides all other proof from the Effects, is
very rational and necessary in it self; for it would be a limitation
of the Divine Power and Will so to be bound up to second causes,
as never to use, upon occasion, an extraordinary influence or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection:
And 'tis manifest, taking any Systeme of Natural causes, if
the best possible, that there may be more and greater things done,
if to this, upon certain occasions you joyn an extraordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
And as we have taken notice before, that there was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Providence in the formation or composition of the
first Earth, so I believe there was also in the dissolution of it; And
I think it had been impossible for the Ark to have liv'd upon the
raging Abyss, or for <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family to have been preserv'd,
if there had not been a miraculous hand of Providence to take
care of them. But 'tis hard to separate and distinguish an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
and extraordinary Providence in all cases, and to mark just
how far one goes, and where the other begins. And writing a
Theory of the Deluge here, as we do, we were to exhibit a Series
of causes whereby it might be made intelligible, or to shew the
proximate Natural Causes of it; wherein we follow the example
both of <hi>Moses</hi> and S. <hi>Peter;</hi> and with the same veneration of the
Divine Power and Wisdom in the government of Nature, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
ordinary Providence, and an occasional extraordinary.</p>
                     <p>So much for the Theory of the Deluge, and the second Section
of this Discourse.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="9" type="chapter">
                     <head>CHAP. IX.</head>
                     <head type="sub">The Second Part of this Discourse, proving the same Theory
from the Effects and present form of the Earth. First, by
a general Scheme of what is most remarkable in this Globe,
and then by a more particular Induction; beginning with
an Account of Subterraneous Cavities and Subterraneous
Waters.</head>
                     <p>WE have now finisht our explication of the Universal Deluge,
and given an account, not only of the possibility of it, but
(so far as our knowledge can reach) of its Causes; and of that
form and structure of the Earth, whereby the <hi>Old World</hi> was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to that sort of Fate. We have not beg'd any Principles
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41970:49"/>
or Suppositions for the proof of this, but taking that common
ground, which both <hi>Moses</hi> and all Antiquity presents to us, <hi>viz.
That this Earth rose from a Chaos;</hi> We have from that deduc'd, by
an easie train of consequences, what the first Form of it would be;
and from that Form, as from a nearer ground, we have by a second
train of consequences made it appear, that at some time or other
that first Earth would be subject to a dissolution, and by that disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to a Deluge. And thus far we have proceeded only by the
intuition of Causes, as is most proper to a Theory; but for the
satisfaction of those that require more sensible arguments, and to
compleat our proofs on either hand, we will now argue from the
Effects; and from the present state of Nature, and the present form
of the Earth, prove that it hath been broken, and undergone such
a dissolution as we have already describ'd, and made the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
occasion of the Deluge. And that we may do this more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuously
and distinctly, we will lay down this Proposition to be
prov'd, <hi>viz. That the present form and structure of the Earth, both as to
the surface and as to the Interiour parts of it, so far as they are known
and accessible to us, doth exactly answer to our Theory concerning the form
and dissolution of the first Earth, and cannot be explain'd upon any other
Hypothesis yet known.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Oratours and Philosophers treat Nature after a very different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
Those represent her with all her graces and ornaments, and
if there be any thing that is not capable of that, they dissemble it,
or pass it over slightly. But Philosophers view Nature with a
more impartial eye, and without favour or prejudice give a just
and free account, how they find all the parts of the Universe, some
more, some less perfect. And as to this Earth in particular, if I
was to describe it as an Oratour, I would suppose it a beautiful and
regular Globe, and not only so, but that the whole Universe was
made for its sake; that it was the darling and favourite of Heaven,
that the Sun shin'd only to give it light, to ripen its Fruit, and
make fresh its Flowers; and that the great Concave of the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and all the Stars in their several Orbs, were design'd only
for a spangled Cabinet to keep this Jewel in. This <hi>Idea</hi> I would
give of it as an Oratour; But a Philosopher that overheard me,
would either think me in jest, or very injudicious, if I took the
Earth for a body so regular in it self, or so considerable, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
with the rest of the Universe. This, he would say, is to make
the great World like one of the Heathen Temples, a beautiful and
magnificent structure, and of the richest materials, yet built only
for a little brute Idol, a Dog, or a Crocodile, or some deformed
Creature, plac'd in a corner of it.</p>
                     <p>We must therefore be impartial where the Truth requires it, and
describe the Earth as it is really in it self; and though it be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and regular enough to the eye in certain parts of it, single
tracts and single Regions; yet if we consider the whole surface
of it, or the whole Exteriour Region, 'tis as a broken and confus'd
heap of bodies, plac'd in no order to one another, nor with any
correspondency or regularity of parts: And such a body as the Moon
appears to us, when 'tis look'd upon with a good Glass, rude and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41970:49"/>
ragged; as it is also represented in the modern Maps of the Moon;
such a thing would the Earth appear if it was seen from the Moon.
They are both in my judgment the image or picture of a great Ruine,<note place="margin">Vid. Fig. p. 100.</note>
and have the true aspect of a World lying in its rubbish.</p>
                     <p>Our Earth is first divided into Sea and Land, without any regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity
in the portions, either of the one or the other; In the Sea lie
the Islands, scatter'd like limbs torn from the rest of the body;
great Rocks stand rear'd up in the waters; The Promontories and
Capes shoot into the Sea, and the Sinus's and Creeks on the other
hand run as much into the Land; and these without any order or
uniformity. Upon the other part of our Globe stand great heaps
of Earth or stone, which we call Mountains; and if these were
all plac'd together, they would take up a very considerable part of
the dry Land; In the rest of it are lesser Hills, Valleys, Plains,
Lakes, and Marishes, Sands and Desarts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and these also with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any regular disposition. Then the inside of the Earth, or
inward parts of it, are generally broken or hollow, especially about
the Mountains and high Lands, as also towards the shores of the
Sea, and among the Rocks. How many Holes and Caverns, and
strange Subterraneous passages do we see in many Countries; and
how many more may we easily imagine, that are unknown and
unaccessible to us?</p>
                     <p>This is the pourtraicture of our Earth, drawn without flattery;
and as oddly as it looks, it will not be at all surprising to one that
hath consider'd the foregoing Theory; For 'tis manifest enough,
that upon the dissolution of the first Earth, and its fall into the
Abyss, this very face and posture of things, which we have now
describ'd, or something extremely like it, would immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult.
The Sea would be open'd, and the face of the Globe would
be divided into Land and Water: And according as the fragments
fell, some would make Islands or Rocks in the Sea, others would
make Mountains or Plains upon the Land; and the Earth would
generally be full of Caverns and hollownesse, especially in the
Mountainous parts of it. And we see the resemblance and imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this in lesser ruines, when a Mountain sinks and falls into
Subterraneous water; or which is more obvious, when the Arch
of a Bridge is broken, and falls into the water, if the water under
it be not so deep as to overflow and cover all its parts, you may see
there the image of all these things in little Continents, and Islands,
and Rocks under water: And in the parts that stand above the
water, you see Mountains, and Precipices, and Plains and most
of the varieties that we see and admire in the parts of the Earth.
What need we then seek any further for the Explication of these
things? Let us suppose this Arch of the Bridge, as the great Arch
of the Earth, which once it had, and the water under it as the
Abyss, and the parts of this ruine to represent the parts of the
Earth; There will be scarce any difference but of lesser and greater,
the same things appearing in both. But we have naturally that
weakness or prejudice, that we think great things are not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
from easie and familiar instances; We think there must be
something difficult and operose in the explication of them, or else
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41970:50"/>
we are not satisfied; whether it is that we are asham'd to see our
ignorance and admiration to have been so groundless, or whether
we fancy there must be a proportion between the difficulty of the
explication, and the greatness of the thing explain'd; but that is a
very false Judgment, for let things be never so great, if they be
simple, their explication must be simple and easie; And on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
some things that are mean, common, and ordinary, may
depend upon causes very difficult to find out; for the difficulty of
explaining an effect doth not depend upon its greatness or littleness,
but upon the simplicity or composition of its causes. And the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
and <hi>Phaenomena</hi> we are here to explain, though great, yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
upon causes very simple, you must not wonder if the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
when found out; be familiar and very intelligible.</p>
                     <p>And this is so intelligible, and so easily deducible from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
causes, that a Man born blind or brought up all his
life in a Cave, that had never seen the face of the Earth, nor ever
heard any description of it, more than that it was a great Globe,
having this Theory propos'd to him, or being instructed what the
form of the first Earth was, how it stood over the waters, and then
how it was broke and fell into them, he would easily of his own
accord foretel what changes would arise upon this dissolution;
and what the new form of the Earth would be. As in the first
place he would tell you, that this second Earth would be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd
and checker'd into Land and Water; for the Orb which
fell being greater than the circumference it fell upon, all the frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
could not fall flat and lie drown'd under water; and those
that stood above, would make the dry Land or habitable part of
the Earth. Then in the second place, he would plainly discern
that these fragments that made the dry Land, could not lie all plain
and smooth and equal, but some would be higher and some lower,
some in one posture and some in another, and consequently would
make Mountains, Hills, Valleys, and Plains, and all other varieties
we have in the situation of the parts of the Earth. And lastly, a
blind man would easily divine that such a great ruine could not
happen but there would be a great many holes and cavities amongst
the parts of it, a great many intervals and empty places in the rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish,
as I may so say; for this we see happens in all ruines more or
less; and where the fragments are great and hard, 'tis not possible
they should be so adjusted in their fall, but that they would lie
hollow in many places, and many unfill'd spaces would be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
amongst them; some gaping in the surface of the Earth,
and others hid within; so as this would give occasion to all sorts
of fractures and cavities either in the skin of the Earth, or within
its body. And these Cavities, that I may add that in the last place,
would be often fill'd with Subterraneous waters, at least at such a
depth; for the foundations of the Earth standing now within the
waters, so high as those waters reach'd they would more or less
propagate themselves every way.</p>
                     <p>Thus far our Blind man could tell us what the New World
would be, or the form of the Earth upon the great dissolution;
and we find his reasonings and inferences very true, these are the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41970:50"/>
chief lineaments and features of our Earth; which appear indeed
very irregular and very inaccountable when they are lookt upon
naked in themselves, but if we look upon them through this
Theory, we see as in a glass all the reasons and causes of them.
There are different Genius's of Men, and different conceptions, and
every one is to be allow'd their liberty as to things of this nature;
I confess, for my own part, when I observe how easily and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> doth apply it self to the general face of this
Earth, hits and falls in so luckily and surprizingly with all the
odd postures of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s parts, I cannot, without violence, bear off my
mind from fully assenting to it: And the more odd and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant,
as I may so say, and the more diversify'd the effects and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
are, to which an <hi>Hypothesis</hi> is to be apply'd, if it answers
them all and with exactness, it comes the nearer to a moral certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and infallibility. As a Lock that consists of a great deal of
workmanship, many Wards, and many odd pieces and contrivances,
if you find a Key that answers to them all, and opens it readily,
'tis a thousand to one that 'tis the true Key, and was made for that
purpose.</p>
                     <p>An eminent Philosopher of this Age, <hi>Monsteur des Cartes,</hi> hath
made use of the like <hi>Hypothesis</hi> to explain the irregular form of the
present Earth; though he never dream'd of the Deluge, nor
thought that first Orb built over the Abyss, to have been any more
than a transient crust, and not a real habitable World that lasted
for more than sixteen hundred years, as we suppose it to have been.
And though he hath, in my opinion, in the formation of that first
Orb, and upon the dissolution of it, committed some great over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sights,<note place="margin">C. 7. &amp; lib. 2. c. 4.</note>
whereof we have given an account in the Latin Treatise;
however he saw a necessity of such a thing, and of the disruption
of it, to bring the Earth into that form and posture wherein we
now find it.</p>
                     <p>Thus far we have spoken in general concerning the agreement
and congruity of our supposition with the present face of the Earth,
and the easie account it gives of the causes of it. And though I
believe to ingenuous persons that are not prejudic'd by the forms
and opinions of the Schools against every thing that looks like a
novelty or invention, thus much might be sufficient; yet for the
satisfaction of all, we will, as a farther proof of our Theory, or
that part of it which concerns the dissolution of the Earth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
to particular explication of three or four of the most consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and remarkable things that occur in the fabrick of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Earth; namely, <hi>The great Chanel of the Ocean; Subterraneous
Cavities and Subterraneous Waters;</hi> and lastly, <hi>Mountains and Rocks.</hi>
These are the wonders of the Earth as to the visible frame of it;
and who would not be pleas'd to see a rational account of these?
of their Origin, and of their properties; Or who would not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of an <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> when they see that Nature in her greatest
and strangest works may easily be understood by it, and is in no
other way, that we know of, intelligible.</p>
                     <p>We will speak first of Subterraneous Cavities and Waters, because
they will be of easier dispatch, and an introduction to the rest.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="78" facs="tcp:41970:51"/>
That the inside of the Earth is hollow and broken in many places,
and is not one firm and united mass, we have both the Testimony
of Sence and of easie Observations to prove: How many Caves
and Dens and hollow passages into the ground do we see in many
Countries, especially amongst Mountains and Rocks; and some of
them endless and bottomless so far as can be discover'd. We have
many of these in our own Island, in <hi>Derbishire, Somersetshire, Wales,</hi>
and other Counties, and in every Continent or Island they abound
more or less. These hollownesses of the Earth the Ancients made
prisons, or storehouses for the Winds, and set a God over them
to confine them, or let them loose at his pleasure. For some Ages
after the Flood, as all Antiquity tells us, These were the first houses
men had, at least in some parts of the Earth; here rude mortals
shelter'd themselves, as well as they could, from the injuries of the
Air, till they were beaten out by wild beasts that took possession of
them. The Ancient Oracles also us'd to be given out of these Vaults
and recesses under ground, the <hi>Sibyls</hi> had their Caves, and the <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick</hi>
Oracle, and their Temples sometimes were built upon an hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Rock. Places that are strange and solemn strike an awe into
us, and incline us to a kind of superstitious timidity and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and therefore they thought them fit for the seats and residen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of their Deities. They fansied also that steams rise sometimes,
or a sort of Vapour in those hollow places, that gave a kind of
Divine fury or inspiration. But all these uses and employments are
now in a great measure worn out, we know no use of them but to
make the places talkt on where they are, to be the wonders of the
Countrey, to please our curiosity to gaze upon and admire; but we
know not how they came, nor to what purpose they were made
at first.</p>
                     <p>It would be very pleasant to read good descriptions of these Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
places, and of all the strange works of Nature there;
how she furnisheth these dark neglected Grottoes; they have often a
little Brook runs murmuring through them, and the roof is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
a kind of petrefied Earth or Icy fret-work; proper enough for
such rooms. But I should be pleas'd especially to view the Sea-caves, or
those hollow Rocks that lie upon the Sea, where the waves Roll in
a great way under ground, and wear the hard Rock into as many
odd shapes and figures as we see in the Clouds. 'Tis pleasant also
to see a River in the middle of its course throw itself into the mouth
of a Cave, or an opening of the Earth, and run under ground some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
many miles; still pursuing its way through the dark pipes of
the Earth, till at last it find an out-let. There are many of these Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
taken notice of in History in the several parts of the Earth, as
the <hi>Rhone</hi> in <hi>France, Guadiana</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and several in <hi>Greece, Alpheus,
Lycus,</hi> and <hi>Erasinus;</hi> then <hi>Niger</hi> in <hi>Africa, Tigris</hi> in <hi>Asia, &amp;c.</hi> And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
if we could turn <hi>Derwent,</hi> or any other River into one of the
holes of the Peak, it would groap its way till it found an issue, it
may be in some other Country. These Subterraneous Rivers that
emerge again, shew us that the holes of the Earth are longer and
reach farther than we imagine, and if we could see into the ground,
as we ride or walk, we should be affrighted to see so often Waters
or Caverns under us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:41970:51"/>
But to return to our dry Caves; these commonly stand high,
and are sometimes of a prodigious greatness:<note place="margin">Geo. l. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>Strabo</hi> mentions some
in the Mountains towards <hi>Arabia,</hi> that are capable to receive four
thousand men at once.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 24. 3, 4.</note> The Cave of <hi>Engedi</hi> hid <hi>David</hi> and six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
men, so as <hi>Saul,</hi> when he was in the mouth of it, did not
perceive them. In the Mountains of the <hi>Traconites</hi> there are many
of these vast dens and recesses, and the people of that Country de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
themselves a long time in those strong Holds against <hi>Herod</hi>
and his Army; They are plac'd among such craggy Rocks and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices,
that,<note place="margin">Ant. Iud. l. 14. ch. 27.</note> as <hi>Iosephus</hi> tells us, <hi>Herod</hi> was forc'd to make a sort
of open chests, and in those by chains of Iron he let down his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
from the top of the Mountains to go fight them in their dens.
I need add no more instances of this kind; In the Natural History
of all Countries, or the Geographical descriptions of them, you
find such places taken notice of, more or less; yet if there was a
good collection made of the chief of them in several parts, it might
be of use, and would make us more sensible how broken and torn
the body of the Earth is.</p>
                     <p>There are Subterraneous Cavities of another nature, and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
which they call <hi>Volcano</hi>'s, or fiery Mountains; that belch
out flames and smoke and ashes, and sometimes great stones and
broken Rocks, and lumps of Earth, or some metallick mixture;
and throw them to an incredible distance by the force of the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
These argue great vacuities in the bowels of the Earth, and
magazines of combustible matter treasur'd up in them. And as the
Exhalations within these places must be copious, so they must lie in
long Mines or Trains to do so great execution, and to last so long.
'Tis scarce credible what is reported concerning some eruptions of
<hi>Vesuvius</hi> and <hi>Aetna.</hi> The Eruptions of <hi>Vesuvius</hi> seem to be more
frequent and less violent of late; The flame and smoke break out
at the top of the Mountain, where they have eaten away the ground
and made a great hollow, so as it looks at the top, when you stand
upon the brimes of it, like an <hi>Amphitheater,</hi> or like a great Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron,
about a mile in circumference, and the burning Furnace
lies under it. The outsides of the Mountain is all spread with
Ashes, but the inside much more; for you wade up to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg
in Ashes to go down to the bottom of the Cavity, and 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
heavy and troublesome to get up again. The inside lies
sloping, and one may safely go down if it be not in a raging fit;
but the middle part of it or center, which is a little rais'd like the
bottom of a Platter, is not to be ventur'd upon, the ground there
lies false and hollow, there it always smoaks, and there the Funnel
is suppos'd to be; yet there is no visible hole or gaping any where
when it doth not rage. <hi>Naples</hi> stands below in fear of this fiery
Mountain, which hath often cover'd its Streets and Palaces with
its Ashes; and in sight of the Sea (which lies by the side of them
both) and as it were in defiance to it, threatens at one time or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to burn that fair City. History tells us, that some eruptions
of <hi>Vesuvius</hi> have carry'd Cinders and Ashes as far as <hi>Constantinople;</hi>
this is attested both by <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Authors; particularly, that
they were so affrighted with these Ashes and darkness, that the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41970:52"/>
Emperor left the City, and there was a day observ'd yearly for a
memorial of this calamity or prodigy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aetna</hi> is of greater same than <hi>Vesuvius,</hi> and of greater fury, all
Antiquity speaks of it; not only the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> but as far
as History reacheth, either real or fabulous, there is something re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
of the Fires of <hi>Aetna.</hi> The Figure of the Mountain is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant,
by reason of the great consumptions and ruines it is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to; The Fires and Aestuations of it are excellently describ'd by
<hi>Virgil,</hi> upon occasion of <hi>Aeneas</hi> his passing by those Coasts.

and Southern parts of the Earth, there are some of these
<hi>Volcano's,</hi> which are sensible evidences that the Earth is incompact
and full of Caverns; besides the roarings, and bellowings that use
to be heard before an eruption of these <hi>Volcano's,</hi> argue some dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
hollowness in the belly or under the roots of the Mountain,
where the Exhalations struggle before they can break their Prison.</p>
                     <p>The Subterraneous Cavities that we have spoke of hitherto, are
such as are visible in the surface of the Earth, and break the skin
by some gaping Orifice; but the Miners and those that work under
ground meet with many more in the bowels of the Earth, that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41970:52"/>
never reach to the top of it; Burrows, and Chanels, and Clefts,
and Caverns; that never had the comfort of one beam of light
since the great fall of the Earth. And where we think the ground
is firm and solid, as upon Heaths and Downs, it often betrays its
hollowness, by sounding under the Horses feet and the Chariot-wheels
that pass over it. We do not know when and where we
stand upon good ground, if it was examin'd deep enough; and to
make us further sensible of this, we will instance in two things that
argue the unsoundness and hollowness of the Earth in the inward
recesses of it, though the surface be intire and unbroken; These
are <hi>Earthquakes</hi> and the communication of <hi>Subterraneous waters and
Seas:</hi> Of which two we will speak a little more particularly.</p>
                     <p>Earthquakes are too evident demonstrations of the hollowness of
the Earth, being the dreadful effects or consequences of it; for if the
body of the Earth was sound and compact, there would be no such
thing in Nature as an Earthquake. They are commonly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with an heavy dead found, like a dull thunder which ariseth
from the Vapours that are striving in the womb of Nature when
her throes are coming upon her. And that these Caverns where
the Vapours lie are very large and capacious, we are taught
sometimes by sad experience; for whole Cities and Countries have
been swallow'd up into them, as <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of <hi>Pentapolis,</hi> and several Cities in <hi>Greece,</hi> and in <hi>Asia,</hi> and
other parts. Whole Islands also have been thus absort in an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake;
the pillars and props they stood upon being broken, they
have sunk and faln in as an house blown up. I am also of opinion
that those Islands that are made by divulsion from a Continent, as
<hi>Sicily</hi> was broken off from <hi>Italy,</hi> and Great <hi>Britain,</hi> as some think,
from <hi>France,</hi> have been made the same way; that is, the Isthmus
or necks of Land that joyn'd these Islands with their Continents
before, have been hollow, and being either worn by the water,
or shak'd by an Earthquake, have sunk down, and so made way for
the Sea to overflow them, and of a Promontory to make an Island.
For it is not at all likely that the neck of Land continu'd standing,
and the Sea overflow'd it, and so made an Island; for then all those
passages between such Islands, and their respective Continents
would be extremely shallow and unnavigable, which we do not
find them to be. Nor is it any more wonder if such a neck of Land
should fall, than that a Mountain should sink, or any other Tract
of Land, and a Lake rise in its place, which hath often happen'd,
<hi>Plato</hi> supposeth his <hi>Atlantis</hi> to have been greater than <hi>Asia</hi> and
<hi>Africa</hi> together, and yet to have sunk all into the Sea; whether
that be true or no, I do not think it impossible that some arms of
the Sea or Sinus's might have had such an original as that; and I
am very apt to think, that for some years after the Deluge, till the
fragments were well setled and adjusted, great alterations would
happen as to the face of the Sea and the Land; many of the
fragments would change their posture, and many would sink into
the water that stood out before, the props failing that bore them
up, or the joynts and corners whereby they lean'd upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and thereupon a new face of things would arise, and a new
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41970:53"/>
Deluge for that part of the Earth. Such removes and interchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
I believe, would often happen in the first Ages after the Flood;
as we see in all other ruines there happen lesser and secondary
ruines after the first, till the parts be so well pois'd and setled, that
without some violence they scarce change their posture any more.</p>
                     <p>But to return to our Earthquakes, and to give an instance or
two of their extent and violence: <hi>Pliny</hi> mentions one in the Reign
of <hi>Tiberius Caesar</hi> that struck down Twelve Cities of <hi>Asia</hi> in one
night. And <hi>Fournier</hi> gives us an account of one in <hi>Peru,</hi> that reacht
three hundred leagues along the Sea-shore, and seventy leagues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
and level'd the Mountains all along as it went, threw down
the Cities, turn'd the Rivers out of their Chanels, and made an
universal havock and confusion; And all this, he saith, was done
within the space of seven or eight minutes. There must be dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Vaults and Mines under that Continent, that gave passage to
the Vapours, and liberty to play for nine hundred miles in length,
and above two hundred in breadth. <hi>Asia</hi> also hath been very sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to these desolations by Earthquakes; and many parts in <hi>Europe,</hi>
as <hi>Greece, Italy,</hi> and others. The truth is, our Cities are built upon
ruines, and our Fields and Countries stand upon broken Arches
and Vaults, and so does the greatest part of the outward frame
of the Earth, and therefore it is no wonder if it be often shaken;
there being quantities of Exhalations within these Mines, or
Cavernous passages, that are capable of rarefaction and inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and, upon such occasions, requiring more room, they shake
or break the ground that covers them. And thus much concerning
Earthquakes.</p>
                     <p>A second observation that argues the hollowness of the Earth,
is the communication of the Seas and Lakes under ground. The
<hi>Caspian</hi> and <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Seas, and several Lakes, receive into
them great Rivers, and yet have no visible out let: These must
have Subterraneous out-lets, by which they empty themselves,
otherwise they would redound and overflow the brims of their
Vessel. The <hi>Mediterranean</hi> is most remarkable in this kind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
'tis observ'd that at one end the great Ocean flows into it
through the straits of <hi>Gibralter,</hi> with a sensible current, and towards
the other end about <hi>Constantinople</hi> the <hi>Pontus</hi> flows down into it
with a stream so strong, that Vessels have much ado to stem it;
and yet it neither hath any visible evacuation or out-let, nor
over-flows its banks. And besides that it is thus fed at either end,
it is sed by the navel too, as I may so say; it sucks in, by their
Chanels, several Rivers into its belly, whereof the <hi>Nile</hi> is one very
great and considerable. These things have made it a great Problem,
<hi>What becomes of the water of the Mediterranean Sea?</hi> And for my
part, I think, the solution is very easie, namely, that it is discharg'd
by Subterraneous passages, or convey'd by Chanels under the ground
into the Ocean. And this manner of discharge or conveyance is
not peculiar to the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> but is common to it with the
<hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, and other Seas and Lakes, that receive great Rivers
into them, and have no visible issue.</p>

                        <pb n="83" facs="tcp:41970:53"/>
I know there have been propos'd several other ways to answer
this difficulty concerning the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>flux or consumption of the waters
of the <hi>Mediterranean;</hi> some have suppos'd a double current in the
strait of <hi>Gibralter,</hi> one that carry'd the water in, and another that
brought it out; like the Arteries and Veins in our Body, the one
exporting our bloud from the heart, and the other re-importing it:
So they suppos'd one current upon the surface, which carry'd the
water into the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> and under it at a certain depth a
counter-current, which brought the water back into the Ocean. But
this hath neither proof nor foundation; for unless it was included
in pipes, as our bloud is, or consisted of liquors very different,
these cross currents would mingle and destroy one another. Others
are of opinion, that all the water that flows into the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi>
or a quantity equal to it, is consum'd in Exhalations every day:
This seems to be a bolder supposition than the other, for if so much
be consum'd in Vapours and Exhalations every day as flows into
this Sea, what if this Sea had an out-let, and discharg'd by that,
every day, as much as it receiv'd; in a few days the Vapours
would have consum'd all the rest; and yet we see many Lakes that
have as free an out-let as an in-let, and are not consum'd, or sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
diminisht by the Vapours. Besides, This Reason is a Summer-reason,
and would pass very ill in Winter, when the heat of the
Sun is much less powerful: At least there would be a very sensible
difference betwixt the height of the waters in Summer and Winter,
if so much was consum'd every day as this Explication supposeth.
And the truth is, this want of a visible out-let is not a property
belonging only to the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, as we noted before, but
is also in other Seas and great Lakes, some lying in one Climate
and some in another, where there is no reason to suppose such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
Exhalations; and though 'tis true some Rivers in <hi>Africk,</hi> and
in others parts of the Earth, are thus exhal'd and dry'd up, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ever flowing into the Sea (as were all the Rivers in the first Earth)
yet this is where the sands and parch'd ground suck up a great part
of them; the heat of the Climate being excessively strong, and the
Chanel of the River growing shallower by degrees, and, it may be,
divided into lesser branches and rivulets; which are causes that
take no place here. And therefore we must return to our first reason,
which is universal, for all seasons of the Year and all Climates; and
seeing we are assur'd that there are Subterraneous Chanels and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages,
for Rivers often fall into the ground, and sometimes rise again,
and sometimes never return; why should we doubt to ascribe this
effect to so obvious a cause? Nay, I believe the very Ocean doth
evacuate it self by Subterraneous out-lets; for considering what a
prodigious mass of water falls into it every day from the wide
mouths of all the Rivers of the Earth, it must have out-lets propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable;
and those <hi>Syrtes</hi> or great Whirlpools that are constant in
certain parts or Sinus's of the Sea, as upon the Coast of <hi>Norway</hi> and
of <hi>Italy,</hi> arise probably from Subterraneous out-lets in those places,
whereby the water sinks, and turns, and draws into it whatsoever
comes within such a compass; and if there was no issue at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
though it might by contrary currents turn things round with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41970:54"/>
in its Sphere, yet there is no reason from that why it should suck
them down to the bottom. Neither does it seem improbable, that
the currents of the Sea are from these in-draughts, and that there is
always a submarine in-let in some part of them, to make a circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Waters. But thus much for the Subterraneous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of Seas and Lakes.</p>
                     <p>And thus much in general concerning Subterraneous Cavities,
and concerning the hollow and broken frame of the Earth. If I
had now Magick enough to show you at one view all the inside
of the Earth, which we have imperfectly describ'd; if we could go
under the roots of the Mountains, and into the sides of the broken
rocks; or could dive into the Earth with one of those Rivers that
sink under ground, and follow its course and all its windings till
it rise again, or led us to the Sea, we should have a much stronger
and more effectual <hi>Idea</hi> of the broken form of the Earth, than any
we can excite by these faint descriptions collected from Reason.
The Ancients I remember us'd to represent these hollow Caves
and Subterraneous Regions in the nature of a <hi>World</hi> under-ground,
and suppos'd it inhabited by the <hi>Nymphs</hi> especially the <hi>Nymphs</hi> of
the waters and the Sea-Goddesses; so <hi>Orpheus</hi> sung of old; and in
imitation of him <hi>Virgil</hi> hath made a description of those Regions;
feigning the Nymph <hi>Cyrene</hi> to send for her son to come down to her,
and make her a visit in those shades where mortals were not admitted.

If we now could open the Earth as this <hi>Nymph</hi> did the Water,
and go down into the bosom of it: see all the dark Chambers and
Apartments there, how ill contriv'd, and how ill kept: so many
holes and corners, some fill'd with smoak and fire, some with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and some with vapours and mouldy Air; how like a ruine it
lies gaping and torn in the parts of it? we should not easily believe
that God created it into this form immediately out of nothing;
It would have cost no more to have made things in better order;
nay, it had been more easie and more simple; and accordingly we
are assured that all things were made at first in Beauty and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And if we consider Nature and the manner of the first for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Earth, 'tis evident that there could be no such holes
and Caverns, nor broken pieces, made then in the body of it; for
the grosser parts of the Chaos falling down towards the Center,
they would there compose a mass of Earth uniform and compact,
the water swimming above it; and this first mass under the water
could have no Caverns or vacuities in it; for if it had had any,
the Earthy parts, while the mass was liquid or semi-liquid, would
have sunk into them and fill'd them up, expelling the Air or
Water that was there; And when afterwards there came to be a
crust or new Earth form'd upon the face of the Waters, there could
be no Cavities, no dens, no fragments in it, no more than in the
other; And for the same general reason, <hi>that is,</hi> passing from a
liquid form into a concrete or solid, leasurely and by degrees, it
would flow and settle together in an entire mass; There being
nothing broken, nor any thing hard, to bear the parts off from
one another, or to intercept any empty spaces between them.</p>
                     <p>'Tis manifest then that the Earth could not be in this Cavernous
form originally, by any work of Nature; nor by any immediate
action of God, seeing there is neither use nor beauty in this kind
of construction; Do we not then, as reasonably, as aptly, ascribe
it to that desolation that was brought upon the Earth in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Deluge? When its outward frame was dissolv'd and fell into
the great Abyss: How easily doth this answer all that we have
observ'd concerning the Subterraneous Regions? That hollow and
broken posture of things under ground, all those Caves and holes,
and blind recesses, that are otherwise so inaccountable, say but that
they are a <hi>Ruine,</hi> and you have in one word explain'd them all.
For there is no sort of Cavities, interior or exterior, great or little,
open or shut, wet or dry, of what form or fashion soever, but we
might reasonably expect them in a ruine of that nature. And as
for the Subterraneous waters, seeing the Earth fell into the Abyss.
the pillars and foundations of the present (exteriour) Earth must
stand immers'd in water, and therefore at such a depth from the
surface every where, there must be water found, if the soil be of
a nature to admit it. 'Tis true, all Subterraneous waters do not
proceed from this original, for many of them are the effects of Rains
and melted Snows sunk into the Earth; but that in digging any
where you constantly come to water at length, even in the most solid
ground, this cannot proceed from these Rains or Snows, but must
come from below, and from a cause as general as the effect is;
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41970:55"/>
which can be no other in my judgment than this, that the roots
of the exteriour Earth stand within the old Abyss, whereof, as a
great part lies open in the Sea, so the rest lies hid and cover'd among
the fragments of the Earth; sometimes dispers'd and only moist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the parts, as our bloud lies in the flesh, and in the habit of
the body; sometimes in greater or lesser masses, as the bloud in
our Vessels. And this I take to be the true account of Subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
waters as distinguish'd from Fountains and Rivers, and from
the matter and causes of them.</p>
                     <p>Thus much we have spoke to give a general <hi>Idea</hi> of the inward
parts of the Earth, and an easie Explication of them by our <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis;</hi>
which whether it be true or no, if you compare it impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially

are just in such a form and posture as if it was true.</p>

properties.</head>
                     <p>WE have hitherto given an account of the Subterraneous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
and of their general form; We now come above
ground to view the surface of the Globe, which we find <hi>Terraque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi>
or divided into Sea and Land: These we must survey, and
what is remarkable in them as to their frame and structure, we
must give an account of from our <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> and shew to be inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
from any other yet known.</p>
                     <p>As for the Ocean, there are two things considerable in it, the
Water and the Chanel that contains it. The Water no doubt is as
ancient as the Earth and cotemporary with it, and we suppose it
to be part of the great Abyss wherein the World was drown'd;
the rest lying cover'd under the hollow fragments of Continents and
Islands. But that is not so much the subject of our present discourse
as the Chanel of the Ocean, that vast and prodigious Cavity that
runs quite round the Globe, and reacheth, for ought we know,
from Pole to Pole, and in many places is unsearchably deep: When
I present this great Gulf to my imagination, emptied of all its
waters, naked and gaping at the Sun, stretching its jaws from
one end of the Earth to another, it appears to me the most ghastly
thing in Nature. What hands or instruments could work a Trench
in the body of the Earth of this vastness, and lay Mountains and
Rocks on the side of it, as Ramparts to enclose it?</p>
                     <p>But as we justly admire its greatness, so we cannot at all admire
its beauty or elegancy, for 'tis as deform'd and irregular as it is
great. And there appearing nothing of order or any regular
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41970:55"/>
design in its parts, it seems reasonable to believe that it was not
the work of Nature, according to her first intention, or according
to the first model that was drawn in measure and proportion, by the
Line and by the Plummet, but a secondary work, and the best
that could be made of broken materials. And upon this supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
'tis easie to imagine, how upon the dissolution of the primae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
Earth the Chanel of the Sea was made, or that huge Cavity
that lies between the several Continents of the Earth; which shall
be more particularly explain'd after we have view'd a little better
the form of it, and the Islands that lie scatter'd by its shores.</p>
                     <p>There is no Cavity in the Earth, whether open or Subterraneous;
that is comparably so great as that of the Ocean, nor would any
appear of that deformity if we could see it empty. The inside of
a Cave is rough and unsightly; The beds of great Rivers and great
Lakes when they are laid dry, look very raw and rude; The Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys
of the Earth, if they were naked, without Trees and without
Grass, nothing but bare ground and bare stones, from the tops of
their Mountains would have a ghastly aspect; but the Sea-chanel is
the complex of all these; here Caves, empty Lakes, naked Valleys
are represented as in their original, or rather far exceeded and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
as to all their irregularities; for the Cavity of the Ocean is
universally irregular, both as to the shores and borders of it; as
to the uncertain breadth and the uncertain depth of its several parts,
and as to its ground and bottom and the whole mould: If the Sea
had been drawn round the Earth in regular figures and borders,
it might have been a great beauty to our Globe, and we should
reasonably have concluded it a work of the first Creation, or of
Nature's first production; but finding on the contrary all the marks
of disorder and disproportion in it, we may as reasonably conclude,
that it did not belong to the first order of things, but was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
succedaneous, when the degeneracy of Mankind, and the
judgments of God had destroy'd the first World, and subjected the
Creation of some kind of Vanity.</p>
                     <p>Nor can it easily be imagin'd, if the Sea had been always, and
the Earth, in this <hi>Terraqueous</hi> form, broke into Continents and Islands,
how Mankind could have been propagated at first through the face
of the Earth, all from one head and from one place. For Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was not then known, at least as to the grand Ocean, or to pass
from Continent to Continent; And, I believe, <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark was
the first Ship, or Vessel of bulk, that ever was built in the World;
how could then the Posterity of <hi>Adam</hi> overflow the Earth, and stock
the several parts of the World, if they had been distant or separate
then, as they are now, by the interposal of the great Ocean? But
this consideration we will insist upon more largely in another place;
let us reflect upon the irregularities of the Sea-chanel again, and the
possible causes of it.</p>
                     <p>If we could imagine the Chanel of the Sea to have been made as
we may imagine the Chanel of Rivers to have been, by long and
insensible attrition: The Water wearing by degrees the ground
under it, by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>orce it hath from its descent and course, we should
not wonder at its irregular form; but 'tis not possible this Chanel
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41970:56"/>
should have had any such original; whence should its water have
descended, from what Mountains, or from what Clouds? Where
is the spring-head of the Sea? What force could eat away half
the surface of the Earth, and wear it hollow to an immeasurable
depth? This must not be from feeble and lingring causes, such as
the attrition of waters, but from some great violence offer'd to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
such as we suppose to have been in the general Deluge, when
the frame of the Earth was broken. And after we have a little sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd
the Sea-coast, and so far as we can, the form of the Sea-cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
we shall the more easily believe that they could have no other
original than what we assign.</p>
                     <p>The shores and coasts of the Sea are no way equal or uniform,
but go in a line uncertainly crooked and broke; indented and
jag'd as a thing torn, as you may see in the Maps of the Coasts and
the Sea-charts; and yet there are innumerable more inequalities than
are taken notice of in those draughts; for they only mark the
greater Promontories and Bays; but there are besides those a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Creeks and out-lets, necks of Land and Angles, which break
the evenness of the shore in all manner of ways. Then the height
and level of the shore is as uncertain as the line of it; 'Tis some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
high and sometimes low, sometimes spread in sandy Plains,
as smooth as the Sea it self, and of such an equal height with it,
that the waves seem to have no bounds but the meer figure and
convexity of the Globe; In other places 'tis rais'd into banks and
ramparts of Earth, and in others 'tis wall'd in with Rocks; And
all this without any order that we can observe, or any other reason
than that this is what might be expected in a ruine.</p>
                     <p>As to the depths and soundings of the Sea, they are under no
rule nor equality any more than the figures of the Shores; Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
in some places, and Gulphs in others; beds of Sands some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
and sometimes Rocks under water; as Navigators have learn'd
by a long and dangerous experience: And though we that are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
dry Land, are not much concern'd how the Rocks and the
Shelves lie in the Sea, yet a poor shipwreckt Mariner, when he hath
run his Vessel upon a Rock in the middle of the Chanel, expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
bitterly with Nature, who it was that plac'd that Rock there,
and to what purpose? Was there not room enough, saith he, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Land, or the Shore, to lay your great stones, but they must
be thrown into the middle of the Sea, as it were in spite to Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation?
The best Apology that can be made for Nature in this case,
so far as I know, is to confess that the whole business of the Sea-chanel
is but a ruine, and in a ruine things tumble uncertainly,
and commonly lie in confusion: Though to speak the truth, it sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
happens, unless in narrow Seas, that Rocks or Banks or Islands
lie in the middle of them, or very far from the Shores.</p>
                     <p>Having view'd the more visible parts of the Chanel of the Sea,
we must now descend to the bottom of it, and see the form and
contrivance of that; but who shall guide us in our journey, while
we walk,<note place="margin">

make a description of that which none hath seen? It is reasonable
to believe, that the bottom of the Sea is much more rugged, broken
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:41970:56"/>
and irregular than the face of the Land; There are Mountains, and
Valleys, and Rocks, and ridges of Rocks, and all the common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equalities
we see upon Land; besides these, 'tis very likely there
are Caves under water, and hollow passages into the bowels of the
Earth, by which the Seas circulate and communicate one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and with Subterraneous waters; Those great <hi>Eddees</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
<hi>Syrtes</hi> and Whirlpools that are in some Seas, as the <hi>Baltick</hi>
and the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> that suck into them and overwhelm what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
comes within their reach, show that there is something below
that sucks from them in proportion, and that drinks up the Sea as
the Sea drinks up the Rivers. We ought also to imagine the Shores
within the water to go inclin'd and sloping, but with great ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality;
there are many Shelves in the way, and Chambers, and
sharp Angles; and many broken Rocks and great stones lie rolled
down to the bottom.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true these things affect us little, because they are not expos'd
to our senses; and we seldom give our selves the trouble to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
from reason what the form of the invisible and inaccessible
parts of the Earth is; or if we do sometimes, those <hi>Idea</hi>'s are faint
and weak, and make no lasting impression upon our imagination
and passions; but if we should suppose the Ocean dry, and that
we lookt down from the top of some high Cloud upon the empty
Shell, how horridly and barbarously would it look? And with
what amazement should we see it under us like an open Hell, or a
wide bottomless pit? So deep, and hollow, and vast; so broken and
confus'd, so every way deform'd and monstrous. This would ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
waken our imagination, and make us enquire and wonder
how such a thing came in Nature; from what causes, by what
force or engines could the Earth be torn in this prodigious manner?
did they dig the Sea with Spades, and carry out the molds in
hand-baskets? Where are the entrails laid? and how did they cleave
the Rocks asunder? If as many Pioneers as the Army of <hi>Xerxes,</hi>
had been at work ever since the beginning of the World, they
could not have made a ditch of this greatness. Nor is it the
greatness only, but that wild and multifarious confusion which
we see in the parts and fashion of it, that makes it strange and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable;
'tis another Chaos in its kind, who can paint the
Scenes of it? Gulfs, and Precipices, and Cataracts; Pits within Pits,
and Rocks under Rocks, broken Mountains and ragged Islands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that look as if they had been Countries pull'd up by the roots, and
planted in the Sea.</p>
                     <p>If we could make true and full representations of these things to
our selves, I think we should not be so bold as to make them the
immediate product of Divine Omnipotence; being destitute of all
appearance of Art or Counsel. The first orders of things are more
perfect and regular: and this <hi>Decorum</hi> seems to be observ'd, that
Nature doth not fall into disorder till Mankind be first degenerate
and leads the way. Monsters have been often made an argument
against Providence; if a Calf have two heads, or five legs, streight
there must not be a God in Heaven, or at least not upon Earth;
and yet this is but a chance that happens once in many years, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41970:57"/>
is of no consequence at all to the rest of the World: But if we make
the standing frame of Nature monstrous, or deform'd and dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd,
and to have been so not by corruption and degeneracy,
but immediately by Divine Creation or Formation, it would not be
so easie to answer that objection against Providence. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
prevent this imputation, and supposing, according to our
Theory, that these things were not originally thus, let us now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
more distinctly how they came to pass at the Deluge, or
upon the dissolution of the first Earth.</p>
                     <p>And we will not content our selves with a general answer to
these observations concerning the Sea-chanel, as if it was a sufficient
account of them to say they were the effects of a ruine; there are
other things to be consider'd and explain'd besides this irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as the vast hollowness of this Cavity, bigger incomparably than
any other belonging to the Earth; and also the declivity of the
sides of it, which lie shelving from top to bottom; For notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all the inequalities we have taken notice of in the Chanel
of the Sea, it hath one general form, which may, though under
many differences, be observ'd throughout, and that is, that the
shores and sides within the water lie inclin'd, and you descend by
degrees to the deepest part, which is towards the middle. This, I
know, admits of many exceptions, for sometimes upon a rocky
shore, or among rocky Islands the Sea is very deep close to the
Rocks, and the deeper commonly the higher and sleeper the Rocks
are. Also where the descent is more leisurely, 'tis often after a
different manner, in some coasts more equal and uniform, in others
more broken and interrupted, but still there is a descent to the
Chanel or deepest part, and this in the deep Ocean is fathomless;
And such a deep Ocean, and such a deep Chanel there is always
between Continents. This, I think, is a property as determinate as
any we can pitch upon in the Chanel of the Sea, and with those
other two mention'd, its vast Cavity and universal irregularity, is
all one can desire an account of as to the form of it; we will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
from this ground take our rise and first measures for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of the Sea-chanel.</p>
                     <p>Let us suppose then in the dissolution of the Earth when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to fall, that it was divided only into three or four fragments,
according to the number of our Continents; but those fragments
being vastly great could not descend at their full breadth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pansion,
or at least could not descend so fast in the middle as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the extremities; because the Air about the edges would
yield and give place easily, not having far to go to get out of the way;
but the Air that was under the middle of the fragment could not
without a very swift motion get from under the concave of it,
and consequently its descent there would be more resisted and sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended;
but the sides in the mean time would continually descend,
bending the fragment with their weight, and so making it of a
lesser compass and expansion than it was before: And by this
means there would be an interval and distance made between the
two falling fragments, and a good part of the Abyss, after their
descent, would lie uncover'd in the middle betwixt them; as may
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41970:57"/>
be seen in this Figure, where the fragments A. B. bending down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in their extremities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> separate as they go, and after they are
faln leave a good space in the Abyss betwixt them, altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd;
This space is the main Chanel of the great Ocean, lying
betwixt two Continents; and the inclining sides shew the declivity
of the Shores.</p>
                     <p>This we have represented here only in a Ring or Circle of the
Earth, in the first Figure; but it may be better represented in a
broader surface, as in the second Figure, where the two fragments
A. B. that are to make the two opposite Continents, fall in like
double Doors opening downwards, the Hinges being towards the
Land on either side, so as at the bottom they leave in the middle
betwixt them a deep Chanel of water, <hi>a. a. a.</hi> such as is betwixt
all Continents; and the water reaching a good height upon the
Land on either side, makes Sea there too, but shallower, and by
degrees you descend into the deepest Chanel.</p>
                     <p>This gives an account of two things that we mention'd to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
and explain'd as to the Sea, how the great Cavity of its
Chanel was made, and how it was made in that general form of
declivity in its sides from the Land: The third thing was the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities
of it, both as to its various depths, and as to the form
of the shores and of the bottom. And this is as easily and natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
explain'd from the same supposition as the former two; for
though we have hitherto represented the fragments A. B. as even
and regular after their fall, because that was most simple, and there
was no occasion then to represent them otherwise, yet we must
suppose that as soon as in their fall they hit upon the top or bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the Abyss, that great force and weight with which they
descended broke off all the edges and extremities, and so made innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
ruptures and inequalities in the shores, and as many with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Sea, and at the bottom; where the broken Rocks and lumps
of Earth would lie in all imaginable disorder; as you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from the <hi>third Figure.</hi> For when the motion came on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to be obstructed, the load of the fragment still pressing it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
such a concussion arise as made thousands of lesser fragments,
of all shapes and magnitudes, and in all postures and forms, and
most of them irregular. And by these fractions and secondary
ruines the line of the shores was broken, and the level of them too;
In some places they would stand high, in others low, sometimes
rought and sometimes even, and generally crooked, with Angles
and in-lets, and uncertain windings. The bottom also, by the same
stroke was diversifi'd into all manner of forms, sometimes Rocky
with Pits and Gulfs, and sometimes spread in plain beds, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
shallow and sometimes deep; for those differences would
depend only upon the situation of the secondary fragments; and so
it might come to pass, that some places near the shore might be
excessive deep when a Rock or Rocks stood in a steep posture, as
<hi>(Figure 3.) b. b. b.</hi> and, on the contrary, sometimes places much
more advanc'd into the Ocean, might be less deep, where a frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Earth lay under water, or one bore up another, as <hi>c. c. c.</hi>
but these cases would not be very frequent. To conclude, There

are no properties of the Sea-chanel, that I know of, nor differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
or irregularities in the form of it, which this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> doth
not give a fair account of: And having thus far open'd the way,
and laid down the general grounds for their Explication, other
things that are more minute, we leave to the curiosity of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Genius's; being unwilling to clog the Theory at first with things
that may seem unnecessary. We proceed now to the consideration
of Islands.</p>
                     <p>We must in the first place distinguish between <hi>Original</hi> Islands
and <hi>Factitious</hi> Islands; Those I call factitious, that are not of the
same date and Antiquity with the Sea, but have been made some
at one time, some at another, by accidental causes, as the aggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Sands and Sand-beds, or the Sea leaving the tops of some
shallow places that lie high, and yet flowing about the lower skirts
of them; These make sandy and plain Islands, that have no high
Land in them, and are but mock-Islands in effect. others are made
by divulsion from some Continent, when an Isthmus or the neck
of a Promontory running into the Sea, sinks or falls in, by an
Earthquake or otherwise, and the Sea entring in at the gap passeth
through, and makes that Promontory or Country become an Island.
Thus the Island <hi>Sicily</hi> is suppos'd to have been made, and all
<hi>Africa</hi> might be an Island, if the Isthmus between the <hi>Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean</hi>
and the red Sea should sink down. And these Islands may
have Rocks and Mountains in them, if the Land had so before.
Lastly, There are Islands that have been said to rise from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the Sea; History mentions such in both the <hi>Archipelago's,
Aegaean</hi> and <hi>Indian;</hi> and this seems to argue that there are great
fragments or tracts of Earth that lie loose at the bottom of the Sea,
or that are not incorporated with the ground; which agrees very
well with our Explication of the Sea-chanel.</p>
                     <p>But besides these Islands and the several sorts of them, there are
others which I call <hi>Original;</hi> because they could not be produc'd
in any of the forementioned ways, but are of the same Origin and
Antiquity with the Chanel of the Sea; and such are the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of our Islands; They were not made of heaps of Sands, nor
torn from any Continent, but are as ancient as the Continents
themselves, namely, ever since the Deluge, the common Parent of
them both. Nor is there any difficulty to understand how Islands
were made at the dissolution of the Earth, any more than how
Continents were made; for Islands are but lesser Continents, or
Continents greater Islands; and according as Continents were made
of greater masses of Earth or greater fragments standing above the
Water, so Islands were made of less, but so big always, and in such
a posture, as to bear their tops above the Water. Yet though they
agree thus far, there is a particular difference to be taken notice of
as to their Origin; for the Continents were made of those three
or four primary masses into which the falling Orb of the Earth
was divided, but the Islands were made of the fractures of these,
and broken off by the fall from the skirts and extremities of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinents;
We noted before, that when those great masses and prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fragments came to dash upon the Abyss in their fall, the sudden
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41970:59"/>
stop of the motion, and the weighty bulk of the descending frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
broke off all the edges and extremities of it, which edges and
extemities broken off made the Islands; and accordingly we see
that they generally lie scatter'd along the sides of the Continents,
and are but splinters, as it were, of those greater bodies. 'Tis ture,
besides these, there were an infinite number of other pieces broke
off that do not appear, some making Rocks under water, some
shallows and banks in the Sea; but the greatest of them when they
fell either one upon another, or in such a posture as to prop up one
another, their heads and higher parts would stand out of the water
and make Islands.</p>
                     <p>Thus I conceive the Islands of the Sea were at first produc'd;
we cannot wonder therefore that they should be so numerous, or
far more numerous than the Continents; These are the Parents,
and those are the Children; Nor can we wonder to see along the
sides of the Continents several Islands or sets of Islands, sown, as it
were, by handfuls, or laid in trains; for the manner of their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
would lead us to think they would be so plac'd. So the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican</hi>
Islands lie scatter'd upon the Coast of that Continent; the <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divian</hi>
and <hi>Philippine</hi> upon the <hi>East-Indian</hi> shore, and the <hi>Hesperides</hi>
upon the <hi>Africk;</hi> and there seldom happen to be any towards the
middle of the Ocean, though, by an accident, that also might
come to pass. Lastly, It suits very well with our Explication, that
there should be Mountains and Rocks, sometimes in clusters, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in long chains, in all Islands; (as we find there are in all that
are true and Original) for 'tis that makes them high enough to
appear above the water, and strong enough to continue and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
themselves in that high situation.</p>
                     <p>And thus much may suffice for a summary Explication of the
causes of the Sea-chanel and Islands, according to our <hi>Hypothesis.</hi>

                     <p>WE have been in the hollows of the Earth, and the Chambers
of the Deep, amongst the damps and steams of those lower
Regions; let us now go air our selves on the tops of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
where we shall have a more free and large Horizon, and
quite another face of things will present it self to our observation.</p>
                     <p>The greatest objects of Nature are, methinks, the most pleasing
to behold; and next to the great Concave of the Heavens, and
those boundless Regions where the Stars inhabit, there is nothing
that I look upon with more plaesure than the wide Sea and the
Mountains of the Earth. There is something august and stately in
the Air of these things, that inspires the mind with great thoughts
and passions; We do naturally, upon such occasions, think of God
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41970:59"/>
and his greatness: and whatsoever hath but the shadow and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of INFINITE, as all things have that are too big
for our comprehension, they fill and over-bear the mind with their
Excess, and cast it into a pleasing kind of stupor and admiration.</p>
                     <p>And yet these Mountains we are speaking of, to confess the truth,
are nothing but great ruines; but such as show a certain magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
in Nature; as from old Temples and broken Amphitheaters
of the <hi>Romans</hi> we collect the greatness of that people. But the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
of a Nation is less sensible to those that never see the remains
and monuments they have left, and those who never see the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous
parts of the Earth, scarce ever reflect upon the causes of
them, or what power in Nature could be sufficient to produce
them. The truth is, the generality of people have not sence and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity
enough to raise a question concerning these things, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Original of them. You may tell them that Mountains
grow out of the Earth like Fuzz-balls, or that there are Monsters
under ground that throw up Mountains as Moles do Mole-hills;
they will scarce raise one objection against your doctrine; or if you
would appear more Learned, tell them that the Earth is a great
Animal and these are Wens that grow upon its body. This would
pass current for Philosophy; so much is the World drown'd in stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity
and sensual pleasures, and so little inquisitive into the works
of God and Nature.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing doth more awaken our thoughts or excite our
minds to enquire into the causes of such things, than the actual
view of them; as I have had experience my self when it was my
fortune to cross the <hi>Alps</hi> and <hi>Appennine</hi> Mountains; for the sight
of those wild, vast and indigested heaps of Stones and Earth, did
so deeply strike my fancy, that I was not easie till I could give my
self some tolerable account how that confusion came in Nature.
'Tis true, the height of Mountains compar'd with the Diameter of
the Earth is not considerable, but the extent of them and the ground
they stand upon, bears a considerable proportion to the surface of
the Earth; and if from <hi>Europe</hi> we may take our measures for the
rest, I easily believe, that the Mountains do at least take up the
tenth part of the dry Land. The Geographers are not very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to describe or note in their Charts, the multitude or situation of
Mountains; They mark the bounds of Countries, the site of Cities
and Towns, and the course of Rivers, because these are things
of chief use to civil affairs and commerce, and that they design to
serve, and not Philosophy or Natural History. But <hi>Cluverius</hi> in his
description of <hi>Ancient Germany, Switzerland</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> hath given
Maps of those Countries more approaching to the natural face of
them, and we have drawn (at the end of this Chapter) such a
Map of either Hemisphere, without marking Countries or Towns,
or any such artificial things; distinguishing only Land and Sea,
Islands and Continents, Mountains and not Mountains; and 'tis
very useful to imagine the Earth in this manner, and to look often
upon such bare draughts as shew us Nature undrest, for then we
are best able to judge what her true shapes and proportions are.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="96" facs="tcp:41970:60"/>
'Tis certain that we naturally imagine the surface of the Earth
much more regular than it is; for unless we be in some Mountai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
parts, there seldom occur any great inequalities within so
much compass of ground as we can, at once, reach with our Eye;
and to conceive the rest, we multiply the same <hi>Iden,</hi> and extend it
to those parts of the Earth that we do not see; and so fansie the
whole Globe much more smooth and uniform than it is. But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a man was carri'd asleep out of a Plain Country amongst
the <hi>Alps,</hi> and left there upon the top of one of the highest Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
when he wak'd and look'd about him, he would think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in an inchanted Country, or carri'd into another World; every
thing would appear to him so different to what he had ever seen
or imagin'd before. To see on every hand of him a multitude of
vast bodies thrown together in confusion, as those Mountains are;
Rocks standing naked round about him; and the hollow Valleys
gaping under him; and at his feet it may be, an heap of frozen
Snow in the midst of Summer. He would hear the thunder come
from below, and see the black Clouds hanging beneath him; Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such a prospect, it would not be easie to him to perswade
himself that he was still upon the same Earth; but if he did, he
would be convinc'd, at least, that there are some Regions of it
strangely rude, and ruine-like, and very different from what he
had ever thought of before. But the Inhabitants of these wild
places are even with us; for those that live amongst the <hi>Alps</hi> and
the great Mountains, think that all the rest of the Earth is like their
Country, all broken into Mountains, and Valleys, and Precipices;
They never see other, and most people think of nothing but what
they have seen at one time or another.</p>
                     <p>These <hi>Alps</hi> we are speaking of are the greatest range of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
in <hi>Europe;</hi> and 'tis prodigious to see and to consider of what
extent these heaps of Stones and Rubbish are; one way they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread
<hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Dauphiné,</hi> and reach through <hi>France</hi> to the <hi>Pyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean</hi>
Mountains, and so to the Ocean. The other way they run along
the skirts of <hi>Germany,</hi> through <hi>Stiria, Pannonia,</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> as
far as <hi>Thrace</hi> and the Black Sea. Then backwards they cover <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland</hi>
and the parts adjacent; and that branch of them which we
call the <hi>Appennines,</hi> strikes through <hi>Italy,</hi> and is, as it were, the
back-bone of that Country. This must needs be a large space of
ground which they stand upon; Yet 'tis not this part of <hi>Europe</hi> only
that is laden with Mountains, the Northern part is as rough and
rude in the face of the Country, as in the manners of the people;
<hi>Bohemia, Silesia, Denmark, Norway, Sweedland, Lapland,</hi> and <hi>Ise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and all the coasts of the <hi>Baltick Sea,</hi> are full of Clifts, and
Rocks, and Crags of Mountains: Besides the <hi>Riphean</hi> Mountains
in <hi>Muscovy,</hi> which the Inhabitants there use to call the <hi>Stone-girdle,</hi>
and believe that it girds the Earth round about.</p>
                     <p>Nor are the other parts of our Continent more free from Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
than <hi>Europe,</hi> nor other parts of the Earth than our Continent:
They are in the New World as well as the Old; and if they could
discover two or three New Worlds or Continents more, they
would still find them there. Neither is there any Original Island
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41970:60"/>
upon the Earth, but is either all a Rock, or hath Rocks and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
in it. And all the dry Land, and every Continent, is but a kind of
Mountain: though that Mountain hath a multitude of lesser ones, and
Valleys, and Plains, and Lakes, and Marshes, and all variety of grounds.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>America,</hi> the <hi>Andes,</hi> or a ridge of Mountains so call'd, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to be higher than any we have, reaching above a thousand
Leagues in length, and twenty in breadth, where they are the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowest.
In <hi>Africk</hi> the Mountain <hi>Atlas,</hi> that for its height was said
to bear the Heavens on its back, runs all along from the Western
Sea to the borders of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> parallel with the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi> There
also are the Mountains or the <hi>Moon,</hi> and many more whereof we
have but an imperfect account, as neither indeed of that Country
in the remote and inner parts of it. <hi>Asia</hi> is better known, and the
Mountains thereof better describ'd: <hi>Taurus,</hi> which is the principal
was adjudg'd by the ancient Geographers the greatest in the World.
It divides <hi>Asia</hi> into two parts, which have their denomination from
it: And there is an <hi>Anti-Taurus</hi> the greater and the less, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
divide <hi>Armenia</hi> into greater and less. Then the <hi>Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi>
Mountains of <hi>Imaus,</hi> the famous <hi>Càucasus,</hi> the long Chains
of <hi>Tartary</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> and the Rocky and Mountainous <hi>Arabia.</hi> If
one could at once have a prospect of all these together, one would
be easily satisfied, that the Globe of the Earth is a more rude and
indigested Body than 'tis commonly imagin'd; If one could see, I
say, all the Kingdoms and Regions of the Earth at one view, how
they lie in broken heaps; The Sea hath overwhelm'd one half of
them, and what remains are but the taller parts of a ruine. Look
upon those great ranges of Mountains in <hi>Europe</hi> or in <hi>Asia</hi> whereof
we have given a short survey, in what confusion do they lie? They
have neither form nor beauty, nor shape, nor order, no more than
the Clouds in the Air. Then how barren, how desolate, how naked
are they? How they stand neglected by Nature? Neither the Rains
can soften them, nor the Dews from Heaven make them fruitful.</p>
                     <p>I have given this short account of the Mountains of the Earth,
to help to remove that prejudice we are apt to have, or that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
That the present Earth <hi>is regularly form'd.</hi> And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
I do not doubt but that it would be of very good use to have
<hi>natural</hi> Maps of the Earth, as we noted before, as well as <hi>civil;</hi> and
done with the same care and judgment. Our common Maps I call
<hi>Civil,</hi> which note the distinction of Countries and of Cities, and
represent the Artificial Earth as inhabited and cultivated: But
Natural Maps leave out all that, and represent the Earth as it
would be if there was not an Inhabitant upon it, nor evor had been;
the Skeleton of the Earth, as I may so say, with the site of all its
parts. Methinks also every Prince should have such a Draught of
his own Country and Dominions, to see how the ground lies in the
several parts of them, which highest, which lowest; what respect
they have to one another, and to the Sea; how the Rivers flow,
and why; how the Mountains stand, how the Heaths, and how
the Marches are plac'd. Such a Map or Survey would be useful
both in time of War and Peace, and many good observations might
be made by it, not only as to Natural History and Philosophy, but
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41970:61"/>
also in order to the perfect improvement of a Country. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to our Mountains.</p>
                     <p>As this View of the multitude and greatness of them may help
to rectifie our mistakes about the form of the Earth, so before we
proceed to examine their causes it will be good to observe farther,
that these Mountains are plac'd in no order on with another,
that can either respect use or beauty; and if you consider them
singly, they do not consist of any proportion of parts that is refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to any design, or that hath the least footsteps of Art or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel.
There is nothing in Nature more shapeless and ill-figur'd than
an old Rock or a Mountain, and all that variety that is among them,
is but the various modes of irregularity; so as you cannot make
a better character of them, in short, than to say they are of all
forms and figures, except regular. Then if you would go within
these Mountains, (for they are generally hollow,) you would find
all things there more rude, if possible, than without: And lastly,
if you look upon an heap of them together, or a Mountainous
Country, they are the greatest examples of confusion that we know
in Nature; no Tempest or Earthquake puts things into more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order.
'Tis true, they cannot look so ill now as they did at first;
a ruine that is fresh looks much worse than afterwards, when the
Earth grows discolour'd and skin'd over. But I fancy if we had
seen the Mountains when they were new born and raw, when the
Earth was fresh-broken, and the waters of the Deluge newly retir'd,
the fractions and confusions of them would have appear'd very
gastly and frightful.</p>
                     <p>After this general Survey of the Mountains of the Earth and
their properties, let us now re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lect upon the causes of them. There
is a double pleasure in Philosophy, first that of Admiration, whilst
we contemplate things that are great and wonderful, and do not
yet understand their Causes; for though admiration proceed from
ignorance, yet there is a certain charm and sweetness in that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
Then the second pleasure is greater and more intellectual,
which is that of distinct knowledge and comprehension, when we
come to have the Key that unlocks those secrets, and see the methods
wherein those things come to pass that we admir'd before; The
reasons why the World is so or so, and from what causes Nature,
or any part of Nature, came into such a state; and this we are
now to enquire after as to the Mountains of the Earth, what their
original was, how and when the Earth came into this strange frame
and structure? In the beginning of our World, when the Earth
rise from a Chaos, 'twas impossible it should come immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this Mountainous form; because a mass that is fluid, as a Chaos
is, cannot li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> in any other figure than what is regular; for the
constant Laws of Nature do certainly bring all liquors into that
form<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And a Chaos is not call'd so from any confusion or bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness
in the form of it, but from a confusion and mixture of all
sorts of ingredients in the composition of it. So we have already
produc'd, in the precedent Chapters a double argument that the
Earth was not originally in this form, both because it rise from a
Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>os, which could not of it self, or by any immediate concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41970:61"/>
settle into a form of this nature, as hath been shown in the
Fourth and Fifth Chapters; as also because if it had been originally
made thus, it could never have undergone a Deluge, as hath been
prov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d in the Second and Third Chapters. If this be then a secondary
and succedaneous form, the great question is from what causes it arises.</p>
                     <p>Some have thought that Mountains, and all other irregularities
in the Earth, have rise from Earthquakes, and such like causes;
others have thought that they came from the universal Deluge;
yet not from any dissolution of the Earth that was then, but only
from the great agitation of the waters, which broke the ground in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this rude and unequal form. Both these causes seem to me very
incompetent and insufficient. Earthquakes seldom make Mountains,
they often take them away, and sink them down into the Caverns
that lie under them; Besides, Earthquakes are not in all Countries
and Climates as Mountains are; for, as we have observ'd more
than once, there is neither Island that is original, nor Continent
any where in the Earth, in what Latitude soever, but hath Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
and Rocks in it. And lastly, what probability is there, or
how is it credible, that those vast tracts of Land which we see fill'd
with Mountains both in <hi>Europe, Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> were rais'd by
Earthquakes, or any eruptions from below. In what Age of the
World was this done, and why not continu'd? As for the Deluge,
which they alledge as another cause, I doubt not but Mountains
were made in the time of the general Deluge, that great change
and transformation of the Earth happen'd then, but not from such
causes as are pretended, that is, the bare rolling and agitation of
the waters; For if the Earth was smooth and plain before the
Flood, as they seem to suppose as well as we do, the waters could
have little or no power over a smooth surface to tear it any way in
pieces, no more than they do a meadow or low ground when they
lie upon it; for that which makes Torrents and Land-floods vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
is their fall from the Mountains and high Lands, which our
Earth is now full of, but if the Rain fell upon even and level ground,
it would only sadden and compress it; there is no possibility how
it should raise Mountains in it. And if we could imagine an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Deluge as the Earth is now constituted, it would rather
throw down the Hills and Mountains than raise new ones; or by
beating down their tops and loose parts, help to fill the Valleys, and
bring the Earth nearer to evenness and plainness.</p>
                     <p>Seeing then there are no hopes of explaining the Origin of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
either from particular Earthquakes, or from the general
Deluge, according to the common notion and Explication of it;
these not being causes answerable to such vast effects; Let us try
our <hi>Hypothesis</hi> again; which hath made us a Chanel large enough
for the Sea, and room for all subterraneous Cavities, and I think
will find us materials enough to raise all the Mountains of the
Earth. We suppose the great Arch or circumference of the first
Earth to have fallen into the Abyss at the Deluge, and seeing that
was large than the surface it fell upon, 'tis absolutely certain,
that it could not all fall flat, or lie under the water; Now as all
those parts that stood above the water made dry Land, or the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41970:62"/>
habitable Earth, so such parts of the dry Land as stood higher
than the rest, made Hills and Mountains; and this is the first and
general account of them, and of all the inequalities of the Earth.
But to consider these things a little more particularly; There is a
double cause and necessity of Mountains, first this now mention'd,
because the exteriour Orb of the Earth was greater than the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
which it fell upon, and therefore it could not all fall flat;
and secondly, because this exteriour Orb did not fall so flat and
large as it might, or did not cover all the bottom of the Abyss, as
it was very capable to do; but as we shewed before in explaining
the Chanel of the Ocean, it left a gaping in the middle, or an
<hi>Abyss-chanel,</hi> as I should call it; and the broader this Abyss-chanel
was, the more Mountains there would be upon the dry Land; for
there would be more Earth, or more of the falling Orb left, and
less room to place it in, and therefore it must stand more in heaps.</p>
                     <p>In what parts of the Earth these heaps would lie, and in what
particular manner, it cannot be expected that we should tell; but
all that we have hitherto observ'd concerning Mountains, how
strange soever and otherwise unaccountable, may easily be explain'd,
and deduc'd from this original; we shall not wonder at their
greatness and vastness, seeing they are the ruines of a broken World;
and they would take up more or less of the dry Land, according
as the Ocean took up more or less space of our Globe: Then as
to their figure and form, whether External or Internal, 'tis just
such as answers our expectation, and no more than what the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis</hi>
leads us to; For you would easily believe that these heaps
would be irregular in all manner of ways, whether consider'd
apart, or in their situation to one another. And they would lie
commonly in Clusters and in Ridges, for those are two of the most
general postures of the parts of a ruine, when they fall inwards.
Lastly, We cannot wonder that Mountains should be generally hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
For great bodies falling together in confusion, or bearing and
leaning against one another, must needs make a great many hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
in them, and by their unequal Applications empty spaces
will be intercepted. We see also from the same reason, why moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous
Countries are subject to Earthquakes; and why Mountains
often sink and fall down into the Caverns that lie under them; their
joynts and props being decayed and worn, they become unable to
bear their weight. And all these properties you see hang upon one
and the same string, and are just consequences from our supposition
concerning the dissolution of the first Earth. And there is no surer
mark of a good <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> than when it doth not only hit luckily
in one or two particulars, but answers all that it is to be apply'd to,
and is adequate to Nature in her whole extent.</p>
                     <p>But how fully or easily soever these things may answer Nature,
you will say, it may be, that all this is but an <hi>Hypothesis;</hi> that is, a
kind of fiction or supposition that things were so and so at first, and
by the coherence and agreement of the Effects with such a supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
you would argue and prove that they were really so. This
I confess is true, this is the method, and if we would know any
thing in Nature further than our senses go, we can know it not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb facs="tcp:41970:62"/>
                        <pb facs="tcp:41970:63"/>

                        <pb n="101" facs="tcp:41970:64"/>
than by an <hi>Hypothesis.</hi> When things are either too little for our
senses, or too remote and inaccessible, we have no way to know the
inward Nature, and the causes of their sensible properties, but by
reasoning upon an <hi>Hypothesis.</hi> If you would know, for example,
of what parts Water, or any other Liquor consists, they are too
little to be discern'd by the Eye, you must therefore take a supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
concerning their invisible figure and form, and if that agrees
and gives the reason of all their sensible qualities, you understand
the nature of Water. In like manner, if you would know the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a Comet, or of what matter the Sun consists, which are
things inaccessible to us, you can do this no otherwise than by an <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis;</hi>
and if that <hi>Hypothesis</hi> be easie and intelligible, and answers
all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of those two bodies, you have done as much as
a <hi>Philosopher</hi> or as <hi>Humane reason</hi> can do. And this is what we have
attempted concerning the Earth and concerning the Deluge. We have
laid down an <hi>Hypothesis</hi> that is easie and perspicuous, consisting of
a few things, and those very intelligible, and from this we have
given an account how the Old World was destroy'd by a Deluge of
Water, and how the Earth came into this present form; so distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd
and interrupted with Sea and Land, Mountains and Valleys,
and so broken in the surface and inward parts of it.</p>
                     <p>But to speak the Truth, this Theory is something more than a
bare <hi>Hypothesis;</hi> because we are assur'd that the general ground that
we go upon is true, namely, That the Earth rise at first from a
Chaos; for besides Reason and Antiquity, Scripture it self doth
assure us of that; and that one point being granted, we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
from it all the rest by a direct chain of consequences, which I
think cannot be broken easily in any part or link of it. Besides, the
great hinge of this Theory upon which all the rest turns, is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
we make of the Ante diluvian Earth and Heavens from the
Post-diluvian, as to their form and constitution. And it will never
be beaten out of my head,<note place="margin">2 Ep. Chap. 3. 5, 6.</note> but that S. <hi>Peter</hi> hath made the same
distinction sixteen hundred years since, and to the very same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
so that we have sure footing here again, and the Theory
riseth above the character of a bare <hi>Hypothesis.</hi> And whereas an <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis</hi>
that is clear and proportion'd to Nature in every respect, is
accounted morally certain, we must in equity give more than a
moral certitude to this Theory. But I mean this only as to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
parts of it; for as to particularities. I look upon them only
as problematical, and accordingly I affirm nothing therein but with
a power of revocation, and a liberty to change my opinion when I
shall be better inform'd. Neither do I know any Author that hath
treated a matter new, remote, and consisting of a multitude of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
who would not have had occasion, if he had liv'd to have
seen his <hi>Hypothesis</hi> fully examin'd, to have chang'd his mind and
manner of explaining things, in many material instances.</p>
                     <p>To conclude both this Chapter and this Section, we have here
added a Map or Draught of the Earth, according to the Natural
face of it, as it would appear from the Moon, if we were a little
nearer to her; or as it was at first after the Deluge, before Cities
were built, distinctions of Countries made, or any alte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ations by
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41970:65"/>
humane industry. 'Tis chiefly to expose more to view the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of the Earth, and the proportions of Sea and Land, to shew
it as it lies in it self, and as a Naturalist ought to conceive and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
it. 'Tis true, there are far more Mountains upon the Earth
than what are here represented, for more could not conveniently
be plac'd in this narrow Scheme; But the best and most effectual
way of representing the body of the Earth as it is by Nature, would
be, not in plain Tables, but by a <hi>rough Globe,</hi> expressing all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
inequalities that are upon the Earth. The smooth Globes
that we use, do but nourish in us the conceit of the Earth's regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity,
and though they may be convenient enough for Geographi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
purposes, they are not so proper for Natural Science; nothing
would be more useful, in this respect, than a rough Globe of the
largest dimensions, wherein the Chanel of the Sea should be really
hollow, as it is in Nature, with all its unequal depths according to
the best soundings, and the shores exprest both according to matter
and form, little Rocks standing where there are Rocks, and Sands
and Beaches in the places where they are found; and all the Islands
planted in the Sea-chanel in a due form, and in their solid dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
Then upon the Land should stand all the ranges of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
in the same order or disorder that Nature hath set them
there; And the in-land Seas, and great Lakes, or rather the beds
they lie in, should be duly represented; as also the vast desarts of
Sand as they lie upon the Earth. And this being done with care
and due Art, would be a true Epitome or true model of our Earth.
Where we should see, besides other instructions, what a rude Lump
our World is, which we are so apt to dote upon.</p>

with ours.</head>
                     <p>WE have finish'd the Three Sections of this Book, and in this
last Chapter we will make a short review and reflection
upon what hath been hitherto treated of, and add some further
confirmations of it. The Explication of the Universal Deluge was
the first proposal and design of this Discourse, to make that a thing
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41970:65"/>
credible and intelligible to the mind of Man: And the full Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of this drew in the whole Theory of the Earth: Whose ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
we have deduc'd from its first Source, and shew'd both what
was its primaeval Form, and how it came into its present Form. The
summ of our <hi>Hypothesis</hi> concerning the Universal Deluge was this;
That it came not to pass, as was vulgarly believ'd, by any excess
of Rains, or any Inundation of the Sea, nor could ever be effected
by a meer abundance of Waters; unless we suppose some dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Earth at the same time, namely when the <hi>Great Abyss</hi>
was broken open. And accordingly we shewed that without such
a dissolution, or if the Earth had been always in the same form it
is in now, no mass of water, any where to be found in the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
could have equall'd the height of the Mountains, or made such an
Universal Deluge. Secondly, We shewed that the form of the
Earth at first, and till the Deluge, was such as made it capable and
subject to a Dissolution: And thirdly, That such a dissolution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
suppos'd, the Doctrine of the Universal Deluge is very reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and intelligible; And not only the Doctrine of the Deluge, but
the same supposition is a Key to all Nature besides, shewing us how
our Globe became Terraqueous, what was the original of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
of the Sea-chanel, of Islands, of subterraneous Cavities;
Things, which without this supposition, are as unintelligible as the
universal Flood it self. And these things reciprocally confirming
one another, our <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of the Deluge is arm'd both breast and
back, by the causes and by the effects.</p>
                     <p>It remains now, that, as to confirm our Explication of the Deluge,
we shew'd all other accounts that had been given of it to be inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
or impossible, so to confirm our doctrine concerning the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of the Earth, and concerning the Original of Mountains,
Seas, and all inequalities upon it, or within it, we must examine
what causes have been assign'd by others, or what accounts given
of these things: That seeing their defectiveness, we may have the
more assurance and satisfaction in our own method.</p>
                     <p>And in order to this, let us observe first the general forms under
which the Earth may be consider'd, or under which it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
accordingly as we view it more nearly or remotely; And the
first of these and the most general is that of a <hi>Terraqueous Globe.</hi> If
a Philosopher should come out of another World out of curiosity
to see our Earth, the first discovery or observation he would make
would be this, that it was a Terraqueous Globe; Thus much he
might observe at a great distance when he came but near the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of our World. This we discern in the Moon and most of the
Planets, that they are divided into Sea and Land, and how this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
came, would be his first remark and inquiry concerning our
Earth; and how also those subdivisions of Islands, or little Earths
which lie in the Water, how these were form'd, and that great
Chanel that contains them both.</p>
                     <p>The second form that the Earth appears under, is that of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even
and <hi>Mountainous Globe.</hi> When our Traveller had got below tho
Circle of the Moon, he would discern the bald tops of our Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and the long ranges of them upon our Continents. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:41970:66"/>
from the Earth discern Mountains and Valleys in the Moon,
directly, but from the motion of the light and shadows which we
see there, we easily collect that there are such inequalities: And
accordingly we suppose that our Mountains would appear at a great
distance, and the shady Valleys lying under them; and that this
curious person that came to view our Earth, would make that his
second Enquiry, how those Mountains were form'd? and how our
Globe came to be so rude and irregular? for we may justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
how any irregularity came into Nature, seeing all her first
motions and her first forms are regular, and whatsoever is not so
is but secondary, and the consequence of some degeneracy, or of
some decay.</p>
                     <p>The Third visible form of our Earth is that of <hi>a broken Globe;</hi>
and broken throughout, but in the outward parts and Regions of
it. This, it may be, you will say, is not a visible form; it doth
not appear to the eye, without reasoning, that the surface of the
Earth is so broken. Suppose our new Visitant had now pass'd
the middle Region of the Air, and was alighted upon the top of
Pick <hi>Teneriffe</hi> for his first resting place, and that sitting there he
took a view of the great Rocks, the wide Sea, and of the shores of
<hi>Africk</hi> and <hi>Europe;</hi> for we'll suppose his piercing Eye to reach so
far; I will not say that at first sight he would pronounce that the
surface of this Globe was broken, unless he knew it to be so by
comparison with some other Planet like to it; but the broken
form and figure of many parts of the Rocks, and the posture in
which they lay, or great portions of them, some inclin'd, some
prostrate, some erected, would naturally lead him to that thought,
that they were a ruine; He would see also the Islands tore from
the Continents, and both the shores of the Continents and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
parts in the same disorder and irregular situation. Besides, he
had this great advantage in viewing the Earth at a distance, that
he could see a whole Hemisphere together, which, as he made his
approaches through the Air, would have much what the same
aspect and countenance as 'tis represented with in the great Scheme;<note place="margin">Pag. 100.</note>
And if any man should accidentally hit upon that Scheme, not
knowing or thinking that it was the Earth, I believe his first thought
of it would be, that it was some great broken body, or ruin'd frame
of matter; and the original, I am sure, is more manifestly so. But
we'll leave our Strange Philosopher to his own observations, and
wish him good Guides and Interpreters in his Survey of the Earth,
and that he would make a favourable report at his return home,
of our little dirty Planet.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, let us pursue, in our own way, this Third
<hi>Idea</hi> of the Earth a little further, as it is <hi>a broken Globe,</hi> Nature I
know hath dissembled and cover'd this form as much as may be, and
time hath helpt to repair some of the old breaches, or fill them up;
besides, the changes that have been made by Art and Humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,
by Agriculture, Planting, and Building Towns, hath made
the face of the Earth quite another thing from what it was in its
naked rudeness. As mankind is much alter'd from its Pristine state,
from what it was four thousand years ago, or towards the first
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:41970:66"/>
Ages after the Flood, when the Nations liv'd in simplicity or bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barousness;
so is the Earth too, and both so disguis'd and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
that if one of those Primitive Fathers should rise from the
dead, he would scarce know this to be the same World which he
liv'd in before. But to discern the true form of the Earth, whether
intire or broken, regular or disorder'd, we must in the first place
take away all those ornaments or additions made by Art or Nature,
and view the bare carcass of the Earth, as it hath nothing on it
but Rocks and Mountains, Desarts and Fields, and hollow Valleys,
and a wide Sea. Then secondly, We must in our imagination
empty this Chanel of the Sea, take out all the Waters that hinder
the sight of it, and look upon the dry Ditch, measure the depth
and breadth of it in our mind, and observe the manner of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
and in what a wild posture all the parts of it lie; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as it hath been formerly represented.<note place="margin">Chap. 10.</note> And lastly, We must
take off the cover of all Subterraneous places and deep Caverns, to
see the inside of the Earth; and lay bare the roots of Mountains,
to look into those holes and Vaults that are under them, fill'd some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with Fire, sometimes with Water, and sometimes with thick
Air and Vapours. The object being thus prepar'd, we are then to
look fix'dly upon it, and to pronounce what we think of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figur'd
mass, whether this Exteriour frame doth not seem to be
shatter'd; and whether it doth more aptly resemble a new-made
World, or the ruines of one broken. I confess when this <hi>Idea</hi> of
the Earth is present to my thoughts, I can no more believe that this
was the form wherein it was first produc'd, than if I had seen the
Temple of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in its ruines, when defac'd and sack'd by the
<hi>Babylonians,</hi> I could have perswaded my self that it had never been
in any other posture, and that <hi>Solomon</hi> had given orders for building
it so.</p>
                     <p>So much for the form of the Earth: It remains now that we
examine what causes have been assign'd by others of these irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the form of the Earth, which we explain by the dissolution
of it; what accounts any of the Ancients have given or attempted
to give, how the Earth swell'd into Mountains in certain places,
and in others was depress'd into low Valleys, how the body of it
was so broken, and how the Chanel of the Sea was made. The
Elements naturally lie in regular forms one above another, and
now we find them mixt, confounded and transpos'd, how comes
this disturbance and disordination in Nature? The Explications of
these things that have been given by others, may be reduc'd to two
general sorts, <hi>Philosophical</hi> or <hi>Theological,</hi> and we will try them
both for our satisfaction.</p>
                     <p>Of Philosophers none was more concern'd to give an account of
such things than <hi>Epicurus,</hi> both because he acknowledged the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
of the Earth to have been from a <hi>Chaos,</hi> and also admitted no
causes to act in Nature but Matter and Motion: Yet all the account
we have from the <hi>Epicureans</hi> of the form of the Earth, and the
great inequalities that are in it, is so slight and trivial, that methinks
it doth not deserve the name of a Philosophical Explication. They
say that the Earth and Water were mix'd at first, or rather the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41970:67"/>
Earth was above the Water, and as the Earth was condens'd by the
heat of the Sun, and the Winds, the Water was squeez'd out in
certain places, which either it found hollow or made so; and so
was the Chanel of the Sea made. Then as for Mountains, while
some parts of the Earth shrunk and sunk in this manner, others
would not sink, and these standing still while the others fell lower,
made the Mountains. How the subterraneous Cavities were made
according to them, I do not find.</p>
                     <p>This is all the Account that <hi>Monsieur Gassendi</hi> (who seems to have
made it his business, as well as his pleasure, to embellish that Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy)
can help us to out of the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Authors, how the Earth
came into this form; and he that can content himself with this, is,
in my mind, of an humour very easie to be pleas'd. Do the Sun
and the Wind use to squeaze pools of Water out of the Earth,
and that in such a quantity as to make an Ocean? They dry the
Earth, and the Waters too, and rarifie them into vapours, but I
never knew them to be the causes of pressing Water out of the
Earth by condensation. Could they compress the Earth any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
than by drying it and making it hard? and in proportion,
as it was more dry, would it not the more imbibe and suck up the
Water? and how were the great Mountains of the Earth made,
in the North and in the South, where the influence of the Sun is
not great? What sunk the Earth there, and made the flesh start
from the bones? But 'tis no wonder that <hi>Epicurus</hi> should give such
a mean account of the Origin of the Earth, and the form of its
parts, who did not so much as understand the general Figure of
the Body of it, that it was in some manner Spherical, or that the
Heavens encompast it round. One must have a blind love for that
Philosophy, and for the conclusions it drives at, not to see its lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and defects in those first and fundamental parts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aristotle,</hi> though he was not concern'd to give an account how
the Earth came into this present form, as he suppos'd it, Eternal;
yet upon another consideration he seems oblig'd to give some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
how the Elements came into this disorder; seeing he supposeth,
that, according to the order of Nature, the Water should lie above
the Earth in a Sphere, as the Air doth above the Water, and his
Fire above the Air. This he toucheth upon in his Meteors, but
so gently and fearfully, as if he was handling hot coals. He saith
the Sea is to be consider'd as the Element, or body of Waters that
belongs to this Earth, and that these Waters change places, and
the Sea is some Ages in one part of the Globe, and some Ages in
another; but that this is at such great distances of time that there
can be no memory or record of it. And he seems willing to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that the Water was once all over the Earth, but that it drid
up in certain places, and continuing in others, it there made the
Sea.</p>
                     <p>What a miserable account is this? As to his change or removal
of the Sea-chanel in several Ages, as it is without all proof or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,
if he mean it of the Chanel of the great Ocean, so 'tis
nothing to the purpose here; for the question is not why the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
of the Sea is in such a part of the Earth, rather than in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41970:67"/>
but why there is any such prodigious Cavity in or upon the
Earth any where. And if we take his supposition, that the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Water was once higher than the Earth, and lay in a Sphere
about it, then let him tell us in plain terms how the Earth got
above, or how the Cavity of the Ocean was made, and how the
the Mountains rise; for this Elementary Earth which lay under the
Water, was, I suppose, equal and smooth when it lay there; and
what reason was there, that the Waters should be dri'd in one
part of it, more than another, if they were every where of an
equal depth, and the ground equal under them? It was not the
Climates made any distinction, for there is Sea towards the Poles,
as well as under the Aequator; but suppose they were dri'd up in
certain places, that would make no Mountains, no more than there
are Mountains in our dri'd Marches: And the places where they
were not dri'd, would not therefore become as deep and hollow as
the Sea chanel, and tear the Earth and Rocks in pieces. If you
should say that this very Elementary Earth, as it lay under the
Waters, was unequal, and was so originally, form'd into Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
and Valleys, and great Cavities; besides, that the supposition
is altogether irrational in it self, you must suppose a prodigious
mass of Water to cover such an Earth; as much as we found re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
for the vulgar Deluge, namely, eight Oceans; and what then
is become of the other seven? Upon the whole I do not see that
either in <hi>Epicurus</hi>'s way, who seems to suppose that the Waters
were at first within the Earth; nor in <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s way, who seems
to suppose them upon the Earth, any rational or tolerable account
can be given of the present form of the Earth.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore some modern Authors, dissatisfied, as very well they
might be, with these Explications given us by the Ancients con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the form of the Earth, have pitch'd upon other causes, more
true indeed in their kind, and in their degree, but that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>all as
much short of those effects to which they would apply them. They
say that all the irregularities of the body of the Earth have risen
from Earthquakes in particular places, and from Torrents and
Inundations, and from eruptions of Fire, or such like causes,
whereof we see some instances more or less every Age; And these
have made that havock upon the face of the Earth, and turn'd
things up-side down, raising the Earth in some places, and making
great Cavities or Chasms in others, so as to have brought it at
length into that torn, broken, and disorderly form in which we
now see it.</p>
                     <p>These Authors do so far agree with us, as to acknowledge that
the present irregular form of the Earth must have proceeded from
ruines and dissolutions of one sort or other, but these ruines they
make to have been partial only, in this or in that Country, by
piece-meal, and in several Ages, and from no other causes but
such as still continue to act in Nature, namely, accidental Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes
and Eruptions of Fires and Waters. These causes we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
as readily as they do, but not as capable to produce so
great effects as they would ascribe to them; The surface of the
Earth may be a little changed by such accidents as these, but for
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41970:68"/>
the most part they rather sink the Mountains than raise new ones:
As when Houses are blown up by Mines of Powder, they are not
set higher, but generally fall lower and flatter: Or suppose they
do sometimes raise an Hill, or a little Mount, what's that to the
great Mountains of our World, to those long and vast piles of Rocks
and Stones, which the Earth can scarce bear? What's that to strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backt
<hi>Taurus</hi> or <hi>Atlas,</hi> to the <hi>American Andes,</hi> or to a Mountain that
reacheth from the <hi>Pyreneans</hi> to the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea? There's as much
difference between these and those factitious Mountains they speak
of, as betwixt them and Mole-hills.</p>
                     <p>And to answer more distinctly to this opinion, as before in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Islands we distinguish'd betwixt Factitious and Original
Islands, so, if you please, we may distinguish here betwixt Factiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Original Mountains; and allowing some few, and those of
the fifth or sixth magnitude, to have risen from such accidental
causes, we enquire concerning the rest and the greatest, what was
their Original? If we should suppose that the seven Hills upon
which <hi>Rome</hi> stands, came from ruines or eruptions, or any such
causes, it doth not follow that the <hi>Alps</hi> were made so too. And as
for Mountains, so for the Cavities of the Earth, I suppose there may
be disruptions sometimes made by Earthquakes, and holes worn by
subterraneous Fires and Waters; but what's that to the Chanel
of the <hi>Atlantick Ocean,</hi> or of the <hi>Pacifick Ocean,</hi> which is extended
an hundred and fifty degrees under the Aequator, and towards the
Poles still further. He that should derive such mighty things from
no greater causes, I should think him a very credulous Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.
And we are too subject indeed to that fault of credulity in
matter of Philosophizing; Many when they have found out causes
that are proper for certain effects within such a compass, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
keep them there, but they will make them do every thing for
them; and extend them often to other effects of a superiour nature
or degree, which their activity can by no means reach to. <hi>Aetna</hi>
hath been a burning Mountain ever since and above the memory
of Man, yet it hath not destroy'd that Island, nor made any new
Chanel to the Sea, though it stands so near it. Neither is <hi>Vesuvius</hi>
above two or three miles distant from the Sea-side, to the best of
my remembrance, and yet in so many Ages it hath made no pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
to it, neither open nor subterraneous. 'Tis true some <hi>Isthmus</hi>'s
have been thrown down by Earthquakes, and some Lakes have
been made in that manner, but what's this to a Ditch nine thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
miles broad? such an one we have upon the Earth, and of
a depth that is not measurable; what proportion have these causes
to such an instance? and how many thousand Ages must be allow'd
to them to do their work, more than the Chronology of our Earth
will bear?</p>
                     <p>Besides, When were these great Earthquakes and disruptions,
that did such great execution upon the body of the Earth? Was
this before the Flood or since? If before, then the old difficulty
returns, how could there be a Flood, if the Earth was in this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous
form before that time? This, I think, is demonstrated
impossible in the Second and Third Chapters. If since the Flood,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41970:68"/>
where were the Waters of the Earth before these Earthquakes made
a Chanel for them? Besides, Where is the History or Tradition
that speaks of these strange things, and of this great change of the
Earth? Hath any writ of the Origins of the <hi>Alps?</hi> In what year
of <hi>Rome,</hi> or what <hi>Olympiad</hi> they were born? Or how they grew
from little ones? how the Earth groan'd when it brought them forth,
when its bowels were torn by the ragged Rocks? Do the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles
of the Nations mention these things, or ancient fame, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fables? were they made all at once, or in successive Ages?
These causes continue still in Nature, we have still Earthquakes and
subterraneous Fires and Waters, why should they not still operate
and have the same effects? We often hear of Cities thrown down
by Earthquakes; or Countries swallow'd up, but whoever heard
of a new chain of Mountains made upon the Earth, or a new Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
made for the Ocean? We do not read that there hath been so
much as a new <hi>Sinus</hi> of the Sea ever since the memory of Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Which is far more feasible than what they pretend. And things of
this nature being both strange and sensible, excite admiration and
great attention when they come to pass, and would certainly have
been remembred or propagated in some way or other, if they had ever
happen'd since the Deluge. They have recorded the foundation of
Cities and Monarchies, the appearance of Blazing Stars, the erupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of fiery Mountains, the most remarkable Earthquakes and Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
the great Eclipses or obscurations of the Sun, and any thing
that look'd strange or prodigy-like, whether in the Heavens or on
Earth: And these which would have been the greatest prodigles
and greatest changes that ever happen'd in nature, would these have
escap'd all observation and memory of Men? That's as incredible
as the things themselves are.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, To comprehend all these opinions together, both of the
Ancient and Modern Authors, they seem all to agree with us in
this, <hi>That</hi> the Earth was once under another form; otherwise why
do they go about to shew the causes how it came into this form.
I desire then to know what form they suppose the Earth to have
been under before the Mountains were made, the Chanel of the
Sea, or subterraneous Cavities. Either they must take that form
which we have assign'd it before th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Deluge, or else they must sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it cover'd with Water, till the Sea-chanels were made, and the
Mountains brought forth;<note place="margin">Fig. 2. p. 37.</note> as in that Fig. <hi>pag.</hi> 37. And no doubt
it was once in this form, both reason and the authority of <hi>Moses</hi>
assures us of it; and this is the Test which every opinion must be
brought to, <hi>how</hi> the Earth-emerg'd out of that watery form? and
in particular, as to that opinion which we are now examining, the
question is, <hi>how</hi> by Earthquakes, and fiery eruptions, subterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Waters, and such like causes, the body of the Earth could be
wrought from that form to this present form? And the thing is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
at first sight; for such causes as these could not take place
in such an Earth. As for subterraneous Waters, there could be
none at that time, for they were all above ground; and as for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
Exhalations, whether Fiery or Aery, there was no place
for them neither, for the Earth when it lay under the Water was a
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41970:69"/>
solid uniform mass, compact and close united in its parts, as we
have shewn before upon several occasions; no Mines or hollow
Vaults for the Vapours to be lodg'd in, no Store-houses of Fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
nothing that could make Earthquakes, nor any sort of ruines or
eruptions: These are Engines that cannot play but in an Earth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
broken, hollow, and cavernous. Therefore the Authors of
this opinion do in effect beg the question; they assign such causes
of the present form of the Earth, as could not take place, nor have
any activity until the Earth was in this form: These causes may
contribute something to increase the rudeness and inequalities of the
Earth in certain places, but they could not be the original causes
of it: And that not only because of their disproportion to such
effects, but also because of their incapacity, or non-existence at that
time when these effects were to be wrought.</p>
                     <p>Thus much concerning the Philosophical opinions, or the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Causes that have been assign'd for the irregular form of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Earth. Let us now consider the Theological opinions, how
Mountains were made at first, and the wonderful Chanel of the Sea:
And these Authors say, God Almighty made them immediately
when he made the World; and so dispatcht the business in a few
words. This is a short account indeed, but we must take heed
that we do not derogate from the perfection of God, by ascribing
all things promiscuously to his immediate action. I have often sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
that the first order of things is regular and simple, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as the Divine Nature is; and continues so till there is some
degeneracy in the moral World; I have also noted upon several
occasions, especially in the <hi>Lat. Treat. Cap. II.</hi> the deformity and
incommodiousness of the present Earth; and from these two consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
we may reasonably infer, that the present state of the
Earth was not Original, but is a state of subjection to Vanity,
wherein it must continue till the redemption and restitution of all
things.</p>
                     <p>But besides this general consideration, there are many others, both
Natural and Theological against this opinion, which the Authors
of it,<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> Ep. Chap. 3. 5, 6.</note> I believe, will find unanswerable. As first, S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
betwixt the present Earth and the Ante-diluvian; and
that in opposition to certain profane persons, who seem to have
been of the same opinion with these Authors, namely, That the
Heavens and the Earth were the same now that they had been from
the beginning, and that there had been no change in Nature, either
of late, or in former Ages; These S. <hi>Peter</hi> confutes and upbraids
them with ignorance or forgetfulness of the change that was brought
upon Nature at the Deluge, or that the Ante-diluvian Heavens and
Earth were of a different form and constitution from the present,
whereby that World was obnoxious to a Deluge of Water, as the
present is to a Deluge of Fire. Let these Authors put themselves
in the place of those Objectors, and see what answer they can make
to the Apostle, whom I leave to dispute the case with them. I hope
they will not treat this Epistle of S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s so rudely as <hi>Didymus
Alexandrinus</hi> did, an ancient Christian, and one of S. <hi>Ierom</hi>'s Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
he was of the same opinion with these Theological Authors,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41970:69"/>
and so fierce in it, that seeing S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s doctrine here to be contrary,
he said this Epistle of S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s was corrupted, and was not to be
receiv'd into the Canon. And all this because it taught that the
Heavens and the Earth had chang'd their form, and would do so
again at the Conflagration; so as the same World would be T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
in success of time. We acknowledge his Exposition of S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s
words to be very true, but what he makes an argument of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of this Epistle, is rather, in my mind, a peculiar argument
of its Divine Inspiration. In the second place, these Writers dash
upon the old rock, the impossibility of explaining the Deluge, if
there were Mountains from the beginning, and the Earth then in
the same form as it is in now. Thirdly, They make the state of
<hi>Paradise</hi> as unintelligible as that of the Deluge; For those proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that are assign'd to <hi>Paradise</hi> by the Ancients, are inconsistent
with the present form of the Earth: As will appear in the Second
Book. Lastly, They must answer, and give an account of all those
marks which we have observ'd in Nature (both in this Chapter,
and the Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh,) of fractions, ruines, and
dissolutions that have been on the Earth, and which we have shown
to be inexplicable, unless we admit that the Earth was once in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
form.</p>
                     <p>These arguments being premis'd, let us now bring their opinion
close to the Test, and see in what manner these Mountains must
have been made according to them, and how the Chanel of the
Sea, and all other Cavities of the Earth. Let us to this purpose
consider the Earth again in that transient incompleat form which it
had when the Abyss encompast the whole body of it;<note place="margin">Fig. 2. p. 37.</note> we both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
that the Earth was once in this state, and they say that it came
immediately out of this state into its present form, there being
made by a supernatural Power a great Chanel or Ditch in one
part of it, which drew off the Waters from the rest, and the Earth
which was squeez'd and forc'd out of this Ditch, made the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.
So there is the Chanel of the Sea made, and the Mountains
of the Earth; how the subterraneous Cavities were made according
to these Authors, I do not well know. This I confess seems to me
a very gross thought, and a way of working very un-God-like;
but however let's have patience to examine it.</p>
                     <p>And in the first place, if the Mountains were taken out of the
Chanel of the Sea, then they are equal to it, and would fill it up
if they were thrown in again. But these proportions upon exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
will not agree; for though the Mountains of the Earth
be very great, yet they do not equal by much the great Ocean.
The Ocean extends to half the surface of the Earth; and if you
suppose the greatest depth of the Ocean to answer the height of the
greatest Mountains, and the middle depth to the middle sort of
Mountains, the Mountains ought to cover all the dry Land to make
them answer to all the capacity of the Ocean; whereas we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
them upon a reasonable computation to cover but the tenth
part of the dry Land; and consequently, neither they, nor the
Sea-chanel, could have been produc'd in this manner, because of
their great disproportion to one another. And the same thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41970:70"/>
if we compare the Mountains with the Abyss, which cover'd
the Earth before this Chanel was made; for this Chanel being
made great enough to contain all the Abyss, the Mountains taken
out of it must also be equal to all the Abyss, but the aggregate of
the Mountains will not answer this by many degrees; for suppose
the Abyss was but half as deep as the deep Ocean, to make this
Calculus answer, all the dry Land ought to be cover'd with Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and with Mountains as high as the Ocean is deep, or doubly
high to the depth of the Abyss, because they are but upon one
half of the Globe. And this is the first argument against the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal
production of Mountains and the Sea, their incongruency
or disproportion.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, We are to consider that a great many Mountains of
the Earth are far distant from any Seas, as the great in-land Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of <hi>Asia</hi> and of <hi>Africk,</hi> and the <hi>Sarmatick</hi> Mountains, and others
in <hi>Europe,</hi> how were these great bodies slung thorow the Air from
their respective Seas, whence they were taken, to those places
where they stand? What appearance is there in common reason, or
credibility, that these huge masses of Earth and Stone that stand
in the middle of Continents, were dug out of any Seas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We
think it strange, and very deservedly, that a little Chapel should
be transported from <hi>Palestine</hi> to <hi>Italy</hi> over Land and Sea, much more
the transportation of Mount <hi>Atlas</hi> or <hi>Taurus</hi> thorow the Air, or of
a range of Mountains two or three thousand miles long, would
surely upon all accounts appear incongruous and incredible: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
neither the hollow form of Mountains, nor the stony matter
whereof they commonly consist, agrees with that supposition, that
they were prest or taken out of the Chanel of the Sea.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, We are to consider that the Mountains are not barely laid
upon the Earth, as a Tomb-stone upon a Grave, nor stand as Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
do upon a Pedestal, as this opinion seems to suppose; but
they are one continued substance with the body of the Earth, and
their roots reach into the Abyss; as the Rocks by the Sea-side go
as deep as the bottom of the Sea in one continu'd mass: And 'tis
a ridiculous thing to imagine the Earth first a plain surface, then
all the Mountains set upon it, as Hay-cocks in a Field, standing
upon their flat bottoms. There is no such common surface in
Nature, nor consequently any such super-additions: 'Tis all one
frame or mass, only broken and disjoynted in the parts of it. To
conclude, 'Tis not only the Mountains that make the inequalities
of the Earth, or the irregularity of its surface, every Country,
every Province, every Field hath an unequal and different situation,
higher or lower, inclin'd more or less, and sometimes one way,
sometimes another, you can scarce take a miles compass in any place
where the surface of the ground continues uniform; and can you
imagine that there were Moulds or Stones brought from the Sea-chanel
to make all those inequalities? Or that Earthquakes have
been in every County, and in every Field? The inner Veins and
Lares, the beds or Strata of the Earth are also broken as well as the
surface. These must proceed from universal causes, and all those
that have been alledg'd, whether from Philosophy or Theology,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41970:70"/>
are but particular or Topical. I am fully satisfied, in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of these things, and so I think every unprejudic'd person may
be, that to such an irregular variety of situation and construction,
as we see every where in the parts of the Earth, nothing could an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
but some universal concussion or dislocation, in the nature of
a general ruine.</p>
                     <p>We have now finisht this first part of our Theory, and all that
concerns the Deluge or dissolution of the Earth; and we have not
only establisht our own <hi>Hypothesis</hi> by positive arguments, but also
produc'd and examin'd all suppositions that have been offer'd
by others, whether Philosophical or Theological, for the Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the same things; so as nothing seems now to remain fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon this subject. For a conclusion of all, we will consider,
if you please, the rest of the Earths, or of the Planets within our
Heavens, that appertain to the same common Sun; to see, so far
as we can go by rational conjectures, if they be not of the same
Fabrick, and have undergone the like fate, and forms with our
Earth. It is now acknowledg'd by the generality of Learned Men,
that the Planets are Opake bodies, and particularly our next neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
the Moon, is known to be a Terraqueous Globe, consisting of
Mountains and Valleys, as our Earth does; and we have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to believe but that she came into that form by a dissolution,
or from like causes as our Earth did. <hi>Mercury</hi> is so near the Sun,
that we cannot well discern his face, whether spotted or no, nor
make a judgment of it. But as for <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> if the spots
that be observed in them be their Waters or their Sea, as they are
in the Moon, 'tis likely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They are also Terraqueous Globes, and
in much what a like form with the Moon and the Earth, and, for
ought we know, from like causes. Particularly as to <hi>Venus,</hi> 'tis
a remarkable passage that S. <hi>Austin</hi> hath preserv'd out of <hi>Varro,</hi> he
saith,<note place="margin">De Civ. Dei lib. 21. c. 8.</note> That <hi>about the time of the great Deluge there was a wonderful
alteration or Catastrophe happen'd to the Planet</hi> Venus, <hi>and that she
chang'd her Colour, form, figure, and magnitude.</hi> This is a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
that she suffer'd her dissolution about the same time that
our Earth did. I do not know that any such thing is recorded
concerning any of the other Planets, but the body of <hi>Mars</hi> looks
very rugged, broken, and much disorder'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> deserve a distinct consideration, as having
something particular and different from the rest of the Planets.
<hi>Saturn</hi> is remarkable for his <hi>Hoop</hi> or Ring, which seems to stand
off, or higher than his body, and would strongly induce one to
believe, that the exteriour Earth of that Planet, at its dissolution,
did not all fall in, but the Polar parts sinking into the Abyss, the
middle or Aequinoctial parts still subsisted, and bore themselves up
in the nature of an Arch about the Planet, or of a Bridge, as it
were, built over the Sea of <hi>Saturn.</hi> And as some have observ'd
concerning the figure of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> that it is not wholly Sphaerical,
but a Sphaeroid, protuberant in the Aequator, and deprest towards
the Poles: So I should suspect <hi>Saturn</hi> to have been much more
so, before his disruption: Namely, That the Body of that Planet
in its first state, was more flat and low towards the Poles, and also
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41970:71"/>
weaker and thinner: and about the Aequator higher, fuller and
stronger Built: By reason of which figure and construction the
Polar parts did more easily fall in, or were suckt in (as Cupping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glasses
draw in the Flesh) when the Abyss below grew more emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Whereas the middle parts about the Aequator, being a more
just Arch and strongly built, would not yield or sink, but stood
firm and unbroken, and continues still in its first posture. Planets
break in different ways, according to the quality of their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the manner of their construction, and the Nature of the
Causes that act upon them. Their dissolutions are sometimes
total, as in our Earth, sometimes partial: and both of these
may be under great variety. In partial dissolutions, the middle
parts sometimes stand, and the Polar are broke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the Polar
stand and the middle are broke. Or one Hemisphere, or part of
an Hemisphere may be sunk, the rest standing. There may be
Causes and occasions for all these varieties and many more, in
diversifying the Phaenomena of an immense Universe. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to <hi>Saturn.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That this present uncouth form of <hi>Saturn</hi> was not its Original
form, I am very well satisfied, if that Planet rise from a Chaos,
as ours did. And if this be an adventitious form, I know no
account can be given of it with more probability, than by sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
it the effect of some fraction or disruption in the Polar
parts. Neither do I know any Phaenomenon hitherto observ'd
concerning <hi>Saturn,</hi> that does disprove this Hypothesis or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture.</p>
                     <p>As to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> that Planet without doubt is also turned about
its Axis, otherwise how shou'd its four Moons be carried round
him? And this is also collected from the motion of that perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Spot (if it be found to be so) that is upon its Body. Which
Spot I take to be either a Lake, or a Chasm and <hi>Hiatus</hi> into the
Abyss of the Planet: That is, part of the Abyss open or unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd,
like the Aperture we made in the Seventh Figure. And this
might either have been left so by Providence,<note place="margin">Chap. 6. p. 46.</note> at first, for some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and causes fitting that Earth: or it may have fallen in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
as <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Atlantis,</hi> or as <hi>So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>m</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> for some judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon part of that World.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, Seeing all the Planets that are plac'd in this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and are the foster-children of this Sun, seem to have some
affinity one with another, and have much-what the same counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and the same general <hi>Phaenomena;</hi> It seems probable that
they rise much-what the same way, and after the like manner as
our Earth, each one from its respective Chaos; And that they
had the same Elementary Regions at first, and an exteriour Orb
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>orm'd over their Abyss: And lastly, That every one of them hath
suffer'd, or is to suffer its Deluge, as our Earth hath done. These,
I say, are probable conjectures according to the Analogy of Reason
and Nature, so far as we can judge concerning things very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
and inaccessible.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:41970:71"/>
And these things being thus, and our Theory of the Deluge,
and the Dissolution which brought it, having such a general agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
both with our Heavens and our Earth, I think there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the uncouthness of the thing to some mens understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
the custom of thinking otherwise, and the uneasiness of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into a new set of thoughts, that can be a bar or hindrance
to its reception. But it may be improv'd, I doubt not, in many
respects, and in some particularities rectified. The first attempts
in great Things are seldom or never perfect: Such is the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our Understandings, and the want of a full Natural Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
And in assigning Causes of such great effects, fair conjectures
are to be allow'd, till they be displac'd by others more evident
and more certain. Accordingly I readily submit to these terms,
and leave this, and all other parts of the Theory, to further exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
and enquiries.</p>

An Earth rais'd from the rudiments of a Chaos,
and dissolv'd and destroy'd in an Universal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge.
We have given also an imperfect descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that primaeval Earth, so far as was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to shew the Causes and manner of its dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But we must not content our selves with
this; Seeing that Earth was the first Theater upon which Mortals
appear'd and acted, and continued so for above Sixteen Hundred
Years; and that with Scenes, as both Reason and History tell us,
very extraordinary and very different from these of our present
Earth, 'tis reasonable we should endeavour to make a more full
discovery and description of it; Especially seeing <hi>Paradise</hi> was there;
that seat of pleasure which our first Parents lost, and which all their
posterity have much ado to find again.</p>
                     <p>In the First Book we so far describ'd This New-found World,
as to shew it very different in form and fabrick from the present
Earth; there was no Sea there, no Mountains, nor Rocks, nor
broken Caves, 'twas all one continued and regular mass, smooth,
simple and compleat, as the first works of Nature use to be. But
to know thus much only, doth rather excite our curiosity than
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41970:74"/>
satisfie it; what were the other properties of this World? how
were the Heavens, how the Elements? what accommodation for
humane life? why was it more proper to be the seat of <hi>Paradise</hi>
than the present Earth? Unless we know these things, you will
say, it will seem but an aëry <hi>Idea</hi> to us; and 'tis certain that the
more properties and particular<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ties that we know concerning any
thing, the more real it appears to be.</p>
                     <p>As it was our chief design therefore in the precedent Book, to
give an account of the Universal Deluge, by way of a Theory; so
we propose to our selves chiefly in this Book, from the same Theory
to give an account of <hi>Paradise;</hi> and in performing of this, we shall
be led into a more full examination and display of that first Earth,
and of its qualities. And if we be so happy, as by the conduct of
the same principles and the same method, to give as fair an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
and as intelligible of the state of <hi>Paradise</hi> in that Original
Earth, as we have done of the Deluge by the dissolution of it, and
of the form of this Earth which succeeded, one must be very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose
or melancholy to imagine that the grounds we go upon, all this
while, are wholly false or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ictitious. A foundation which will bear
the weight of two Worlds without sinking, must surely stand upon
a firm Rock. And I am apt to promise my self that this Theory of
the Earth will find acceptance and credit, more or less, with all but
those, that think it a sufficient answer to all arguments, to say <hi>it
is a Novelty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to proceed in our disquisition concerning <hi>Paradise,</hi> we may
note, in the first place, two opinions to be avoided, being both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams;
one that placeth <hi>Paradise</hi> in the extra-mundane Regions,
or in the Air, or in the Moon, and the other that makes it so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable,
as to be confin'd to a little spot of ground in <hi>Mesopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamia,</hi>
or some other Country of <hi>Asia,</hi> the Earth being now as it
was then. This offends as much in the defect, as the other in the
excess. For it is not any single Region of the Earth that can be
<hi>Paradisiacal,</hi> unless all Nature conspire, and a certain Order of
things proper and peculiar for that state. Nor is it of less importance
to find out this peculiar Order of things, than to find out the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
seat of <hi>Paradise,</hi> but rather pre-requisite to it: We will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
therefore to discover and determine both, so far as a Theory
can go, beginning with that which is more general.</p>
                     <p>'Tis certain there were some qualities and conditions of <hi>Paradise</hi>
that were not meerly Topical, but common to all the rest of the
Earth at that time; and these we must consider in the first place,
examine what they were, and upon what they depended. History,
both Sacred and Profane, must tell us what they were, and our
Theory must shew us upon what causes they depended. I had once,
I confess, propos'd to my self another method, independent upon
History or Effects; I thought to have continued the description of
the Primitive or Ante-diluvian Earth from the contemplation of its
causes only, and then left it to the judgment of others to determine,
whether that was not the Earth where the Golden Age was past,
and where <hi>Paradise</hi> stood. For I had observ'd three conditions or
characters of it, which I thought were sufficient to answer all that
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41970:74"/>
we knew concerning that first state of things, <hi>viz. The regularity of
its surface; The situation or posture of its Body to the Sun; and the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of it:</hi> From these three general causes, I thought might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d
all the chief differences of that Earth from the present, and
particularly those that made it more capable of being <hi>Paradisiacal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But upon second thoughts I judg'd it more useful and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to lay aside the Causes at present, and begin with the Effects,
that we might have some sensible matter to work upon. Bare <hi>Idea</hi>'s
of things are lookt upon as Romantick till Effects be propos'd,
whereof they are to give an account; 'Tis that makes us value the
Causes when necessity puts us upon enquiry after them; and the
reasons of things are very acceptable, when they ease the mind,
anxious, and at a loss, how to understand Nature without their help.
We will therefore, without more ado, premise those things that
have been taken notice of as extraordinary and peculiar to the
first Ages of the World, and to <hi>Paradise,</hi> and which neither
do, nor can, obtain in the present Earth; whereof the first is a
<hi>perpetual Spring or Equinox;</hi> The second, the <hi>Long aevity of Animals,</hi>
and the third <hi>Their production out of the Earth,</hi> and the great ferti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the soil in all other things.</p>
                     <p>These difficulties guard the way to <hi>Paradise</hi> like the flaming
Sword, and must be remov'd before we can enter; these are general
Preliminaries which we must explain before we proceed to enquire
after the particular place of this Garden of Pleasure. The Ancients
have taken notice of all these in the first Ages of the World, or in
their <hi>Golden Age,</hi> as they call it; and I do not doubt but what they
ascrib'd to the Golden Age, was more remarkably true of <hi>Paradise;</hi>
yet was not so peculiar to it, but that it did in a good measure
extend to other parts of the Earth at that time. And 'tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
that their Golden Age was contemporary with our <hi>Paradise;</hi>
for they make it begin immediately after the production and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation
of the Earth (which They, as well as <hi>Moses,</hi> raise from
the Chaos) and to degenerate by degrees till the Deluge; when the
World ended and begun again.</p>
                     <p>That this parallel may the better appear, we may observe, that
as we say that the whole Earth was, in some sence, Paradisiacal
in the first Ages of the World, and that there was besides, one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
or Portion of it that was peculiarly so, and bore the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of <hi>Paradise;</hi> So the Ancients besides their Golden Age;
which was common to all the Earth, noted some parts of it that
were more Golden, if I may so say, than the rest, and which did
more particularly answer to <hi>Paradise;</hi> as their <hi>Elysian</hi> Fields, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Islands, Gardens of <hi>Hesperides, Alcinous, &amp;c.</hi> these had a
double portion of pleasantness, and besides the advantages which
they had common with the rest of the Earth at that time, had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
proper and singular, which gave them a distinct consideration
and character from the rest.</p>
                     <p>Having made this observation, let us proceed, and see what An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
saith concerning that first and Paradisiacal state of things,
upon those three Heads forementioned; First, That there was a
perpetual Spring, and constant serenity of the Air; This is often
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41970:75"/>
repeated by the Ancient Poets, in their description of the Golden
Age:

<q>
                           <l>Iupiter antiqui contraxit tempora Veris, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </l>
                           <l>When <hi>Jove</hi> begun to reign he chang'd the Year,</l>
                           <l>And for one Spring four Seasons made appear.</l>

                     </p>
                     <p>The Ancients suppos'd, that in the reign of <hi>Saturn,</hi> who was an
Ante-diluvian God, as I may so call him, Time flow'd with a more
even motion, and there was no diversity of Seasons in the Year;
but <hi>Iupiter,</hi> they say, first introduc'd that, when he came to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
affairs. This is exprest after their way, who seldom give
any severe and Philosophical accounts of the changes of Nature.
And as they suppos'd this perpetual Spring in the Golden Age, so
they did also in their particular <hi>Elysiums;</hi> as I could shew largely
from their Authors, if it would not multiply Citations too much.
'Tis true, their <hi>Elysiums</hi> respected the New Heavens, and New Earth
to come, rather than the past, but they are both fram'd upon the
same model, and have common properties.</p>
                     <p>The Christian Authors have no less celebrated the perpetual
Spring and Serenity of the Heavens in <hi>Paradise;</hi> such expressions or
descriptions you will find in <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> S. <hi>Basil, Damascen, Isi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore

                        <note place="margin">De Grat. prim. hom.</note> and others; insomuch that <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> I remember,
reflecting upon those Characters of <hi>Paradise,</hi> which many of the
Fathers have given in these respects, saith, Such things could not
be, unless the Sun had then another course from what he hath now;
or which is more easie, the Earth another situation. Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
will hereafter appear to have been well-grounded. In the
mean time, let us see the Christian Poetry upon this subject, as we

                     <p>And as the Christian Authors, so likewise the <hi>Iewish</hi> have spoken
of <hi>Paradise</hi> in the same manner; they tell us also that the days
there were always of the same length throughout the whole Year;
and that made them fancy <hi>Paradise</hi> to lie under the Aequinoctial;
as we shall see in its due place. 'Tis true, we do not find these
things mention'd expresly in the Sacred Writings, but the Effects
that flow'd from them are recorded there, and we may reasonably
suppose providence to have foreseen, that when those Effects came
to be scan'd and narrowly lookt into, they would lead us to a di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the Causes, and particularly of this great and general
Cause, that <hi>perpetual Aequinox</hi> and unity of seasons in the Year,
till the Deluge. The Longaevity of the Ante-diluvians cannot be
explain'd upon any other supposition, as we shall have occasion to
show hereafter; and that you know is recorded carefully in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:
As also that there was no <hi>Rainbow</hi> before the Flood; which
goes upon the same ground, that there was no variety of Seasons,
nor any Rain: And this by many is thought to be understood by
<hi>Moses</hi> his words, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 5, 6. which he speaks of the first and Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disiacal
Earth. Lastly, Seeing the Earth then brought forth the
principles of life and all living Creatures (Man excepted) according
to <hi>Moses, Gen.</hi> 1. 24. we must suppose that the state of the Heavens
was such as favour'd these Conceptions and Births, which could
not possibly be brought to perfection, as the Seasons of the Year are
at present. The first time that we have mention made in Scripture
of Summer and Winter, and the differences of Seasons, is at the
ending of the Deluge. <hi>Gen. 8. 22. Hence forward all the days of the
Earth, Seed-time and Harvest, Heat and Cold, Summer and Winter,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41970:76"/>
Day and Night shall not cease.</hi> 'Tis true these words are so lax, that
they may be understood either of a new course of Nature then insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted,
or of an old one restor'd; but seeing it doth appear from
other arguments and considerations, that there was at that time a
new course of Nature constituted, it is more reasonable to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
the words in that sence; which, as it is agreeable to truth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Reason and Antiquity; so it renders that remark of
<hi>Moses</hi> of far greater importance, if it be understood as an indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a new order then setled in Nature, which should continue
thenceforwards so long as the Earth endur'd. Nor do I at all won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that such things should not be expresly and positively declar'd
in Scripture, for Natural Mysteries in the Holy Writings, as well
as Prophetical, are many times, on set purpose, incompleatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd,
so as to awaken and excite our thoughts rather than fully
resolve them: This being often more suitable to the designs of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
in the government of the World. But thus much for this
first common or general Character of the Golden Age, and of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,</hi>
a <hi>perpetual Serenity and perpetual Aequinox.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The second Character is the Longaevity of Men, and, as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
of all other Animals in proportion. This, methinks, is as
strange and surprising as the other; and I know no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Ante-diluvian World and the present, so apt to affect
us, if we reflect upon it, as this wonderful disproportion in the
Ages of Men; Our fore-fathers and their Posterity; They liv'd
seven, eight, nine hundred Years and upwards, and 'tis a wonder
now if a Man live to one hundred. Our Oakes do not last so long
as their Bodies did; Stone and Iron would scarce out-wear them.
And this property of the first Ages, or their Inhabitants, how
strange soever, is well attested, and beyond all exception, having
the joynt consent of Sacred and Profane History. The Scripture
sets down the precise Age of a s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ries of Ante diluvian Patriarchs,
and by that measures the time from the beginning of the World
to the Deluge; so as all Sacred Chronology stand upon that bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.
Yet I know some have thought this so improbable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous
a thing, that to save the credit of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Sacred
History, they interpret these years of <hi>Lunar</hi> years or months; and
so the Ages of these Patriarchs are reduc'd to much what the same
measure with the common life of man at this time. It may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
in this, as in many other instances, that for want of a Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to make things credible and intelligibile, men of wit and parts
have often deprest the sence of Scripture; and that not out of any ill
will to Scripture or Religion, but because they could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
upon the stock of their notions, give themselves a rational
account of things recorded there. But I hope when we come to
explain the Causes of this Longaevity, we shall shew that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togeth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>r
us strange a thing that Men should have such short lives as
they have now, as that they had such long lives in the first Ages
of the World. In the mean time, there are a great many collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
reasons to assure us that <hi>Lunar</hi> years cannot be here understood
by <hi>Moses,</hi> for all Antiquity gives the same account of those first
Ages of the World, and of the first Men, that they were extremely
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:41970:76"/>
long-liv'd. We meet with it generally in the description of the
Golden Age; and not only so, but in their Topical <hi>Paradises</hi> also
they always suppos'd a great vivacity or longaevity in those that
enjoy'd them.<note place="margin">Book 1. Ch. 4. Iew. Ant.</note> And <hi>Iosephus</hi> speaking upon this subject, saith, the
Authors of all the learned Nations, <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Barbarians,</hi> bear
witness to <hi>Moses</hi>'s doctrine in this particular. And in the <hi>Mosaical</hi>
History it self, there are several circumstances and marks that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
plainly, that the years of the Patriarchs cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of <hi>Lunar</hi> years;<note place="margin">Chap. 4.</note> as we shall have occasion to show in another
place. We proceed in the mean time to the third and last Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
The extraordinary fertility of the Soil, and the production
of Animals out of the new-made Earth.</p>
                     <p>The first part of this Character is unquestionable; All Antiquity
speaks of the plenty of the Golden Age, and of their <hi>Paradises,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Christian or Heathen. The fruits of the Earth at first were
spontaneous, and the ground without being torn and tormented,
satisfied the wants or desires of Man. When Nature was fresh
and full, all things flow'd from her more easily and more pure, like
the first running of the Grape, or the Hony-comb; but now she
must be prest and squeez'd, and her productions taste more of the
Earth and of bitterness. The Ancient Poets have often pleas'd
themselves in making descriptions of this happy state, and in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
the riches and liberality of Nature at that time, but we
need not transcribe their Poetry here, seeing this point is not, I think,
contested by any. The second part of this Character, concerning
the spontaneous Origin of living Creatures out of that first Earth,
is not so unquestionable, and as to Man, <hi>Moses</hi> plainly implies that
there was a particular action or ministery of Providence in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of his Body, but as to other Animals He seems to suppose
that the Earth brought them forth as it did Herbs and Plants.
<hi>(Gen.</hi> 1. 24. compar'd with the 11. Vers.) And the truth is, there is
no such great difference betwixt Vegetable and Animal Eggs, or
betwixt the Seeds out of which Plants rise, and the Eggs out of
which all Animals rise, but that we may conceive, the one as well
as the other, in the first Earth: And as some warmth and influence
from the Sun is requir'd for the Vegetation of Seeds, so that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
or impregnation which is necessary to make Animal Eggs
fruitful, was imputed by the Ancients to the <hi>Aether,</hi> or to an
active and pure Element which had the same effect upon our great
Mother the Earth, as the irradiation of the Male hath upon the
Females Eggs.

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41970:77"/>
it not only to all brute Creatures, but to Mankind also, whom he
suppos'd to grow out of the Earth in great numbers, in several Parts
and Countries, like other Animals; which is a notion contrary to
the Sacred Writings; for they declare, that all Mankind, though
diffus'd now through the several parts and Regions of the Earth,
rise at first from one Head or single Man and Woman; which is a
Conclusion of great importance, and that could not, I think, by the
Light of Nature, have ever been discover'd. And this makes the
<hi>Epicurean</hi> opinion the more improbable, for why should two rise
only, if they sprung from the Earth? or how could they rise in their
full growth and perfection, as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> did? But as for the
opinion of Animals rising out of the Earth at first, that was not at
all peculiar to <hi>Epicurus;</hi> The <hi>Stoicks</hi> were of the same mind, and
the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> and the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and, I think, all that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
the Earth to rise from a Chaos. Neither do I know any harm
in that opinion, if duly limited and stated; for what inconvenience
is it, or what diminution of Providence, that there should be the
principles of Life, as well as the principles of Vegetation, in the
new Earth? And unless you suppose all the first Animals, as well
as the first Man, to have been made at one stroke, in their full growth
and perfection, which we have neither reason nor authority suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to believe; if they were made young, little and weak, as they
come now into the World, there seems to be no way for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
more proper, and decorous, than that they should spring from
their great Mother the Earth. Lastly, considering the innumerable
little Creatures that are upon the Earth, Insects and Creeping things:
and that these were not created out of nothing, but form'd out of
the ground: I think that an office most proper for Nature, that
can set so many hands to work at once; and that hath hands fit
for all those little operations or manufactures, how small soever,
that would less become the dignity of Superiour Agents.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for the Preliminaries, or three general Characters of
<hi>Paradise,</hi> which were common to it with the rest of the Primae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
Earth; and were the chief ingredients of the Golden Age, so
much celebrated by the Ancients. I know there were several other
differences betwixt that Earth and this, but these are the original;
and such as are not necessary to be premis'd for the general Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of <hi>Paradise,</hi> we reserve for another place. We may, in
the mean time observe, how preposterously they go to work, that
set themselves immediately to find out some pleasant place of the
Earth to six <hi>Paradise</hi> in, before they have consider'd, or laid any
grounds, to explain the general conditions of it, wheresoever it was.
These must be first known and determin'd, and we must take our
aim and directions from these, how to proceed further in our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries
after it; otherwise we fail without a Compass, or seek a
Port and know not which way it lies. And as we should think him a
very unskilful Pilot that sought a place in the New World, or <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi>
that really was in the Old; so they commit no less an error,
that seek <hi>Paradise</hi> in the present Earth, as now constituted, which
could only belong to the former, and to the state of the first World:

                     <p>
                        <hi>THE Scheme of this World passeth away,</hi> saith an holy Author:
The mode and form, both of the Natural and Civil World,
changeth continually more or less, but most remarkably at certain
Periods, when all Nature puts on another face; as it will do at the
Conflagration, and hath done already from the time of the Deluge.
We may imagine how different a prospect the first World would
make from what we see now in the present state of things, if we
consider only those generals by which we have describ'd it in the
foregoing Chapter, and what their influence would be upon Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
and the rest of Nature. For every new state of Nature doth
introduce a new Civil Order, and a new face and Oeconomy of
Humane affairs: And I am apt to think that some two Planets,
that are under the same state or Period, do not so much differ from
one another, as the same Planet doth from it self, in different pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods
of its duration. We do not seem to inhabit the same World
that our first fore-fathers did, nor scarce to be the same race of
Men. Our life now is so short and vain, as if we came into the
World only to see it and leave it; by that time we begin to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
our selves a little, and to know where we are, and how to
act our part, we must leave the stage, and give place to others as
meer Novices as we were our selves at our first entrance. And this
short life is imploy'd, in a great measure, to preserve our selves
from necessity, or diseases, or injuries of the Air, or other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies;
to make one Man easie, ten must work and do drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery;
The Body takes up so much time, we have little leisure for
Contemplation, or to cultivate the mind. The Earth doth not
yield us food, but with much labour and industry, and what was
her free-will offering before, or an easie liberality can scarce now
be extorted from her. Neither are the Heavens more favourable,
sometimes in one extreme, sometimes in another; The Air often
impure or infectious, and, for a great part of the year, Nature
her self seems to be sick or dead. To this vanity the external
Creation is made subject as well as Mankind, and so must continue
till the restitution of all things.</p>
                     <p>Can we imagine, in those happy Times and Places we are treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of, that things stood in this same posture? are these the fruits
of the Golden Age and of <hi>Paradise,</hi> or consistent with their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
And the remedies of these evils must be so universal, you
cannot give them to one place or Region of the Earth, but all must
participate: For these are things that flow from the course of the
Heavens, or such general Causes as extend at once to all Nature.
If there was a perpetual Spring and perpetual Aequinox in <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,</hi>
                        <pb n="128" facs="tcp:41970:78"/>
there was at the same time a perpetual Aequinox all the Earth
over; unless you place <hi>Paradise</hi> in the middle of the Torrid Zone.
So also the long-lives of the Ante-diluvians was an universal Effect,
and must have had an universal Cause. 'Tis true, in some single
parts or Regions of the present Earth, the Inhabitants live generally
longer than in others, but do not approach in any measure the
Age of their Ante-diluvian fore-fathers; and that degree of longae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
which they have above the rest, they owe to the calmness and
tranquility of their Heavens and Air; which is but an imperfect
participation of that cause which was once Universal, and had its
effect throughout the whole Earth. And as to the fertility of this
Earth, though in some spots it be eminently more fruitful than in
others, and more delicious, yet that of the first Earth was a ferti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of another kind, being spontaneous, and extending to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of Animals, which cannot be without a favourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
from the Heavens also.</p>
                     <p>Thus much in general; We will now go over those three fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Characters more distinctly, to show by their unsuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to the present state of Nature, that neither the whole Earth,
as it is now, nor any part of it, could be <hi>Paradisiacal.</hi> The perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Spring, which belong'd to the Golden Age, and to <hi>Paradise,</hi>
is an happiness this present Earth cannot pretend to, nor is capable
of, unless we could transfer the Sun from the Ecliptick to the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator,
or, which is as easie, perswade the Earth to change its
posture to the Sun. If <hi>Archimedes</hi> had found a place to plant his
Machines in for removing of the Earth, all that I should have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
of him, would have been only to have given it an heave at
one end, and set it a little to rights again with the Sun, that we
might have enjoy'd the comfort of a perpetual Spring, which we
have lost by its dislocation ever since the Deluge. And there being
nothing more indispensably necessary to a <hi>Paradisiacal</hi> state than
this unity and equality of Seasons, where that cannot be, 'tis in vain
to seek for the rest of <hi>Paradise.</hi>

                     <p>The spontaneous fruitfulness of the ground was a thing peculiar
to the primigenial soil, which was so temper'd, as made it more
luxuriant at that time than it could ever be afterwards; and as
that rich temperament was spent, so by degrees it grew less fertile.
The Origin or production of Animals out of the Earth, depended not
only upon this vital constitution of the soil at first, but also upon such a
posture and aspect of the Heavens, as favour'd, or at least permitted, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to make her best works out of this prepar'd matter, and better than
could be made in that manner, after the Flood. <hi>Noah,</hi> we see, had orders
given him to preserve the Races of living Creatures in his Ark, when
the Old World was destroy'd; which is an argument to me, that
Providence foresaw that the Earth would not be capable to produce
them under its new form; and that, not only for want of fitness in
the soil, but because of the diversity of Seasons, which were then
to take place, whereby Nature would be disturb'd in her work,
and the subject to be wrought upon would not continue long enough
in the same due temper. But this part of the second Character con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Original of Animals, deserves to be further examin'd and
explain'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="129" facs="tcp:41970:78"/>
The first principles of Life must be tender and ductile, that they
may yield to all the motions and gentle touches of Nature; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it is not possible that they should be wrought with that curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity,
and drawn into all those little fine threds and textures, that
we see and admire in some parts of the Bodies of Animals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And as
the matter must be so constituted at first, so it must be kept in a due
temper till the work be finisht, without any excess of heat or cold;
and accordingly we see that Nature hath made provision in all sorts
of Creatures, whether Oviparous or Viviparous, that the first ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
of Life should be preserv'd from all injuries of the Air,
and kept in a moderate warmth. Eggs are enclos'd in a Shell,
or Film, and must be cherish'd with an equal gentle heat, to begin
formation and continue it, otherwise the work miscarries: And
in Viviparous Creatures, the materials of life are safely lodg'd in
the Females womb, and conserv'd in a fit temperature 'twixt
heat and cold, while the Causes that Providence hath imploy'd,
are busie at work, fashioning and placing and joyning the parts, in
that due order which so wonderful a Fabrick requires.</p>
                     <p>Let us now compare these things with the birth of Animals in
the new-made World, when they first rose out of the Earth, to see
what provision could be made there for their safety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
while they were a making, and when newly made; And
though we take all advantages we can, and suppose both the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
and the Earth favourable, a fit soil and a warm and constant
temper of the Air, all will be little enough to make this way of
production feasible or probable. But if we suppose there was then
the same inconstancy of the Heavens that is now, the same vicissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of seasons, and the same inequality of heat and cold, I do not
think it at all possible that they could be so form'd, or being new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
preserv'd and nourish'd. 'Tis true, some little Creatures
that are of short dispatch in their formation, and find nourishment
enough wheresoever they are br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d, might be produc'd and brought
to perfection in this way, notwithstanding any inequality of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
because they are made all at a heat, as I may so say, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
and ended within the compass of one Season; But the great
question is concerning the more perfect kinds of Animals, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a long stay in the womb, to make them capable to sustain and
nourish themselves when they first come into the World. Such Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
being big and strong, must have a pretty hardness in their bones,
and force and firmness in their Muscles and Joynts, before they can
bear their own weight, and exercise the common motions of their
body: And accordingly we see Nature hath ordain'd for these a
longer time of gestation, that their limbs and members might have
time to acquire strength and solidity. Besides the young ones of
these Animals have commonly the milk of the Dam to nourish
them after they are brought forth, which is a very proper nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and like to that which they had before in the womb; and by
this means their stomachs are prepar'd by degrees for courser food:
Whereas our Terrigenous Animals must have been wean'd as soon
as they were born, or as soon as they were separated from their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Earth, and therefore must be allow'd a longer time of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
there.</p>

                        <pb n="130" facs="tcp:41970:79"/>
These things being consider'd, we cannot in reason but suppose,
that these Terrigenous Animals were as long, or longer, a perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
than our Viviparous, and were not separated from the body
of the Earth for ten, twelve, eighteen or more months, according
as their Nature was; and seeing in this space of time they must
have suffer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d, upon the common <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> all vicissitudes and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of seasons, and great excesses of heat and cold, which are
things incompatible with the tender principles of life and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of living Creatures, as we have shown before; we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
and safely conclude, that Nature had not, when the World
began, the same course she hath now, or that the Earth was not
then in its present posture and constitution: Seeing, I say, these
first spontaneous Births, which both the Holy Writ, Reason, and
Antiquity seem to allow, could not be finish'd and brought to
maturity, nor afterwards preserv'd and nourisht, upon any other
supposition.</p>
                     <p>Longaevi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y is the last Character to be consider'd, and as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with the present state of the Earth as any other. There are
many things in the story of the first Ages that seem strange, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so prodigy-like as the long lives of those Men; that their
houses of Clay should stand eight or nine hundred years and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and those we build of the hardest Stone or Marble will not
now last so long. This hath excited the curiosity of ingenious and
learned men in all Ages to enquire after the possible Causes of that
longaveity; and if it had been always in conjunction with innocency
of life and manners, and expir'd when that expir'd, we might have
thought it some peculiar blessing or reward attending that; but
'twas common to good and bad, and lasted till the Deluge, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
mankind was degenerate long before. Amongst Natural Causes,
some have imputed it to the sobriety and simplicity of their diet
and manner of living in those days, that they eat no flesh, and
had not all those provocations to gluttony which Wit and Vice
have since invented. This might have some effect, but not possibly
to that degree and measure that we speak of. There are many Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastical
persons now that live abstemiously all their lives, and yet
they think an hundred years a very great age amongst them. Others
have imputed it to the excellency of their Fruits and some unknown
vertue in their Herbs and Plants in those days; But they may as
well say nothing, as say that which can neither be prov'd nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.
It could not be either the quantity or quality of their
food that was the cause of their long lives, for the Earth was said
to be curst long before the Deluge, and probably by that time
was more barren and juiceless (for the generality) than ours is
now; yet we do not see that their longaevity decreast at all, from
the beginning of the World to the Flood. <hi>Methusalah</hi> was <hi>Noah</hi>'s
Grandfather, but one intire remove from the Deluge, and he liv'd
longer than any of his Fore-fathers. That food that will nourish
the parts and keep us in health, is also capable to keep us in long
life, if there be no impediments otherwise; for to continue health is to
continue life; as that fewel that is fit to raise and nourish a flame,
will preserve it as long as you please, if you add fresh fewel, and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:41970:79"/>
no external causes hinder: Neither do we observe that in those parts
of the present Earth where people live longer than in others, that
there is any thing extraordinary in their food, but that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is chiefly from the Air and the temperateness of the Heavens;
And if the Ante-diluvians had not enjoy'd that advantage in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
manner, and differently from what any parts of the Earth
do now, they would never have seen, seven, eight, or nine hundred
years go over their heads, though they had been nourish'd with
<hi>Nectar</hi> and <hi>Ambrosia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Others have thought that the long lives of those Men of the old
World proceeded from the strength of their <hi>Stamina,</hi> or first prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of their bodies; which if they were now as strong in us;
they think we should still live as long as they did. This could
not be the sole and adaequate cause of their longaevity, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
both from History and Reason. <hi>Shem,</hi> who was born before
the Flood, and had in his body all the vertue of the Ante-diluvian
<hi>Stamina</hi> and constitution, fell three hundred years short of the age
of his fore-fathers, because the greatest part of his life was past af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Flood. That their <hi>Stamina</hi> were stronger than ours are, I
am very ready to believe, and that their bodies were greater; and
any race of strong Men, living long in health, would have children
of a proportionably strong constitution with themselves; but then
the question is, How was this interrupted? We that are their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
why do not we inherit their long lives? how was this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
broken at the Deluge, and how did the <hi>Stamina</hi> fail so
fast when that came? why was there so great a <hi>Crisis</hi> then and
turn of life, or why was that the period of their strength?</p>
                     <p>We see this longaevity sunk half in half immediately after the
Flood, and after that it sunk by gentler degrees, but was still in
motion and declension till it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ixt at length,<note place="margin">Ps. 90. 10. call'd a Psalm of <hi>Moses.</hi>
                        </note> before <hi>David</hi>'s time,
in that which hath been the common standard of Man's Age ever
since: As when some excellent fruit is transplanted into a worse
Climate and Soil, it degenerates continually till it comes to such a
degree of meanness as suits that Air and Soil, and then it stands.
That the Age of Man did not fall all on a sudden from the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diluvian
measure to the present, I impute it to the remaining <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina</hi>
of those first Ages, and the strength of that pristine constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which could not wear off but by degrees. We see the <hi>Blacks</hi>
do not quit their complexion immediately by removing into another
Climate, but their posterity changeth by little and little, and after
some generations they become altogether like the people of the
Country where they are. Thus by the change of Nature that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
at the Flood, the unhappy influence of the Air and unequal
Seasons weaken'd by degrees the innate strength of their bodies
and the vigour of their parts, which would have been capable to
have lasted several more hundreds of years, if the Heavens had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
their course as formerly, or the Earth its position. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this particular, If any think that the Ante-diluvian longaevity
proceeded only from the <hi>Stamina,</hi> or the meer strength of their
bodies, and would have been so under any constitution of the
Heavens, let them resolve themselves these Questions; first, Why
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41970:80"/>
these <hi>Stamina,</hi> or this strength of constitution fail'd? Secondly,
Why did it fail so much and so remarkably at the Deluge? Thirdly,
Why in such proportions as it hath done since the Deluge? And
lastly, Why it hath stood so long immovable, and without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
diminution? Within the compass of five hundred years they
sunk from nine hundred to ninety; and in the compass of more
than three thousand years since they have not sunk ten years,
or scarce any thing at all. Who considers the reasons of these things,
and the true resolution of these questions, will be satisfi'd, that to
understand the causes of that longaevity something more must be
consider'd than the make and strength of their bodies; which,
though they had been made as strong as the <hi>Behemoth</hi> or <hi>Leviathan,</hi>
could not have lasted so many Ages, if there had not been a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
concurrence of external causes, such as the present state of
Nature doth not admit of.</p>
                     <p>By this short review of the three general Characters of <hi>Paradise</hi>
and the Golden Age, we may conclude how little consistent they
are with the present from and order of the Earth. Who can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to assign any place or Region in this Terraqueous Globe,
Island or Continent, that is capable of these conditions, or that
agrees either with the descriptions given by the ancient Heathens of
their <hi>Paradise,</hi> or by the Christian Fathers of Scripture <hi>Paradise.</hi>
But where then, will you say, must we look for it, if not upon
this Earth? This puts us more into despair of finding it than ever;
'tis not above nor below, in the Air or in the subterraneous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions:
no, doubtless 'twas upon the surface of the Earth, but of
the Primitive Earth, whose form and properties as they were dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from this, so they were such as made it capable of being
truly <hi>Paradisiacal,</hi> both according to the forementioned Characters,
and all other qualities and privileges reasonably ascrib'd to <hi>Paradise.</hi>

and the Golden Age found in the Primitive Earth.
A particular Explication of each Character.</head>
                     <p>WE have hitherto only perplext the Argument and our selves,
by showing how inexplicable the state of <hi>Paradise</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the present order of things, and the present condition
of the Earth. We must now therefore bring into view that Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
and Ante-diluvian Earth where we pretend its seat was, and
show it capable of all those privileges which we have deny'd to
the present; in vertue of which privileges, and of the order of
Nature establisht there, that primitive Earth might be truly <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disiacal,</hi>
as in the Golden Age; and some Region of it might be
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:41970:80"/>
peculiarly so, according to the receiv'd <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Paradise.</hi> And this,
I think, is all the knowledge and satisfaction that we can expect,
or that Providence hath allow'd us in this Argument.</p>
                     <p>The Primigenial Earth, which in the first Book <hi>(Chap. 5.)</hi> we
rais'd from a Chaos, and set up in an habitable form, we must
now survey again with more care, to observe its principal differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from the present Earth, and what influence they will have upon
the question in hand. These differences, as we have said before,
were chiefly three; The form of it, which was smooth, even and
regular. The posture and situation of it to the Sun, which was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect,
and not, as it is at present, inclin'd and oblique; And the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of it, which was more apparently and regularly Oval than it
is now. From these three differences flow'd a great many more,
inferiour and subordinate; and which had a considerable influence
upon the moral World at that time, as well as the natural. But
we will only observe here their more immediate effects, and that
in reference to those general Characters or properties of the Golden
Age and of <hi>Paradise,</hi> which we have instanc'd in, and whereof
we are bound to give an account by our <hi>Hypothesis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in this respect the most fundamental of those three differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
we mention'd, was, that of the right posture and situation of
the Earth to the Sun; for from this immediately follow'd a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Aequinox all the Earth over, or, if you will, a perpetual
Spring: and that was the great thing we found a wanting in the
present Earth to make it <hi>Paradisiacal,</hi> or capable of being so. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this being now found and establisht in the Primitive Earth,
the other two properties, of Longaevity and of Spontaneous and
Vital fertility, will be of more easie explication. In the mean time
let us view a little the reasons and causes of that regular situation
in the first Earth.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, one cannot so well require a reason of the regular
situation the Earth had then, for that was most simple and natural;
as of the irregular situation it hath now, standing oblique and
inclin'd to the Sun or the Ecliptick: Whereby the course of the
year is become unequal, and we are cast into a great diversity of
Seasons. But however, stating the first aright with its circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
we shall have a better prospect upon the second, and see from
what causes, and in what manner, it came to pass. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
suppose the Earth, with the rest of its fellow Planets, to be
carried about the Sun in the Ecliptick by the motion of the liquid
Heavens; and being at that time perfectly uniform and regular,
having the same Center of its magnitude and gravity, it would by
the equality of its libration necessarily have its Axis parallel to the
Axis of the same Ecliptick, both its Poles being equally inclin'd to
the Sun. And this posture I call a <hi>right situation,</hi> as oppos'd to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
or inclin'd: or a <hi>parallel</hi> situation, if you please. Now this
is a thing that needs no proof besides its own evidence; for 'tis the
immediate result and common effect of gravity or libration, that
a Body freely left to it self in a fluid <hi>medium,</hi> should settle in such a
posture as best answers to its gravitation; and this first Earth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we speak, being uniform and every way equally balanc'd, there
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:41970:81"/>
was no reason why it should incline at one end, more than at the
other, towards the Sun. As if you should suppose a Ship to stand
North and South under the Aequator, if it was equally built and
equally ballasted, it would not incline to one Pole or other, but
keep its Axis parallel to the Axis of the Earth; but if the ballast
lay more at one end, it would dip towards that Pole, and rise pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
higher towards the other. So those great Ships that
fail about the Sun once a year, or once in so many years, whilst
they are uniformly built and equally pois'd, they keep steddy and
even with the Axis of their Orbit; but if they lose that equality,
and the Center of their gravity change, the heavier end will incline
more towards the common Center of their motion, and the other
end will recede from it. So particularly the Earth, which makes
one in that aëry Fleet, when it scap'd so narrowly from being ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrackt
in the great Deluge, was however so broken and disorder'd,
that it lost its equal poise, and thereupon the Center of its gravity
changing, one Pole became more inclin'd towards the Sun, and the
other more remov'd from it, and so its right and parallel situation
which it had before to the Axis of the Ecliptick, was chang'd into
an oblique; in which skew posture it hath stood ever since, and is
likely so to do for some Ages to come. I instance in this, as the
most obvious cause of the change of the situation of the Earth,
tho' it may be, upon this, followed a change in its Magnetism, and
that might also contribute to the same effect.</p>
                     <p>However, This change and obliquity of the Earth's posture had
a long train of consequences depending upon it; whereof that was
the most immediate, that it alter'd the form of the year, and brought
in that inequality of Seasons which hath since obtain'd: As, on
the contrary, while the Earth was in its first and natural posture,
in a more easie and regular disposition to the Sun, That had also
another respective train of consequences, whereof one of the first,
and that which we are most concern'd in at present, was, that it
made a perpetual Aequinox or Spring to all the World, all the parts
of the year had one and the same tenour, face and temper; there
was no Winter or Summer, Seed-time or Harvest, but a continual
temperature of the Air and Verdure of the Earth. And this fully
answers the first and fundamental character of the Golden Age
and of <hi>Paradise;</hi> And what Antiquity, whether Heathen or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
hath spoken concerning that perpetual serenity and constant
Spring that reign'd there, which in the one was accounted fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
and in the other hyperbolical, we see to have been really and
Philosophically true. Nor is there any wonder in the thing, the
wonder is rather on our side, that the Earth should stand and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in that forc'd posture wherein it is now, spinning yearly about
an Axis, I mean that of the Aequator, that doth not belong to the
Orbit of its motion; This, I say, is more strange than that it once stood
in a posture that was streight and regular; As we more justly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the Tower at <hi>Pisa,</hi> that stands crook'd, than twenty other
streight Towers that are much higher.</p>
                     <p>Having got this foundation to stand upon, the rest of our work
will go on more easily; and the two other Characters which we
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:41970:81"/>
mention'd, will not be of very difficult explication. The spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
fertility of the Earth, and its production of Animals at that
time, we have in some measure explain'd before; supposing it to
proceed partly from the richness of the Primigenial soil, and partly
from this constant Spring and benignity of the Heavens, which we
have now establisht; These were always ready to excite Nature,
and put her upon action, and never to interrupt her in any of her
motions or attempts. We have show'd in the Fifth Chapter of the
First Book, how this primigenial soil was made, and of what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients;
which were such as compose the richest and fattest soil,
being a light Earth mixt with unctuous juices, and then afterwards
refresh'd and diluted with the dews of Heaven all the year long, and
cherisht with a continual warmth from the Sun. What more hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
beginning of a World than this? You will grant, I believe, that
whatsoever degree or whatsoever kind of fruitfulness could be
expected from a Soil and a Sun, might be reasonably expected
there. We see great Woods and Forests of Trees rise spontaneously,
and that since the Flood (for who can imagine that the ancient Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests,
whereof some were so vastly great were planted by the hand of
Man?) why should we not then believe that Fruit-trees and Corn
rose as spontaneously in that first Earth? That which makes Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
and Humane Arts so necessary now for the Fruits and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
of the Earth, is partly indeed the decay of the Soil, but
chiefly the diversity of Seasons, whereby they perish, if care be not
taken of them; but when there was neither Heat nor cold, Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
nor Summer, every Season was a Seed-time to Nature, and
every Season an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Harvest.</p>
                     <p>This, it may be you will allow as to the Fruits of the Earth, but
that the same Earth should produce Animals also will not be thought
so intelligible. Since it hath been discover'd, that the first mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
of all Animals are Eggs, as Seeds are of Plants, it doth not
seem so hard to conceive that these Eggs might be in the first Earth,
as well as those Seeds; for there is a great analogy and similitude
betwixt them; Especially if you compare these Seeds first with the
Eggs of Insects or Fishes, and then with the Eggs of Viviparous
Animals. And as for those juices which the Eggs of Viviparous
Animals imbibe thorough their coats from the womb, they might
as well imbibe them, or something analogous to them, from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
temper'd Earth, as Plant-Eggs do; And these things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
admitted, the progress is much-what the same in Seeds as Eggs,
and in one sort of Eggs as in another.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, Animal-Eggs do not seem to be fruitful of themselves,
without the influence of the Male; and this is not necessary in
Plant-Eggs or Vegetable Seeds. But neither doth it seem necessary
in all Animal Eggs, if there be any Animals <hi>sponte orta,</hi> as they call
them, or bred without copulation. And, as we observ'd before,
according to the best knowledge that we have of this Male influence,
it is reasonable to believe, that it may be supplied by the Heavens
or <hi>Aether.</hi> The Ancients, both the <hi>Stoicks</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> have sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
that there was something of an Aethereal Element in the Male-geniture,
from whence the vertue of it chiefly proceeded; and if so,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:41970:82"/>
why may we not suppose, at that time, some general impression or
irradiation of that purer Element to fructifie the new-made Earth?
<hi>Moses</hi> saith there was an incubation of the Spirit of God upon the
mass; and without all doubt that was either to form or fructifie it,
and by the mediation of this active principle; but the Ancients
speak more plainly with express mention of this <hi>Aether,</hi> and of the
impregnation of the Earth by it, as betwixt Male and Female. As
in the place before-cited;
<q>
                           <l>Tum Pater omnipotens faecundis imbribus Aether</l>
                           <l>Conjugis in gremium laetae descendit; &amp; omnes</l>
                           <l>Magnus alit magno commixtus corpore, foetus.</l>
                        </q>
Which notion,<note place="margin">De Civ. D. lib. 4. c. 10.</note> I remember, S. <hi>Austin</hi> saith, <hi>Virgil</hi> did not take from
the fictions of the Poets, but out of the Books of the Philosophers.
Some of the gravest Authors amongst the <hi>Romans</hi> have reported
that this vertue hath been convey'd into the Wombs of some Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
by the Winds or the <hi>Zephyri;</hi> and as I easily believe that the
first fresh Air was more impregnated with this Aethereal principle
than ours is, so I see no reason but those balmy dews that fell every
night in the Primitive Earth, might be the Vehicle of it as well
as the Male-geniture is now; and from them the teeming Earth and
those vital Seeds which it contain'd, were actuated, and receiv'd
their first fruitfulness.</p>
                     <p>Now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this Principle, howsoever convey'd to those rudiments of
life which we call Eggs, is that which gives the first stroke towards
Animation; and this seems to be by exciting a ferment in those
little masses whereby the parts are loosen'd, and dispos'd for that
formation which is to follow afterwards. And I see nothing that
hinders but that we may reasonably suppose that these Animal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
might proceed thus far in the Primigenial Earth; And
as to their progress and the formation of the Body, by what Agents
or Principles soever that great work is carried on in the womb of
the Female, it might by the same be carried on there. Neither
would there be any danger of miscarrying by excess of Heat or Cold,
for the Air was always of an equal temper and moderate warmth;
And all other impediments were remov'd, and all principles ready,
whether active or passive; so as we may justly conclude, that as <hi>Eve</hi>
was the Mother of all living as to Mankind, so was the Earth the
Great Mother of all living Creatures besides.</p>
                     <p>The Third Character to be explain'd, and the most extraordinary
in appearance, is that of LONGAEVITY. This sprung from
the same root, in my opinion, with the other; though the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion,
it may be, is not so visible. We show'd in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Chapter, that no advantage of Diet, or of strong Constitutions,
could have carried their lives, before the Flood, to that wonderful
length, if they had been expos'd to the same changes of Air and of
Seasons that our Bodies are: But taking a perpetual Aequinox, and
fixing the Heavens, you fix the life of Man too; which was not
then in such a rapid flux as it is now, but seem'd to stand still, as
the Sun did once, without declension. There is no question but
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:41970:82"/>
every thing upon Earth, and especially the Animate World, would
be much more permanent, if the general course of Nature was more
steddy and uniform; A stabi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ity in the Heavens makes a stability
in all things below; and that change and contrariety of qualities
that we have in these Regions, is the fountain of corruption, and
suffers nothing to be long in quiet: Either by intestine motions and
fermentations excited within, or by outward impressions, Bodies
are no sooner well constituted, but they are tending again to disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.
The <hi>Aether</hi> in their little pores and chinks is unequally
agitated, and differently mov'd at different times, and so is the Air
in their greater, and the Vapours and Atmosphere round about
them: All these shake and unsettle both the texture and continuity
of Bodies. Whereas in a fixt state of Nature, where these prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
have always the same constant and uniform motion, when
they are once suited to the forms and compositions of Bodies, they
give them no further disturbance; they enjoy a long and lasting
peace without any commotions or violence, within or without.</p>
                     <p>We find our selves, sensible changes in our Bodies upon the turn
of the Year, and the change of Seasons; new fermentations in the
Bloud and resolutions of the Humours; which if they do not
amount to diseases, at least they disturb Nature, and have a bad
effect not only upon the fluid parts, but also upon the more solid;
upon the Springs and Fibres in the Organs of the Body; to weaken
them and unfit them by degrees for their respective functions. For
though the change is not sensible immediately in these parts, yet
after many repeated impressions every year, by unequal heat and
cold, driness and moisture, contracting and relaxing the Fibres,
their tone at length is in a great measure destroy'd, and brought to
a manifest debility; and the great Springs failing, the lesser that
depend upon them, fall in proportion, and all the symptoms of
decay and old age follow. We see by daily experience, that Bodies
are kept better in the same <hi>medium,</hi> as we call it, than if they often
change their <hi>medium,</hi> as sometimes in Air, sometimes in Water,
moisten'd and dry'd, heated and cool'd; these different states weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
the contexture of the parts: But our Bodies, in the present state
of Nature, are put into an hundred different <hi>mediums</hi> in the course
of a Year; sometimes we are steept in Water, or in a misty fog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
Air for several days together, sometimes we are almost frozen with
cold, then fainting with heat at another time of the Year; and
the Winds are of a different nature, and the Air of a different
weight and pressure, according to the Weather and the Seasons: These
things would wear our Bodies, though they were built of Oak,
and that in a very short time in comparison of what they would
last, if they were always incompast with one and the same <hi>medium,</hi>
under one and the same temper, as it was in the Primitive Earth.</p>
                     <p>The Ancients seem to have been sensible of this, and of the
true causes of those long periods of life; for wheresoever they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
a great longaevity, as they did not only to their Golden Age,
but also to their particular and topical <hi>Paradises,</hi> they also assign'd
there a constant serenity and equality of the Heavens, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
expresly a constant Aequinox; as might be made appear from
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:41970:83"/>
their Authors. And some of our Christian Authors have gone
farther, and connected these two together, as Cause and Effect;
for they say that the Longaevity of the Ante-diluvian Patriarchs
proceeded from a favourable Aspect and influence of the Heavens at
that time; which <hi>Aspect</hi> of the Heavens being rightly interpreted,
is the same thing that we call the Position of the Heavens, or the
right situation of the Sun and the Earth, from whence came a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Aequinox. And if we consider the present Earth, I know
no place where they live longer than in that little Island of the
<hi>Bermudas,</hi> where, according to the proportion of time they hold
out there, after they are arriv'd from other parts, one may reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
suppose, that the Natives would live two hundred Years. And
there's nothing appears in that Island that should give long life above
other places, but the extraordinary steddiness of the Weather, and
of the temper of the Air throughout the whole Year, so as there is
scarce any considerable difference of Seasons.</p>
                     <p>But because it would take up too much time to show in this
place the full and just reasons why, and how these long periods of
life depend upon the stability of the Heavens: and how on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
from their inconstancy and mutability these periods are
shorten'd, as in the present order of Nature; we will set apart
the next Chapter to treat upon that subject; yet by way of digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
only, so as those that have a mind may pass to the following,
where the thred of this discourse is continued. In the mean time,
you see, we have prepar'd an Earth for <hi>Paradise,</hi> and given a fair
and intelligible account of those three general Characters, which,
according to the rules of method, must be determin'd before any
further progress can be made in this Argument. For in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of <hi>Paradise</hi> there are two things to be consider'd, the state
of it, and the place of it; And as it is first in order of Nature, so
it is much more material, to find out the state of it, than the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
where it stood. We need not follow the Windings of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and the interpretation of hard names, to discover this, we
take more faithful Guides, The unanimous reports of Antiquity, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
and Profane, supported by a regular Theory. Upon these
grounds we go, and have thus far proceeded on our way; which
we hope will grow more easie and pleasant, the nearer we come to
our journeys end.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. IV. A digression, concerning the Natural Causes of Longaevity.
That the Machine of an Animal consists of Springs, and
which are the two principal. The Age of the Ante-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luvians
to be computed by Solar not Lunar Years.</head>
                     <p>TO confirm our opinion concerning the reasons of Longaevity in
the first Inhabitants of the World, it will not be amiss to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
more at large the Natural Causes of <hi>long</hi> or <hi>short periods of life.</hi>
And when we speak of long or short periods of life, we do not
mean those little differences of ten, twenty or forty Years which
we see amongst Men now adays, according as they are of
stronger or weaker constitutions, and govern themselves better or
worse, but those grand and famous differences of several hundreds
of Years, which we have examples of in the different Ages of the
World, and particularly in those that liv'd before and since the
Flood. Neither do we think it peculiar to this Earth to have such
an inequality in the lives of Men, but the other Planets, if they be
inhabited, have the same property, and the same difference in their
different periods; All Planets that are in their Ante-diluvian state,
and in their first and regular situation to the Sun, have long-liv'd
Inhabitants; and those that are in an oblique situation, have short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liv'd;
unless there be some counter-causes that hinder this general
rule of Nature from taking place.</p>
                     <p>We are now so us'd to a short life, and to drop away after three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
or fourscore years, that when we compare our lives with
those of the Ante-diluvians, we think the wonder lies wholly on
their side, <hi>why</hi> they liv'd so long; and so it doth, popularly speaking;
but if we speak Philosophically, the wonder lies rather on our side,
<hi>why</hi> we live so little, or so short a time: For seeing our Bodies are
such Machines as have a faculty of nourishing themselves, that is,
of repairing their lost or decay'd parts, so long as they have good
nourishment to make use of, why should they not continue in good
plight, and always the same? as a flame does, so long as it is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
with fewel? And that we may the better see on whether side
the wonder lies, and from what causes it proceeds, we will propose
this Problem to be examin'd, <hi>Why the frame or Machine of an humane
Body, or of another Animal, having that construction of parts and those
faculties which it hath, lasts so short a time?</hi> And though it fall
into no disease, nor have any unnatural accident, within the space
of eighty years, more or less, fatally and inevitably decays, dies and
perisheth?</p>
                     <p>That the state and difficulty of this question may the better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
let us consider a Man in the prime and vigour of his life, at
the age of twenty or twenty four years, of an healthful constitution,
and all his Vitals sound; let him be nourish'd with good food,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:41970:84"/>
use due exercise, and govern himself with moderation in all other
things; The Question is, Why this Body should not continue in
the same plight, and in the same strength, for some Ages? or at
least why it should decay so soon, and so fast as we see it does?
We do not wonder at things that happen daily, though the causes
of them be never so hard to find out; We contract a certain fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>arity
with common events, and fancy we know as much of
them as can be known, though in reality we know nothing of them
but matter of fact; which the vulgar knows as well as the Wise or
the Learned. We see daily instances of the shortness of man's life,
how soon his race is run, and we do not wonder at it, because 'tis
common, yet if we examine the composition of the Body, it will be
very hard to find any good reasons why the frame of it should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
so soon.</p>
                     <p>I know 'tis easie to give general and superficial answers and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
of these things, but they are such, as being strictly examin'd,
give no satisfaction to an inquisitive mind: You would say, it may
be, that the Interiour parts and Organs of the Body wear and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
by degrees, so as not performing so well their several offices
and functions, for the digestion and distribution of the food and its
juices, all the other parts suffer by it, and draws on insensibly a
decay upon the whole frame of the Body. This is all true; but
why, and how comes this to pass? from what causes? where is
the first failure, and what are the consequences of it? The inward
parts do not destroy themselves, and we suppose that there is no
want of good food, nor any disease, and we take the Body in its
full strength and vigour, why doth it not continue thus, as a Lamp
does, if you supply it with Oil? The causes being the same, why
doth not the same effect still follow? why should not the flame of
life, as well as any other flame, if you give it fewel, continue in its
force without languishing or decay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </p>
                     <p>You will say, it may be, The case is not the same in a simple
Body, such as a Lamp or a Fire, and in an Organical Body; which
being variously compounded of multiplicity of parts, and all those
parts put in connexion and dependance one upon another, if any
one fail, it will disorder the whole frame; and therefore it must
needs be more difficult for such a body to continue long in the same
state, than for a simple Body that hath no variety of parts or ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
I acknowledge such a Body is much more subject to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
and accidents than a more simple, but barring all diseases and
accidents, as we do, it might be of as long a duration as any other,
if it was suppli'd with nourishment adequately to all its parts: As
this Lamp we speak of, if it consisted of twenty branches, and
each of these branches was to be fed with a different Oil, and these
Oils could be all mix'd together in some common Cistern, whence
they were to be distributed into the several branches, either accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their different degrees of lightness, one rising higher than
another; or according to the capacity and figure of the little pipes
they were to pass thorough; such a compounded Lamp, made up
of such artifices, would indeed be more subject to accidents, and to
be out of order, by the obstruction of some of the little pipes, or
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:41970:84"/>
some unfit qualities in the Oils, but all these casualties and disorders
excepted, as they are in our case, if it was suppli'd with conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
liquors, it would burn as long as any other, though more
plain and simple.</p>
                     <p>To instance yet, for more plainness, in another sort of Machine,
supppose a Mill, where the Water may represent the nourishment
and humours in our Body, and the frame of Wood and Stone, the
solid parts; if we could suppose this Mill to have a power of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
it self by the Water it receiv'd, and of repairing all the parts
that were worn away, whether of the Wood work or of the Stone,
feed it but with a constant stream, and it would subsist and grind
for ever. And 'tis the same thing for all other Artificial Machines
of this nature, if they had a faculty of nourishig themselves, and
repairing their parts. And seeing those natural Machines we are
speaking of, the Body of Man, and of other Animals, have and
enjoy this faculty, why should they not be able to preserve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
beyond that short period of time which is now the measure of
their life?</p>
                     <p>Thus much we have said to shew the difficulty propos'd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
it; We must now consider the true answer and resolution of
it; and to that purpose bring into view again those causes which
we have assign'd, both of the long periods of life before the Flood,
and of the short ones since. That there was a perpetual Aequinox
and stability of the Heavens before the Flood, we have show'd both
from History and Reason; neither was there then any thing of
Clouds, Rains, Winds, Storms or unequal weather, as will appear
in the following Chapter; And to this steddiness of Nature and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
calmness of the External World, we have imputed those long
periods of life which Men enjoy'd at that time: As on the contrary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
when that great change and revolution happen'd to Nature at the
Deluge, and the Heavens and the Earth were cast in another mould,
then was brought in, besides many other new Scenes, that shortness
and vanity in the life of Man, and a general instability in all sublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
things, but especially in the Animate World.</p>
                     <p>It is not necessary to show, more than we have done already, how
that Primitive state of Nature contributed to long life; neither is it
requir'd that it should actively contribute, but only be permissive,
and suffer our Bodies to act their parts; for if they be not disturb'd,
nor any harm done them by External Nature, they are built with
art and strength enough to last many hundreds of years. And as we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
before concerning the posture of the Earth, that that which
it had at first, being simple and regular, was not so much to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
for, as its present posture, which is irregular; so likewise
for the life of Man, the difficulty is not why they liv'd so long in
the old World; that was their due and proper course; but why
our Bodies being made after the same manner, should endure so short
a time now. This is it therefore which we must now make our
business to give an account of, namely, how that vicissitude of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
inconstancy of the Air, and unequal course of Nature which
came in at the Deluge, do shorten <hi>Life;</hi> and indeed hasten the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of all Bodies, Animate or Inanimate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="142" facs="tcp:41970:85"/>
In our Bodies we may consider three several qualities on dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
and according to each whereof they suffer decay; First, Their
continuity; Secondly, That disposition whereby the are capable of
receiving nourishment, which we may call Nutribility; and Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
The Tone or Tonick disposition of the Organs whereby they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
their several functions. In all these three respects they would
decay in any state of Nature, but far sooner, and faster in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
state than in the Primaeval. As for their Continuity, we have
noted before that all consistent Bodies must be less durable now,
than under that first order of the World, because of the unequal and
contrary motions of the Elements, or of the Air and Aether that
penetrato and pervade them; and 'tis part of that vanity which all
things now are subject to, to be more perishable than in their first
Constitution. If we should consider our Bodies only as breathing
Statues, consisting of those parts they do, and of that tenderness,
the Air which we breath, and wherewith we are continually incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past,
changing so often 'twixt moist and dry, hot and cold, a slew and
eager motion, these different actions and restless changes would sooner
weaken and destroy the union of the parts, than if they were always
in a calm and quiet <hi>medium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it is not the gross and visible Continuity of the parts of our
Body that frist dacays, there are finer Textures that are spoil'd insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly,
and draw on the decay of the rest; such are those other two
we mention'd, That disposition and temper of the parts whereby
they are fit to receive their full nourishment; and especially that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
and texture of the Organs that are preparatory to this
Nutrition. The Nutribility of the Body depends upon a certain tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament
in the parts, soft and yielding, which makes them open
to the Blood and Juices in their Circulation and passage through
them, and mixing intimately, and universally, hold fast and retain
many of their Particles; as muddy Earth doth the parts of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that runs into it and mixeth with it: And when these Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Particles retain'd are more than the Body spends, that Body is
in its growth; as when they are fewer, 'tis in its decay. And as we
compar'd the flesh and tender parts when they are young and in a
growing disposition, to a muddy soil, that opens to the Water,
swells and incorporates with it? so when they become hard and dry,
they are like a sandy Earth, that suffers the Water to glide through
it, without incorporating or retaining many of its parts; and the
sooner they come to this temper, the sooner follows their decay:
For the same Causes that set limits to our Growth, set also limits
to our Life; and he that can resolve that Question, <hi>why</hi> the time of
our <hi>Growth</hi> is so short, will also be able to resolve the other in a
good measure, <hi>why</hi> the time of our <hi>Life</hi> is so short. In both cases,
that which stops our progress is external Nature, whose course, while
it was even and steddy, and the ambient Air mild and balmy, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
the Body much longer in a fresh and fit temper to receive its
full nourishment, and consequently gave larger bounds both to our
Growth and Life.</p>
                     <p>But the Third thing we mention'd is the most considerable, The
decay of the Organick parts; and especially of the Organs prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:41970:85"/>
to Nutrition. This is the point chiefly to be examin'd and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd,
and therefore we will endeavour to state it fully and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly.
There are several functions in the Body of an Animal, and
several Organs for the conduct of them; and I am of opinion, that
all the Organs of the Body are in the nature of Springs, and that
their action is Tonical. The action of the Muscles is apparently so,
and so is that of the Heart and the Stomach; and as for those
parts that make secretions only, as the <hi>Glandules</hi> and <hi>Parenchymata,</hi>
if they be any more than merely passive, as Strainers, 'tis the Tone
of the parts, when distended, that performs the separation: And
accordingly in all other active Organs, the action proceeds from a
Tone in the parts. And this seems to be easily prov'd, both as to
our Bodies and all other Bodies: for no matter that is not fluid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
hath any motion or action in it, but in vertue of some Tone; If
matter be fluid, its parts are actually in motion, and consequently
may impel or give motion to other Bodies; but if it be solid or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent,
the parts are not separate or separately mov'd from one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and therefore cannot impel or give motion to any other, but
in vertue of their Tone; they having no other motion themselves.
Accordingly we see in Artificial Machines there are but two ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
sorts, those that move by some fluid or volatile matter, as Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Wind, Air, or some active Spirit; And those which move by
Springs, or by the Tonick disposition of some part that gives mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the rest: For as for such Machines as act by weights, 'tis not
the weight that is the active principle, but the Air or Aether that
impels it. 'Tis true, the Body of an Animal is a kind of mixt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine,
and those Organs that are the Primary parts of it, partake
of both these principles; for there are Spirits and Liquors that do
assist in the motions of the Muscles, of the Heart and of the Stomach;
but we have no occasion to consider them at present, but only the
Tone of the solid Organs.</p>
                     <p>This being observ'd in the first place, <hi>Wherein</hi> the force of our
Organs consists, we might here immediately subjoyn, how this force
is weaken'd and destroy'd by the unequal course of Nature which
now obtains, and consequently our Life shorten'd; for the whole
state and Oeconomy of the Body depends upon the force and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of these Organs. But to understand the business more distinctly,
it will be worth our time to examine, upon which of the Organs
of the Body Life depends more immediately, and the prolongation
of it; that so reducing our Inquiries into a narrower compass, we
may manage them with more ease and more certainty.</p>
                     <p>In the Body of Man there are several <hi>Compages,</hi> or setts of parts;
some whereof need not be consider'd in this question; There is that
Systeme that serves for sence and local-motion, which is commonly
call'd the ANIMAL Compages; and that which serves for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
which is call'd the GENITAL. These have no influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upon long Life, being parts nourished, not nourishing, and
that are fed from others as Rivers from their Fountain: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
having laid these aside, there remain two Compages more,
the NATURAL and VITAL, which consist of the Heart
and Stomach, with their appendages. These are the Sources of Life,

and these are all that is absolutely necessary to the constitution of a
Living Creature; what parts we find more, few or many, of one
sort or other, according to the several kinds of Creatures, is acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
to our purpose; The form of an Animal, as we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
it here, lies in this little compass, and what is superadded is
for some new purposes, besides that of meer Life, as for Sense,
Motion, Generation, and such like. As in a Watch, besides the
Movement, which is made to tell you the hour of the day, which
constitutes a Watch, you may have a fancy to have an Alarum ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
or a Minute-motion, or that it should tell you the day of the
Month; and this sometimes will require a new Spring, sometimes
only new Wheels; however if you would examine the Nature of
a Watch, and upon what its motion, or, if I may so say, its Life
depends, you must lay aside those secondary Movements, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the main Spring, and the Wheels that immediately depend
upon that, for all the ret is accidental. So for the Life of an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
which is a piece of Nature's Clockwork, if we would exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
upon what the duration of it depends, we must lay aside
those additional parts or Systems of parts, which are for other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
and consider only the first principles and fountains of Life,
and the causes of their natural and necessary decay.</p>
                     <p>Having thus reduc'd our Inquiries to these two Organs, The Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
and the Heart, as the two Master-Springs in the Mechanism
of an Animal, upon which all the rest depend, let us now see what
their action is, and how it will be more or less durable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
according to the different states of External Nature. We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd
before, that the force and action of all Organs in the
Body was Tonical, and of none more remarkably than of these
two, the Heart and Stomach; for though it be not clearly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
what the particular structure of these Organs, or of their
Fibres is, that makes them Tonical, yet 'tis manifest by their actions
that they are so. In the Stomach, besides a peculiar ferment that
opens and dissolves the parts of the Meat, and melts them into a
fluor or pulp, the coats of it, or Fibres whereof they consist, have
a motion proper to them, proceeding from their Tone, whereby
they close the Stomach, and compress the Meat when it is receiv'd,
and when turn'd into Chyle, press it forwards, and squeeze it into
the Intestines; and the Intestines also partaking of the same motion,
push and work it still forwards into those little Veins that convey
it towards the Heart. The Heart hath the same general motions
with the Stomach, of opening and shutting, and hath also a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
ferment which rarifies the Bloud that enters into it; and that
Bloud by the Spring of the Heart, and the particular Texture of its
Fibres, is thrown out again to make its Circulation through the
Body. This is, in short, the action of both these Organs; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the mystery of the Body of an Animal, and of its operations
and Oeconomy, consists chiefly in Springs and Ferments; The
one for the solid parts, the other in the fluid.</p>
                     <p>But to apply this Fabrick of the organick parts to our purpose,
we may observe and conclude, that whatsoever weakens the Tone
or Spring of these two Organs, which are the Bases of all Vitality,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41970:86"/>
weaken the principle of Life, and shorten the natural duration of
it; And if of two Orders or Courses of Nature, the one be favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and easie to these Tonick principles in the Body, and the other
uneasie and prejudicial, that course of Nature will be attended with
long periods of Life, and this with short. And we have shewn,
that in the Primitive Earth the course of Nature was even, steddy
and unchangeable, without either different qualities of the Air,
or unequal Seasons of the Year, which must needs be more easie to
these principles we speak of, and permit them to continue longer
in their strength and vigour, than they can possibly do under all
those changes of the Air, of the Atmosphere, and of the Heavens,
which we now suffer yearly, monthly, and daily. And though
Sacred History had not acquainted us with the Longaevity of the
Ante-diluvian Patriarchs, nor profane History with those of the
Golden Age, I should have concluded, from the Theory alone, and
the contemplation of that state of Nature, that the forms of all
things were much more permanent in that World than in ours,
and that the lives of Men and all other Animals had longer pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods.</p>
                     <p>I confess, I am of opinion, that 'tis this that makes not only
these living Springs or Tonick Organs of the Body, but all Artificial
Springs also, though made of the hardest Metal, decay so fast. The
different pressure of the Atmosphere, sometimes heavier, sometimes
lighter, more rare or more dense, moist or dry, and agitated with
different degrees of motion, and in different manners; this must
needs operate upon that nicer contexture of Bodies, which makes
them Tonical or Elastick; altering the figure or minuteness of the
pores, and the strength and order of the Fibres upon which that
propriety depends: bending and unbending, closing and opening
the parts. There is a subtle and Aethereal Element that traverseth
the pores of all Bodies, and when 'tis straiten'd and pent up there,
or stopt in its usual course and passage, its motion is more quick
and eager, as a Current of Water, when 'tis obstructed or runs
through a narrower Chanel; and that strife and those attempts
which these little active Particles make to get free, and follow the
same tracts they did before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do still press upon the parts of the Body
that are chang'd, to redress and reduce them to their first and Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
posture, and in this consists the force of a Spring. Accordingly
we may observe, that there is no Body that is or will be Tonical
or Elastick, if it be left to it self, and to that posture it would take
naturally; for then all the parts are at ease, and the subtle matter
moves freely and uninterruptedly within its pores; but if by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stention,
or by compression, or by flexion, or any other way, the
situation of the parts and pores be so alter'd, that the Air sometimes,
but for the most part that subtiler Element, is uneasie and comprest
too much, it causeth that renitency or tendency to restitution,
which we call the Tone or Spring of a Body. Now as this dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of Bodies doth far more easily perish than their Continuity,
so I think there is nothing that contributes more to its perishing
(whether in Natural or Artificial Springs) than the unequal action
and different qualities of the Aether, Air, and Atmosphere.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="146" facs="tcp:41970:87"/>
It will be objected to us, it may be, that in the beginning of the
Chapter we instanc'd in Artificial things, that would continue for
ever, if they had but the power of nourishing themselves, as Lamps,
Mills, and such like; why then may not Natural Machines that
have that power, last for ever? The case is not the same as to the
Bodies of Animals, and the things there instanc'd in, for those
were springless Machines, that act only by some external cause,
and not in vertue of any Tone or interiour temper of the parts, as
our Bodies do; and when that Tone or temper is destroy'd, no
nourishment can repair it. There is something, I say, irreparable
in the Tonical disposition of matter, which when wholly lost, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be restor'd by Nutrition; Nutrition may answer to a bare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
of parts, but where the parts are to be preserv'd in such
a temperament, or in such a degree of humidity and driness, warmth,
rarity or density, to make them capable of that nourishment, as
well as of their other operations, as Organs, (which is the case of
our Bodies) there the Heavens, the Air, and external Causes will
change the qualities of the matter in spite of all Nutrition; and
the qualities of the matter being chang'd (in a course of Nature,
where the Cause cannot be taken away) that is a fault incorrigible,
and irreparable by the nourishment that follows, being hinder'd of
its effect by the indisposition or incapacity of the Recipient. And
as they say, a fault in the first concoction cannot be corrected in the
second; so neither can a fault in the Prerequisites to all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions
be corrected by any of them.</p>
                     <p>I know the Ancients made the decay and term of Life to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
rather upon the humours of the Body, than the solid parts,
and suppos'd an <hi>Humidum radicale</hi> and a <hi>Calidum innatum,</hi> as they
call them, a Radical Moisture and Congenit heat to be in every Body
from its birth and first formation; and as these decay'd, life decay'd.
But who's wiser for this account, what doth this instruct us in?
We know there is heat and moisture in the Body, and you may call
the one <hi>Radical,</hi> and the other <hi>Innate</hi> if you please; this is but a
sort of Cant, for we know no more of the real Physical Causes
of that effect we enquir'd into, than we did before. What makes
this heat and moisture fail, if the nourishment be good, and all the
Organs in their due strength and temper? The first and original
failure is not in the fluid, but in the solid parts, which if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
the same, the humours would do so too. Besides, What be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel
this Radical moisture and heat at the Deluge, that it should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
so fast afterwards, and last so long before? There is a certain
temper, no doubt, of the juices and humours of the Body, which
is more fit than any other to conserve the parts from driness and
decay; but the cause of that driness and decay, or other inhability
in the solid parts, whence is that, if not from external Nature?
'Tis thither we must come at length in our search of the reasons of
the Natural decay of our Bodies, we follow the fate and Laws of
that: and, I think, by those Causes, and in that order, that we
have already describ'd and explain'd.</p>
                     <p>To conclude this Discourse, we may collect from it what judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is to be made of those Projectors of Immortality, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:41970:87"/>
to make Men live to the Age of <hi>Methusalah,</hi> if they will use
their methods and medicines; There is but one method for this,
To put the Sun into his old course, or the Earth into its first posture;
there is no other secret to prolong life; Our Bodies will sympathize
with the general course of Nature, nothing can guard us from it,
no Elixir, no Specifick, no Philosopher's-stone. But there are En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasts
in Philosophy, as well as in Religion; Men that go by no
principles, but their own conceit and fancy, and by a Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
which shines very uncertainly, and, for the most part, leads
them out of the way of truth. And so much for this disquisition,
concerning the <hi>Causes</hi> of <hi>Longaevity,</hi> or of the long and short periods
of Life in the different periods of the World.</p>
                     <p>That the Age of the Ante-diluvian Patriarchs is to be computed by <hi>Solar</hi> or common Years, not by <hi>Lunar</hi> or Months.</p>
                     <p>Having made this discourse of the unequal periods of life, only
in reference to the Ante diluvians and their fam'd Longaevity, lest
we should seem to have proceeded upon an ill-grounded and mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
supposition, we are bound to take notice of, and confute, That
Opinion which makes the Years of the Ante-diluvian Patriarchs to
have been <hi>Lunar,</hi> not <hi>Solar,</hi> and so would bear us in hand, that
they liv'd only so many Months, as Scripture saith they liv'd Years.
Seeing there is nothing could drive Men to this bold interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but the incredibility of the thing, as they fansied; They having
no Notions or <hi>Hypothesis</hi> whereby it could appear intelligible or
possible to them; and seeing we have taken away that stumbling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,
and shew'd it not only possible but necessary, according to
the constitution of that World, that the periods of Life should be
far longer than in this; by removing the ground or occasion of their
misinterpretation, we hope we have undeceiv'd them, and let them
see that there is no need of that subterfuge, either to prevent an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruity,
or save the credit of the Sacred Historian.</p>
                     <p>But as this opinion is inconsistent with Nature truly understood,
so is it also with common History; for besides what I have already
mention'd in the first Chapter of this Book, <hi>Iosephus</hi> tells us, that
the Historians of all Nations,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. Iew. Ant. Chap. 4.</note> both <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> give the
same account of the first Inhabitants of the Earth; Manetho, <hi>who
writ the story of the</hi> Aegyptians, Berosus, <hi>who writ the</hi> Chaldaean <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
and those Authors that have given us an account of the</hi> Phoenician
<hi>Antiquities; besides</hi> Molus <hi>and</hi> Hestiaeus, <hi>and</hi> Hieronymus <hi>the</hi> Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian;
<hi>and amongst the Greeks</hi> Hesiodus, Hecateus, Hellanicus, Acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silaus,
Ephorus <hi>and</hi> Nicolaus: <hi>We have the Suffrages of all these, and
their common consent, that in the first Ages of the World Men liv'd a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Years.</hi> Now we cannot well suppose, that all these Historians meant
<hi>Lunar</hi> Years, or that they all conspir'd together to make and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate
a Fable.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, as Nature and Profane History do disown and confute
this opinion, so much more doth Sacred History; not indeed in
profess'd terms, for <hi>Moses</hi> doth not say that he useth <hi>Solar</hi> Years,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:41970:88"/>
but by several marks and observations, or collateral Arguments, it
may be clearly collected, that he doth not use <hi>Lunar.</hi> As first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
He distinguisheth <hi>Months</hi> and <hi>Years</hi> in the History of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge,
and of the life of <hi>Noah;</hi> for <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 11. he saith in the six
hundredth year of <hi>Noah</hi>'s life, in the second month, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It cannot
be imagin'd that in the same verse and sentence these two terms of
<hi>Year</hi> and <hi>Month</hi> should be so confounded as to signifie the same thing;
and therefore <hi>Noah</hi>'s Years were not the same with Months, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
those of the other Patriarchs, for we have no reason to make
any difference. Besides, what ground was there, or how was it proper
or pertinent to reckon, as <hi>Moses</hi> does there, first, second, third
Month, as so many going to a Year, if every one of them was a
Year? And seeing the Deluge begun in the six hundredth year of
<hi>Noah</hi>'s life, and in the second Month, and ended in the six hundredth
and first Year <hi>(Chap. 8. 13.)</hi> the first or second Month, all that was
betwixt these two terms, or all the duration of the Deluge, made but
one year in <hi>Noah</hi>'s life, or it may be not so much; and we know
<hi>Moses</hi> reckons a great many Months in the duration of the Deluge;
so as this is a demonstration that <hi>Noah</hi>'s years are not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of <hi>Lunar.</hi> And to imagine that his Years are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
one way, and those of his fellow-Patriarchs another, would be
an inaccountable fiction. This Argument therefore extends to all the
Ante-diluvians; And <hi>Noah</hi>'s life will take in the Post-diluvians too,
for you see part of it runs amongst them, and ties together the two
Worlds: so that if we exclude <hi>Lunar</hi> years from his life, we exclude
them from all, those of his Fathers, and those of his Children.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If <hi>Lunar</hi> years were understood in the Ages of the Ante-diluvian
Patriarchs, the interval betwixt the Creation and the Deluge
would be too short, and in many respects incongruous. There would
be but 1656 months from the beginning of the World to the Flood;
which converted into common years, make but 127 years, and five
months, for that interval. This perverts all Chronology, and besides,
makes the number of people so small and inconsiderable at the time
of the Deluge, that destroying of the World then was not so much
as destroying of a Country Town would be now: For from one
couple you cannot well imagine there could arise above five hundred
persons in so short a time; but if there was a thousa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d, 'tis not so
many as we have sometimes in a good Country Village. And were
the Flood-gates of Heaven open'd, and the great Abyss broken up
to destroy such an handful of people? and the Waters rais'd fifteen
Cubits above the highest Mountains throughout the face of the Earth,
to drown a Parish or two? is not this more incredible than our Age
of the Patriarchs? Besides, This short interval doth not leave room for
Ten Generations, which we find from <hi>Adam</hi> to the Flood, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
the Patriarchs age enough at the time when they are said to
have got Children. One hundred twenty seven years for Ten Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations
is very strait; and of these you must take off forty six years
for one Generation only, or for <hi>Noah,</hi> for he liv'd six hundred years
before the Flood, and if they were <hi>Lunar,</hi> they would come how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
to forty six of our years; so that for the other Nine Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
you would have but eighty one years, that is, nine years a-piece;
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:41970:88"/>
at which Age they must all be suppos'd to have begun to get Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
which you cannot but think a very absurd supposition. Thus
it would be, if you divide the whole time equally amongst the Nine.
Generations, but if you consider some single instances, as they are set
down by <hi>Moses,</hi> 'tis still worse; for <hi>Mahaleel</hi> and his Grandchild
<hi>Enoch</hi> are said to have got Children at sixty five years of Age, which
if you suppose months, they were but five years old at that time; now
I appeal to any one, Whether it is more incredible that men should
live to the age of nine hundred years, or that they should beget Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
at the age of five years.</p>
                     <p>You will say, it may be, 'tis true these inconveniences follow, if
our <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copies of the Old Testament be Authentick; but if the
<hi>Greek</hi> Translation by the <hi>Septuagint</hi> be of better Authority, as some
would have it to be, that gives a little relief in this case; for the <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint</hi>
make the distance from the Creation to the Flood six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years more than the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text does, and so give us a little
more room for our Ten Generations: And not only so, but they
have so conveniently dispos'd those additional years, as to salve the
other inconvenience too, of the Patriarchs having Children so young;
for what Patriarchs are found to have got Children sooner than
the rest, and so soon, that upon a computation by <hi>Lunar</hi> years, they
would be but meer Children themselves at that time, to these, more
years are added and plac'd opportunely, before the time of their
getting Children; so as one can scarce forbear to think that it was
done on purpose to cure that inconvenience, and to favour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
the computation by <hi>Lunar</hi> years. The thing looks so like an
artifice, and as done to serve a turn, that one cannot but have a less
opinion of that Chronology for it.</p>
                     <p>But not to enter upon that dispute at present, methinks they have
not wrought the cure effectually enough; for with these six hundred
<hi>Lunar</hi> years added, the summ will be only one hundred seventy
three common years and odd months; and from these deducting,
as we did before, for <hi>Noah,</hi> forty six years, and for <hi>Adam,</hi> or the
first Generation, about eighteen, (for he was two hundred and
thirty years old, according to the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> when he begot <hi>Seth)</hi>
there will remain but one hundred and nine years for eight Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations;
which will be thirteen years a-piece and odd months; a
low age to get children in, and to hold for eight Generations toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Neither is the other inconvenience we mention'd, well cur'd
by the <hi>Septuagint</hi> account, namely, the small number of people that
would be in the World at the Deluge; for the <hi>Septuagint</hi> account,
if understood of <hi>Lunar</hi> years, adds but forty six common years to
the <hi>Hebrew</hi> account, and to the age of the World at the Deluge, in
which time there could be but a very small accession to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Mankind. So as both these incongruities continue, though
not in the same degree, and stand good in either account, if it be
understood of <hi>Lunar</hi> years.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, 'Tis manifest from other Texts of Scripture, and from
other considerations, that our first Fathers liv'd very long, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderably
longer than men have done since; whereas if their years be
interpreted <hi>Lunar,</hi> there is not one of them that liv'd to the age
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41970:89"/>
that Men do now; <hi>Methusalah</hi> himself did not reach threescore and
fifteen years, upon that interpretation; Which doth depress them
not only below those that liv'd next to the Flood, but below all fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Generations to this day; and those first Ages of the World,
which were always celebrated for strength and vivacity, are made as
weak and feeble as the last dregs of Nature. We may observe, that
after the Flood for some time, till the pristine <hi>Crasis</hi> of the Body
was broken by the new course of Nature, they liv'd five, four,
three, two hundred years, and the Life of Men shortn'd by degrees;
but before the Flood, when they liv'd longer, there was no such
decrease or gradual declension in their lives. For <hi>Noah,</hi> who was
the last, liv'd longer than <hi>Adam;</hi> and <hi>Methusalah</hi> who was last but
two, liv'd the longest of all: So that it was not simply their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from the beginning of the World that made them live a
shorter time, but some change which happen'd in Nature after such
a period of time; namely at the Deluge, when the declension begun.
Let's set down the Table of both states.

                     <p>From these Tables we see that Mens Lives were much longer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Flood, and next after it, than they are now; which also
is confirm'd undeniably by <hi>Iacob</hi>'s complaint of the shortness of his
life, in comparison of his Fore-fathers, when he had liv'd one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and thirty years, <hi>Gen. 47. 9. The days of the years of my pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
are an hundred and thirty years; few and evil have the days of the
years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of
the life of my Fathers.</hi> There was then, 'tis certain, long-liv'd men
in the World before <hi>Iacob</hi>'s time; when were they, before the Flood
or after? We say both, according as the Tables shew it? But if
you count by <hi>Lunar</hi> years, there never were any, either before or
after, and <hi>Iacob</hi>'s complaint was unjust and false; for he was the
oldest Man in the World himself, or at least there was none of his
Fore-fathers that liv'd so long as he.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="151" facs="tcp:41970:89"/>
The Patrons of this opinion must needs find themselves at a loss,
how or where to break off the account of <hi>Lunar</hi> years in Sacred
History, if they once admit it. If they say, that way of counting
must only be extended to the Flood, then they make the Post-diluvian
Fathers longer liv'd than the Ante-diluvian; did the Flood
bring in Longaevity? how could that be the cause of such an effect?
Besides, if they allow the Post-diluvians to have liv'd six hundred
(common) years, that being clearly beyond the standard of our
lives, I should never stick at two or three hundred years more for
the first Ages of the World. If they extend their <hi>Lunar</hi> account
to the Post-diluvians too, they will still be intangled in worse ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities;
for they must make their lives miserably short, and their
Age of getting Children altogether incongruous and impossible.
<hi>Nahor,</hi> for example, when he was but two years and three months
old must have begot <hi>Terah, Abraham</hi>'s Father: And all the rest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and <hi>Shem</hi> must have had Children before they were three
years old: A pretty race of Pigmies. Then their lives were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
short, for this <hi>Nahor</hi> liv'd but eleven years and six
months at this rate; and his Grandchild <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is said to have
died <hi>in a good old age, and full of years, (Gen. 25. 8.)</hi> was not four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years old. What a ridiculous account this gives of Scripture-Chronology
and Genealogies? But you'll say, it may be, these <hi>Lunar</hi>
years are not to be carried so far as <hi>Abraham</hi> neither; tell us then
where you'll stop, and why you stop in such a place rather than
another. If you once take in <hi>Lunar</hi> years, what ground is there in
the Text, or in the History, that you should change your way of
computing, at such a time, or in such a place? All our Ancient Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology
is founded upon the Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> where the terms and
periods of times are exprest by years, and often by Genealogies, and
the Lives of Men; now if these years are sometimes to be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Lunar,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Solar,</hi> without any distinction made in the
Text, what light or certain rule have we to go by? let these Authors
name to us the parts and places where, and only where, the <hi>Lunar</hi>
years are to be understood, and I dare undertake to show, that their
method is not only arbitrary, but absurd and incoherent.</p>
                     <p>To conclude this Discourse, we cannot but repeat what we have
partly observ'd before, How necessary it is to understand Nature,
if we would rightly understand those things in holy Writ that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to the Natural World. For without this knowledge, as we
are apt to think some things consistent and credible that are really
impossible in Nature; so on the other hand, we are apt to look upon
other things as incredible and impossible that are really founded
in Nature. And seeing every one is willing so to expound Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as it may be to them good sence, and consistent with their
Notions in other things, they are forc'd many times to go against
the easie and natural importance of the words, and to invent other
interpretations more compliant with their principles, and, as they
think, with the nature of things. We have, I say, a great instance
of this before us in the Scripture-History of the long lives of the
Ante-diluvians, where without any ground or shadow of ground
in the Narration, only to comply with a mistaken Philosophy,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:41970:90"/>
and their ignorance of the Primitive World, many men would
beat down the Scripture account of years into months, and sink the
lives of those first Fathers below the rate of the worst of Ages.
Whereby that great Monument, which Providence hath left us of
the first World, and of its difference from the Second, would not
only be defac'd, but wholly demolish'd. And all this sprung only
from the seeming incredibility of the thing; for they cannot show
in any part of Scripture, New or Old, that these <hi>Lunar</hi> years are
made use of, or that any computation, literal or Prophetical, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
upon them: Nor that there is any thing in the Text or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
of that place, that argues or intimates any such account. We
have endeavour'd, upon this occasion, effectually to prevent this
misconstruction of Sacred History, for the future; both by showing
the incongruities that follow upon it, and also that there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
from Nature of any such shift or evasion, as that is: But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on the contrary, that we have just and necessary reasons to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
That as the Forms of all things would be far more permanent
and lasting in that Primitive state of the Heavens and the Earth; so
particularly the Lives of Men, and of other Animals.</p>

discourse of the place of it, there is one affair of moment, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this Primitive Earth, that must first be stated and explain'd;
and that is, <hi>How</hi> it was water'd; from what causes, and in what
manner. How could Fountains rise, or Rivers flow in an Earth of
that Form and Nature? We have shut up the Sea with thick walls
on every side, and taken away all communication that could be
'twixt it and the External Earth; and we have remov'd all the
Hills and the Mountains where the Springs use to rise, and whence
the Rivers descend to water the face of the ground: And lastly, we
have left no issue for these Rivers, no Ocean to receive them, nor
any other place to disburthen themselves into: So that our New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
World is like to be a dry and barren Wilderness, and so far
from being <hi>Paradisiacal,</hi> that it would scarce be habitable.</p>
                     <p>I confess there was nothing in this whole Theory that gave such
a stop to my thoughts, as this part of it, concerning the Rivers of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:41970:90"/>
the first Earth; how they rise, how they flow'd, and how they
ended: It seem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d at first, that we had wip'd away at once the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and whole Doctrine of Rivers, we had turn'd the Earth so
smooth, that there was not an Hill or rising for the head of a
Spring, nor any fall or descent for the course of a River: Besides,
I had suckt in the common opinion of Philosophers, That all Rivers
rise from the Sea, and return to it again; and both those passages,
I see, were stopt up in that Earth. This gave me occasion to reflect
upon the modern and more solid opinion, concerning the Origin of
Fountains and Rivers, That they rise chiefly from Rains and mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Snows, and not from the Sea alone; and as soon as I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murr'd
in that particular, I see it was necessary to consider, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine,
how the Rains fell in that first Earth, to understand what
the state of their Waters and Rivers would be.</p>
                     <p>And I had no sooner appli'd my self to that Inquiry, but I easily
discover'd, that the Order of Nature in the Regions of the Air,
would be then very different from what it is now, and the Meteoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
of that World was of another sort from that of the present.
The Air was always calm and equal, there could be no violent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors
there, nor any that proceeded from extremity of Cold; as Ice,
Snow or Hail; nor Thunder neither; for the Clouds could not be
of a quality and consistency fit for such an effect, either by falling
one upon another, or by their disruption. And as for Winds, they
could not be either impetuous or irregular in that Earth; seeing there
were neither Mountains nor any other inequalities to obstruct the
course of the Vapours; nor any unequal Seasons, or unequal action
of the Sun, nor any contrary and strugling motions of the Air: Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was then a stranger to all those disorders. But as for watery
Meteors, or those that rise from watery Vapours more immediately,
as Dews, and Rains, there could not but be plenty of these, in some
part or other of that Earth; for the action of the Sun in raising Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,
was very strong and very constant, and the Earth was at first
moist and soft, and according as it grew more dry, the Rays of the
Sun would pierce more deep into it, and reach at length the
great Abyss which lay underneath, and was an unexhausted storehouse
of new Vapours. But, 'tis true, the same heat which extracted these
Vapours so copiously would also hinder them from condensing into
Clouds or Rain, in the warmer parts of the Earth; and there being
no Mountains at that time, nor contrary Winds, nor any such causes
to stop them or compress them, we must consider which way they
would tend, and what their course would be, and whether they
would any where meet with causes capable to change or condense
them; for upon this, 'tis manifest, would depend the Meteors of that
Air, and the Waters of that Earth.</p>
                     <p>And as the heat of the Sun was chiefly towards the middle parts of
the Earth, so the copious Vapours rais'd there were most rarified and
agitated; and being once in the open Air, their course would be that
way, where they found least resistance to their motion; and that
would certainly be towards the Poles, and the colder Regions of the
Earth. For East and West they would meet with as warm an Air,
and Vapours as much agitated as themselves, which therefore would
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:41970:91"/>
not yield to their progress that way; but towards the North and the
South, they would find a more easie passage, the Cold of those parts
attracting them, as we call it, that is, making way to their motion
and dilatation without much resistance, as Mountains and Cold places
usually draw Vapours from the warmer. So as the regular and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
course of the Vapours of that Earth, which were rais'd chiefly
about the Aequinoctial and middle parts of it, would be towards
the extream parts of it, or towards the Poles.</p>
                     <p>And in consequence of this, when these Vapours were arriv'd in
those cooler Climats, and cooler parts of the Air, they would be
condens'd into Rain; for wanting there the cause of their agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
namely, the heat of the Sun, their motion would soon begin
to languish, and they would fall closer to one another in the form
of Water. For the difference betwixt Vapours and Water is only
gradual, and consists in this, that Vapours are in a flying motion,
separate and distant each from another; but the parts of Water
are in a creeping motion, close to one another; like a swarm of
Bees, when they are setled; as Vapours resemble the same Bees in
the Air before they settle together. Now there is nothing puts
these Vapours upon the wing, or keeps them so, but a strong agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
by Heat; and when that fails, as it must do in all colder places
and Regions, they necessarily return to Water again. Accordingly
therefore we must suppose they would soon, after they reacht these
cold Regions, be condens'd, and fall down in a continual Rain or
Dew upon those parts of the Earth. I say a <hi>continual</hi> Rain; for see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the action of the Sun, which rais'd the Vapours, was (at that
time) always the same, and the state of the Air always alike, nor
any cross Winds, nor any thing else that could hinder the course
of the Vapours towards the Poles, nor their condensation when ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
there; 'tis manifest there would be a constant Source or store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house
of Waters in those parts of the Air, and in those parts of
the Earth.</p>
                     <p>And this, I think, was the establisht order of Nature in that
World, this was the state of the Ante-diluvian Heavens and Earth;
all their Waters came from above, and that with a constant supply
and circulation; for when the croud of Vapours, rais'd about the
middle parts of the Earth, found vent and issue this way towards
the Poles, the passage being once open'd, and the Chanel made, the
Current would be still continued without intermission; and as they
were dissolv'd and spent there, they would suck in more and more
of those which followed, and came in fresh streams from the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Climates. <hi>Aristotle,</hi> I remember, in his <hi>Meteors,</hi> speaking of
the course of the Vapours, saith, there is a River in the Air, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
slowing betwixt the Heavens and the Earth, made by the
ascending and descending Vapours; This was more remarkably
true in the Primitive Earth, where the state of Nature was
more constant and regular; there was indeed an uninterrupted
flood of Vapours rising in one Region of the Earth, and flowing to
another, and there continually distilling in Dews and Rain, which
made this Aereal River. As may be easily apprehended from this
Scheme of the Earth and Air.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="155" facs="tcp:41970:91"/>

                     </p>
                     <p>Thus we have found a Source for Waters in the first Earth,
which had no communication with the Sea; and a Source that
would never fail, neither diminish or overflow, but feed the Earth
with an equal supply throughout all the parts of the year. But
there is a second difficulty that appears at the end of this, <hi>How</hi> these
Waters would flow upon the even surface of the Earth, or form
themselves into Rivers; there being no descent or declivity for their
course. There were no Hills, nor Mountains, not high Lands in
the first Earth, and if these Rains fell in the frigid Zones, or towards
the Poles, there they would stand, in Lakes and Pools, having no
descent one way more than another; and so the rest of the Earth
would be no better for them. This, I confess, appear'd as great
a difficulty as the former, and would be unanswerable, for ought
I know, if that first Earth was not water'd by Dews only (as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
some Worlds are) or had been exactly Spherical; but we
noted before, that it was Oval or Oblong; and in such a Figure,
'tis manifest, the Polar parts are higher than the Aequinoctial, that
is, more remote from the Center, as appears to the eye in this
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:41970:92"/>
Scheme. This affords us a present remedy, and sets us free of the
second difficulty; for by this means the Waters which fell about
the extreme parts of the Earth, would have a continual descent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the middle parts of it; this Figure gives them motion and
distribution; and many Rivers and Rivulets would flow from those
Mother-Lakes to refresh the face of the Earth, bending their course
still towards the middle parts of it.</p>
                     <figure>

                     </figure>
                     <p>'Tis true, These derivations of the Waters at first would be very
irregular and diffuse, till the Chanels were a little worn and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed;
and though that Earth was smooth and uniform, yet 'tis
impossible, upon an inclining surface, but that Waters should find
a way of creeping downwards, as we see upon a smooth Table,
or a flagg'd Pavement, if there be the least inclination, Water will
flow from the higher to the lower parts of it, either directly, or
winding to and fro: So the smoothness of that Earth would be
no hindrance to the course of the Rivers, provided there was a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
declivity in the site and libration of it, as 'tis plain there was
from the Poles towards the Aequator. The Current indeed would
be easie and gentle all along, and if it chanc'd in some places to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:41970:92"/>
rest or be stopt, it would spread it self into a pleasant Lake, till by
fresh supplies it had rais'd its Waters so high, as to overflow and
break loose again; then it would pursue its way, with many other
Rivers its companions, through all the temperate Climates, as far
as the Torrid Zone.</p>
                     <p>But you'll say, When they were got thither, what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of them then? <hi>How</hi> would they end or finish their course?
This is the third difficulty, <hi>concerning</hi> the ending of the Rivers in that
Earth; what issue could they have when they were come to the
middle parts of it, whether it seems, they all tended. There was
no Sea to lose themselves in, as our Rivers do; nor any Subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
passages to throw themselves into; how would they die, what
would be their fate at last? I answer, The greater Rivers, when
they were come towards those parts of the Earth, would be divided
into many branches, or a multitude of Rivulets; and those would
be partly exhal'd by the heat of the Sun, and partly drunk up by
the dry and sandy Earth. But how and in what manner this came
to pass, requires a little further Explication.</p>
                     <p>We must therefore observe in the first place, that those Rivers as
they drew nearer to the Aequinoctial parts, would find a less decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
or descent of ground than in the beginning or former part of
their course; that is evident from the Oval Figure of the Earth,
for near the middle parts of an Oval, the Semidiameters, as I may
call them, are very little shorter one than another; and for this
reason the Rivers, when they were advanc'd towards the middle parts
of the Earth, would begin to flow more slowly, and by that weakness of
their Current, suffer themselves easily to be divided and distracted
into several lesser streams and Rivulets; or else, having no force to
wear a Chanel, would lie shallow upon the ground like a plash of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and in both cases their Waters would be much more expos'd to
the action of the Sun, than if they had kept together in a deeper
Chanel, as they were before.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, We must observe, that seeing these Waters could not
reach to the middle of the Torrid Zone, for want of descent; that
part of the Earth having the Sun always perpendicular over it, and
being refresht by no Rivers, would become extremely dry and parch'd,
and be converted at length into a kind of sandy Desart; so as all the
Waters that were carried thus far, and were not exhal'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd
by the Sun, would be suckt up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in a Spunge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by these
Sands of the Torrid Zone. This was the common Grave wherein
the Rivers of the first Earth were buried; and this is nothing but
what happens still in several parts of the present Earth, especially in
<hi>Africk,</hi> where many Rivers never flow into the Sea, but expire after
the same manner as these did, drunk up by the Sun and the Sands.
And one arm of <hi>Euphrates</hi> dies, as I remember, amongst the Sands
of <hi>Arabia,</hi> after the manner of the Rivers of the first Earth.</p>
                     <p>Thus we have conquer'd the greatest difficulty, in my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
in this whole Theory, <hi>To</hi> find out the state of the Rivers in the
Primitive and Ante-diluvian Earth, their origin, course, and period.
We have been forc'd to win our ground by Inches, and have divided
the difficulty into parts, that we might encounter them single with
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:41970:93"/>
more ease. The Rivers of that Earth, you see, were in most respects
different, and in some contrary to ours; and if you could turn our
Rivers backwards, to run from the Sea towards their Fountain-heads,
they would more resemble the course of those Ante-diluvian Rivers;
for they were greatest at their first setting out, and the Current after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
when it was more weak, and the Chanel more shallow,
was divided into many branches, and little Rivers; like the Arteries
in our Body, that carry the Blood, they are greatest at first, and the
further they go from the Heart, their Source, the less they grow and
divide into a multitude of little branches, which lose themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly
in the habit of the flesh, as these little Floods did in the
Sands of the Earth.</p>
                     <figure>
                        <p>Book. 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. fig. 3. p. 158.</p>
                     </figure>
                     <p>Because it pleaseth more, and makes a greater impression upon us,
to see things represented to the Eye, than to read their description in
words, we have ventur'd to give a model of the Primaeval Earth,
with its Zones or greater Climates, and the general order and tracts
of its Rivers: Not that we believe things to have been in the very
same form as here exhibited, but this may serve as a general <hi>Idea</hi> of
that Earth, which may be wrought into more exactness, according as
we are able to enlarge or correct our thoughts hereafter. And as the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:41970:93"/>
Zones here represented resemble the <hi>Belts</hi> or <hi>Eusciae</hi> of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> so
we suppose them to proceed from like causes, if that Planet be in an
Ante-diluvian state, as the Earth we here represent. As for the Polar
parts in that first Earth, I can say very little of them, they would make
a Scene by themselves, and a very particular one; The Sun would be
perpetually in their Horizon, which makes me think the Rains would
not fall so much there as in the other parts of the Frigid Zones,
where accordingly we have made their chief seat and receptacle. That
they flow'd from thence in such a like manner as is hero represented,
we have already prov'd; And sometimes in their passage swelling into
Lakes, and towards the end of their course parting into several
streams and branches, they would water those parts of the Earth like
a Garden.</p>
                     <p>We have before compar'd the branchings of these Rivers towards
the end of their course to the ramifications of the Arteries in the Body,
when they are far from the Heart near the extream parts; and some,
it may be, looking upon this Scheme, would carry the comparison
further, and suppose, that as in the Body the Bloud is not lost in the
habit of the flesh, but strain'd thorough it, and taken up again by
the little branches of the Veins; so in that Earth the Waters were
not lost in those Sands of the Torrid Zone, but strain'd or percola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thorough them, and receiv'd into the Chanels of the other Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphere.
This indeed would in some measure answer the Notion
which several of the Ancient Fathers make use of, that the Rivers of
<hi>Paradise</hi> were trajected out of the other Hemisphere into this, by Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
passages. But, I confess, I could never see it possible,
how such a trajection could be made, nor how they could have any
motion, being arriv'd in another Hemisphere; and therefore I am
apt to believe, that doctrine amongst the Ancients arose from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanglement
in their principles; They suppos'd generally, that <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise</hi>
was in the other Hemisphere, as we shall have occasion to show
hereafter; and yet they believ'd that <hi>Tigris, Euphrates, Nile,</hi> and
<hi>Gunges</hi> were the Rivers of <hi>Paradise,</hi> or came out of it; and these two
opinions they could not reconcile, or make out, but by supposing
that these four Rivers had their Fountain-heads in the other Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphere,
and by some wonderful trajection broke out again here. This
was the expedient they found out to make their opinions consistent
one with another; but this is a method to me altogether uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable;
and, for my part, I do not love to be led our of my depth,
leaning only upon Antiquity. How there could be any such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
either above ground, or under-ground; betwixt the two
Hemispheres does not appear, and therefore we must still suppose
the Torrid Zone to have been the Barrier betwixt them, which nothing
could pass either way.</p>
                     <p>We have now examin'd and determin'd the state of the Air, and
of the Waters in the Primitive Earth, by the light and consequences
of reason; and we must not wonder to find them different from the
present order of Nature; what things are said of them, or relating
to them in Holy Writ do testifie or imply as much; and it will be
worth our time to make some reflection upon those passages for our
further confirmation. <hi>Moses</hi> tells us, that the <hi>Rainbow</hi> was set in the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:41970:94"/>
Clouds after the Deluge; those Heavens then that never had a Rain-bow
before, were certainly of a constitution very different from ours. And
S. <hi>Peter</hi> doth formally and expresly tell us,<note place="margin">2 Epist. Chap. 3. 5.</note> that the <hi>Old Heavens,</hi> or
the Ante-diluvian Heavens had a different constitution from ours,
and particularly, that they were compos'd or constituted of Water;
which Philosophy of the Apostle's may be easily understood, if we
attend to two things, first, that the Heavens he speaks of, were not
the Starry Heavens, but the Aereal Heavens, or the Regions of our
Air, where the Meteors are; Secondly, That there were no Meteors
in those Regions, or in those Heavens, till the Deluge, but watery
Meteors, and therefore, he says, they consisted of Water. And this
shows the foundation upon which that description is made, how co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herently
the Apostle argues, and answers the objection there propos'd:
how justly also he distinguisheth the first Heavens from the present
Heavens, or rather opposeth them one to another; because as those
were constituted of Water and watery Meteors only, so the present
Heavens, he saith, have treasures of Fire, fiery Exhalations and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors,
and a disposition to become the Executioners of the Divine
wrath and decrees in the final Conflagration of the Earth.</p>
                     <p>This minds me also of the <hi>Celestial Waters,</hi> or the Waters above
the Firmaments, which Scripture sometimes mentions, and which,
methinks, cannot be explain'd so fitly and emphatically upon any
supposition as this of ours. Those who place them above the Starry
Heavens, seem neither to understand Astronomy nor Philosophy;
and, on the other hand, if nothing be understood by them, but the
Clouds and the middle Region of the Air, as it is at present, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
that was no such eminent and remarkable thing, as to deserve
a particular commemoration by <hi>Moses</hi> in his six days work; but if
we understand them, not as they are now, but as they were then,
the only Source of Waters, or the only Source of Waters upon that
Earth, (for they had not one drop of Water but what was Celestial,)
this gives it a new force and Emphasis: Besides, the whole middle
Region having no other sort of Meteors but them, That made it still
the greater singularity, and more worthy commemoration. As for
the Rivers of <hi>Paradise,</hi> there is nothing said concerning their Source,
or their issue, that is either contrary to this, or that is not agreeable
to the general account we have given of the Waters and Rivers
of the first Earth. They are not said to rise from any Mountain, but
from a great River, or a kind of Lake in <hi>Eden,</hi> according to the custom
of the Rivers of that Earth: And as for their end and issue, <hi>Moses</hi>
doth not say, that they disburthen'd themselves into this or that Sea,
as they usually do in the description of great Rivers, but rather im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
that they spent themselves in compassing and watering certain
Countries, which falls in again very easily with our <hi>Hypothesis.</hi> But
I say this rather to comply with the opinions of others than of my <hi>own</hi>
judgment. For I think that suggestion about the Supercoelestial
Waters made by <hi>Moses,</hi> was not so much according to the strict na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and speciality of Causes, as for the ease and profit of the People,
in their belief and acknowledgment of Providence for so great a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
by what Causes soever it was brought to pass.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="161" facs="tcp:41970:94"/>
But to return to the Rainbow, which we mention'd before, and
is not to be past over so slightly. This we say, is a Creature of the
modern World, and was not seen nor known before the Flood.
<hi>Moses (Gen. 9. 12, 13.)</hi> plainly intimates as much, or rather direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirms it; for he says. The Bow was set in the Clouds after the
Deluge, as a confirmation of the promise or Covenant which God
made with <hi>Noah,</hi> that he would drown the World no more with
Water. And how could it be a sign of this, or given as a pledge
and confirmation of such a promise, if it was in the Clouds before,
and with no regard to this promise? and stood there, it may be,
when the World was going to be drown'd. This would have been
but cold comfort to <hi>Noah,</hi> to have had such a pledge of the Divine Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity.
You'll say, it may be, that it was not a sign or pledge that
signified naturally, but voluntarily only, and by Divine Institution;
I am of opinion, I confess, that it signifi'd naturally, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
with the effect, importing thus much, that the state of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was chang'd from what it was before, and so chang'd, that
the Earth was no more in a condition to perish by Water. But
however, let us grant that it signified only by institution; to make
it significant in this sence, it must be something new, otherwise it
could not signifie any new thing, or be the confirmation of a new
promise. If God Almighty had said to <hi>Noah,</hi> I make a promise to
you, and to all living Creatures, that the World shall never be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd
by Water again, and for confirmation of this, Behold, <hi>I set
the Sun in the firmament:</hi> Would this have been any strengthning of
<hi>Noah</hi>'s faith, or any satisfaction to his mind? Why, says <hi>Noah,</hi>
the Sun was in the Firmament when the Deluge came, and was a
spectator of that sad Tragedy; why may it not be so again? what
sign or assurance is this against a second Deluge? when God gives a
sign in the Heavens, or on the Earth, of any Prophecy or Promise
to be fulfill'd, it must be by something new, or by some change
wrought in Nature; whereby God doth testifie to us, that he is able
and willing to stand to his promise.<note place="margin">Isa. 7.</note> God says to <hi>Ahaz, Ask a sign of the
Lord; Ask it either in the depth, or in the height above:</hi> And when
<hi>Ahaz</hi> would ask no sign, God gives one unaskt, <hi>Behold, a Virgin
shall conceive and bear a Son.</hi> So when <hi>Zachary</hi> was promis'd a Son,
he asketh for a sign,<note place="margin">Luke 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Whereby shall I know this? for I am old, and my
Wife well stricken in years;</hi> and the sign given him was, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
dumb, and continued so till the promise was fulfill'd. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
when <hi>Abraham</hi> askt a sign whereby he might be assur'd of
God's promise that his seed shou'd inherit the Land of <hi>Canaan, Gen.</hi>
15. 8. 'Tis said <hi>(ver. 17.) When the Sun went down and it was dark,
behold a smoaking furnace and a burning Lamp passed betwixt the pieces</hi>
of the beasts that he had cut asunder. So in other instances of signs
given in external Nature,<note place="margin">Isa. 38.</note> as the sign given to King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> for his
recovery, and to <hi>Gideon</hi> for his victory; to confirm the promise
made to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iudg. 7.</note> the shadow went back ten degrees in <hi>Ahaz.</hi> Dial:
And for <hi>Gideon, his Fleece was wet, and all the ground about it dry;</hi>
and then to change the trial, <hi>it was dry and all the ground about it
wet.</hi> These were all signs very proper, significant, and satisfactory,
having something surprising and extraordinary, yet these were signs
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:41970:95"/>
by institution only; and to be such they must have something new
and strange, as a mark of the hand of God, otherwise they can
have no force or significancy. Accordingly we see <hi>Moses</hi> himself in
another place speaks this very sence, when in the Mutiny or Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
of <hi>Corah</hi> and <hi>Dathan,</hi> he speaks thus to the People, <hi>If these men
die the common death of men, then the Lord hath not sent me. But if the
Lord make a new thing, and the Earth open her moath and swallow them
up,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then you shall understand that these men have provoked the Lord,
Nunr.</hi> 26. 29, 30. So in the case of <hi>Noah,</hi> if God <hi>created a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
(when are <hi>Moses</hi>'s words in the forecited place) the sign ws
effectual. But where every thing continues to be as it was before,
and the face of Nature, in all its parts, the very same, it cannot
signifie any thing new, nor any new intention in the Author of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and consequently, cannot be a sign or pledge, a token or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of the accomplishment of any new Covenant or promise
made by him.</p>
                     <p>This, methinks, is plain to common Sense, and to every Man's
Reason; but because it is a thing of importance, to prove that there
was no Rainbow before the Flood, and will confirm a considerable
part of this Theory, by discovering what the state of the Air was
in the Old World, give me leave to argue it a little further, and to
remove some prejudices that may keep others from assenting to
clear Reason. I know tis usually said, that signs, like words, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
any thing by institution, or may be appl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>d to any thing by
the will of the Imposer; as hanging out a white Flag is calling for
mercy, a Bush at the door, a sign of Wine to be fold, and such
like. But these are instances nothing to our purpose, these are signs
of something present, and that signifie only by use and repeated ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience;
we are speaking of signs of another nature, given in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of a promise, or threatning, or prophecy, and given with
design to cure our unbelief, or to excite and beget in us Faith in God,
in the Prophet, or in the Promiser, such signs, I say, when they are
wrought in external Nature, must be some new Appearance, and must
thereby induce us to believe the effect, or more to believe it, than if there
had been no sign, but only the affirmation of the Promiser; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the pretended sign is a meer Cypher and superfluity. But a
thing that obtain'd before, and in the same manner (even when that
came to pass, which we are now promis'd shall not come to pass
again) signifies no more, than if there had been no sign at all: it
can neither signifie another course in Nature, nor another purpose
in God; and therefore is perfectly insignificant. Some instance in
the Sacraments, Jewish or Christian, and make them signs in such a
sence as the Rainbow is: But those are rather Symbolical repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations
or commemorations; and some of them, marks of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
and consecration of our selves to God in such a Religion;
They were also new, and very particular when first instituted; but
all such instances fall short and do not reach the case before us;
we are speaking of signs confirmatory of a promise; when there is
something affirm'd <hi>de futuro,</hi> and to give us a further argument of
the certainty of it, and of the power and veracity of the Promiser,
a sign is given: This we say, must indispensably be something new,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:41970:95"/>
otherwise it cannot have the nature, vertue, and influence of a
sign.</p>
                     <p>We have seen how incongruous it would be to admit that the
Rainbow appear'd before the Deluge, and how dead a sign that
would make it, how forc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d, fruitless and ineffectual, as to the promise
it was to confirm; Let us now on the other hand suppose, that it
first appear'd to the Inhabitants of the Earth after the Deluge,
How proper, and how apposite a sign would this be for Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to pitch upon, to confirm the Promise made to <hi>Noah</hi> and his
posterity, <hi>That</hi> the World should be no more destroy'd by Water?
It had a secret connexion with the effect it self, and was so far a
natural sign; but however appearing first after the Deluge, and in
a watery Cloud, there was, methinks, a great easiness, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
of application for such a purpose. And if we suppose, that
while God Almighty was declaring his promise to <hi>Noah,</hi> and the
sign of it, there appear'd at the same time in the Clouds a fair
Rainbow, that marvellous and beautiful Meteor, which <hi>Noah</hi> had
never seen before; it could not but make a most lively impression
upon him, quickning his Faith, and giving him comfort and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
that God would be stedfast to his promise.</p>
                     <p>Nor ought we to wonder, that Interpreters have commonly
gone the other way, and suppos'd that the Rainbow was before the
Flood; This, I say, was no wonder in them, for they had no <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis</hi>
that could answer to any other interpretation; And in the
interpretation of the Texts of Scripture that concern natural things,
they commonly bring them down to their own Philosophy and
Notions:<note place="margin">2 Epist. c. 3. 5.</note> As we have a great instance in that discourse of S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s,
concerning the Deluge, and the Ante-diluvian Heavens, and Earth,
which, for want of a Theory, they have been scarce able to make
sence of; for they have forc'dly appli'd to the present Earth, or the
present form of the Earth, what plainly respected another. A like
instance we have in the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Abyss, or <hi>Tehom-Rabba,</hi> by whose
disruption the Deluge was made; this they knew not well what to
make of, and so have generally interpreted it of the Sea, or of our
Subterraneous Waters; without any propriety, either as to the
word, or as to the sence. A third instance is this of the Rainbow,
where their Philosophy hath misguided them again; for to give
them their due, they do not alledge, nor pretend to alledge, any
thing from the Text, that should make them interpret thus, or
think the Rainbow was before the Flood; but they pretend to go
by certain reasons, as that the Clouds were before the Flood, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Rainbow; and if the Rainbow was not before the Flood,
then all things were not made within the six days Creation: To
whom these reasons are convictive, they must be led into the same
belief with them, but not by any thing in the Text, nor in the
true Theory, at least if ours be so; for by that you see that the
Vapours were never condens'd into drops, nor into Rain in the
temperate and inhabited Climates of that Earth, and consequently
there could never be the production or appearance of this Bow in
the Clouds. Thus much concerning the Rainbow.</p>

To recollect our selves, and conclude this Chapter, and the whole
disquisition concerning the Waters of the Primitive Earth; we seem
to have so well satisfied the difficulties propos'd in the beginning of
the Chapter, that they have rather given us an advantage; a better
discovery, and such a new prospect of that Earth, as makes it
not only habitable, but more fit to be <hi>Paradisical.</hi> The pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the site of <hi>Paradise</hi> is made to consist chiefly in two things, its
Waters, and its Trees, <hi>(Gen.</hi> 2. and <hi>Chap. 13. 10. Ezek. 31. 8.)</hi> and
considering the richness of that first soil in the Primitive Earth, it
could not but abound in Trees, as it did in Rivers and Rivulets;
and be wooded like a Grove, uss it was water'd like a Garden, in the
temperate Climates of it; so as it would not be, methinks, so diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult

comparison of it with the present World.</head>
                     <p>WE have now, in a good measure, finish'd our description of
the first and Ante-diluvian Earth; And as Travellers, when
they see strange Countries, make it part of their pleasure and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement,
to compare them with their own, to observe the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
and wherein they excel, or come short of one another: So
it will not be unpleasant, nor unuseful, it may be, having made a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
not of a new Countrey, but of a new World, and travell'd
it over in our thoughts and fancy, now to sit down and compare
it with our own: and 'twill be no hard task, from the general dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
which we have taken notice of already, to observe what
lesser would arise, and what the whole face of Nature would be.</p>
                     <p>'Tis also one fruit of travelling, that by seeing variety of places
and people, of humours, fashions, and forms of living, it frees us,
by degrees, from that pedantry and littleness of Spirit, whereby we
are apt to censure every thing for absurd and ridiculous, that is
not according to our own way, and the mode of our own Country;
But if instead of crossing the Seas, we could waft our selves over to
our neighbouring Planets, we should meet with such varieties
there, both in Nature and Mankind, as would very much enlarge
our thoughts and Souls, and help to cure those diseases of little minds,
that make them troublesome to others, as well as uneasie to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                     <p>But seeing our heavy Bodies are not made for such Voyages, the
best and greatest thing we can do in this kind, is to make a Survey
and reflection upon the Ante-diluvian Earth, which in some sence was
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:41970:96"/>
another World from this, and it may be, as different as some two
Planets are from one another. We have declar'd already the general
grounds upon which we must proceed, and must now trace the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
of them, and drive them down into particulars, which
will shew us in most things, wherein that Earth, or that World,
differ'd from the present. The form of that Earth, and its situation
to the Sun, were two of its most fundamental differences from ours;
As to the form of it, 'twas all one smooth Continent, one continued
surface of Earth, without any Sea, any Mountains, or Rocks; any
Holes, Dens or Caverns: And the situation of it to the Sun was
such as made a perpetual Aequinox. These two joyn'd together, lay
the foundation of a new Astronomy, Meteorology, Hydrography and
Geography; such as were proper and peculiar to that World. The
Earth by this means having its Axis parallel to the Axis of the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
the Heavens would appear in another posture: and their diurnal
motion, which is imputed to the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> and suppos'd to be
upon the Poles of the Aequator, would then be upon the same Poles
with the second and Periodical motions of the Orbs and Planets;
namely, upon the Poles of the Ecliptick; by which means the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi>
of the Heavens would be more simple and regular, and much
of that intangledness and perplexity, which we find now in Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
would be taken away. Whether the Sun and Moon would suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
any Eclipses then, cannot well be determin'd, unless one knew
what the course of the Moon was at that time, or whether she was
then come into our neighbourhood: Her presence seems to have
been less needful when there were no long Winter-nights, nor the
great Pool of the Sea to move or govern.</p>
                     <p>As for the Regions of the Air and the Meteors, we have in the
preceding Chapter set down what the state of them would be, and
in how much a better order, and more peaceable, that Kingdom was,
till the Earth was broken and displac'd, and the course of Nature
chang'd: Nothing violent, nothing frightful, nothing troublesome or
incommodious to Mankind, came from above, but the countenance of
the Heavens was always smooth and serene. I have often thought it
a very desirable piece of power, if a Man could but command a fair
day, when he had occasion for it, for himself, or for his friends; 'tis
more than the greatest Prince or Potentate upon Earth can do; yet
they never wanted one in that World, nor ever see a foul one. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
they had constant breezes from the motion of the Earth, and
the course of the Vapours, which cool'd the open Plains, and made the
weather temperate, as well as fair. But we have spoken enough in
other places upon this subject of the Air and the Heavens, Let us
now descend to the Earth.</p>
                     <p>The Earth was divided into two Hemispheres, separated by the
Torrid Zone, which at that time was uninhabitable, and utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passable;
so as the two Hemispheres made two distinct Worlds,
which, so far as we can judge, had no manner of commerce or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
one with another. The Southern Hemisphere the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
call'd <hi>Antichthon, the Opposite Earth,</hi> or the <hi>Other World.</hi> And
this name and notion remain'd long after the reason of it had c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ast.
Just as the Torrid Zone was generally accounted uninhabitable by the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:41970:97"/>
Ancients, even in their time, because it really had been so once,
and the Tradition remain'd uncorrected, when the causes were taken
away; namely, when the Earth had chang'd its posture to the Sun
after the Deluge.</p>
                     <p>This may be lookt upon as the first division of that Primaval Earth,
into two Hemispheres, naturally sever'd and disunited: But it was
also divided into five Zones, two Frigid, two Temperate, and the
Torrid betwixt them. And this distinction of the Globe into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ve
Zones, I think, did properly belong to that Original Earth, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Geography, and improperly, and by translation only, to the
present. For all the Zones of our Earth are habitable, and their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions
are in a manner but imaginary, not fixt by Nature; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in that Earth where the Rivers fail'd, and the Regions became un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabitable,
by reason of driness and heat, there begun the Torrid
Zone; and where the Regions became uninhabitable by reason of cold
and moisture, there begun the Frigid Zone; and these being deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd,
they became bounds on either side to the Temperate. But all
this was alter'd when the posture of the Earth was chang'd; and
chang'd for that very purpose, as some of the Ancients have said,
<hi>That the uninhabitable parts of the Earth might become habitable.</hi> Yet
though there was so much of the first Earth uninhabitable, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
as much to be inhabited as we have now; for the Sea, since
the breaking up of the Abyss, hath taken away half of the Earth from
us, a great part whereof was to them good Land. Besides, We are
not to suppose, that the Torrid Zone was of that extent we make it
now, twenty three degrees and more on either side of the Aequator;
these bounds are set only by the Tropicks, and the Tropicks by the
obliquity of the course of the Sun, or of the posture of the Earth,
which was not in that World. Where the Rivers stopt, there the
Torrid Zone would begin, but the Sun was directly perpendicular to
no part of it but the middle.</p>
                     <p>How the Rivers flow'd in the first Earth we have before explain'd
sufficiently, and what parts the Rivers did not reach, were turn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Sands and Desarts by the heat of the Sun; for I cannot easily
imagine, that the Sandy Desarts of the Earth were made so at first,
immediately and from the beginning of the World; from what causes
should that be, and to what purpose in that age? But in those Tracts
of the Earth that were not refresht with Rivers and moisture, which
cement the parts, the ground would moulder and crumble into
little pieces, and then those pieces by the heat of the Sun were bak'd
into Stone. And this would come to pass chiefly in the hot and
scorch'd Regions of the Earth, though it might happen sometimes
where there was not that extremity of heat, if by any chance a place
wanted Rivers and Water to keep the Earth in due temper; but
those Sands would not be so early or ancient as the other. As for
greater loose Stones, and rough Pebbles, there were none in that
Earth; <hi>Deucalion</hi> and <hi>Pyrrha</hi> when the Deluge was over, found
new made Stones to cast behind their backs; the bones of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Earth, which then were broken in pieces, in that great ruine.</p>
                     <p>As for Plants and Trees, we cannot imagine but that they must
needs abound in the Primitive Earth, seeing it was so well water'd,

                     <p>As for Subterraneous things, Metals and Minerals, I believe they
had none in the first Earth; and the happier they; no Gold, nor
Silver, nor courser Metals. The use of these is either imaginary,
or in such works, as, by the constitution of their World, they
had little occasion for. And Minerals are either for Medicine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which they had no need of further than Herbs; or for Materials to
certain Arts, which were not then in use, or were suppli'd by
other ways. These Subterraneous things, Metals and metallick Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,

doth not seem probable, that they could be drawn through such
a mass of Waters, or that the heat of the Sun could on a sudden
penetrate so deep, and be able to loosen them, and raise them into
the exteriour Earth. And as the first Age of the World was call'd
<hi>Golden,</hi> though it knew not what Gold was; so the following Ages
had their names from several Metals, which lay then asleep in the
dark and deep womb of Nature, and see not the Sun till many
Years and Ages afterwards.</p>
                     <p>Having run through the several Regions of Nature, from top to
bottom, from the Heavens to the lower parts of the Earth, and
made some observations upon their order in the Ante-diluvian
World; Let us now look upon Man and other living Creatures, that
make the Superiour and Animate part of Nature. We have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,
and sufficiently spoken to that difference betwixt the Men
of the old World, and those of the present, in point of Longaevity,
and given the reasons of it; but we must not imagine, that this
long life was peculiar to Man, all other Animals had their share of
it, and were in their proportion longer-liv'd than they are now.
Nay, not only Animals, but also Vegetables, and the forms of all
living things were far more permanent; The Trees of the Field and
of the Forest, in all probability, out-lasted the lives of Men; and I
do not know but the first Groves of Pines and Cedars that grew out
of the Earth,<note place="margin">Ezek. 31. 8.</note> or that were planted in the Garden of God, might be
standing when the Deluge came, and see, from first to last, the entire
course and period of a World.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="168" facs="tcp:41970:98"/>
We might add here,<note place="margin">Civ. Dei lib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

concerning Men and other living Creatures in the first World, that
They were greater, as well as longer-liv'd, than they are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
This seems to be a very reasonable conjecture, for the state
of every thing that hath life, is divided into the time of its growth,
its consistency, and its decay; and when the whole duration is
longer, every one of these parts, though not always in like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions,
will be longer. We must suppose then, that the growth
both in Men and other Animals lasted longer in that World than
it doth now, and consequently carried their Bodies both to a greater
height and bulk. And in like manner, their Trees would be both
taller, and every way bigger than ours; neither were they in any
danger there to be blown down by Winds and Storms, or struck
with Thunder, though they had been as high as the <hi>Ae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and Trunks proportionable, and were streight and well pois'd,
they would stand firm and with a greater majesty. <hi>The Fowls of

Beasts of the Field bringing forth their Young.</hi> When things are fairly
possible in their causes, and possible in several degrees, higher or
lower, 'tis weakness of Spirit in us, to think there is nothing in
Nature, but in that one way, or in that one degree, that we are
us'd to. And whosoever believes those accounts given us, both by
the Ancients<note n="*" place="margin">Plin. l. 7. c. 2. Strab. l. 17.</note> and Moderns<note n="‖" place="margin">Hort. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labor. vol. 3.</note>, of the <hi>Indian</hi> Trees, will not think it

to the Trees of <hi>Paradise,</hi> was chiefly for the greatness and
stateliness of them; and there is all fairness of reason to believe,
that in that first Earth, both the Birds of the Air, and the Beasts
of the Field, and the Trees and their Fruit, were all, in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
kinds more large and goodly than Nature produces any now.</p>
                     <p>So much in short concerning the Natural World, Inanimate or
Animate; We should now take a prospect of the Moral World
of that time, or of the Civil and Artificial World; what the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Oeconomy of these was, what the manner of living, and
how the Scenes of humane life were different from ours at present.
The Ancients, especially the Poets, in their description of the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Age, exhibit to us an Order of things, and a Form of Life,
very remote from any thing we see in our days; but they are not to
be trusted in all particulars, many times they exaggerate matters
on purpose, that they may seem more strange, or more great, and
by that means move and please us more. A <hi>Moral</hi> or <hi>Philosophick
History</hi> of the World well writ, would certainly be a very useful
work, to observe and relate how the Scenes of Humane Life have
chang'd in several Ages, the modes and Forms of living, in what
simplicity Men begun at first, and by what degrees they came out
of that way, by luxury, ambition, improvement, or changes in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
then what new forms and modifications were superadded by
the invention of Arts, what by Religion, what by Superstition.
This would be a view of things more instructive, and more satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:41970:98"/>
factory, than to know what Kings Reign'd in such an Age, and
what Battles were fought; which common History teacheth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
teacheth little more. Such affairs are but the little under plots in
the Tragi comedy of the World; the main design is of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and of far greater extent and consequence. But to return to
the subject.</p>
                     <p>As the Animate World depends upon the Inanimate, so the Civil
World depends upon them both, and takes its measures from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Nature is the foundation still, and the affairs of Mankind are a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstructure
that will be always proportion'd to it. Therefore we
must look back upon the model or picture of their Natural World,
which we have drawn before, to make our conjectures or judgment
of the Civil and Artificial that were to accompany it. We observ'd
from their perpetual Aequinox, and the smoothness of the Earth,
that the Air would be always calm, and the Heavens fair, no cold
or violent Winds, Rains, or Storms, no extremity of weather in
any kind, and therefore they would need little protection from the
iniuries of the Air in that state; whereas now one great part of the
affairs of life, is to preserve our selves from those inconveniences,
by building and cloathing. How many Hands, and how many Trades
are imploy'd about these two things, which then were in a manner
needless, or at least in such plainness and simplicity, that every man
might be his own workman. Tents and Bowers would keep them
from all incommodities of the Air and weather, better than Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walls,
and strong Roofs defend <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s now; and Men are apt to take
the easiest ways of living, till necessity or vice put them upon others
that are more laborious, and more artificial. We also observ'd and
prov'd, that they had no Sea in the Primitive and Ante-diluvian
World, which makes a vast difference 'twixt us and them; This
takes up half of our Globe, and a good part of Mankind is busied
with Sea-affairs and Navigation. They had little need of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing
then. Nature suppli'd them at home with all necessaries, which
were few, and they were not so greedy of superfluities as we are.
We may add to these what concern'd their Food and Diet; Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
doth generally suppose that Men were not Carnivo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>us in those
Ages of the World, or did not feed upon Flesh, but only upon
Fruit and Herbs. And this seems to be plainly confirm'd by Scripture;
for after the Deluge God Almighty gives <hi>Noah</hi> and his Posterity a
Licence to eat Flesh, <hi>(Gen. 9. 2, 3.) Every moving thing that liveth
shall be meat for you.</hi> Whereas before in the new-made Earth God
had prescrib'd them Herbs and Fruit for their Diet, <hi>Gen. 1. 29. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
I have given you every Herb bearing Seed, which is upon the face
of all the Earth; and every Tree, in the which is the Fruit of a Tree
yielding Seed, to you it shall be for meat.</hi> and of this Natural Diet
they would be provided to their hands, without further preparation,
as the Birds and the Beasts are.</p>
                     <p>Upon these general grounds we may infer and conclude, that the
Civil World then, as well as the Natural, had a very different face
and aspect from what it hath now; for of these Heads, Food and
Cloathing. Building and Traffick, with that train of Arts, Trades
and Manufactures that attend them, the Civil Order of things is in a
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:41970:99"/>
great measure constituted and compounded: These make the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of life, the several occupations of Men, the noise and hurry of
the World; These fill our Cities, and our Fairs, and our Havens and
Ports; yet all these fine things are but the effects of indigency and
necessitousness, and were, for the most part, needless and unknown
in that first state of Nature. The Ancients have told us the same
things in effect, but telling us them without their grounds, which
they themselves did not know, they lookt like Poetical stories, and
pleasant fictions, and with most Men past for no better. We have
shewn them in another light, with their Reasons and Causes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
from the state of the Natural World, which is the Basis upon
which they stand; and this doth not only give them a just and full
credibility, but also lays a foundation for after-thoughts, and further
deductions, when they meet with minds dispos'd to pursue Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of this Nature.</p>
                     <p>As for Laws, Government, natural Religion, Military and Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial

                        </gap>, with all their Equipage, which make an higher order of
things in the Civil and Moral World, to calculate these upon the
grounds given, would be more difficult, and more uncertain; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do they at all belong to the present Theory. But from what
we have already observ'd, we may be able to make a better judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of those Traditional accounts which the Ancients have left us
concerning these things, in the early Ages of the World, and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
state of Nature. No doubt in these, as in all other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
there was a great easiness and simplicity in comparison of what
is now, we are in a more pompous, forc'd, and artificial method,
which partly the change of Nature, and partly the Vices and Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Men have introduc'd and establisht. But these things, with
many more, ought to be the subject of a <hi>Philosophick History</hi> of the
World, which we mention'd before.</p>
                     <p>This is a short and general Scheme of the Primaeval World,
compar'd with the Modern; yet these things did not equally run
through all the parts and Ages of it, there was a declension and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy,
both Natural and Moral, by degrees, and especially to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the latter end, but the principal form of Nature remaining
till the Deluge and the dissolution of that Heavens and Earth, till
then also this Civil frame of things would stand in a great measure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And though such a state of Nature, and of Mankind, when 'tis
propos'd crudely, and without its grounds, appear fabulous or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary,
yet 'tis really in it self a state, not only possible, but more
easie and natural, than what the World is in at present. And if
one of the old Ante-diluvian Patriarchs should rise from the dead,
he would be more surpris'd to see our World in that posture it is,
than we can be by the story and description of his. As an <hi>Indian</hi>
hath more reason to wonder at the <hi>European</hi> modes, than we have
to wonder at their plain manner of living. 'Tis we that have left
the tract of Nature, that are wrought and screw'd up into artifices,
that have disguis'd our selves; and 'tis in our World that the
Scenes are chang'd, and become more strange and Fantastical.</p>
                     <p>I will conclude this Discourse with an easie remark, and without
any particular Application of it. 'Tis a strange power that custom
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:41970:99"/>
hath upon weak and little Spirits; whose thoughts reach no further
than their Senses; and what they have seen and been us'd to, they
make the Standard and Measure of Nature, of Reason, and of
all <hi>Decorum.</hi> Neither are there any sort of Men more positive and
tenacicus of their petty opinions, than they are; nor more censo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
even to bitterness and malice. And 'tis generally so, that
those that have the least evidence for the truth of their beloved opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
are most peevish and impatient in the defence of them.
This sort of Men are the last that will be made Wise Men, if ever they
be; for they have the worst of diseases that accompany ignorance,
and do not so much as know themselves to be sick.</p>

the middle Region; but then they were at a loss for Water, which
made a great part of the pleasure and beauty of that place. Others
therefore would seat it in a Plain, or in a River-Island, that they
might have Water enough, but then it would be subject to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
of the Air, and foul weather at the seasons of the Year, from
which, both Reason and all Authority have exempted <hi>Paradise.</hi>
'Tis like seeking a perfect beauty in a mortal Body, there are so
many things requir'd to it, as to complexion, Features, Proportions
and Air, that they never meet all together in one person; neither can
all the properties of a Terrestrial <hi>Paradise</hi> ever meet together in one
place, though never so well chosen, in this present Earth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="172" facs="tcp:41970:100"/>
But in the Primaeval Earth, which we have describ'd, 'tis easie to
find a Seat that had all those beauties and conveniences. We have
every where through the temperate Climates, a clear and constant
Air, a fruitful Soil, pleasant Waters, and all the general characters of
<hi>Paradise;</hi> so that the trouble will be rather in that competition, what
part of Region to pitch upon in particular. But to come as near it
as we can, we must remember in the first place, how that Earth was
divided into two Hemispheres, distant and separated from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
not by an imaginary line, but by a real boundary that could
not be past; so as the first inquiry will be, in whether of these Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spheres
was the Seat of <hi>Paradise.</hi> To answer this only according to
our Theory, I confess, I see no natural reason or occasion to place it
in one Hemisphere more than in another; I see no ground of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
or pre-eminence, that one had above the other; and I am apt
to think, that depended rather upon the will of God, and the Series
of Providence that was to follow in this Earth, than upon any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
incapacity in one of these two Regions more than in the other,
for planting in it the Garden of God. Neither doth Scripture
determine, with any certainty, either Hemisphere for the place of it;
for when 'tis said to be in <hi>Eden,</hi> or to be the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> 'tis
no more than the Garden of <hi>pleasure</hi> or <hi>delight,</hi> as the word signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies:
And even the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> who render this word <hi>Eden,</hi> as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
name twice, <hi>(Gen. 2. ver. 8, &amp; 10.)</hi> do in the same story render
it twice as a common name, signifying <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>pleasure, (Chap.</hi> 2. 15.
and <hi>Chap. 3. 24.)</hi> and so they do accordingly render it in <hi>Ezekiel
(Chap. 31. 9. 16, 18.)</hi> where this Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> is spoken of again.
Some have thought that the word <hi>Mekiddim (Gen. 2. 8.)</hi> was to be
render'd <hi>in the East,</hi> or <hi>Eastward,</hi> as we read it, and therefore deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
the site of <hi>Paradise;</hi> but 'tis only the <hi>Septuagint</hi> Translate it
so, all the other <hi>Greek</hi> Versions, and S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> the <hi>Vulgate,</hi> the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi>
Paraphrase, and the <hi>Syriack</hi> render it <hi>from the beginning,</hi> or <hi>in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,</hi>
or to that effect. And we that do not believe the <hi>Septuagint</hi> to
have been infallible, or inspir'd, have no reason to prefer their single
authority above all the rest. Some also think the place of <hi>Paradise</hi>
may be determin'd by the four Rivers that are named as belonging
to it, and the Countries they ran thorough; but the names of those
Rivers are to me uncertain, and two of them altogether unintelligible.
Where are there four Rivers in our Continent that come from one
Head, as these are said to have done, either at the entrance or issue
of the Garden? 'Tis true, if you admit our <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> concerning
the fraction and disruption of the Earth at the Deluge, then we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
expect to find Rivers now as they were before, the general
Source is chang'd, and their Chanels are all broke up; but if you do
not admit such a dissolution of the Earth, but suppose the Deluge to
have been only like a standing Pool, after it had once cover'd the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the Earth, I do not see why it should make any great haveck
or confusion in it; and they that go that way, are therefore the more
oblig'd to show us still the Rivers of <hi>Paradise.</hi> Several of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
as we shall show hereafter, suppos'd these four Rivers to have
their Heads in the other Hemisphere, and if so, the Seat of <hi>Paradise</hi>
might be there too. But let them first agree amongst themselves,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:41970:100"/>
concerning these Rivers, and the Countries they run thorough, and
we will undertake to show, that there cannot be any such in this
Continent.</p>
                     <p>Seeing then neither the Theory doth determine, nor Scripture,
where the place of <hi>Paradise</hi> was, nor in whether Hemisphere, we
must appeal to Antiquity, or the opinions of the Ancients; for I know
no other Guide, but one of these three, Scripture, Reason, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Tradition; and where the two former are silent, it seems very
reasonable to consult the third. And that our Inquiries may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
enough, we will consider what the <hi>Iews,</hi> what the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi>
and what the <hi>Christian</hi> Fathers have said or determin'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Seat of <hi>Paradise.</hi> The <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors place it
in neither Hemisphere, but betwixt both, under the Aequinoctial,
as you may see plainly in <hi>Abravanel, Manasses Ben-Israel, Maimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
Aben Ezra,</hi> and others But the reason why they carried it no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than the Line, is because they suppos'd it certain, as <hi>Aben Ezra</hi>
tells us, that the days and nights were always equal in <hi>Paradise,</hi> and
they did not know how that could be, unless it stood under the Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial.
But we have shown another method, wherein that perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Aequinox came to pass, and how it was common to all the parts
and Climates of that Earth, which if they had been aware of, and
that the Torrid Zone at that time was utterly uninhabitable, having
remov'd their <hi>Paradise</hi> thus far from home, they would probably
have remov'd it a little further, into the temperate Climates of
the other Hemisphere.</p>
                     <p>The Ancient Heathens, Poets and Philosophers, had the notion
of <hi>Paradise,</hi> or rather of several <hi>Paradises</hi> in the Earth; and 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
that they plac'd them generally, if not all of them, out
of this Continent; in the Ocean, or beyond it, or in another Orb
or Hemisphere. The Garden of the <hi>Hesperides,</hi> the Fortunate <hi>Islands,</hi>
the <hi>Elysian Fields, Ogygia</hi> and <hi>Toprabane,</hi> as it is describ'd by <hi>Diodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
Siculus,</hi> with others such like; which as they were all characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riz'd
like so many <hi>Paradises,</hi> so they were all feared out of our
Continent by their Geography and descriptions of them.</p>
                     <p>Thus far Antiquity seems to incline to the other Hemisphere, or
to some place beyond the bounds of our Continent for the Seat of
<hi>Paradise:</hi> But that which we are most to depend upon in this affair,
is Christian Antiquity, the Judgment and Tradition of the Fathers
upon this Argument. And we may safely say in the first place,
negatively, that none of the Christian Fathers, <hi>Latin</hi> or <hi>Greek,</hi> ever
plac'd <hi>Paradise</hi> in <hi>Mesopotamia;</hi> that is a conceit and invention of
some Modern Authors, which hath been much encouraged of late, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it gave Men ease and rest as to further inquiries, in an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they could not well manage. Secondly, We may affirm, that
none of the Christian Fathers have plac'd <hi>Paradise</hi> in any determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Region of our Continent, <hi>Asia, Africk</hi> or <hi>Europe.</hi> I have read
of one or two Authors, I think, that fansied <hi>Paradise</hi> to have been
at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> but 'twas a meer fansie, that no body regarded or
pursu'd. The controversie amongst the Fathers concerning <hi>Paradise,</hi>
was quite another thing from what it is now of late: They disputed
and controverted, whether <hi>Paradise</hi> was Corporeal or Intellectual
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:41970:101"/>
only, and Allegorical; This was the grand point amongst them.
Then of those that thought it Corporeal, some plac'd it high
in the Air, some inaccessible by Desarts or Mountains, and many
beyond the Ocean, or in another World; And in these chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
the differences and diversity of opinions amongst them; nor
do we find that they nam'd any particular place or Country in the
known parts of the Earth for the Seat of <hi>Paradise,</hi> or that one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
for one spot of ground, and another for another, which is
the vain temerity of modern Authors; as if they could tell to an
Acre of Land where <hi>Paradise</hi> stood, or could set their foot upon
the Centre of the Garden. These have corrupted and misrepresen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the notion of our <hi>Paradise,</hi> just as some modern Poets have the
notion of the <hi>Elysian fields,</hi> which <hi>Homer</hi> and the Ancients plac'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
on the extremities of the Earth, and these would make a little
green Meadow in <hi>Campania Felix</hi> to be the fam'd <hi>Elysium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus much concerning the Fathers, negatively; but to discover
as far as we can, what their positive Assertions were in this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
we may observe, that though their opinions be differently
exprest, they generally concenter in this, that the <hi>Southern Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphere</hi>
was the Seat of <hi>Paradise.</hi> This, I say, seems manifestly to be
the sence of Christian Antiquity and Tradition, so far as there is
any thing definitive in the remains we have upon that subject. Some
of the Fathers did not believe <hi>Paradise</hi> to be Corporeal and Local,
and those are to be laid aside in the first place, as to this point;
Others that thought it Local, did not determine any thing (as most
of them indeed did not) concerning the particular place of it; But
the rest that did, though they have exprest themselves in various
ways, and under various forms, yet, upon a due interpretation,
they all meet in one common and general conclusion, That <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise</hi>
was seated beyond the Aequinoctial, or in the other Hemisphere.</p>
                     <p>And to understand this aright, we must reflect, in the first place,
upon the form of the Primaeval Earth, and of the two Hemispheres
of which it consisted, altogether incommunicable one with another,
by reason of the Torrid Zone betwixt them; so as those two He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mispheres
were then as two distinct Worlds, or distinct Earths,
that had no commerce with one another. And this Notion or
Tradition we find among Heathen Authors, as well as Christian,
this Opposite Earth being call'd by them <hi>Antichthon,</hi> and its Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
<hi>Antichthones:</hi> For those words comprehend both the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes</hi>
and <hi>Antoeci,</hi> or all beyond the Line, as is manifest from their
best Authors, as <hi>Achilles Tatius,</hi> and <hi>Caesar Germanicus</hi> upon <hi>Aratus,
Probus Grammaticus, Censorinus, Pomponius Mela,</hi> and <hi>Pliny.</hi> And
these were call'd another World, and lookt upon as another stock
and race of Mankind,<note place="margin">Somn. Scip.</note> as appears from <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Macrobius:</hi> But as
the latter part was their mistake, so the former is acknowledg'd by
Christian Authors, as well as others; and particularly S. <hi>Clement,</hi>
in his Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> mentions a <hi>World,</hi> or <hi>Worlds beyond
the Ocean, subject to Divine Providence, and the great Lord of Nature,
as well as ours.</hi> This passage of S. <hi>Clement</hi> is also cited by S. <hi>Ierom,</hi>
in his Commentary upon <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 2. and by <hi>Origen Periarchon,</hi>
where the Inhabitants of that other World are call'd <hi>Antichthones.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lib. 2. c. 3.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="175" facs="tcp:41970:101"/>
I make this remark in the first place, that we may understand
the true sence and importance of those phrases and expressions
amongst the Ancients, when they say <hi>Paradise</hi> was in <hi>another World.</hi>
Which are not to be so understood, as if they thought <hi>Paradise</hi> was in
the Moon, or in <hi>Iupiter,</hi> or hung above like a Cloud or a Meteor,
they were not so extravagant; but that <hi>Paradise</hi> was in another
Hemisphere, which was call'd <hi>Antichthon,</hi> another <hi>Earth,</hi> or another
<hi>World</hi> from Ours; and justly reputed so, because of an impossibility
of commerce or intercourse betwixt their respective Inhabitants.
And this remark being premis'd, we will now distribute the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Authors and Fathers that have deliver'd their opinion concerning
the place of <hi>Paradise,</hi> into three or four ranks or orders; and
though they express themselves differently, you will see, when duly
examin'd and expounded, they all conspire and concur in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
conclusion, <hi>That</hi> the Seat of <hi>Paradise</hi> was in the other
Hemisphere.</p>
                     <p>In the first rank then we will place and reckon those that have
set <hi>Paradise</hi> in another <hi>World,</hi> or in another <hi>Earth;</hi> seeing, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the foregoing Explication, that is the same thing, as to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it seated beyond the Torrid Zone in the other Hemisphere. In
this number are <hi>Ephrem Syrus, Moses Bar Cepha, Tatianus,</hi> and of
later date <hi>Iacobus de Valentia.</hi> To these are to be added again such
Authors as say, that <hi>Adam,</hi> when he was turn'd out of <hi>Paradise,</hi>
was brought into <hi>our Earth,</hi> or into our Region of the Earth; for
this is tantamount with the former; And this seems to be the sence
of S. <hi>Ierom</hi> in several places against <hi>Iovinian,</hi> as also of <hi>Constantine,</hi>
in his <hi>Oration</hi> in <hi>Eusebius,</hi> and is positively asserted by <hi>Sulpitius Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus.</hi>
And lastly, Those Authors that represent <hi>Paradise</hi> as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from our World, and inaccessible, so S. <hi>Austin, Procopius Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeus,
Beda, Strabus Fuldensis, Historia Scholiastica,</hi> and others, these
I say, pursue the same notion of Antiquity; for what is remote
from our World (that is, from our Continent, as we before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
it) is to be understood to be that <hi>Antichthon,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </note> or Anti-hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphere
which the Ancients oppos'd to ours.</p>
                     <p>Another sett of Authors that interpret the <hi>Flaming Sword</hi> that
guarded <hi>Paradise</hi> to be the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> do plainly intimate, that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise</hi>
in their opinion lay beyond the Torrid Zone, or in the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemisphere;
And thus <hi>Tertullian</hi> interprets the Flaming Sword, and
in such words as fully confirm our sence: <hi>Paradise,</hi> He says, <hi>by the
Torrid Zone, as by a wall of Fire, was sever'd from the communication and
knowledge of our World.</hi> It lay then on the other side of this Zone.
And S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> or the ancient Author that passeth under his name,
in his Comment upon <hi>Genesis,</hi> expresseth himself to the same effect;
so also S. <hi>Austin</hi> and <hi>Isidore Hispalensis</hi> are thought to interpret it:
And <hi>Aquinas</hi> who makes <hi>Paradise</hi> inaccessible, gives this reason for
it, <hi>Propter vehementiam aestûs in locis intermediis ex propinquitate Solis,
&amp; hoc significatur per Flammeum Gladium: Because of that vehement
heat in the parts betwixt us and that, arising from the nearness of the
Sun, and this is signified by the Flaming Sword.</hi> And this interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Flaming Sword</hi> receives a remarkable force and Emphasis
from our Theory and description of the Primaeval Earth, for there
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:41970:102"/>
the Torrid Zone was as a wall of Fire indeed, or a Region of flame
which none could pass or subsist in, no more than in a Furnace.</p>
                     <p>There is another form of expression amongst the Ancients con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Paradise,</hi> which, if decyphered, is of the same force and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
with this we have already instanc'd in; They say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>Paradise</hi> was <hi>beyond the Ocean,</hi> or that the Rivers of <hi>Paradise</hi>
came from beyond the Ocean. This is of the same import with the
former Head, and points still at the other Hemisphere; for, as we
noted before, some of them fixt their <hi>Antichthon</hi> and <hi>Antichth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>nes</hi>
beyond the Ocean; that is, since there was an Ocean, Since the
form of the Earth was chang'd, and the Torrid Zone become habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and cosequently could not be a boundary or separation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the two Worlds. Wherefore, as some run still upon the
old division by the Torrid Zone, others took the new division by
the Ocean. Which Ocean they suppos'd to lie from East to West
betwixt the Tropicks; as may be seen in Ancient Authors, <hi>Gemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
Herodotus, Cicero de republicâ,</hi> and <hi>Clemens Romanus,</hi> whom we
cited before.<note place="margin">De Civ. Dei lib. 16. c. 9.</note> S. <hi>Austin</hi> also speaks upon the same supposition, when
he would confute the doctrine of the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> or <hi>Antichth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>nes;</hi>
and <hi>Macrobius,</hi> I remember, makes it an argument of Providence,
that the Sun and the Planets, in what part of their course soever
they are betwixt the two Tropicks, have still the Ocean under
them, that they may be cool'd and nourisht by its moisture. They
thought the Sea like a Girdle, went round the Earth, and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
Zones on either side were the habitable Regions, whereof this
was call'd the <hi>Oicouméne,</hi> and the other <hi>Antichthon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This being observ'd, 'tis not material, whether their Notion was
true or false, it shews us what their meaning was, and what part
of the Earth they design'd, when they spoke of any thing beyond
the Ocean; namely, that they meant beyond the Line, in the other
Hemisphere, or in the <hi>Antichthon;</hi> and accordingly, when they say
<hi>Paradise,</hi> or the Fountains of its Rivers were beyond the Ocean,
they say the same thing in other terms with the rest of those Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
we have cited. In <hi>Moses Bar Cepha</hi> above mention'd, we
find a Chapter upon this subject, <hi>Qucmodo trajecerint Mortales inde
ex Paradisi terrâ in hanc Terram? How Mankind past out of that Earth
or Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>tinent where</hi> Paradise <hi>was, into that where we are?</hi> Namely,
how they past the Ocean, <hi>that lay betwixt them,</hi> as the answer there
given explains it. And so <hi>Ephrem Syrus</hi> is cited often in that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
placing <hi>Paradise</hi> beyond the Ocean. The <hi>Essenes</hi> also, who
were the most Philosophick Sect of the <hi>Iews,</hi> plac'd <hi>Paradise,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Iosephus,</hi> beyond the Ocean, under a perfect tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Air. And that passage in <hi>Eusebius,</hi> in the Oration of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi>
being corrected and restor'd to the true reading, represents
<hi>Paradise,</hi> in like manner, as in another Continent, from whence
<hi>Adam</hi> was brought, after his transgression, into this. And lastly,
there are some Authors, whose testimony and authority may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
to be consider'd, not for their own Antiquity, but because
they are profess'dly transcribers of Antiquity and Traditions, such
as <hi>Strabus, Comestor,</hi> and the like, who are known to give this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
or report of <hi>Paradise</hi> from the Ancients, that it was <hi>interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sito
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:41970:102"/>
Oceano ab Orbe nostro vel à Zonâ nostrâ habitabili secretus, Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from our Orb or Hemisphere by the interposition of the Ocean.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is also observable, that many of the Ancients that took <hi>Tigris,
Euphrates, Nile</hi> and <hi>Ganges</hi> for the Rivers of <hi>Paradise,</hi> said that
those Heads or Fountains of them which we have in our Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
are but their <hi>Capita secunda,</hi> their second Sources, and that
their first Sources were in another Orb where <hi>Paradise</hi> was; and
thus <hi>Hugo de Sancto Victore</hi> says, <hi>Sanctos communiter sensisse,</hi> That
the Holy Men of old were generally of that opinion. To this sence
also <hi>Moses Bar Cepha</hi> often expresseth himself; as also <hi>Epiphanius,
Procopius Gazaeus,</hi> and <hi>Severianus in Catenâ.</hi> Which notion amongst
the Ancients, concerning the trajection or passage of the Paradisia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Rivers under-ground, or under-Sea, from one Continent into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
is to me, I confess, unintelligible, either in the first or second
Earth; but however it discovers their sence and opinion of the
Seat of <hi>Paradise,</hi> that it was not to be sought for in <hi>Asia</hi> or in <hi>Africk,</hi>
where those Rivers rise to us, but in some remoter parts of the
World, where they suppos'd their first Sources to be.</p>
                     <p>This is a short account of what the Christian Fathers have left
us, concerning the Seat of <hi>Paradise;</hi> and the truth is, 'tis but a
short and broken account; yet 'tis no wonder it should be so, if
we consider, as we noted before, that several of them did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<hi>Paradise</hi> to be Local and Corporeal; Others that did believe it
so, yet did not offer to determine the place of it, but left that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
wholly untoucht and undecided; and the rest that did speak to
that point, did it commonly both in general terms, and in expressions
that were disguis'd, and needed interpretation; but all these diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
and obscurities of expression, you see, when duly stated and
expounded, may signifie one and the same thing, and terminate all
in this common Conclusion, <hi>That Paradise</hi> was without our Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,

And I do not doubt but the Tradition would have been both more
express and more universal, if the Ancients had understood Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy
better; for those of the Ancients that did not admit or
believe, that there were <hi>Antipodes</hi> or <hi>Antichthones,</hi> as <hi>Lactantius,</hi>

on the one hand by his false <hi>Idea</hi> of the Earth, that he could not
joyn with Antiquity as to the place of <hi>Paradise;</hi> so on the other
hand he had that respect for it, that he would not say any thing to the
contrary; therefore being to give his opinion, he says only, <hi>Terrestrem

That it is somewhere upon the Earth, but the place of it very remote from
the knowledge of Men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as their ignorance of the Globe of the Earth was one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
why, the doctrine of <hi>Paradise</hi> was so broken and obscure, so
another reason why it is much more so at present is, because the
chief ancient Books writ upon that subiect, are lost; <hi>Ephrem Syrus,</hi>
who liv'd in the Fourth Century, writ a Commentary <hi>in Genesin
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:41970:103"/>
five de Ortu rerum,</hi> concerning the Origin of the Earth; and by
those remains that are cited from it, we have reason to believe, that
it contain'd many things remarkable concerning the first Earth, and
concerning <hi>Paradise. Tertullian</hi> also writ a Book <hi>de Paradiso,</hi> which
is wholly lost; and we see to what effect it would have been, by his
making the Torrid Zone to be the <hi>Flaming Sword,</hi> and the partition
betwixt this Earth and <hi>Paradise;</hi> which two Earths he more than
once distinguisheth as very different from one another.<note place="margin">Cont. Marc. lib. 2. c. 2. c. 5.</note> The most
ancient Author that I know upon this subject, at least of those that
writ of it literally, is <hi>Moses Bar Cepha,</hi> a <hi>Syrian</hi> Bishop, who liv'd
about seven hundred years since, and his Book is translated into <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi>
by that Learned and Judicious Man, <hi>Andreas Masius. Bar Cepha</hi>
writes upon the same Views of <hi>Paradise</hi> that we have here presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that it was beyond the Ocean, in another tract of Land, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Continent from that which we inhabit: As appears from the
very Titles of his Eighth, Tenth, and Fourteenth Chapters. But
we must allow him for his mistaken Notions about the form of the
Earth; for he seems to have sansied the Earth plain, (not only as
oppos'd to rough and Mountainous, for so it was plain; but as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to Spherical) and the Ocean to have divided it in two parts,
an Interiour, and an Exteriour, and in that Exteriour part was <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise.</hi>
Such allowances must often be made for Geographical mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes,
in examining and understanding the writings of the Ancients.
The rest of the <hi>Syrian</hi> Fathers, as well as <hi>Ephrem</hi> and <hi>Bar Cepha,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
to the same doctrine of <hi>Paradise,</hi> and seem to have retain'd more
of the ancient notions concerning it, than the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
have; and yet there is in all some fragments of this doctrine,
and but fragments in the best.</p>
                     <p>We might add in the last place, that as the most ancient Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
concerning <hi>Paradise</hi> are lost, so also the ancient <hi>Glosses</hi> and <hi>Catenae</hi>
upon Scripture, where we might have found the Traditions and
Opinions of the Ancients upon this subject, are many of them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lost or unpublisht; And upon this consideration we did not
think it improper to cite some Authors of small Antiquity, but such
as have transcrib'd several things out of ancient Manuscript-glosses into
their Commentaries. They living however before Printing was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
or Learning well restor'd, and before the Reformation. I
add that also <hi>before the Reformation,</hi> for since that time the Protestant
Authors having lessen'd the Authority of Traditions, the Pontificial
Doctors content themselves to insist only upon such as they thought
were useful or necessary, lest by multiplying others that were but
matter of curiosity, they should bring the first into question, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the whole doctrine of Traditions more dubious and exceptionable;
And upon this account, there are some Authors that writ an Age or
two before the Reformation, that have with more freedom told us
the Tenets and Traditions of the Ancients in these Speculations, that
are but collateral to Religion, than any have done since. And I
must confess, I am apt to think that what remains concerning the
doctrine of <hi>Paradise,</hi> and the Primaeval Earth, is in a good measure
Traditional; for one may observe, that those that treat upon these
subjects, quote the true Opinions, and tell you some of the Ancients
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:41970:103"/>
held so and so, as That <hi>Paradise</hi> was in another Earth, or higher
than this Earth, That there were no Mountains before the Flood,
nor any Rain, and such like: yet they do not name those ancient
Authors that held these Opinions; which makes me apt to believe,
either that they were convey'd by a Traditional communication
from one to another, or that there were other Books extant upon
those subjects, or other Glosses, than what are now known.</p>
                     <p>Finally, To conclude this Discourse concerning the Seat of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,</hi>
we must mind you again upon what Basis it stands. We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
freely, that we could not by our Theory alone determine
the particular place of it, only by that we are assur'd that it was in
the Primaeval Earth, and not in the present; but in what Region,
or in whether Hemisphere of that Earth it was seated, we cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
from Speculation only. 'Tis true, if we hold fast to that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-conclusion,
That all Mankind rise from one Head, and from
one and the same Stock and Lineage, (which doth not seem to be
according to the sentiments of the Heathens) we must suppose they
were born in one Hemisphere, and after some time translated into
the other, or a Colony of them: But this still doth not determine,
in whether of the two they begun, and were first seated before their
translation; and I am apt to think that depended rather, as we
noted before, upon the Divine Pleasure, and the train of affairs that
was to succeed, than upon Natural causes and differences. Some
of the Ancients, I know, made both the Soil and the Stars more
noble in the Southern Hemisphere, than in ours, but I do not see
any proof or warrant for it; wherefore laying aside all natural To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks,
we are willing, in this particular, to refer our selves wholly
to the report and majority of Votes amongst the Ancients; who yet
do not seem to me to lay much stress upon the notion of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
and Topical Paradise, and therefore use general and remote
expressions concerning it. And finding no place for it in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
they are willing to quit their hands of it, by placing it in
a Region some-where far off, and inaccessible. This, together with
the old Tradition, that Paradise was in another Earth, seems to me
to give an account of most of their Opinions concerning the Seat
of Paradise: and that they were generally very uncertain where to
fix it.</p>

Torrid Zone; The change of the Poles of the World;
The doctrine of the Mundane Egg; How America was
first peopled; How Paradise within the Circle of the
Moon.</head>
                     <p>WE have now dispatch'd the Theory of the Primaeval Earth,
and reviv'd a forgotten World. 'Tis pity the first and fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
works of Nature should be lost out of the memory of Man,
and that we should so much dote upon the Ruines, as never to
think upon the Original Structure. As the modern Artists from
some broken pieces of an ancient Statue, make out all the other
parts and proportions; so from the broken and scatter'd limbs of
the first World we have shown you how to raise the whole Fabrick
again; and renew the prospect of those pleasant Scenes that first
see the light, and first entertain'd Man, when he came to act upon
this new-erected Stage.</p>
                     <p>We have drawn this Theory chiefly to give an account of the
Universal Deluge, and of <hi>Paradise;</hi> but as when one lights a Candle
to look for one or two things which they want, the light will not
confine it self to those two objects, but shows all the other in
the room; so, methinks, we have unexpectedly cast a light upon all
Antiquity, in seeking after these two things, or in retrieving the
Notion and Doctrine of the Primaeval Earth, upon which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended.
For in ancient Learning there are many Discourses, and
many Conclusions deliver'd to us, that are so obscure and confus'd,
and so remote from the present state of things, that one cannot well
distinguish, whether they are fictions or realities: and there is no
way to distinguish with certainty, but by a clear Theory upon
the same subjects; which showing us the truth directly, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently
upon them, shows us also by reflection, how far they are
true or false, and in what sence they are to be interpreted and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.
And the present Theory being of great extent, we shall
find it serviceable in many things, for the illustration of such du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious
and obscure doctrines in Antiquity.</p>
                     <p>To begin with their Ancient CHAOS, what a dark story have they
made of it, both their Philosophers and Poets; and how fabulous
in appearance? 'Tis deliver'd as confus'dly as the Mass it self could
be, and hath not been reduc'd to order, nor indeed made intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
by any. They tell us of <hi>moral</hi> principles in the Chaos instead
of <hi>natural,</hi> of <hi>strife,</hi> and <hi>discord,</hi> and <hi>division</hi> on the one hand, and
<hi>Love, Friendship,</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> on the other; and, after a long contest,
Love got the better of Discord, and united the disagreeing principles:
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:41970:104"/>
This is one part of their story. Then they make the forming of the
World out of the Chaos a kind of <hi>Genealogie</hi> or Pedigree; <hi>Chaos</hi>
was the common Parent of all, and from Chaos sprung, first, <hi>Night,</hi>
and <hi>Tartarus,</hi> or <hi>Oceanus;</hi> Night was a teeming Mother, and of
her were born <hi>Aether</hi> and the <hi>Earth;</hi> The Earth conceiv'd by the
influences of Aether, and brought forth Man and all Animals.</p>
                     <p>This seems to be a Poetical fiction rather than Philosophy; yet
when 'tis set in a true light, and compar'd with our Theory of the
Chaos, 'twill appear a pretty regular account, how the World was
form'd at first, or how the Chaos divided it self successively into
several Regions, rising one after another, and propagated one from
another, as Children and Posterity from a common Parent. We
show'd in the first Book, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. how the Chaos, from an uniform
mass, wrought it self into several Regions or Elements; the grossest
part sinking to the Center, upon this lay the mass of Water, and
over the Water was a Region of dark, impure, caliginous Air;
This impure, caliginous Air is that which the Ancients call <hi>Night,</hi>
and the mass of Water <hi>Oceanus</hi> or <hi>Tartarus,</hi> for those two terms
with them are often of the like force, <hi>Tartarus</hi> being <hi>Oceanus</hi> inclos'd
and lock'd up: Thus we have the first off-spring of the Chaos, or
its first-born twins, <hi>Nox</hi> and <hi>Oceanus.</hi> Now this turbid Air puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
it self by degrees, as the more subtle parts flew upwards, and
compos'd the Aether; so the earthy parts that were mixt with it
dropt down upon the surface of the Water, or the liquid mass;
and that mass on the other hand sending up its lighter and more
oily parts towards its surface, these two incorporate there, and by
their mixture and union compose a body of Earth quite round the
mass of Waters: And this was the first habitable Earth, which as
it was, you see, the Daughter of <hi>Nox</hi> and <hi>Oceanus,</hi> so it was the
Mother of all other things, and all living Creatures, which at the
beginning of the World sprung out of its fruitful womb.</p>
                     <p>This doctrine of the Chaos, for the greater pomp of the business,
the Ancients call'd their <hi>Theogonia,</hi> or the Genealogy of the Gods;
for they gave their Gods, at least their Terrestrial Gods, an origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and beginning; and all the Elements and greater portions of
Nature they made Gods and Goddesses, or their Deities presided
over them in such a manner, that the names were us'd promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
for one another. We also mention'd before some moral prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
which they plac'd in the Chaos, <hi>Eris</hi> and <hi>Eros;</hi> Strife, discord,
and disaffection which prevail'd at first, and afterward <hi>Love,</hi> kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and union got the upper hand, and in spite of those factious
and dividing principles gather'd together the separated Elements,
and united them into an habitable World. This is all easily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
if we do but look upon the Schemes of the rising World, as
we have set them down in that fifth Chapter; for in the first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
of the Chaos, after an intestine struggle of all the parts, the
Elements separated from one another into so many distinct bodies
or masses; and in this state and posture things continued a good
while, which the Ancients, after their Poetick or Moral way, call'd
the Reign of <hi>Eris</hi> or Contention, of hatred, flight and disaffection;
and if things had always continued in that System, we should never
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:41970:105"/>
have had an habitable World. But Love and good Nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
at length, <hi>Venus</hi> rise out of the Sea, and receiv'd into her
bosom, and intangled into her imbraces the falling Aether, <hi>viz.</hi> The
parts of lighter earth, which were mixt with the Air in that first
separation, and gave it the name of <hi>Night;</hi> These, I say, fell down
upon the oily parts of the Sea-mass, which lay floating upon the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of it, and by that union and conjunction, a new Body, and a
new World was produc'd, which was the first habitable Earth.
This is the interpretation of their mystical Philosophy of the Chaos,
and the resolution of it into plain natural History: Which you may
see more fully discuss'd in the <hi>Latin</hi> Treatise.<note place="margin">Lib. 2. c. 7.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>In consequence of this, We have already explain'd, in several
places the <hi>Golden Age</hi> of the Ancients, and laid down such grounds
as will enable us to discern what is real, and what Poetical, in the
reports and characters that Antiquity hath given of those first Ages
of the World. And if there be any thing amongst the Ancients
that refers to another Earth, as <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Atlantis,</hi> which he says, was
absorpt by an Earthquake, and an inundation, as the primaeval
Earth was; or his <hi>Aethereal</hi> Earth mention'd in his <hi>Phaedo,</hi> which
he opposeth to this broken hollow Earth; makes it to have long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liv'd
inhabitants, and to be without Rains and Storms, as that first
Earth was also; or the pendulous <hi>Gardens</hi> of <hi>Alcinous,</hi> or such like,
to which nothing answers in present Nature, by reflecting upon
the state of the first Earth, we find an easie explication of them. We
have also explain'd what the <hi>Antichthon</hi> and <hi>Antichthones</hi> of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
were, and what the true ground of that distinction was. But
nothing seems more remarkable than the <hi>inhabitability of the Torrid
Zone,</hi> if we consider what a general fame and belief it had amongst
the Ancients, and yet in the present form of the Earth we find no
such thing, nor any foundation for it. I cannot believe that this was
so universally receiv'd upon a slight presumption only, because it
lay under the course of the Sun, if the Sun had then the same la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
from the Aequator in his course and motion that he hath now,
and made the same variety of seasons; whereby even the hottest
parts of the Earth have a Winter, or something equivalent to it.
But if we apply this to the Primaeval Earth, whose posture was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
to the Sun, standing always fixt in its Equinoctial, we shall
easily believe that the Torrid Zone was then uninhabitable by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of heat, there being no difference of seasons, nor any change
of weather, the Sun hanging always over head at the same distance,
and in the same direction. Besides this, the descent of the Rivers
in that first Earth was such, that they could never reach the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial
parts, as we have shown before; by which means, and the
want of Rain, that Region must necessarily be turn'd into a dry
Desart. Now this being really the state of the first Earth, the fame
and general belief that the Torrid Zone was uninhabitable had this
true Original, and continued still with posterity after the Deluge,
though the causes then were taken away; for they being ignorant
of the change that was made in Nature at that time, kept up still
the same Tradition and opinion currant, till observation and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
taught later Ages to correct it. As the true miracles that were
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:41970:105"/>
in the Christian Church at first, occasion'd a fame and belief of
their continuance long after they had really ceast.</p>
                     <p>This gives an easie account, and, I think, the true cause, of that
opinion, amongst the Ancients generally receiv'd, <hi>That the Torrid
Zone was uninhabitable.</hi> I say, generally receiv'd, for not only the
Poets, both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> but their Philosophers, Astsonomers
and Geographers, had the same notion, and deliver'd the same do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
as <hi>Aristotle, Cleomedes, Achilles Tatius, Ptolomy, Cicero, Strabo,
Mela, Pliny, Macrobius, &amp;c.</hi> And to speak truth, the whole doctrine
of the Zones is calculated more properly for the first Earth, than
for the present; for the divisions and bounds of them now, are but
arbitrary, being habitable all over, and having no visible distinction;
whereas they were then determin'd by Nature, and the Globe of
the Earth was really divided into so many Regions of a very
different aspect and quality; which would have appear'd at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
if they had been lookt upon from the Clouds, or from the
Moon, as <hi>Iupiter</hi>'s Belts, or as so many Girdles or Swathing-bands
about the body of the Earth: And so the word imports, and so the
Ancients use to call them <hi>Cinguli</hi> and <hi>Fasciae.</hi> But in the present
form of the Earth, if it was seen at a distance, no such distinction
would appear in the parts of it, nor scarce any other but that of
Land and Water, and of Mountains and Valleys, which are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the purpose of Zones. And to add this note further, When
the Earth lay in this regular form, divided into Regions or Walks,
if I may so call them, as this gave occasion of its distinction, by
Zones, so if we might consider all that Earth as a <hi>Paradise,</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise</hi>
as a Garden; (for it is always call'd so in Scripture, and in
<hi>Iewish</hi> Authors) And as this Torrid Zone, bare of Grass and Trees,
made a kind of Gravel-walk in the middle: so there was a green
Walk on either hand of it, made by the temperate Zones; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
those lay a Canal,<note place="margin">See Fig. 3. c. 5.</note> which water'd the Garden from either side.</p>
                     <p>But to return to Antiquity; We may add under this Head ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
observation or doctrine amongst the Ancients, strange enough
in appearance, which yet receives an easie explication from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
Theory; They say, <hi>The Poles</hi> of the World did once change
their situation, and were at first in another posture from what they
are in now, till that inclination happen'd; This the ancient Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
often make mention of,<note place="margin">See the Lat. Treat. lib. 2. c. 10.</note> as <hi>Anaxagoras, Empedocles, Dioge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
Leucippus, Democritus;</hi> as may be seen in <hi>Laertius,</hi> and in <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch;</hi>
and the Stars, they say, at first were carried about the Earth
in a more uniform manner. This is no more than what we have
observ'd and told you in other words, namely, That the Earth
chang'd its posture at the Deluge, and thereby made these seeming
changes in the Heavens; its Poles before pointed to the Poles of the
Ecliptick, which now point to the Poles of the Aequator, and its
Axis is become parallel with that Axis; and this is the mystery and
interpretation of what they say in other terms; this makes the
different aspect of the Heavens, and of its Poles: And I am apt to
think, that those changes in the course of the Stars, which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
sometimes speak of, and especially the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> if they did
not proceed from defects in their Calendar, had no other Physical
account than this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="184" facs="tcp:41970:106"/>
And as they say the Poles of the World were in another situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at first, so at first they say, there was no variety of seasons in
the Year, as in their Golden Age. Which is very coherent with
all the rest, and still runs along with the Theory. And you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that all these things we have instanc'd in hitherto, are but
links of the same chain, in connexion and dependance upon one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
When the Primaeval Earth was made out of the Chaos, its
form and posture was such, as, of course, brought on all those
Scenes which Antiquity hath kept the remembrance of: though now
in another state of Nature they seem very strange; especially being
disguis'd, as some of them are, by their odd manner of represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them. <hi>That</hi> the Poles of the World stood once in another
posture; That the Year had no diversity of Seasons; That the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Zone was uninhabitable; That the two Hemispheres had no
possibility of intercourse, and such like; These all hang upon the
same string; or lean one upon another as Stones in the same Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
whereof we have, by this Theory, laid the very foundation
bare, that you may see what they all stand upon, and in what
order.</p>
                     <p>There is still one remarkable Notion or Doctrine amongst the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
which we have not spoken to; 'tis partly Symbolical, and the
propriety of the Symbol, or of the Application of it, hath been
little understood; 'Tis their doctrine of the <hi>Mundane Egg,</hi> or their
comparing the World to an Egg, and especially in the Original
composition of it. This seems to be a mean comparison, the World
and an Egg, what proportion, or what resemblance betwixt these
two things? And yet I do not know any Symbolical doctrine, or
conclusion, that hath been so universally entertain'd by the <hi>Mystae,</hi>
or Wise and Learned, of all Nations; as hath been noted before
in the fifth Chapter of the First Book,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. c. 10.</note> and at large in the <hi>Latin</hi>
Treatise. 'Tis certain, that by the World in this similitude, they
do not mean the Great Universe, for that hath neither Figure, nor
any determinate form of composition, and it would be a great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and rashness in any one to compare this to an Egg; The works
of God are immense, as his rature is infinite, and we cannot make
any image or resemblance of either of them; but this comparison
is to be understood of the <hi>Sublunary World,</hi> or of the <hi>Earth;</hi> And
for a general key to Antiquity upon this Argument, we may lay
this down as a Maxim or Canon, <hi>That what the Ancients have said
concerning the form and figure of the World, or concerning the Original of it
from a Chaos, or about its periods and dissolution are never to be understood
of the Great Universe, but of our Earth, or of this Sublunary and Terr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>strial
World.</hi> And this observation being made, do but reflect upon our Theory
of the Earth, the manner of its composition at first, and the figure
of it, being compleated, and you will need no other interpreter to
understand this mystery. We have show'd there, that the figure
of it,<note place="margin">Book. 1. c. 5.</note> when finisht, was Oval, and the inward form of it was a
frame of four Regions encompassing one another, where that of
Fire lay in the middle like the Yolk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a shell of Earth inclos'd
them all. This gives a solution so easie and natural, and shows such
an aptness and elegancy in the representation, that one cannot doubt,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:41970:106"/>
upon a view and compare of circumstances, but that we have truly
found out the Riddle of the Mundane Egg.</p>
                     <p>Amongst other difficulties arising from the Form of this present
Earth, That is one, How <hi>America</hi> could be peopled: or any other
Continent, or Island remote from all Continents the Sea interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.
This difficulty does not hold in our Theory of the First Earth,
where there was no Sea. And after the Flood, when the Earth
was broken and the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>a laid open, the same race of Men might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
there, if setled there before. For I do not see any necessity
of deducing all Mankind from <hi>Noah</hi> after the Flood: If <hi>America</hi>
was peopled before, it might continue so; not but that the Flood
was universal. But when the great frame of the Earth broke at the
Deluge, Providence fore-saw into how many Continents it would
be divided after the ceasing of the Flood, and accordingly, as we may
reasonably suppose, made provision to save a remnant in every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
that the race of Mankind might not be quite extinct in any
of them. What provision he made in our Continent we know from
Sacred History, but as that takes notice of no other Continent but
ours, so neither could it take notice of any method that was us'd
there for saving of a remnant of Men; but 'twere great presumption,
methinks, to imagine that Providence had a care of none but us,
or could not find out ways of preservation in other places, as well
as in that where our habitations were to be. <hi>Asia, Africk</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
were repeopled by the Sons of <hi>Noah, Shem, Ham,</hi> and <hi>Iaphet,</hi>
but we read nothing of their going over into <hi>America,</hi> or sending
any Colonies thither; and that World which is near as big as ours,
must have stood long without people, or any thing of Humane race
in it, after the Flood, if it stood so till this was full, or till men
Navigated the Ocean, and by chance discover'd it: it seems more
reasonable to suppose, that there was a stock providentially reserv'd
there, as well as here, out of which they sprung again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but we do
not pretend in an Argument of this nature to define or determine
any thing positively. To conclude, As this is but a secondary diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
and of no great force, so neither is it any thing peculiar to
us, or to our <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> but alike common to both; and if they can
propose any reasonable way, whereby the Sons of <hi>Noah</hi> might be
transplanted into <hi>America,</hi> with all my heart; but all the ways that
I have met with hitherto, have seem'd to me meer fictions, or meer
presumptions. Besides, finding Birds and Beasts there, which are
no where upon our Continent, nor would live in our Countries if
brought hither, 'tis a fair conjecture that they were not carried from
us, but originally bred and preserv'd there.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for the illustration of Antiquity in some points of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
literature, by our Theory of the Primaeval Earth; There is
also in <hi>Christian Antiquity</hi> a Tradition or Doctrine, that appears as
obscure and as much a Paradox as any of these, and better deserves
an illustration, because it relates more closely and expresly to our
present subject: 'Tis that Notion or Opinion amongst the Ancients
concerning <hi>Paradise,</hi> that it was seated as high as the Sphere of the
Moon, or <hi>within the Lunar Circle.</hi> This looks very strange, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
extravagantly, at first sight, but the wonder will cease, if we
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:41970:107"/>
understand this not of <hi>Paradise</hi> taken apart from the rest of the Earth,
but of the whole Primaeval Earth, wherein the Seat of <hi>Paradise</hi> was;
That was really seated much higher than the present Earth, and
may be reasonably suppos'd to have been as much elevated as the
tops of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Mountains are now. And that phrase of reaching to
<hi>the Sphere of the Moon,</hi> signifies no more than those other expressions
of <hi>reaching to Heaven,</hi> or <hi>reaching above the Clouds,</hi> which are phrases
commonly us'd to express the height of Buildings, or of Mountains,
and such like things: So the Builders of <hi>Babel</hi> said, they would make
a Tower should reach to Heaven; <hi>Olympus</hi> and <hi>Parnassus</hi> are said
by the Poets to reach to Heaven, or to rise above the Clouds; And
<hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Solinus</hi> use this very expression of the <hi>Lunar Circle,</hi> when
they describe the height of Mount <hi>Atlas, Eductus in viciniam Luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris
Circuli.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Solin. c. 17.</note> The Ancients, I believe, aim'd particularly by this phrase,
to express an height above the middle Region, or above our Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphere,
that <hi>Paradise</hi> might be serene; and where our Atmosphere
ended, they reckon'd the Sphere of the Moon begun, and therefore
said it reacht to the Sphere of the Moon. Many of the Christian Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
exprest their opinion concerning the high situation of <hi>Paradise</hi>
in plain and formal terms, as S. <hi>Basil, Damascen, Moses Bar Cepha, &amp;c.</hi>
but this phrase of reaching to the <hi>Lunar Circle</hi> is repeated by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of them, and said to be of great Antiquity. <hi>Aquinas, Albertus,</hi>
and others, ascribe it to <hi>Bede,</hi> but many to S. <hi>Austin;</hi> and therefore
<hi>Ambrosius Catharinus</hi> is angry with their great Schoolman,<note place="margin">Com. in Gen. c. 2.</note> that he
should derive it from <hi>Bede,</hi> seeing S. <hi>Austin</hi> writing to <hi>Orosius,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
this doctrine, which surely, says he, S. <hi>Austin neither feign'd
nor dream'd only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but had receiv'd it from Antiquity:</hi> And from so
great Antiquity, that it was no less than Apostolical, if we credit
<hi>Albertus Magnus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Sum. Theol. par. 2. tract. 13. q. 79</note> and the ancient Books he appeals to; for He says
this Tradition was deriv'd as high as from S. <hi>Thomas</hi> the Apostle. His
words are these, after he had deliver'd his own opinion, <hi>Hoc tamen
di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>o, &amp;c. But this I say, without prejudice to the better opinion, for I
have found it in some most ancient Books, that</hi> Thomas <hi>the Apostle was
the Author of that opinion, which is usually attributed to</hi> Bede <hi>and</hi> Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,
<hi>namely, That</hi> Paradise <hi>was so high as to reach to the Lunar Circle.</hi> But
this much concerning this Opinion, and concerning Antiquity.</p>
                     <p>To conclude all, we see this Theory, which was drawn only by
a thred of Reason, and the Laws of Nature, abstractly from all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
notwithstanding casts a light upon many passages there,
which were otherwise accounted fictions, or unintelligible truths;
and though we do not alledge these as proofs of the Theory, for it
carries its own light and proof with it, yet whether we will or no,
they do mutually confirm, as well as illustrate, one another; And
'tis a pleasure also, when one hath wrought out truth by meer dint of
thinking, and examination of causes, and propos'd it plainly and
openly, to meet with it again amongst the Ancients, disguis'd, and
in an old fashion'd dress: scarce to be known or discover'd, but by
those that before-hand knew it very well. And it would be a further
pleasure and satisfaction, to have render'd those Doctrines and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
for the future, intelligible and useful to others, as well as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
to our selves.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. IX. A general objection against this Theory, viz. That if there
had been such a Primitive Earth, as we pretend, the
fame of it would have sounded throughout all Antiquity.
The Eastern and Western Learning consider'd. The most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable

Sacred Writings bear witness to it. The Providential
conduct of Knowledge in the World. A recapitulation and
state of the Theory.</head>
                     <p>HAving gone through the two First Parts, and the two First
Books of this Theory, that concern the Primitive World, the
Universal Deluge, and the state of <hi>Paradise,</hi> We have leisure now
to reflect a little, and consider what may probably be objected
against a Theory of this nature. I do not mean single objections
against single parts, for those may be many, and such as I cannot
fore-see; but what may be said against the body and substance of
the Theory, and the credibility of it, appearing new and surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
and yet of great extent and importance. This, I fancy, will
induce many to say, surely this cannot be a reality; for if there
had been such a Primitive Earth, and such a Primitive World as is
here represented, and so remarkably different from the present, it
could not have been so utterly forgotten, or lain hid for so many
Ages; all Antiquity would have rung of it; the memory of it would
have been kept fresh by Books or Traditions. Can we imagine, that
it should lie buried for some thousands of years in deep silence and
oblivion? and now only when the second World is drawing to an
end, we begin to discover that there was a first, and that of another
make and order from this.</p>
                     <p>To satisfie this obiection, or surmise rather, it will be convenient
to take a good large scope and compass in our Discourse; We must
not suppose, that this Primitive World hath been wholly lost out
of the memory of Man, or out of History, for we have some Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Chronology of it preserv'd by <hi>Moses,</hi> and likewise in the
Monuments of the Ancients, more or less; for they all suppos'd a
World before the Deluge. But 'tis the Philosophy of this Primitive
World that hath been lost in a great measure; what the state of
Nature was then, and wherein it differ'd from the present or Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diluvian
order of things. This, I confess, hath been little taken
notice of; it hath been generally thought or presum'd, that the
World before the Flood was of the same form and constitution
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:41970:108"/>
with the present World: This we do not deny, but rather think it
design'd and Providential, that there should not remain a clear and
full knowledge of that first state of things; and we may easily sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
how it might decay and perish, if we consider how little of the
remote Antiquities of the World have ever been brought down to
our knowledge.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> divided the Ages of the World into three
periods or intervals, whereof they call'd the first the <hi>Obscure</hi> Period,
the second the <hi>Fabulous,</hi> and the third <hi>Historical.</hi> The dark and
obscure Period was from the beginning of the World to the Deluge;
what pass'd then, either in Nature or amongst Men, they have no
Records, no account, by their own confession; all that space of time
was cover'd with darkness and oblivion; so that we ought rather
to wonder at those remains they have, and those broken notions of
the Golden Age, and the conditions of it, how they were sav'd out
of the common shipwrack, than to expect from them the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
of that World, and all its differences from the present. And as
for the other Nations that pretend to greater Antiquities, to more
ancient History and Chronology, from what is left of their Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
many will allow only this difference, that their fabulous
Age begun more high, or that they had more ancient Fables.</p>
                     <p>But besides that our expectations cannot be great from the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> we have not the means or opportunity to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
our selves well what Notions they did leave us concerning
the Primitive World; for their Books and Monuments are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
lost, or lie hid unknown to us. The Learning of the World
may be divided into the Eastern Learning and the Western; and
I look upon the Eastern as far more considerable for Philosophical
Antiquities, and Philosophical Conclusions; I say <hi>Conclusions,</hi> for I
do not believe either of them had any considerable Theory, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture
of Principles and Conclusions together: But 'tis certain,
that in the East, from what Source soever it came, Humane or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
they had some extraordinary Doctrines and Notions disperst
amongst them. Now as by the Western Learning we understand
that of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans;</hi> so by the Eastern, that which was
amongst the <hi>Aegyptians, Phoenicians, Chaldaeans, Assyrians, Indians,
Aethiopians,</hi> and <hi>Persians;</hi> and of the Learning of these Nations, how
little have we now left? except some Fragments and Citations in
<hi>Greek</hi> Authors, what do we know of them? The modern <hi>Brac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
and the <hi>Persees</hi> or <hi>Pagan Persians,</hi> have some broken remains
of Traditions relating to the Origin and Changes of the World:
But if we had, not only those Books intire, whereof we have now
the gleanings and reversions only, but all that have perisht besides,
especially in that famous Library at <hi>Alexandria;</hi> if these, I say,
were all restor'd to the World again, we might promise our selves
the satisfaction of seeing more of the Antiquities, and Natural Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of the first World, than we have now left, or can reasonably
expect. That Library we speak of, at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> was a Collection,
besides <hi>Greek</hi> Books, of <hi>Aegyptian, Chaldaean,</hi> and all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Learning; and <hi>Cedrenus</hi> makes it to consist of an hundred thousand
Volumes: But <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith, when the Translation of the Bible by
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:41970:108"/>
the <hi>Septuagint</hi> was to be added to it, <hi>Demetrius Phalerius</hi> (who was
Keeper or Governour of it) told the King then, that he had already
two hundred thousand Volumes, and that he hop'd to make them
five hundred thousand; and he was better than his word, or his
Successors for him, for <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus,</hi> and other Authors,
report them to have increas'd to seven hundred thousand. This Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>brary
was unfortunately burnt in the sacking of <hi>Alexandria</hi> by <hi>Caesar,</hi>
and considering that all these were ancient Books, and generally of
the Eastern Wisdom, 'twas an inestimable and irreparable loss to the
Commonwealth of Learning. In like manner we are told of a vast
Library of Books of all Arts and Sciences, in <hi>China,</hi> burnt by the
command or caprice of one of their Kings. Wherein, the <hi>Chineses,</hi>
according to their vanity, were us'd to say, greater riches were lost,
than will be in the last Conflagration.</p>
                     <p>We are told also of the <hi>Abyssine</hi> or <hi>Aethiopick</hi> Library as something
very extraordinary. 'Twas formerly in great reputation, but is now,
I suppose, embezil'd and lost. But I was extremely surpriz'd by a
Treatise brought to me some few months since, wherein are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
some <hi>Aethiopick</hi> Antiquities relating to the Primaeval Earth
and the Deluge: To both which they give such characters and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
as are in effect the very same with those assign'd them in this
Theory. They say the First Earth was much greater than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
higher and more advanc'd into the Air: That it was smooth
and regular in its surface, without Mountains or Valleys, but hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
within: and was spontaneously fruitful, without plowing or
sowing. This was its first state, but when Mankind became de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
and outragious with Pride and Violence, The angry Gods,
as they say, by Earthquakes and Concussions broke the habitable
Orb of the Earth, and thereupon the Subterraneous Waters gushing
out, drown'd it in a Deluge, and destroy'd Mankind. Upon this
fraction, it came into another Form, with a Sea, Lakes and Rivers,
as we now have. And those parts of the broken Earth, that stood
above the Waters, became Mountains, Rocks, Islands, and so much
of the Land as we now inhabit. This account is given us by <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardinus

This story indeed, deserves to be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
after, for we do not any where, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Ancients, meet with such a
full and explicit narration of the state
of the First and Second Earth. That
which comes nearest to it are those ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
we find in <hi>Plato,</hi> from the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
                        <pb n="190" facs="tcp:41970:109"/>
Antiquities, in his <hi>Timaeus, Politicus,</hi>
and <hi>Phoedo,</hi> of another Earth and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
state of Nature and Mankind. But
none of them are so full and distinct as
this <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Doctrine.</p>
                     <p>As for the Western Learning, we may remember what the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi>
Priest says to <hi>Solon</hi> in <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Timaeus, You Greeks are always
Children,</hi> and know nothing of Antiquity; And if the <hi>Greeks</hi> were
so, much more the <hi>Romans,</hi> who came after them in time, and for
so great a People, and so much civiliz'd, never any had less Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,
and less of the Sciences amongst them than the <hi>Romans</hi> had;
They studied only the Art of Speaking, of Governing, and of Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
and left the rest to the <hi>Greeks</hi> and Eastern Nations, as unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.
Yet we have reason to believe, that the best Philosophical
Antiquities that the <hi>Romans</hi> had,<note place="margin">De Civ. Dei lib. 6. Dion. Halic. Ant. Rom. lib. 4.</note> perisht with the Books of <hi>Varro,</hi>
of <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> and of the ancient <hi>Sibyls. Varro</hi> writ, as S. <hi>Austin</hi>
tells us a multitude of Volumes, and of various sorts, and I had
rather retrieve his works, than the works of any other <hi>Roman</hi> Author;
not his Etymologies and Criticisms, where we see nothing admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
but his <hi>Theologia Physica,</hi> and his <hi>Antiquitates;</hi> which in all
probability would have given us more light into remote times,
and the Natural History of the past World, than all the <hi>Latin</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
besides have done. He has left the foremention'd distinction
of three Periods of time; He had the doctrine of the <hi>Mundane
Egg,</hi> as we see in <hi>Probus Grammaticus;</hi> and he gave us that observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Star <hi>Venus,</hi> concerning the great change she suffer'd about
the time of our Deluge.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> was doubtless a contemplative Man, and 'tis
thought that he understood the true System of the World, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
the Sun by his <hi>Vestal Fire;</hi> though, methinks, <hi>Vesta</hi> does
not so properly refer to the Sun, as to the Earth, which hath a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
fire too, that is not to be extinguisht. He order'd his Books
to be buried with him, which were found in a Stone Chest by him,
four hundred years after his death; They were in all Twenty-four,
whereof Twelve contain'd Sacred Rites and Ceremonies, and the
other Twelve the Philosophy and Wisdom of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
gave them to the <hi>Praetor Petilius</hi> to peruse; and to make his
report to the Senate, whether they were fit to be publisht or no:
The <hi>Praetor</hi> made a wise politick report, that the Contents of them
might be of dangerous consequence to the establisht Laws and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
and thereupon they were condemn'd to be burnt, and Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
was depriv'd of that ancient Treasure, whatsoever it was. What
the Nine Books of the <hi>Sibyl</hi> contain'd, that were offer'd to King <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin,</hi>
we little know; She valued them high, and the higher still,
the more they seem'd to slight or neglect them; which is a piece of
very natural indignation or contempt, when one is satisfied of the
worth of what they offer. 'Tis likely they respected, besides the
fate of <hi>Rome,</hi> the fate and several periods of the World, both past
and to come, and the most mystical passages of them. And in these
Authors and Monuments are lost the greatest hopes of Natural and
Philosophick Antiquities, that we could have had from the <hi>Romans.</hi>

And as to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> their best and Sacred Learning was not
originally their own; they enricht themselves with the spoils of the
East, and the remains we have of that Eastern Learning, is what
we pick out of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> whose works, I believe, if they were
intirely extant, we should not need to go any further for witnesses
to confirm all the principal parts of this Theory. With what regret
does one read in <hi>Laertius, Suidas,</hi> and others, the promising titles
of Books writ by the <hi>Greek</hi> Philosophers, hundreds or thousands,
whereof there is not one now extant; and those that are extant are
generally but fragments: Those Authors also that have writ their
Lives, or collected their Opinions, have done it confus'dly and
injudiciously. I should hope for as much light and instruction, as
to the Original of the World, from <hi>Orpheus</hi> alone, if his Works had
been preserv'd, as from all that is extant now of the other <hi>Greek</hi>
Philosophers. We may see from what remains of him, that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
in a good measure, how the Earth rise from a Chaos, what
was its external Figure, and what the form of its inward structure;
The opinion of the <hi>Oval</hi> Figure of the Earth is ascrib'd to <hi>Orpheus</hi>
and his Disciples; and the doctrine of the <hi>Mundane Egg</hi> is so pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
his, that 'tis call'd by <hi>Proclus,</hi> The <hi>Orphick Egg;</hi> not that he
was the first Author of that doctrine, but the first that brought it
into <hi>Greece.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus much concerning the Heathen Learning, Eastern and We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern,
and the small remains of it in things Philosophical; 'tis no
wonder then if the account we have left us from them of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Earth; and the Antiquities of the Natural World be very
imperfect. And yet we have trac'd (in the precedent Chapter, and
more largely in our <hi>Latin</hi> Treatise) the foot-steps of several parts
of this Theory amongst the Writings and Traditions of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients:
and even of those parts that seem the most strange and
singular, and that are the Basis upon which the rest stand. We have
shown there, that their account of the Chaos, though it seem'd to
many but a Poetical Rhapsody, contain'd the true mystery of the
formation of the Primitive Earth.<note place="margin">Tell. Theor. lib. 2. c. 7.</note> We have also shown upon the
same occasion, that both the External Figure and Internal Form of
that Earth was compriz'd and signified in their ancient doctrine of
the Mundane Egg,<note place="margin">Ibid. Cap. 10.</note> which hath been propagated through all the
Learned Nations. And lastly, As to the situation of that Earth,
and the change of its posture since, that the memory of that has
been kept up, we have brought several testimonies and indications
from the <hi>Greek</hi> Philosophers.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> And these were the three great and
fundamental properties of the Primitive Earth, upon which all the
other depend, and all its differences from the present Order of
Nature. You see then, though Providence hath suffer'd the ancient
Heathen Learning and their Monuments, in a great part, to perish,
yet we are not left wholly without witnesses amongst them, in a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
of this great importance.</p>
                     <p>You will say, it may be, though this account, as to the Books
and Learning of the Heathen, may be lookt upon as reasonable, yet
we might expect however, from the <hi>Iewish</hi> and <hi>Christian</hi> Authors,
a more full and satisfactory account of that Primitive Earth, and of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:41970:110"/>
the Old World. First, as to the <hi>Iews,</hi> 'tis well known that they
have no ancient Learning, unless by way of Tradition, amongst
them. There is not a Book extant in their Language, excepting
the Canon of the Old Testament, that hath not been writ since
our Saviour's time. They are very bad Masters of Antiquity,
and they may in some measure be excus'd, because of their several
captivities, dispersions, and desolations. In the <hi>Babylonish</hi> captivity
their Temple was ransack'd, and they did not preserve, as is thought,
so much as the Autograph or original Manuscript of the Law, nor
the Books of those of their Prophets that were then extant, and
kept in the Temple; And at their return from the Captivity after
seventy years, they seem to have had forgot their Native Language
so much, that the Law was to be interpreted to them in <hi>Chaldee,</hi>
after it was read in <hi>Hebrew;</hi> for so I understand that interpretation
in <hi>Neh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>miah.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">c. 8. 7, 8.</note> 'Twas a great Providence, methinks, that they should
any way preserve their Law, and other Books of Scripture, in the
Captivity, for so long a time; for 'tis likely they had not the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of using them in any publick worship, seeing they return'd
so ignorant of their own Language, and, as 'tis thought, of their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet
and Character too. And if their Sacred Books were hardly
preserv'd, we may easily Believe all others perisht in that publick
desolation.</p>
                     <p>Yet there was another destruction of that Nation, and their
Temple, greater than this, by the <hi>Romans;</hi> and if there were any
remains of Learning preserv'd in the former ruine, or any recruits
made since that time, this second desolation would sweep them all
away. And accordingly we see they have nothing left in their
Tongue, besides the Bible, so ancient as the destruction of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>
These, and other publick calamities of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation,
may reasonably be thought to have wasted their Records of ancient
Learning, <hi>if they had any;</hi> for, to speak truth, the <hi>Iews</hi> are a people
of little curiosity, as to Sciences and Philosophical enquiries: They
were very tenacious of their own customs, and careful of those
Traditions that did respect them, but were not remarkable, that
I know of, or thought great Proficients in any other sort of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
There has been a great fame, 'tis true, of the <hi>Iewish Gabala,</hi>
and of great mysteries contain'd in it; and, I believe, there was once
a Traditional doctrine amongst some of them, that had extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Notions and Conclusions: But where is this now to be
found? The <hi>Essenes</hi> were the likeliest Sect, one would think, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
such doctrines, but 'tis probable they are now so mixt with
things fabulous and fantastical, that what one should alledge from
thence would be of little or no authority. One Head in this <hi>Cabala</hi>
was the doctrine of the <hi>Sephiroth,</hi> and though the explication of
them be uncertain,<note place="margin">Vid. Men. ben Isr. de Creat. probl. 28.</note> the Inferiour <hi>Sephiroth</hi> in the Corporeal World
cannot so well be appli'd to any thing, as to those several Orbs
and Regions, infolding one another, whereof the Primigenial Earth
was compos'd. Yet such conjectures and applications, I know, are
of no validity, but in consort with better Arguments. I have often
thought also, that their first and second Temple represented the first
and second Earth or World; and that of <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s, which is the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:41970:110"/>
third, is still to be erected, the most beautiful of all, when this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Temple of the World shall be burnt down. If the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of <hi>Enoch</hi> had been preserv'd, and taken into the Canon by
<hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Sacred Books is suppos'd to have been made, we might probably have
had a considerable account there, both of times past and to come, of
Antiquities and futuritions; for those Prophecies are generally sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and all the periods of it. But as this Book is lost to us, so I look
upon all others that pretend to be Ante-Mosaical or Patriarchal, as
Spurious and Fabulous.</p>
                     <p>Thus much concerning the <hi>Iews.</hi> As for <hi>Christian</hi> Authors, their
knowledge must be from some of these foremention'd, <hi>Iews</hi> or <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens;</hi>
or else by Apostolical Tradition: For the <hi>Christian</hi> Fathers
were not very speculative, so as to raise a Theory from their own
thoughts and contemplations, concerning the Origin of the Earth.
We have instanc'd, in the last Chapter, in a <hi>Christian</hi> Tradition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Paradise,</hi> and the high situation of it, which is fully conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the site of the Primitive Earth, where <hi>Paradise</hi> stood, and
doth seem plainly to refer to it, being unintelligible upon any other
supposition. And 'twas, I believe, this elevation of <hi>Paradise,</hi> and
the pensile structure of that <hi>Paradisiacal</hi> Earth, that gave occasion to
<hi>Celsus,</hi> as we see by <hi>Origen</hi>'s answer, to say, that the <hi>Christian Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise</hi>
was taken from the pensile Gardens of <hi>Alcinous:</hi> But we may
see now what was the ground of such expressions or Traditions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Ancients, which Providence left to keep mens minds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake;
not fully to instruct them, but to confirm them in the truth,
when it should come to be made known in other methods. We
have noted also above, that the ancient Books and Authors amongst
the <hi>Christians,</hi> that were most likely to inform us in this Argument,
have perisht, and are lost out of the World, such as <hi>Ephrem Syrus
de ortu rerum,</hi> and <hi>Tertul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ian de Paradiso;</hi> and that piece which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
of <hi>Moses Bar Cepha</hi>'s upon this subject, receives more light
from our <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> than from any other I know; for, correcting
some mistakes about the Figure of the Earth, which the Ancients
were often guilty of, the obscurity or confusion of that Discourse
in other things, may be easily rectifi'd, if compar'd with this The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory.</p>
                     <p>Of this nature also is that Tradition that is common both to <hi>Iews</hi>
and <hi>Christians,</hi> and which we have often mention'd before, that
there was a perpetual serenity, and perpetual Equinox in <hi>Paradise;</hi>
which cannot be upon this Earth, not so much as under the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial;
for they have a sort of Winter and Summer there, a course
of Rains at certain times of the Year, and great inequalities of the
Air, as to heat and cold, moisture and drought. They had also
Traditions amongst them,<note place="margin">Lat. Treat. Lib. 2. c. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>That there was no Rain from the beginning
of the World till the Deluge,</hi> and that <hi>there were no Mountains till the
Flood,</hi> and such like; These, you see, point directly at such an
Earth, as we have describ'd. And I call these <hi>Traditions,</hi> because
we cannot find the Original Authors of them; The ancient <hi>ordinary
Gloss</hi> (upon <hi>Genesis)</hi> which some make Eight hundred years old,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:41970:111"/>
mentions both these Opinions; so does <hi>Historia Scholastica, Alcuinus,
Rabanus, Maurus, Lyranus,</hi> and such Collectors of Antiquity. <hi>Bede</hi>
also relates that of the <hi>plainness</hi> or smoothness of the <hi>Antediluvian</hi>
Earth. Yet these are reported Traditionally, as it were, naming no
Authors or Books from whence they were taken; Nor can it be
imagin'd that they feign'd them themselves; to what end or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose?
it serv'd no interest; or upon what ground? Seeing they had
no Theory that could lead them to such Notions as these, or that
could be strengthen'd and confirm'd by them. Those opinions also
of the Fathers which we recited in the seventh Chapter, placing
<hi>Paradise</hi> beyond the Torrid Zone, and making it therefore inacces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
suit very well to the form, qualities, and bipartition of the
Primaeval Earth, and seem to be grounded upon them.</p>
                     <p>Thus much may serve for a short Survey of the ancient Learning,
to give us a reasonable account, why the memory and knowledge
of the Primitive Earth should be so much lost out of the World;
and what we retain of it still; which would be far more, I do
not doubt, if all Manuscripts were brought to light, that are yet
extant in publick or private Libraries. The Truth is, one cannot
judge with certainty, neither what things have been recorded and
preserv'd in the monuments of Learning, nor what are still; not
what have been, because so many of those Monuments are lost:
The <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Library, which we spoke of before, seems to have
been the greatest Collection that ever was made before Christianity,
and the <hi>Constantinopolitan</hi> (begun by <hi>Constantine,</hi> and destroy'd in
the Fifth Century, when it was rais'd to the number, as is said, of
one hundred twenty thousand Volumes) the most valuable that was
ever since, and both these have been permitted by Providence to
perish in the merciless Flames. Besides those devastations of Books
and Libraries that have been made in Christendom, by the <hi>Northern</hi>
barbarous Nations overflowing <hi>Europe,</hi> and the <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi>
great parts of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africk.</hi> It is hard therefore to pronounce
what knowledge hath been in the World, or what accounts of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity;
Neither can we well judge what remain, or of what things
the memory may be still latently conserv'd; for besides those Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscripts
that are yet unexamin'd in these parts of Christendom,
there are many, doubtless, of good value in other parts; Besides
those that lie hid in the unchristianiz'd dominions. The Library
of <hi>Fez</hi> is said to contain thirty two thousand Volumes in <hi>Arabick;</hi>
and though the <hi>Arabick</hi> Learning was mostwhat <hi>Western,</hi> and therefore
of less account, yet they did deal in <hi>Eastern</hi> Learning too; for
<hi>Avicenna</hi> writ a Book with that Title, <hi>Philosophia Orientalis.</hi> There
may be also in the <hi>East</hi> thousands of Manuscripts unknown to us,
of greater value than most Books we have: And as to those sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
we are treating of, I should promise my self more light and
confirmation from the <hi>Syriack</hi> Authors than from any others. These
things being consider'd, we can make but a very imperfect estimate,
what evidences are left us, and what accounts of the Primitive
Earth, and if these deductions and defalcations be made, both for
what Books are wholly lost, and for what lie asleep or dead in Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries,
we have reason to be satisfied in a Theory of this nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        </gap>nd so good attestations as we have produc'd for the several parts
of it; which we purpose to enlarge upon considerably at another time
and occasion.</p>
                     <p>But to carry this Objection as far as may be, let us suppose it to
be urg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d still in the last place, that though these Humane Writings
have perisht, or be imperfect, yet in the Divine Writings at least,
we might expect, that the memory of the Old World, and of the
Primitive Earth should have been preserv'd. To this I answer in
short, That we could not expect in the Scriptures any Natural The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory
of that Earth, nor any account of it, but what was general;
and this we have, both by the <hi>Tehom-Rabba</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of the same Abyss in other places of Scripture, as we have
shown at large in the First Book, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. And also by the descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
which S. <hi>Peter</hi> hath given of the Ante-diluvian Heavens and
Earth, and their different constitution from the present: which is
also prov'd by the Rainbow, not seen in the first World. You will
say,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 5, 6, &amp;c.</note> it may be, that that place of S. <hi>Peter</hi> is capable of another inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation;
so are most places of Scripture, if you speak of a bare capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city;
they are capable of more than one interpretation; but that
which is most natural, proper and congruous, and suitable to the
words, suitable to the Argument, and suitable to the Context, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is nothing superfluous or impertinent, That we prefer and accept
of as the most reasonable interpretation. Besides, in such Texts as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to the Natural World, if of two interpretations propos'd, one
agrees better with the Theory of Nature than the other, <hi>caeteris
paribus,</hi> that ought to be prefer'd. And by these two rules we are
willing to be try'd, in the exposition of that remarkable Discourse of
S. <hi>Peter'</hi>s, and to stand to that sence which is found most agreeable
to them.</p>
                     <p>Give me leave to conclude the whole Discourse with this general
Consideration; 'Tis reasonable to suppose, that there is a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the conduct of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> as well as of other affairs on the
Earth; and that it was not design'd that all the mysteries of Nature
and Providence should be plainly and clearly understood throughout
all the Ages of the World; but that there is an Order establisht for
this, as for other things, and certain Periods and Seasons; And what
was made known to the Ancients only by broken Conclusions and
Traditions, will be known (in the latter Ages of the World) in a
more perfect way, by Principles and Theories. The increase of
Knowledge being that which changeth so much the face of the World,
and the state of Humane affairs, I do not doubt but there is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
care and superintendency for the conduct of it; by what steps
and degrees it should come to light, at what Seasons and in what
Ages; what evidence should be left, either in Scripture, Reason, or
Tradition, for the grounds of it; how clear or obscure, how disperst
or united; all these things were weigh'd and consider'd, and such
measures taken as best suit the designs of Providence, and the general
project and method propos'd in the government of the World. And
I make no question but the state both of the Old World, and of that
which is to come, is exhibited to us in Scripture in such a measure
and proportion, as is fit for this fore-mentioned purpose; not as the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:41970:112"/>
Articles of our Faith, or the precepts of a good Life, which he that
runs may read: but to the attentive and reflexive, to those that
are unprejudic'd, and to those that are inquisitive, and have their
minds open and prepar'd for the discernment of mysteries of such a
nature.</p>
                     <p>Thus much in answer to that general Objection which might be
made against this Theory, <hi>That</hi> it is not founded in Antiquity. I
do not doubt but there may be many particular Objections against
Parts and Sections of it, and the exposing it thus in our own
Tongue may excite some or other, it may be, to make them; but
if any be so minded, I desire (if they be Scholars) that it may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be in <hi>Latin,</hi> as being more proper for a subject of this nature;
and also that they would keep themselves close to the substance of
the Theory, and wound that as much as they can; but to make
excursions upon things accidental or collateral, that do not destory
the <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> is but to trouble the World with impertinencies.
Now the substance of the Theory is this, THAT there was a <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Earth</hi> of another form from the present, and inhabited by
Mankind till the Deluge; That it had those properties and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that we have ascrib'd to it, namely, a perpetual Equinox or
Spring, by reason of its <hi>right</hi> situation to the Sun; Was of an Oval
Figure, and the exteriour face of it smooth and uniform, without
Mountains or a Sea. That in this Earth stood <hi>Paradise;</hi> the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
whereof cannot be understood but upon supposition of this
Primitive Earth, and its properties. Then that the disruption and
fall of this Earth into the Abyss, which lay under it, was that which
made the Universal Deluge, and the destruction of the Old World;
And that neither <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood, nor the present form of the Earth
can be explain'd in any other method that is rational, nor by any
other Causes that are intelligible: at least that have been hitherto
propos'd to the World. These are the Vitals of the Theory, and
the primary Assertions, whereof I do freely profess my full belief:
and whosoever by solid reasons will show me in an Errour, and
undeceive me, I shall be very much oblig'd to him. There are
other lesser Conclusions which flow from these, and may be call'd
Secondary, as that the Longaevity of the Ante-diluvians depended
upon their perpetual Equinox, and the perpetual equality and sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the Air; That the Torrid Zone in the Primitive Earth was
uninhabitable; And that all their Rivers flow'd from the extreme
parts of the Earth towards the Equinoctial; there being neither
Rain, nor Rainbow, in the temperate and habitable Regions of it;
And lastly, That the place of <hi>Paradise,</hi> according to the opinion of
Antiquity, (for I determine no place by the Theory) was in the
Southern Hemisphere. These, I think, are all truly deduc'd and
prov'd in their several ways, though they be not such essential parts
of the Theory, as the former. There are also besides, many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Explications that are to be consider'd with more liberty and
latitude, and may be perhaps upon better thoughts, or better observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
corrected, without any prejudice to the General Theory. Those
places of Scripture, which we have cited, I think, are all truly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd;
and I have not mention'd <hi>Moses</hi>'s <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

it deliver'd by him as a Lawgiver, not as a Philosopher; which I
intend to show at large in another Treatise, not thinking that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussion
proper for the Vulgar Tongue. Upon the whole, we are
to remember, that some allowances are to be made for every <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis</hi>
that is new propos'd and untry'd: and that we ought not out
of levity of wit, or any private design, discountenance free and fair
Essays: nor from any other motive, but the only love and concern
of Truth.</p>

                     <p>SEeing the Theory which we have propos'd in this Work is of
that extent and comprehension, that it begins with the first foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation

one continued Series or chain of Nature; It will not be improper,
before we conclude, to make some reflections and remarks what
<hi>Nature</hi> is, and upon what superiour Causes she depends in all her
Motions and Operations: And this will lead us to the discovery of
the <hi>Author</hi> of Nature, and to the true Notion and state of <hi>Natural
Providence,</hi> which seems to have been hitherto very much neglected,
or little understood in the World. And 'tis the more reasonable
and fitting, that we should explain these Notions before we shut

which they think applicable to their purpose, or which
they can maliciously represent, without attending to the scope or just
limitations of what is spoken.</p>
                     <p>By <hi>Nature</hi> in general is understood All the Powers of Finite Beings,
with the Laws establisht for their action and conduct according to the
ordinary course of things. And this extends both to Intellectual
Beings and Corporeal; but seeing 'tis only the Material World that
hath been the subject of our Discourse, Nature, as to that, may be
defin'd, the Powers of <hi>Matter,</hi> with the Laws establisht for their
action and conduct. Seeing also Matter hath no action, whether
from it self, or imprest upon it, but Motion, as to the Corporeal
World Nature is no more than the powers and capacities of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
with the Laws that govern the Motions of it. And this defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is so plain and easie, that, I believe, all parties will agree
in it; There will also be no great controversie what these Laws
are, As that one part of Matter cannot penetrate another, nor be
in several places at once; That the greater Body overcomes the less,
and the swifter the flower; That all motion is in a right line, till
something obstruct it or divert it; which are points little disputed
as to the matter of fact; but the points concerning which the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:41970:113"/>
ariseth, and which are to lead us to the Author of Nature,
are these, <hi>Who</hi> or <hi>what</hi> is the Author of these <hi>Laws?</hi> of this <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)</hi>
and even of <hi>Matter</hi> it self; and of all those modes and forms
of it which we see in Nature?</p>
                     <p>The Question useth chiefly to be put concerning <hi>Motion,</hi> how it
came into the World; what the first Source of it is, or how Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
came at first to be mov'd? For the simple notion of Matter,
not divided into parts, nor diversified, doth not imply Motion, but
Extension only; 'Tis true, from Extension there necessarily follows
<hi>mobility,</hi> or a capacity of being mov'd by an External Power, but
not actual or necessary Motion springing from it self. For dimensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or length, breadth, and depth, which is the <hi>Idea</hi> of Matter, or
of a Body, do no way include local Motion, or translation of parts;
on the contrary, we do more easily and naturally conceive simple Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension
as a thing steddy and fixt, and if we conceive Motion in it,
or in its parts, we must superadd something to our first thought,
and something that does not flow from Extension. As when we
conceive a Figure, a Triangle, Square, or any other, we naturally
conceive it fixt or quiescent, and if afterwards we imagine it in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that is purely accidental to the Figure; in like manner it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental
to Matter, that there should be Motion in it, it hath no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
principle from whence that can flow, and its Nature is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
without it; Wherefore if we find Motion and Action in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which is of it self a dead in-active Mass, this should lead us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to the Author of Nature, or to some External Power di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from Matter, which is the Cause of all Motion in the World.</p>
                     <p>In single Bodies, and single parts of Matter, we readily believe and
conclude, that they do not move, unless something move them, and
why should we not conclude the same thing of the whole mass? If
a Rock or Mountain cannot move it self, nor divide it self, either
into great gobbets, or into small powder, why should it not be as impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for the whole mass of Matter to do so? 'Tis true, Matter is
capable both of motion and rest, yet to conceive it undivided, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diversified
and unmov'd, is certainly a more simple Notion, than to
conceive it divided and mov'd; and this being first in order of Nature,
and an adequate conception too, we ought to enquire and give our
selves an account how it came out of this state, and by what Causes,
or, as we said before, how <hi>Motion came first into the World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the second place, That diversity which we see in Nature, both
as to the qualities of Matter, and the compositions of it, being one
step further than bare Motion, ought also to be a further indication
of the Author of Nature, and to put us upon enquiry into the Causes
of this diversity. There is nothing more uniform than simple Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
nothing more the same throughout, all of a piece, and all of a
sort, similar, and like to it self every where, yet we find the matter
of the Universe diversified a thousand ways, into Heavens and Earth,
Air and Water, Stars, Meteors, Light, Darkness, Stones, Wood,
Animals, and all Terrestrial Bodies; These diversifications are still fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
removes from the natural unity and identity of Matter, and a
further argument of some external and superiour power that hath
given these different forms <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o the several portions of Matter by the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:41970:113"/>
intervention of Motion. For if you exclude the Author of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and suppose nothing but Matter in the World, take whether
<hi>Hypothesis</hi> you will, either that Matter is without Motion of it self,
or that it is of it self in Motion, there could not arise this diversity,
and these compositions in it. If it was without Motion, then the
case is plain, for it would be nothing but an hard inflexible lump
of impenetrable extension, without any diversity at all. And if you
suppose it mov'd of it self, or to have an innate Motion, that would
certainly hinder all sort of natural concretions and compositions,
and in effect destroy all Continuity. For Motion, if it be essential
to Matter, it is essential to every Atome of it, and equally diffus'd
throughout all its parts; and all those parts or Atomes would be
equal to one another, and as little as possible; for if Matter was
divided into parts by its own innate Motion, that would melt it
down into parts as little as possible, and consequently all equal to
one another, there being no reason why you should stop those di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
or the effect of this innate <hi>impetus</hi> in any one part sooner
than in another, or in any part indeed till it was divided as much
as was possible; Wherefore upon this principle, or in this method, all
the Matter of the Universe would be one liquid or volatile mass,
smaller than pin dust, nay, than Air or Aether: And there would
be no diversity of forms, only another sort of identity from the
former, when we suppos'd it wholly without motion. And so,
upon the whole, you see, that Matter, whether we allow it Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or no Motion, could not come into that variety of tempers and
compositions in which we find it in the World, without the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and direction of a Superiour External Cause, which we call
the Author of Nature.</p>
                     <p>But there is still a further and stronger Argument from this Head,
if we consider not only the diversity of Bodies, that the mass of
Matter is cut into, but also that that diversity is <hi>regular,</hi> and in some
parts of it admirably artful and ingenious. This will not only
lead us to an Author of Nature, but to such an Author as hath
Wisdom as well as Power. Matter is a brute Being, stupid and
senseless, and though we should suppose it to have a force to
move it self, yet that it should be able to meditate and consult, and
take its measures how to frame a World, a regular and beautiful
structure, consisting of such and such parts and Regions, and adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to such and such purposes, this would be too extravagant to
imagine; to allow it not only Motion from it self, but Wit and
Judgment too; and that before it came into any Organical or Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
composition.</p>
                     <p>You'll say, it may be, The Frame of the World was not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
of counsel and consultation, but of <hi>necessity;</hi> Matter being once
in Motion under the conduct of those Laws that are essential to it,
it wrought it self by degrees from one state into another, till at
length it came into the present form which we call the World.
These are words thrown out at random, without any pretence of
ground, only to see if they can be confuted; And so they may
easily be, for we have shown already, that if Matter had innate Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it would be so far from running into the orderly and well
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:41970:114"/>
dispos'd frame of the World, that it would run into no frame at
all, into no forms, or compositions, or diversity of Bodies; but
would either be all fluid, or all solid; either every single particle
in a separate Motion, or all in one continued mass with an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
tremor, or inclination to move without actual separation; and
either of these two states is far from the form of a World. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
As to the Laws of Motion, as some of them are essential to
Matter, so others are not demonstrable, but upon supposition of
an Author of Nature. And thirdly, Though all the Laws of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be admitted, they cannot bring Matter into the form of a
World, unless some measures be taken at first by an intelligent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
I say some measures be taken to determine the primary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
upon which the rest depend, and to put them in a way that
leads to the formation of a World. The mass must be divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Regions, and Centers fixt, and Motions appropriated to them;
and it must be consider'd of what magnitude the first Bodies, or
the first divisions of Matter should be, and how mov'd: Besides,
there must be a determinate proportion, and certain degree of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
imprest upon the Universal Matter, to qualifie it for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of a World; if the dose was either too strong or too weak,
the work would miscarry; and nothing but infinite Wisdom could
see thorough the effects of every proportion, or every new degree
of Motion, and discern which was best for the beginning, progress,
and perfection of a World. So you see the Author of Nature is
no way excluded, or made useless by the Laws of Motion; nor if
Matter was promiscuously mov'd would these be sufficient causes of
themselves to produce a World, or that regular diversity of Bodies
that compose it.</p>
                     <p>But 'tis hard to satisfie Men against their inclinations, or their
interest: And as the regularity of the Universe was always a great
stumbling-stone to the <hi>Epicuraeans;</hi> so they have endeavour'd to
make shifts of all sorts to give an account and answer to it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
recourse to an Intelligent Principle; and for their last refuge,
they say, That Chance might bring that to pass, which Nature
and Necessity could not do; The Atoms might hit upon a lucky
sett of Motions, which though it were casual and fortuitous, might
happily lead them to the forming of a World. A lucky hit indeed,
for Chance to frame a World: But this is a meer shuffle and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion;
for if there was nothing in Nature but Matter, there could
be no such thing as <hi>Chance,</hi> all would be pure <hi>Mechanical Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity;</hi>
and so this answer, though it seem very different, is the
same in effect with the former, and <hi>Epicurus</hi> with his Atomists are
oblig'd to give a just mechanical account, how all the parts of
Nature, the most compound and elaborate parts not excepted,
rise from their Atoms by pure necessity: There could be no acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
concourse or coalition of them, every step, every motion,
every composition was fatal and necessary, and therefore 'tis non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
for an <hi>Epicuraean</hi> to talk of Chance, as Chance is oppos'd to
Necessity; and if they oppose it to <hi>Counsel</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> 'tis little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than non-sence, to say the World and all its furniture rise by
Chance, in that notion of it. But it will deserve our patience a
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:41970:114"/>
little to give a more full and distinct answer to this, seeing it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all their pleas and evasions at once.</p>
                     <p>What proof or demonstration of Wisdom and Counsel can be
given, or can be desir'd, that is not found in some part of the
World, Animate or Inanimate? We know but a little portion of
the Universe, a meer point in comparison, and a broken point too,
and yet in this broken point, or some small parcels of it, there is
more of Art, Counsel and Wisdom shown, than in all the works of
Men taken together, or than in all our <hi>Artificial</hi> World. In the
construction of the Body of an Animal, there is more of thought
and contrivance, more of exquisite invention, and fit disposition of
parts, than is in all the Temples, Palaces, Ships, Theaters, or any
other pieces of Architecture the World ever yet see: And not Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture
only, but all other Mechanism whatsoever, Engines,
Clock-work, or any other, is not comparable to the Body of a
living Creature. Seeing then we acknowledge these artificial works,
wheresoever we meet with them, to be the effects of Wit, Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and Reason, is it not manifest partiality, or stupidity rather,
to deny the Works of Nature, which excel these in all degrees, to
proceed from an Intelligent Principle? Let them take any piece of
Humane Art, or any Machine fram'd by the Wit of Man, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
it with the Body of an Animal, either for diversity and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity
of Workmanship, or curiosity in the minute parts, or just
connexion and dependance of one thing upon another, or fit sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serviency
to the ends propos'd, of life, motion, use and ornament to
the Creature, and if in all these respects they find it superiour to any
work of Humane production, (as they certainly must do,) why
should it be thought to proceed from inferiour and senceless Causes;
ought we not in this, as well as in other things, to proportion the
Causes to the Effect? and to speak truth, and bring in an honest
Verdict for Nature as well as Art?</p>
                     <p>In the composition of a perfect Animal, there are four several
frames or compages joyn'd together, The Natural, Vital, Animal,
and Genital; Let them examine any one of these apart, and try if
they can find any thing defective or superfluous, or any way
inept, for matter or form. Let them view the whole Compages
of the Bones, and especially the admirable construction, texture,
and disposition of the Muscles, which are joyn'd with them for
moving the Body, or its parts. Let them take an account of the
little Pipes and Conduits for the Juices and the Liquors, of their
form and distribution; Or let them take any single Organ to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
as the Eye, or the Ear, the Hand or the Heart; In each of
these they may discover such arguments of Wisdom, and of Art, as
will either convince them, or confound them; though still they
must leave greater undiscover'd. We know little the insensible
form and contexture of the parts of the Body, nor the just method
of their Action; We know not yet the manner, order and causes
of the Motion of the Heart, which is the chief Spring of the whole
Machine: and with how little exactness do we understand the Brain,
and the parts belonging to it? Why of that temper and of that
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:41970:115"/>
form? How Motions are propagated there, and how conserv'd?
How they answer the several operations of the Mind? Why such
little discomposures of it disturb our Senses, and upon what little
differences in this the great differences of Wits and Genius's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.
Yet seeing in all these Organs, whose make and manner of
action we cannot discover, we see however by the Effects, that they
are truly fitted for those offices to which Nature hath design'd them,
we ought in reason to admire that Art which we cannot penetrate.
At least we cannot but judge it a thing absurd, that what we have
not wit enough to find out or comprehend, we should not allow
to be an argument of wit and understanding in the Author, or
Inventor of it. This would be against all Logick, common Sense,
and common <hi>Decorum.</hi> Neither do I think it possible to the mind
of Man, while we attend to evidence, to believe that these, and
such like works of Nature came by <hi>Chance,</hi> as they call it, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Providence, forecast and Wisdom, either in the first Causes, or
in the proximate; in the design, or in the execution; in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
to them, or in the finishing of them.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, in my judgment, if any be of this perswasion, it
cannot be so much the effect of their understanding, as of their
disposition and inclination; and in moral things, mens opinions do
as often spring from the one, as from the other. For my part, I
do generally distinguish of two sorts of opinions in all men, <hi>Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-opinions,</hi>
and <hi>Reason'd-opinions;</hi> Opinions that grow upon Mens
Complexions, and Opinions that are the results of their Reason;
and I meet with very few that are of a temperament so equal, or
a constitution so even pois'd, but that they incline to one sett of
Opinions rather than another, antecedently to all proofs of Reason:
And when they have espous'd their opinions from that secret sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy,
then they find out as good Reasons as they can to maintain
them, and say, nay think sometimes, that 'twas for the sake of
those Reasons that they first imbrac'd them. We may commonly
distinguish these Inclination-opinions from the Rational, because
we find them accompanied with more Heat than Light, a great
deal of eagerness and impatience in defending of them, and but slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
arguments. One might give instances of this, both in Sects of
Religion and Philosophy, in <hi>Platonists, Stoicks,</hi> and <hi>Epicureans,</hi> that
are so by their temper more than their reason, but to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it will be sufficient to instance in one hearty <hi>Epicurean, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretius,</hi>
who is manifestly such, more from his inclination, and the
bent of his Spirit, than from the force of Argument. For though
his suppositions be very precarious, and his reasonings all along very
slight, he will many times strut and triumph, as if he had wrested
the Thunder out of <hi>Iove</hi>'s right hand; and a Mathematician is not
more confident of his demonstration, than he seems to be of the
truth of his shallow Philosophy. From such a principle of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Complexion as this, I allow a man may be Atheistical, but
never from the calm dictate of his Reason; yet he may be as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
and as tenacious of his Conclusion, as if he had a clear and
distinct evidence for it. For I take it to be a true Maxim in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:41970:115"/>
Nature, that <hi>A strong inclination, with a little evidence is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
to a strong evidence.</hi> And therefore we are not to be surpris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d
if we find Men confident in their opinions many times far beyond
the degree of their evidence, seeing there are other things, besides
evidence, that incline the Will to one Conclusion rather than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And as I have instanc'd in Natural Complexion, so <hi>Interest</hi>
hath the same effect upon Humane Nature, because it always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
an inclination to those opinions that favour our interest, and a
disinclination to the contrary; And this principle may be another
ingredient, and secret perswasive to Atheism; for when men have
run themselves so deep into Vice and Immorality, that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
no benefit from a God, 'tis in a manner necessary to their
quiet, and the ease of their mind, that they should fansie there is
none; for they are afraid, if there be a God, that he will not stand
neuter, and let them alone in another World. This, I say, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to the quiet of their mind, unless they can attain that great
Art, which many labour after, of <hi>non-reflection,</hi> or an <hi>unthinking
faculty,</hi> as to God and a World to come, but to return to our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
after this short digression—</p>
                     <p>And as that regular diversity which we see in the forms of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and especially in the Bodies of Animals, could not be from
any blind principle, either of Necessity or of Chance; So, in the last
place, that <hi>Subordination</hi> which we see in the parts of Nature, and
subserviency to one another, the less Noble to the more Noble, the
Inanimate to the Animate, and all things upon Earth unto Man,
must needs have been the effect of some Being higher than Matter;
that did wisely dispose all things so at first, and doth still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
them in the same order. If Man had been born into the
World, and a numerous host of Creatures, without any provision
or accommodation made for their subsistence and conveniences, we
might have suspected that they had come by Chance, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were so ill provided for: but which of them can complain?
through their various Kinds and Orders, what is there awant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
They are all fitted to their several Elements, and their ways of
living, Birds, Beasts, and Fishes, both by the form and shape of their
Bodies the manner of their covering, and the quality of their food.
Besides, They are instructed in little Arts and Instincts for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation;
and not only for their proper conservation, but also to
find a way to make and bring up young ones, and leave behind
them a Posterity; And all this in so fit a method, and by such a
pretty train of actions, as is really admirable.</p>
                     <p>Man is the Master of all, and of him a double care is taken;
that he should neither want what Nature can afford, nor what
Art can supply. He could not be provided of all conveniences by
Nature only, especially to secure him against the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uries of the Air;
but in recompence, Nature hath provided materials for all those
Arts which she see would be needful in Humane Life, as Building,
Cloathing, Navigation, Agriculture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That so Mankind might
have both wherewithal to answer their occasions, and also to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
their time, and exercise their ingenuity. This Oeconomy of
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:41970:116"/>
Nature, as I may call it, or well ordering of the great Family of
living Creatures, is an argument both of Goodness and of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and is every way far above the powers of brute Matter. All
regular administration we ascribe to conduct and judgment; If an
Army of Men be well provided for in things necessary both for
Food, Cloaths, Arms, Lodging, Security and Defence, so as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is awanting in so great a multitude, we suppose it the effect
of care and forecast in those persons that had the charge of it;
they took their measures at first, computed and proportion'd one
thing to another, made good regulations, and gave orders for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
supplies. And can we suppose the great Army of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
upon Earth manag'd and provided for with less fore-thought
and Providence, nay, with none at all, by meer Chance? This is
to recede from all rules and analogy of Reason, only to serve a turn,
and gratifie an unreasonable humour.</p>
                     <p>To conclude this Argument; There are two general Heads of
things, if I recollect aright, which we make the marks and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of Wisdom and Reason, Works of Art, and the Conduct
of affairs or direction of means to an end; and wheresoever we
meet, either with regular material works, or a regular ordination
of affairs, we think we have a good title and warrant to derive
them from an intelligent Author; Now these two being found in
the Natural World, and that in an eminent degree, the one in the
Frame of it, and the other in the Oeconomy of it, we have all the
evidence and ground that can be in arguing from things visible to
things invisible, that there is an Author of Nature, Superiour both
to Humane Power and Humane Wisdom.</p>
                     <p>Before we proceed to give any further proofs or discoveries of
the Author of Nature, let us reflect a little upon those we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
insisted upon; which have been taken wholly from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
World, and from the common course of Nature. The very
existence of Matter is a proof of a Deity, for the <hi>Idea</hi> of it hath no
connexion with existence, as we shall show hereafter; however we
will take leave now to set it down with the rest, in order as they
follow one another.</p>

                     <p>The five first of these Heads are prerequisites, and preparatives to
the formation of a World, and the two last are as the image and
character of its Maker, of his Power, Goodness and Wisdom, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
upon it. Every one of them might well deserve a Chapter to
it self, if the subject was to be treated on at large; but this is only
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:41970:116"/>
an occasional dissertation, to state the Powers of Matter, lest they
should be thought boundless, and the Author of Nature unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as the <hi>Epicuraeans</hi> pretend; but notwithstanding their vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
and credulity, I defie them, or any man else, to make sence
of the Material World, without placing a God at the Center of it.</p>
                     <p>To these considerations taken wholly from the Corporeal World,
give me leave to add one of a mixt nature, concerning the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Soul and Body.</hi> This strange effect, if rightly understood,
doth as truly discover the Author of Nature, as many Effects that
are accounted more Supernatural. The Incarnation, as I may so
say, of a Spiritual Substance, is to me a kind of standing miracle;
That there should be such an union and connexion reciprocally
betwixt the motions of the Body, and the actions and passions of
the Soul: betwixt a substance Intellectual, and a parcel of orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niz'd
Matter: can be no effect of either of those substances; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wholly distinct in themselves, and remote in their natures from
one another. For instance, When my Finger is cut, or when 'tis
burnt, that my Soul thereupon should feel such a smart and violent
pain, is no consequence of Nature, or does not follow from any
connexion there is betwixt the Motion or Division of that piece of
Matter, I call my Finger, and the passion of that Spirit I call my
Soul; for these are two distinct Essences, and in themselves inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
upon one another, as much as the Sun and my Body are
independent; and there is no more reason in strict Nature, or in the
essential chain of Causes and Effects, that my Soul should suffer,
or be affected with this Motion in the Finger, than that the Sun
should be affected with it; nay, there is less reason, if less can be,
for the Sun being Corporeal, as the finger is, there is some remote
possibility that there might be communication of Motion betwixt
them; but Motion cannot beget a thought, or a passion, by its own
force; Motion can beget nothing but Motion, and if it should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a thought, the Effect would be more noble than the Cause.
Wherefore this Union is not by any necessity of Nature, but only from
a positive Institution, or Decree establisht by the Author of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that there should be such a communication betwixt these two
substances for a time, <hi>viz.</hi> during the Vitality of the Body.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true indeed, if Thought, Apprehension, and Reason, was
nothing but Corporeal Motion, this Argument would be of no
force; but to suppose this, is to admit an absurdity to cure a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty;
to make a Thought out of a local Motion; is like making a
God out of a Stock, or a Stone; for these two are as remote in
their Nature, and have as different <hi>Idea</hi>'s in the Mind, as any two
disparate things we can propose or conceive; Number and Colour,
a Triangle and Vertue, Free-will and a Pyramid are not more
unlike, more distant, or of more different forms, than Thought
and local Motion. Motion is nothing but a Bodies changing its
place and situation amongst other Bodies, and what affinity or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
hath that to a <hi>Thought?</hi> How is that like to Pain, or to a
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:41970:117"/>
doubt of the Mind? to Hope or to Desire? to the <hi>Idea</hi> of God?
to any act of the Will or Understanding, as judging, consenting,
reasoning, remembring, or any other? These are things of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
orders that have no similitude, nor any mixture of one another.
And as this is the nature of Motion, so, on the other hand, in a
<hi>Thought</hi> there are two things, <hi>Consciousness,</hi> and a <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>epresentation;</hi>
Consciousness is in all Thoughts indifferently, whether distinct or
confus'd, for no Man thinks but he is conscious that he thinks, nor
perceives any thing but he is conscious that he perceives it; there
is also in a Thought, especially if it be distinct, a representation;
'tis the image of that we think upon, and makes its Object present
to the Mind. Now what hath local Motion to do with either of
these two, Consciousness, or Representativeness? How doth it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
either of them, or hold them any way affixt to its Nature?
I think one may with as good sence and reason ask of what colour
a Thought is, green or scarlet, as what sort of Motion it is; for
Motion of what sort soever, can never be conscious, not represent
things as our Thoughts do. I have noted thus much in general,
only to show the different nature of Motion and Cogitation, that
we may be the more sensible that they have no mutual connexion
in us, nor in any other Creature, from their essence or essential
properties, but by a supervenient power from the Author of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
who hath thus united the Soul and the Body in their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
                     <p>We have hitherto only consider'd the ordinary course of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and what indications and proofs of its Author, that affords
us; There is another remarkable Head of Arguments from effects
extraordinary and supernatural, such as Miracles, Prophecies, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirations,
Prodigies, Apparitions, Witchcraft, Sorceries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
These, at one step, lead us to something above Nature, and this is
the shortest way, and the most popular; several Arguments are
suited to several tempers, and God hath not left himself without a
proper witness to every temper that is not wilfully blind. Of these
witnesses we now speak of, the most considerable are Miracles, and
the most considerable Records of them are the Books of Scripture;
which if we consider only as an History, and as having nothing
Sacred in them more than other good Histories, that is, truth in
matter of fact, we cannot doubt but there have been Miracles
in the World; That <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, our Saviour and his
Apostles, wrought Miracles, I can no more question, than that
<hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> fought Battles, and took Cities. So also that
there were true Prophecies and Inspirations, we know from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
only consider'd as a true History. But as for other superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
effects that are not recorded there, we have reason to examine
them more strictly before we receive them, at least as to particular
instances; for I am apt to think they are like Lotteries, where
there are ten or twenty Blanks for one Prize; but yet if there
were no Prizes at all, the Lottery would not have credit to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
and would be cry'd down as a perfect Cheat; So if amongst
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:41970:117"/>
those many stories of Prodigies, Apparitions, and Witchcrafts,
there were not some true, the very fame and thought of them
would die from amongst Men, and the first broachers of them
would be hooted at as Cheats. As a false Religion that hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
true and solid mixt with it, can scarce be fixt upon Mankind;
but where there is a mixture of true and false, the strength of
the one supports the weakness of the other. As for Sorcery, the
instances and examples of it are undeniable; not so much those few
scatter'd instances that happen now and then amongst us, but such
as are more constant, and in a manner National, in some Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and amongst barbarous people. Besides, the Oracles, and the
Magick that was so frequent amongst the Ancients, show us that
there have been always some Powers more than Humane tampering
with the affairs of Mankind. But this Topick from effects Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
and Supernatural, being in a great measure Historical, and
respecting evil Spirits as well as the Author of Nature, is not so
proper for this place.</p>
                     <p>There is a third Sett or Head of Arguments, that to some tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
are more cogent and convictive than any of these, namely,
Arguments <hi>abstract</hi> and <hi>Metaphysical;</hi> And these do not only lead
us to an Author of Nature in general, but show us more of his
properties and perfections; represent him to us as a supream Deity,
infinitely perfect, the fountain of all Being, and the steddy Center
of all things. But reasons of this order, being of a finer thred,
require more attention, and some preparation of Mind to make us
discern them well, and be duly sensible of them. When a Man
hath withdrawn himself from the noise of this busie World, lock'd
up his Senses and his Passions, and every thing that would unite
him with it: commanded a general silence in the Soul, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
not a Thought to stir, but what looks inwards; Let him then
reflect seriously, and ask himself, <hi>What am I,</hi> and <hi>How came I into
Being?</hi> If I was Author and Original to my self, surely I ought to
feel that mighty Power, and enjoy the pleasure of it; but, alas, I
am conscious of no such force or Vertue, nor of any thing in my
Nature, that should give me necessary existence; It hath no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
with any part of me, nor any faculty in me, that I can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.
And now that I do exist, from what Causes soever, <hi>Can I se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
my self in Being?</hi> now that I am in possession, am I sure to keep
it? am I certain that three minutes hence I shall still exist? I may
or I may not, for ought I see; Either seems possible in it self, and
either is contingent as to me; I find nothing in my Nature that can
warrant my subsistence for one day, for one hour, for one moment
longer. I am nothing but Thoughts, fleeting Thoughts, that chase
and extinguish one another; and my Being, for ought I know, is
successive, and as dying as they are, and renew'd to me every moment.
This I am sure of, that so far as I know my self, and am conscious what
I am, there is no principle of immutability, or of necessary and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectible
existence in my Nature; and therefore I ought in reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that I stand or fall at the mercy of other Causes, and not by my
own will, or my own sufficiency.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="208" facs="tcp:41970:118"/>
Besides, I am very sensible and in this I cannot be mistaken, that
my Nature is in several respects, weak and imperfect; both as to
Will and Understanding. I <hi>Will</hi> many things in vain, and without
effect, and I Wish often what I have no ability to execute or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
And as to my Understanding, how defective is it? how little
or nothing do I know in comparison of what I am ignorant of?
Almost all the Intellectual World is shut up to me, and the far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part of the Corporeal; And in those things that fall under
my cognizance, how often am I mistaken? I am confin'd to a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
sphere, and yet within that sphere I often erre; my conceptions
of things are obscure and confus'd, my reason short-sighted; I am
forc'd often to correct my self, to acknowledge that I have judg'd
false, and consented to an errour. In summ, all my powers I find
are limited, and I can easily conceive the same kind of perfections
in higher degrees than I possess them, and consequently there are
Beings,<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. Arist.</note> or may be, greater and more excellent than my self, and
more able to subsist by their own power. Why should I not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
believe that my Original is from those Beings rather than from
my self? For every Nature, the more great and perfect it is,
the nearer it approacheth to necessity of existence, and to a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of producing other things. Yet, the truth is, it must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd,
that so long as the perfections of those other Beings are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
and finite, though they be far superiour to us, there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
ariseth from their Nature that they should exist; and the
same Arguments that we have us'd against our selves, they may, in
proportion, use against themselves; and therefore we must still ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
higher to find a self originated Being, whose existence must fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>w
immediately from his essence, or have a necessary connextion with it.</p>
                     <p>And indeed all these different degrees of higher and higher per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
lead us directly to an highest, or Supream degree, which
is infinite and unlimited Perfection. As subordinate causes lead to
the first, so Natures more perfect one than another lead us to a
Nature infinitely perfect, which is the Fountain of them all. Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we must go, if we will follow the course of Reason, which
cannot stop at one more than another, till it arrive there; And
being arriv'd there, at that Soveraign and Original Perfection, it
finds a firm and immoveable ground to stand upon; the steddy Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of all Being, wherein the Mind rests and is satisfied. All the
scruples or objections that we mov'd against our selves, or other
Creatures, take no place here; This Being is conscious of an All-sufficiency
in it self, and of immutability as to any thing else,
including in it all the causes of existence, or, to speak more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
all necessity of existence. Besides, that <hi>we exist our selves,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the imperfection and insufficiency of our Nature, is a
just, collateral proof of the existence of this Supream Being; for
such an effect as this cannot be without its Cause, and it can have
no other competent Cause but that we mention. And as this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is its own Origin, so it must needs be capable of producing all
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:41970:118"/>
Creatures; for whatsoever is possible, must be possible to it; and
that Creatures or finite Beings are possible, we both see by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and may also discern by Reason; for those several degrees of
perfection, or limitations of it, which we mention'd before, are all
consistent Notions, and consequently make consistent Natures, and
such as may exist; but contingently indeed, and in dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the first Cause.</p>
                     <p>Thus we are come at length to a fair resolution of that great
Question, <hi>Whence we are,</hi> and <hi>how</hi> we continue in Being? And this
hath led us by an easie ascent to the Supreme Author of Nature,
and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>irst Cause of all things; and presents us also with such a
Scheme and Draught of the Universe, as is clear and rational; every
thing in its order, and in its place, according to the dignity of its
Nature, and the strength of its principles. When the Mind hath
rais'd it self into this view of a Being infinitely perfect, 'tis in a Region
of Light, hath a free prospect every way, and sees all things from
top to bottom, as pervious and transparent. Whereas without God
and a First Cause, there is nothing but darkness and confusion in the
Mind, and in Nature; broken views of things, short interrupted
glimpses of Light, nothing certain or demonstrative, no Basis of Truth,
no extent of Thought, no Science, no Contemplation.</p>
                     <p>You will say, it may be, 'Tis true, something must be <hi>Eternal,</hi>
and of <hi>necessary existence,</hi> but why may not <hi>Matter</hi> be this Eternal
necessary Being? Then our Souls and all other Intellectual things
must be parts and parcels of Matter; and what pretensions can Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
have to those properties and perfections that we find in our
Souls, how limited soever? much less to <hi>necessary existence,</hi> and
those perfections that are the foundation of it? What exists Eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and from it self, its existence must flow immediately from its es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
as its cause, reason or ground; for as Existence hath always
something antecedent to it in order of Nature, so that which is ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
to it must infer it by a necessary connexion, and so may be
call'd the cause, ground, or reason of it. And nothing can be such a
ground, but what is a perfection; nor every perfection neither, it
must be Sovereign and Infinite perfection; for from what else can
necessary existence flow, or be inferr'd? Besides, if that Being was
not infinitely perfect, there might be another Being more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
than it, and consequently able to oppose and hinder its Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence;
and what may be hinder'd is contingent and arbitrary.
Now <hi>Matter</hi> is so far from being a Nature infinitely perfect, that it
hath no perfection at all, but that of bare <hi>substance;</hi> neither Life,
Sense, Will or Understanding; nor so much as Motion, from it
self; as we have show'd before. And therefore this brute inactive
mass, which is but, as it were, the Drudge of Nature, can have no
right or title to that Sovereign prerogative of Self existence.</p>
                     <p>We noted before, as a thing agreed upon, <hi>That something or other
must needs be Eternal.</hi> For if ever there was a time or state, when
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:41970:119"/>
there was no Being, there never could be any. Seeing <hi>Nothing</hi>
could not produce <hi>Something.</hi> Therefore 'tis undeniably true on
all hands, That there was some Being from Eternity. Now, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our understandings, <hi>Truth</hi> is <hi>Eternal:</hi> therefore, say we,
some intellect or Intelligent Being. So also the reasons of <hi>Goodness</hi>
and <hi>Iustice</hi> appear to us Eternal, and therefore some Good and
Just Being is Eternal. Thus much is plain, that these perfections
which bear the signatures of Eternity upon them, are things that
have no relation to <hi>Matter,</hi> but relate immediately to an Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Being: therefore some such Being, to whom they originally
belong, must be that <hi>Eternal.</hi> Besides, We cannot possibly but
judge such a Being more perfect than Matter; Now every Nature,
the more perfect it is, the more remote it is from <hi>Nothing:</hi> and the
more remote it is from Nothing, the more it approaches to necessity
of existence, and consequently to Eternal Existence.</p>
                     <p>Thus we have made a short Survey, so far as the bounds of a
Chapter would permit, of those evidences and assurances which we
have, from abstract Reason, and the External World, that there is
an Author of Nature; and That, a Being infinitely perfect, which
we call <hi>God.</hi> We may add to these, in the last place, that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
consent of Mankind, or natural instinct of Religion, which
we see, more or less, throughout all Nations, Barbarous or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.
For though this Argument, 'tis true, be more disputable than
the rest, yet having set down just grounds already from whence
this Natural Judgment or perswasion might spring, we have more
reason to impute it to some of those, and their insensible influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upon the Mind, than to the artifices of Men, or to make it
a weakness, prejudice, or errour of our Nature. That there is
such a propension in Humane Nature, seems to be very plain; at
least so far as to move us to implore, and have recourse to invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Powers in our extremities. Prayer is natural in certain cases,
and we do at the meer motion of our natural Spirit, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately,
invoke God and Heaven, either in case of extreme dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
to help and assist us; or in case of injustice and oppression, to
relieve or avenge us; or in case of false accusation, to vindicate our
innocency; and generally in all cases desperate and remediless as
to Humane Power, we seem to appeal, and address our selves to
something higher. And this we do by a sudden impulse of Nature,
without reflexion or deliberation. Besides, as witnesses of our
Faith and Veracity, we use to invoke the Gods, or Superiour
Powers, by way of imprecation upon our selves, if we be false and
perjur'd; and this hath been us'd in most Nations and Ages, if not in all.
These things also argue, that there is a Natural Conscience in Man,
and a distinction of moral <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil;</hi> and that we look upon
those invisible Powers as the Guardians of Vertue and Honesty.
There are also few or no People upon the Earth but have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of External Religion, true or false; and either of them is an
argument of this natural anticipation, or that they have an opinion
that there is something above them, and above visible Nature;
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:41970:119"/>
though what that <hi>something</hi> was, they seldom were able to make a
good judgment. But to pursue this Argument particularly, would
require an Historical deduction of Times and Places, which is not
suitable to our present design.</p>
                     <p>To conclude this Chapter and this Subject; If we set Religion
apart, and consider the Deist and Atheist only as two Sects in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
or their doctrine as two different <hi>Hypotheses</hi> propos'd for
the explication of Nature, and in competition with one another,
whether should give the more rational account of the Universe, of
its Origin and <hi>Phaenomena;</hi> I say, if we consider them only thus,
and make an impartial estimate, whether System is more reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
more clear, and more satisfactory, to me there seems to be
no more comparison, than betwixt light and darkness. The <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis</hi>
of the Deist reacheth from top to bottom, both thorough the
Intellectual and Material World, with a clear and distinct light
every where, is genuine, comprehensive, and satisfactory; hath
nothing forc'd, nothing confus'd, nothing precarious; whereas the
<hi>Hypothesis</hi> of the Atheist is strain'd and broken, dark and uneasie
to the Mind, commonly precarious, often incongruous and irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
and sometimes plainly ridiculous. And this judgment I
should make of them abstractly from the interest of Religion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
them only as matter of Reason and Philosophy; <hi>And</hi> I
dare affirm with assurance, if the faculties of our Souls be true,
that no Man can have a System of Thoughts reaching thorough
Nature, coherent and consistent in every part, without a Deity for
the Basis of it.</p>

Concerning
NATURAL PROVIDENCE. Several incroachments upon Natural Providence, or misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations
of it, and false methods of Contemplation;
A true method propos'd, and a true representation of the
Vniverse. The Mundane Idea, and the Vniversal Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem
of Providence; Several subordinate Systems, That
of our Earth and Sublunary World; The Course and Periods
of it; How much of this is already treated of, and what
remains. The Conclusion.</head>
                     <p>WE have set bounds to Nature in the foregoing Chapter, and
plac'd her Author and Governour upon his Throne, to
give Laws to her Motions, and to direct and limit her Power in
such ways and methods as are most for his honour. Let us now
consider Nature under the conduct of Providence, or consider <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Providence,</hi> and the extent of it; And as we were cautious
before not to give too much power or greatness to Nature, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
apart from Providence, so we must be careful now, under this
second consideration, not to contract her bounds too much; lest we
should by too mean and narrow thoughts of the Creation, Eclipse
the glory of its Author, whom we have so lately own'd as a Being
infinitely perfect.</p>
                     <p>And to use no further Introduction, In the <hi>first place,</hi> we must
not by any means admit or imagine, that all Nature, and this
great Universe, was made only for the sake of Man, the meanest
of all Intelligent Creatures that we know of; Nor that this little Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
where we sojourn for a few days, is the only habitable part of
the Universe; These are Thoughts so groundless and unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in themselves, and also so derogatory to the Infinite Power,
Wisdom, and Goodness of the First Cause, that as they are absurd
in Reason, so they deserve far better to be mark'd and censur'd for
Heresies in Religion, than many Opinions that have been censur'd
for such, in former Ages. How is it possible that it should enter
into the thoughts of vain Man, to believe himself the principal
part of God's Creation: or that all the rest was ordain'd for him,
for his service or pleasure? Man, whose follies we laugh at every
day, or else complain of them; whose pleasures are vanity, and
his Passions stronger than his Reason; Who sees himself every
way weak and impotent, hath no power over external Nature,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:41970:120"/>
little over himself; cannot execute so much as his own good reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions;
mutable, irregular, prone to evil. Surely, if we made
the least reflection upon our selves with impartiality, we should be
asham'd of such an arrogant Thought. How few of these Sons of
Men, for whom, they say, all things were made, are the Sons of
Wisdom? How few find the paths of Life? They spend a few days
in folly and sin, and then go down to the Regions of death and
misery. And is it possible to believe, that all Nature, and all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
are only, or principally for their sake? Is it not a more
reasonable character or conclusion which the Prophet hath made,
<hi>Surely every Man is vanity?</hi> Man that comes into the World at the
pleasure of another, and goes out by an hundred accidents; His
Birth and Education generally determine his fate here, and neither
of those are in his own power; His wit also is as uncertain as his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
He hath not the moulding of his own Brain, however a
knock on the Head makes him a Fool, stupid as the Beasts of the
Field; and a little excess of passion or melancholy makes him worse,
Mad and Frantick. In his best Senses, he is shallow, and of little
understanding: and in nothing more blind and ignorant than in
things Sacred and Divine; He falls down before a stock or a stone,
and says, Thou art my God; He can believe non-sence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,
and make it his Religion to do so. And is this the great
Creature which God hath made <hi>by the might of his Power, and for
the honour of his Majesty?</hi> Upon whom all things must wait, to
whom all things must be subservient? Methinks we have noted
weaknesses and sollies enough in the Nature of Man, this need not
be added as the top and accomplishment, <hi>That with all these he
is so Vain, as to think that all the rest of the World was made for his
sake.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as due humility and the consideration of our own meanness,
ought to secure us from any such vain opinion of our selves, so the
perfection of other Beings ought to give us more respect and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
for them. With what face can we pretend, that Creatures
far superiour to us, and more excellent both in Nature and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
should be made for our sake and service? How preposterous
would it be to ascribe such a thing to our Maker, and how into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
a vanity in us to affect it? We that are next to the Brutes
that perish by a sacrilegious attempt, would make our selves more
considerable than the highest Dignities. It is thought to have been
the crime of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> who was thrown down from Heaven to Hell,
that he affected an equality with the Almighty; and to affect to
be next to the Almighty is a crime next to that. We have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to believe, but that there are, at least, as many orders of Beings
above us, as there are ranks of Creatures below us; there is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
distance sure betwixt us and God Almighty, than there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
us and the meanest Worm: and yet we should take it very
ill, if the Worms of the Earth should pretend that we were made
for them. But to pass from the invisible World to the visible and
Corporeal,—
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:41970:121"/>
Was that made only for our sake? King <hi>David</hi> was more wise,
and more just both to God and Man, in his <hi>8th</hi> Psalm; where he
says, He wonders, when he considers the Heavens, that the Maker
of them could think on Man. He truly supposes the Celestial Bodies
and the Inhabitants of them, much more considerable than we are,
and reckons up only Terrestrial things as put in subjection to Man.
Can we then be so fond as to imagine all the Corporeal Universe
made for our use? 'Tis not the Millioneth part of it that is known
to us, much less useful; We can neither reach with our Eye, nor
our imagination, those Armies of Stars that lie far and deep in
the boundless Heavens. If we take a good Glass, we discover in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerably
more Stars in the Firmament than we can with our
single Eye; and yet if you take a second Glass, better than the first,
that carries the sight to a greater distance, you see more still lying
beyond the other; and a third Glass that pierceth further, still
makes new discoveries of Stars; and so forwards, indefinitely and
inexhaustedly for any thing we know, according to the immensity of
the Divine Nature and Power. Who can reckon up the Stars of
the Galaxy, or direct us in the use of them? And can we believe
that those and all the rest were made for us? Of those few Stars that
we enjoy, or that are visible to the Eye, there is not a tenth part
that is really useful to Man; and no doubt if the principal end of
them had been our pleasure or conveniency, they would have been
put in some better order in respect of the Earth? They lie carelesly
scatter'd, as if they had been sown in the Heaven, like Seed, by
handfuls; and not by a skilful hand neither. What a beautiful
Hemisphere they would have made, if they had been plac'd in rank
and order, if they had been all dispos'd into regular figures and
the little ones set with due regard to the greater, then all finisht
and made up into one fair piece or great Composition; according
to the rules of Art and Symmetry. What a surprizing beauty
this would have been to the Inhabitants of the Earth? What a
lovely Roof to our little World? This indeed might have given one
some Temptation to have thought that they had been all made for
us; but lest any such vain imagination should now enter into our
thoughts, Providence (besides more important Reasons) seems on
purpose to have left them under that negligence or disorder which
they appear in to us.</p>
                     <p>The second part of this opinion supposeth this Planet, where
we live, to be the only habitable part of the Universe; and this is
a natural consequence of the former; If all things were made to
serve us, why should any more be made than what is useful to us.
But 'tis only our ignorance of the System of the World, and of
the grandeur of the Works of God, that betrays us to such narrow
thoughts.<note place="margin">See the Lat. Treat. lib. 1. c. 10. p. 108, 109, &amp;c.</note> If we do but consider what this Earth is, both for little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and deformity, and what its Inhabitants are, we shall not be apt
to think that this miserable Atome hath ingross'd and exhausted all
the Divine Favours, and all the riches of his goodness, and of his
Providence. But we will not inlarge upon this part of the opinion, lest
it should carry us too far from the subject, and it will fall, of its own
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:41970:121"/>
accord, with the former. Upon the whole we may conclude, that
it was only the Sublunary World that was made for the sake of
Man, and not the Great Creation, either Material or Intellectual;
and we cannot admit or affirm any more, without manifest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
depression, and misrepresentation of Providence, as we may
be easily convinc'd from these four Heads; <hi>The</hi> Meanness of Man and
of this Earth, <hi>The</hi> Excellency of other Beings, <hi>The</hi> Immensity of the
Universe, and <hi>The</hi> infinite perfection of the first Cause. Which I
leave to your further Meditation, and pass on to the second rule,
concerning Natural Providence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In the second place</hi> then, if we would have a fair view and right
apprehensions of Natural Providence, we must not cut the chains
of it too short, by having recourse, without necessity, either to the
First Cause, in explaining the Origins of things: or to Miracles,
in explaining particular effects. This, I say, breaks the chains of
Natural Providence, when it is done without necessity, that is, when
things are otherwise ntelligible from Second Causes. Neither is
any thing gain'd by it to God Almighty; for 'tis but, as the
Proverb says, to rob <hi>Peter</hi> to pay <hi>Paul,</hi> to take so much from
his ordinary Providence, and place it to his extraordinary. When
a new Religion is brought into the World, 'tis very reasonable
and decorous that it should be usher'd in with Miracles, as both the
<hi>Iewish</hi> and <hi>Christian</hi> were; but afterwards things return into their
Chanel, and do not change or overflow again, but upon extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
occasions or revolutions. The power <hi>Extraordinary</hi> of God
is to be accounted very Sacred, not to be touch'd or expos'd for
our pleasure or conveniency; but I am afraid we often make use
of it only to conceal our own ignorance, or to save us the trouble
of inquiring into Natural Causes. Men are generally unwilling to
appear ignorant, especially those that make profession of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and when they have not skill enough to explain some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
effect in a way of Reason, they throw it upon the First
Cause, as able to bear all; and so placing it to that account, they
excuse themselves, and save their credit; for all Men are equally
wise, if you take away Second Causes; as we are all of the same co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
if you take away the Light.</p>
                     <p>But to state this matter,<note place="margin">See Book 1. c. 8. at the end.</note> and see the ground of this rule more
distinctly, we must observe and consider, that <hi>The Course of Nature
is truly the Will of God;</hi> and, as I may so say, his first Will; from
which we are not to recede, but upon clear evidence and necessity.
And as in matter of Religion, we are to follow the known reveal'd
Will of God, and not to trust to every impulse or motion of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm,
as coming from the Divine Spirit, unless there be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
marks that it is Supernatural, and cannot come from our own;
So neither are we, without necessity, to quit the known and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Will and Power of God establisht in the course of Nature,
and fly to Supernatural Causes, or his extraordinary Will; for this
is a kind of Enthusiasm or Fanaticism, as well as the other: And
no doubt that great prodigality and waste of Miracles which some
make, is no way to the honour of God or Religion. 'Tis true, the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:41970:122"/>
other extream is worse than this, for to deny all Miracles, is in
effect to deny all reveal'd Religion; therefore due measures are to
be taken betwixt these two, so as neither to make the Divine Power
too mean and cheap, nor the Power of Nature illimited and all-sufficient.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In the Third place,</hi> To make the Scenes of Natural Providence
considerable, and the knowledge of them satisfactory to the Mind;
we must take a true Philosophy, or the true principles that govern
Nature, which are Geometrical and Mechanical. By these you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the footsteps of the Divine Art and Wisdom, and trace the
progress of Nature step by step, as distinctly as in Artificial things,
where we see how the Motions depend upon one another, in what
order and by what necessity. God made all things in <hi>Number,
Wei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ht</hi> and <hi>Measure,</hi> which are Geometrical and Mechanical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
He is not said to have made things by <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
or any combination of Qualities, but by these three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
which may be conceiv'd to express the subject of three Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical
Sciences, Number, of <hi>Arithmetick;</hi> Weight, of <hi>Staticks;</hi>
and <hi>Measure</hi> and Proportion, of <hi>Geometry;</hi> If then all things were
made according to these principles, to understand the manner of
their construction and composition, we must proceed in the search
of them by the same principles, and resolve them into these again.
Besides, The nature of the subject does direct us sufficiently; for
when we contemplate or treat of Bodies, and the Material World,
we must proceed by the modes of Bodies, and their real proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
such as can be represented, either to Sense or Imagination,
for these faculties are made for Corporeal Things; but Logical No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
when appli'd to particular Bodies, are meer shadows of
them, without light or substance. No Man can raise a Theory
upon such grounds, nor calculate any revolutions of Nature; nor
render any service, or invent any thing useful in Humane Life:
And accordingly we see, that for these many Ages, that this dry
Philosophy hath govern'd Christendom, it hath brought forth no
fruit, produc'd nothing good, to God or Man, to Religion or
Humane Society.</p>
                     <p>To these True Principles of Philosophy, we must joyn also the
True System of the World. That gives scope to our thoughts, and
rational grounds to work upon; but the Vulgar System, or that
which <hi>Aristotle</hi> and others have propos'd, affords no matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.
All above the Moon, according to him, is firm as Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant,
and as immutable; no change or variation in the Universe,
but in those little removes that happen here below, one quality or
form shifting into another; there would therefore be no great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of Reason or Meditation in such a World; no long Series's
of Providence; The Regions above being made of a kind of immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Matter, they would always remain in the same form, stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
and qualities: So as we might lock up that part of the
Universe as to any further Inquiries, and we should find it ten
thousand years hence in the same form and state wherein we left it.
Then in this Sublunary World there would be but very small
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:41970:122"/>
doings neither, things would lie in a narrow compass, no great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution
of Nature, no new Form of the Earth, but a few anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
<hi>Corruptions</hi> and <hi>Generations,</hi> and that would be the short
and the long of Nature, and of Providence, according to <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
But if we consider the Earth, as one of those many Planets that
move about the Sun, and the Sun as one of those innumerable fixt
Stars that adorn the Universe, and are the Centers of its greatest
Motions; and all this subject to fate and change, to corruptions and
renovations; This opens a large Field for our Thoughts; and gives
a large subject for the exercise and expansion of the Divine Wisdom
and Power, and for the glory of his Providence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In the last place,</hi> Having thus prepar'd your Mind, and the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
for the Contemplation of <hi>Natural Providence,</hi> do not content
your self to consider only the present face of Nature, but look back
into the first <hi>Sources</hi> of things, into their more simple and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
states; and observe the progress of Nature from one form to
another, through various modes and compositions. For there is
no single Effect, nor any single state of Nature, how perfect soever,
that can be such an argument and demonstration of Providence,
as a Period of Nature, or a revolution of several states consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to one another; and in such an order and dependance, that as
they flow and succeed, they shall still be adjusted to the periods of
the Moral World; so as to be ready always to be Ministers of the
Divine Justice or beneficence to Mankind. This shows the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
riches of the Wisdom and Power of God in Nature. And
this may give us just occasion to reflect again upon <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s System
and method, which destroys Natural Providence in this respect also;
for he takes the World as it is now, both for Matter and Form, and
supposeth it to have been in this posture from all Eternity, and
that it will continue to Eternity in the same; so as all the great
turns of Nature, and the principal scenes of Providence in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
World are quite struck out; and we have but this one Scene
for all, and a pitiful one too, if compar'd with the Infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God, and the depths of Providence. We must take things
in their full extent, and from their Origins, to comprehend them
well, and to discover the Mysteries of Providence, both in the
Causes and in the Conduct of them. That method which <hi>David</hi>
followed in the Contemplation of the Little World, or in the Body
of Man, we should also follow in the Great; take it in its first
mass, in its tender principles and rudiments, and observe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
of it to a compleat form; In these first stroaks of Nature are
the secrets of her Art; The Eye must be plac'd in this point to
have a right prospect, and see her works in a true light. <hi>David</hi>
admires the Wisdom of God in the Origin and formation of his
Body;<note place="margin">Psal. 139. 15. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>My Body,</hi> says He, <hi>was not hid from thee, when I was made in
secret, curiously wrought in the lower parts of the Earth; Thine eyes did
see my substance being yet unperfect, and in thy Book all my members
were written; which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there
was none of them,</hi> or being at first in no form. <hi>How precious are
thy Thoughts to me, O God,</hi> &amp;c. This was the subject of <hi>David</hi>'s
Meditations, how his Body was wrought from a shapeless mass into
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:41970:123"/>
that marvellous composition which it had when fully fram'd; and
this, he says, was under the Eye of God all along, and the model
of it, as it were, was design'd and delineated in the Book of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
according to which it was by degrees fashion'd and wrought
to perfection. <hi>Thine eyes did see my substance yet being imperfect, in
thy Book all my members were drawn,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iob</hi> also hath aptly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
those first rudiments of the Body, or that little Chaos out of
which it riseth,<note place="margin">Iob 10. 10, 11.</note> 
                        <hi>Hast thou not poured me out as Milk, and crudled me
like Cheese? Thou hast cloathed me with Skin and Flesh, and fenced me
with Bones and Sinews.</hi> Where he notes the first Matter and the
last Form of his Body, its compleat and most incompleat state. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to those examples we must likewise consider the Greater
Bodies of Nature, The Earth and the Sublunary World; we must
go to the Origin of them, the Seminal Mass, the Chaos out of
which they rise; Look upon the World first as an Embryo world,
without form or shape, and then consider how its Members were
fashion'd, how by degrees it was brought into that diversity of
Parts and Regions, which it consists of, with all their furniture,
and with all their ornaments. The <hi>Idea</hi> of all which was before
hand, according to <hi>David</hi>'s expression, written in the Divine Mind;
and we partake of that wisdom, according to our capacity, in
seeing and admiring the methods of it.</p>
                     <p>These seem to be necessary preparatives or directions to those that
would contemplate, with profit, Natural Providence, and the great
Works of God in the Visible Creation. We consider'd Nature in
the precedent Chapter abstractly, and in her self, and now we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
her under the Conduct of Providence, which we therefore
call Natural Providence; And as we have endeavour'd to remove
those false Notions and Suppositions that lay as Clouds upon her
face, so we must now endeavour to represent her in a better light,
and in a fuller beauty. By <hi>Natural Providence</hi> therefore we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
<hi>The Form or Course of Universal Nature, as actuated by the
Divine Power: with all the Changes, Periods, and Vicissitudes that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it, according to the method and establishment made at first, by the
Author of it.</hi> I said of <hi>Universal Nature,</hi> through all the Orders of
Beings in the Intellectual World, and all the Regions and Systems
of Matter in the Corporeal. For, having prov'd in the foregoing
Chapter, that there is an Author of Nature, a Being Infinitely Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
by whose power and influence alone all finite Natures exist
and act, we have an assured ground to conclude, that nothing can
come to pass, throughout the whole Creation, without the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
and permission of its Author; and as it is necessary to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that there is an <hi>Idea</hi> in the Divine Understanding of all the
mass of Beings produc'd or Created, according to the several ranks
and orders wherein they stand; so there is also an <hi>Idea</hi> there, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which this great Frame moves, and all the parts of it,
in beauty and harmony.</p>
                     <p>And these two things, The <hi>Essences</hi> of all Beings, and the Series
of their <hi>Motions,</hi> compose the MUNDANE IDEA, as I may
so call it; or that great All-comprehensive Thought in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Understanding, which contains the System of Universal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:41970:123"/>
and the state of all things, past, present, or to come. This
glorious <hi>Idea</hi> is the express Image of the whole Creation, of all the
Works of God, and the disposition of them; here lie the mysteries
of Providence, as in their Original; The successive Forms of all
Nature; and herein as in a Glass, may be view'd all the Scenes of
Time or Eternity. This is an Abyss of Sacred Wisdom, The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhausted
Treasure of all Science, The Root of Truth, and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of Intellectual Light; and in the clear and full contemplation of
this is perfect happiness, and a truly Beatifick Vision.</p>
                     <p>But what concerns the Intellectual World in this <hi>Idea,</hi> and the
Orders or Natures that compose it, is not our present business to
pursue; We are to speak of the Corporeal Universe, whereof we
will make now a short and general Survey, as it lies under Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.
The Corporeal Universe, how immense soever it be,
and divided into innumerable Regions, may be consider'd all as one
System, made up of several subordinate Systems. And there is also
one immense design of Providence co-extended with it, that contains
all the fate, and all the revolutions of this great Mass. This, I say,
is made up of several subordinate Systems, involving one another,
and comprehending one another, in greater and greater Orbs and
Compositions; and the Aggregate of all these is that which we call
the <hi>Universe.</hi> But what the form of these Compositions is, and what
the Design of Providence that runs thorough them all, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
them all, this is unsearchable, not only to Humane Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
but even to Angels and Archangels.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore leaving those greater Systems and Compositions of
the Universe, as matter of our admiration, rather than of our
knowledge, There are two or three kinds of lesser Systems that are
visible to us, and bring us nearer to our subject, and nearer home.
<hi>That</hi> of a Fixt Star, single; <hi>That</hi> of a Fixt Star with its Planets,
and <hi>That</hi> of a single Planet, Primary or Secondary. These three
Systems we see and enjoy more or less. No doubt there are Fixt
Stars single, or that have no Planets about them, as our Sun hath;
nay, 'tis probable, that at first the whole Universe consisted only
of such; Globes of liquid Fire, with Spheres about them of pure
Light and Aether: Earths are but the dirt and skum of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and all things were pure as they came at first out of the
hands of God. But because we have nothing particular taught us,
either by the light of Nature or Revelation, concerning the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that governs these single Stars, of what use they are to Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
Beings, how animated by them, what diversity there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
those Aethereal Worlds, what Periods they have, what
Changes or Vicissitudes they are capable to undergo; because such
Inquiries would seem too remote, and carry us too far from our
subject, we leave these Heavenly Systems to the enjoyment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of higher and more noble Creatures.</p>
                     <p>The Sun, with all the Planets that move about him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon him, make a good sort of System; not considerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
if compar'd with the whole Universe, or some of the greater
Compositions in it, but in respect of us, the System of the Sun is
of vast extent; We cannot measure the greatness of his Kingdom,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:41970:124"/>
and his Dominion is without end. The distance from the highest
Planet to the nearest Fixt Star in the Firmament is unmeasurable,
and all this belongs to the Empire of the Sun; besides the several
Planets and their Orbs, which cast themselves closer about his Body,
that they may receive a warmer and stronger influence from him;
for by him they may be said to <hi>live</hi> and <hi>move.</hi> But those vast spaces
that lie beyond these Opake Bodies, are Regions of perpetual light;
One Planet may Eclipse the Sun to another, and one Hemisphere
of a Planet to the other Hemisphere makes night and darkness, but
nothing can Eclipse the Sun, or intercept the course of his light to
these remote Aethereal Regions; They are always luminous, and
always pure and serene. And if the worst and Planetary parts of
his Dominions be replenisht with Inhabitants, we cannot suppose
the better to lie as Desarts, uninjoy'd and uninhabited; his Subjects
then must be numerous, as well as his Dominions large; and in
both respects, this System of a Fixt Star, with its Planets (of which
kind we may imagine innumerable in the Universe, besides this of
the Sun, which is near and visible to us) is of a noble Character and
Order, being the habitation of Angels and glorified Spirits, as well
as of Mortal Men.</p>
                     <p>A Planetary System is the last and lowest; and of these, no
doubt, there is great variety, and great differences; not only of
Primary and Secondary, or of the principal Planet, and its Moons
or Attendants, but also amongst Planets of the same rank; for they
may differ both in their original constitution, and according to the
from and state they are under at present; of which sort of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
we have noted<note n="*" place="margin">Book 1. chap. last, p. 113, &amp;c.</note> some amongst our Planets, though they seem
to be all of much-what the same original constitution. Besides,
according to external circumstances, their distance, manner of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and posture to the Sun, which is the Heart of the whole Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem,
they become different in many things. And we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that those leading differences, though they seem little, draw
after them innumerable others, and so make a distinct face of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and a distinct World; which still shows the riches and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundity
of Divine Providence, and gives new matter of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
to those that take pleasure in studying the works and ways
of God. But leaving all other Planets or Planetary Systems to our
meditations only, we must particularly consider our own.</p>
                     <p>Having therefore made this general Survey of the great Universe,
run thorough the boundless Regions of it, and with much ado
found our way home to that little Planet where our concerns lie,
This Earth or Sublunary World, we must rest here as at the end
of our course. And having undertaken to give the general Theory
of this Earth, to conclude the present Treatise, we'll reflect upon
the whole work, and observe what progress we have hitherto
made in this Theory, and what remains to be treated of hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
This Earth, though it be a small part or particle of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
hath a distinct System of Providence belonging to it, or an
Order establisht by the Author of Nature for all its <hi>Phaenomena</hi>
(Natural or Moral) throughout the whole Period of its duration,
and every interval of it; for as there is nothing so great as to be
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:41970:124"/>
above the Divine care, so neither is there any thing so little as to
be below it. All the Changes of our World are fixt, How, or how
often to be destroy'd, and how renew'd; What different faces of
Nature, and what of Mankind, in every part of its Course; What
new Scenes to adorn the Stage, and what new parts to be acted;
What the Entrance, and what the Consummation of all. Neither
is there any sort of knowledge more proper, or of more importance
to us that are the Inhabitants of this Earth, than to understand
this its Natural and Sacred History, as I may so call it, both as to
what is past, and what is to come. And as those greater Volumes
and Compositions of the Universe are proportion'd to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of Angels and Superiour Beings, so these little Systems are
<hi>Compendium</hi>'s of the Divine Wisdom, more fitted to our capacity and
comprehension.</p>
                     <p>The Providence of the Earth, as of all other Systems consists of
two parts, Natural, and Sacred or Theological. I call that Sacred
or Theological that respects Religion, and the dispensations of it;
the government of the Rational World, or of Mankind whether
under the Light of Nature only, or of a Revelation; the method
and terms of their happiness and unhappiness in a Future Life;
The State, Oeconomy, and Conduct of this, with all the Mysteries
contain'd in it, we call Theological Providence; in the head where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
stands the Soul of the Blessed <hi>Messiah,</hi> who is Lord of both
Worlds, Intellectual and Material. When we call the other part
of Providence <hi>Natural,</hi> we use that word in a restrain'd sence, as
respecting only the Material World; and accordingly this part of
Providence others and superintends the state of the Earth, the
great Vicissitudes and Mutations of it; for we must not imagine,
but that these are under the Eye of Providence, as well as Humane
Affairs, or any revolutions of States and Empires. Now seeing
both in the Intellectual and Corporeal World there are certain Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods,
Fulnesses of Time, and fixt Seasons, either for some great
Catastrophe, or some great Instauration, 'Tis Providence that makes
a due harmony or Synchronism betwixt these two, and measures out
the concurrent fates of both Worlds, so as Nature may be always a
faithful minister of the Divine Pleasure, whether for rewards or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,
according as the state of Mankind may require. But The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ological
Providence not being the subject of this work, we shall only
observe, as we said before, what account we have hitherto given of
the Natural state of the Earth, and what remains to be handled in
another Treatise, and so conclude.</p>
                     <p>I did not think it necessary to carry the story and original of the
Earth, higher than the Chaos, as <hi>Zoroaster</hi> and <hi>Orpheus</hi> seem to
have done; but taking that for our Foundation, which Antiquity
Sacred and Profane doth suppose, and Natural Reason approve and
confirm, we have form'd the Earth from it. But when we say the
Earth rise from a Fluid Mass, it is not to be so crudely understood,
as if a rock of Marble, suppose, was fluid immediately before it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Marble; no, Things had a gradual progression from one form
to another, and came at length to those more permanent forms they
are now setled in: Stone was once Earth, and Earth was once Mud,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:41970:125"/>
and Mud was once sluid. And so other things may have another
kind of progression from fluidity; but all was once fluid, at least
all the exteriour Regions of this Earth. And even those Stones and
Rocks of Marble which we speak of, seem to confess they were once
soft or liquid, by those mixtures we find in them of Heterogeneous
Bodies, and those spots and Veins disperst thorough their substance;
for these things could not happen to them after they were hard and
impenetrable, in the form of Stone or Marble. And if we can soften
Rocks and Stones, and run them down into their first Liquors, as
these observations seem to do, we may easily believe that other Bodies
also that compose the Earth, were once in a Fluid Mass, which is that
we call a Chaos.</p>
                     <p>We therefore watch'd the motions of that Chaos, and the several
transformations of it, while it continued Fluid; and we found at
length what its first Concretion would be, and how it setled into the
form of an habitable Earth. But that form was very different from
the present form of the Earth, which is not immediately deducible
from a Chaos, by any known Laws of Nature, or by any Wit of
Man; as every one, that will have patience to examine it, may easily
be satisfied. That First Earth was of a smooth regular surface, as
the Concretions of Liquors are, before they are disturb'd or broken;
under that surface lay the Great Abyss, which was ready to swallow
up the World that hung over it, and about it, whensoever God
should give the command, and the Vault should break; and this
constitution of the Primaeval Earth gave occasion to the first Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strophe
of this World, when it perisht in a Deluge of Water. For
that Vault did break, as we have shown at large, and by the dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and fall of it, the Great Deep was thrown out of its bed, forc'd
upwards into the Air, and overflow'd, in that impetuous Commotion,
the highest tops of the Fragments of the ruin'd Earth, which now we
call its Mountains. And as this was the first great and fatal Period of
Nature; so upon the issue of this, and the return of the Waters into
their Chanels, the second face of Nature appear'd, or the present
broken form of the Earth, as it is <hi>Terraqueous, Mountainous,</hi> and
<hi>Cavernous.</hi> These things we have explain'd fully in the First Book,
and have thereby setled two great Points, given a rational account
of the <hi>Universal Deluge,</hi> and shown the Causes of the irregular form
of the present or <hi>Post-diluvian Earth.</hi> This being done, we have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
our selves, in the Second Book, to the description of the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeval
Earth,</hi> and the examination of its properties; and this hath
led us by an easie tract to the discovery of <hi>Paradise,</hi> and of the true
Notion and Mystery of it; which is not so much a spot of ground
where a fine Garden stood, as a course of Nature, or a peculiar
state of the Earth; <hi>Paradisiacal</hi> in many parts, but especially in one
Region of it; which place or Region we have also endeavour'd to
determine, though not so much from the Theory, as from the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages
of Antiquity, if you will take their judgment.</p>
                     <p>THUS much is finisht, and this contains the Natural Theory
of the Earth till this present time; for since the Deluge all things
have continued in the same state, or without any remarkable change.
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:41970:125"/>
We are next to enter upon new Matter and new Thoughts, and
not only so, but upon a Series of <hi>Things and Times to come,</hi> which is
to make the Second Part of this Theory. Dividing the duration
of the World into two parts, Past and Future, we have dispatch'd
the first and far greater part, and come better half of our way;
And if we make a stand here, and look both ways, backwards to
the Chaos, and the beginning of the World, and forwards to the
End and Consummation of all Things, though the first be a longer
prospect, yet there are as many general Changes and Revolutions
of Nature in the remaining part as have already happen'd; and in
the Evening of this long Day the Scenes will change faster, and be
more bright and illustrious. From the Creation to this Age the
Earth hath undergone but one Catastrophe, and Nature hath had
two different faces. The next Catastrophe is the CONFLA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GRATION,
to which a new face of Nature will accordingly
succeed,<note place="margin">

the first part of this Theory to Your
ROYAL UNCLE, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to offer the Second to Your
Majesty. This part of the Subject,
I hope, will be no less acceptable, for certainly 'tis of
no less importance. They both indeed agree in this,
That there is a WORLD made and destroy'd in
either Treatise. But we are more concern'd in what
is to come, than what is past. And as the former
Books represented to us the Rise and Fall of the First
World; so These give an account of the present Frame
of Nature labouring under the last Flames, and of
the Resurrection of it in the <hi>New Heavens</hi> and
<hi>New Earth:</hi> which, according to the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
we are to expect.</p>
                  <p>Cities that are burnt, are commonly rebuilt more
beautiful and regular than they were before. And
when this World is demolish'd by the last Fire, He
that undertakes to rear it up again, will supply the
<pb facs="tcp:41970:128"/>
defects, if there were any, of the former Fabrick.
This Theory supposes the present Earth to be little
better than an Heap of Ruines: where yet there is
room enough for Sea and Land, for Islands and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinents,
for several Countries and Dominions: But
when these are all melted down, and refin'd in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Fire, they will be cast into a better mould, and

                  <p>But, I fear, it may be thought no very proper ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress,
to shew Your Majesty a World laid in ashes,
where You have so great an interest Your Self, and
Such fair Dominions; and then, to recompence the
loss by giving a Reversion in a Future Earth. But if
that future Earth be a second Paradise, to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
for a Thousand Years; with Peace, Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
and constant health: An Inheritance there will
be an happy exchange for the best Crown in this World.</p>
                  <p>I confess, I could never perswade my self that the
Kingdom of Christ and of his Saints, which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
speaks of so frequently, was design'd to be upon
this present Earth. But however, upon all supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
They that have done some eminent Good in this
Life, will be sharers in the happiness of that State.
To humble the Oppressors, and rescue the Oppressed,
is a work of Generosity and Charity that cannot want
its reward; Yet, <hi>MADAM,</hi> They are the greatest
Benefactors to Mankind, that dispose the World to
become Vertuous: and by their example, Influence,
and Authority, retrieve that <hi>TRUTH</hi> and
<hi>JUSTICE,</hi> that have been lost, amongst men,
for many Ages. The School-Divines tell us, Those
<pb facs="tcp:41970:128"/>
that act or suffer great things for the Publick Good,
are distinguish'd in Heaven by a Circle of Gold about
their Heads. One would not willingly vouch for that:
but one may safely for what the Prophet says,
which is far greater: namely, that They shall shine
like Stars in the Firmament, <hi>that turn many to
Righteousness.</hi> Which is not to be understood, so
much, of the Conversion of single Souls, as of the
turning of Nations and People, the turning of the
World to Righteousness. They that lead on that
great and happy Work, shall be distinguish'd in Glory
from the rest of Mankind.</p>
                  <p>We are sensible, <hi>MADAM,</hi> from Your Great
Example, that Piety and Vertue seated upon a Throne,
draw many to imitation, whom ill Principles, or the
course of the World, might have led another way.
These are the best, as well as easiest Victories, that are
gain'd without Contest. And as Princes are the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents
of God upon Earth, so when their Majesty
is in Conjunction with Goodness, it hath a double Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of Divinity upon it: and we owe them a double
Tribute, of Fear and Love. Which, with constant

                  <head>PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> HAVE not much to say to the Reader
in this Preface to the Third Part of the
Theory: seeing it treats upon a Subject
own'd by all, and out of dispute: <hi>The
Conflagration of the World.</hi> The question
will be only about the bounds and limits of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration,
the Causes and the Manner of it. These I
have fix'd according to the truest measures I could
take from Scripture, and from Nature. I differ, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
from the common Sentiment in this, that, in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Philosophy, I suppose, that the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Earth will be a true Liquefaction or disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of it, as to the exteriour Region. And that this
lays a foundation for <hi>New Heavens</hi> and a <hi>New Earth;</hi>
which seems to me as plain a doctrine in Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
as the Conflagration it self.</p>
                  <p>I have endeavour'd to propose an intelligible way,
whereby the Earth may be consum'd by Fire. But if
any one can propose another, more probable and more
consistent, I will be the First Man that shall give him
thanks for his discovery. He that loves Truth for its
own sake, is willing to receive it from any hand: as he
that truly loves his Country, is glad of a Victory over
the Enemy, whether himself, or any other, has the glory
of it. I need not repeat here, what I have already said
upon several occasions, That 'tis the substance of this
Theory, whether in this part or in other parts, that I
mainly regard and depend upon. Being willing to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that many single explications and particularities
may be rectified, upon further thoughts and clearer
<pb facs="tcp:41970:130"/>
light. I know our best writings, in this life, are but
<hi>Essays,</hi> which we leave to Posterity to review and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect.</p>
                  <p>As to the Style, I always endeavour to express my
self, in a plain and perspicuous manner: that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
may not lose time, nor wait too long, to know my
meaning. To give an Attendant quick dispatch, is a
civility, whether you do his business or no. I would
not willingly give any one the trouble of reading a
period twice over, to know the sence of it: lest when
he comes to know it, he should not think it a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
for his pains. Whereas, on the contrary, if you
are easie to your Reader, he will certainly make you an
allowance for it, in his censure.</p>
                  <p>You must not think it strange however, that the
Author sometimes, in meditating upon this subject is
warm in his thoughts and expressions. For to see a
World perishing in Flames, Rocks melting, the Earth
trembling, and an Host of Angels in the clouds, one
must be very much a Stoick, to be a cold and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
Spectator of all this. And when we are mov'd
our selves, our words will have a tincture of those pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
which we feel. Besides, in moral reflections which
are design'd for use, there must be some heat, as well
as dry reason, to inspire this cold clod of clay, this dull
body of Earth, which we carry about with us; and
you must soften and pierce that crust, before you can
come at the Soul. But especially when things future
are to be represented, you cannot use too strong Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
if you would give them life, and make them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
present to the mind. Farewel.</p>

how this Earth can be set on
fire. With a general answer to that
difficulty. Two suppos'd Causes of

and how far it is Fatal. The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Causes and Materials of it, cast
into three ranks. First, such as
are Exteriour and visible upon Earth.
Where the Volcano's of this Earth,

This Treatise may, in both respects, hope
for a favourable reception amongst inquisitive per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;

of the greatest revolutions of Nature that are expected in future
Ages: and in the first place, of the <hi>Conflagration of the World.</hi> In
which Universal Calamity, when all Nature suffers, every Man's
particular concern must needs be involv'd.</p>
                     <p>We see with what eagerness Men pry into the Stars, to see if they
can read there the Death of a King, or the fall of an Empire: 'Tis
not the fate of any single Prince or Potentate, that we Calculate, but
of all Mankind: Nor of this or that particular Kingdom or Empire,
but of the whole Earth. Our enquiries must reach to that great
period of Nature, when all things are to be dissolv'd: both humane
affairs, and the Stage whereon they are acted. When the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
and the Earth will pass away, and the Elements melt with
fervent heat. We desire, if possible, to know what will be the face
of that Day, that great and terrible Day, when the Regions of the

But we must not leave the World in this disorder and confusion,
without examining what will be the Issue and consequences of it.
Whether this will be the End of all Things, and Nature by a sad

Prophecy, or Prognostication of things to come: as it hath been
hitherto an History of things pass'd; of such states and changes
as Nature hath already undergone. And if that account which
we have given of the Origin of the Earth, its first and Paradisia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
form, and the dissolution of it at the Universal Deluge, appear
fair and reasonable: The second dissolution by Fire, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation
of it out of a Second Chaos, I hope will be deduc'd
from as clear grounds and suppositions. And Scripture it self will
be a more visible Guide to us in these following parts of the Theory,
than it was in the former. In the mean time, I take occasion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
here again, as I have done heretofore, that neither this, nor
any other great revolutions of Nature, are brought to pass, by
Causes purely Natural, without the conduct of a particular Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
And 'tis the Sacred Books of Scripture that are the records
of this Providence, both as to times past, and times to come: as
to all the signal Changes either of the Natural World, or of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and the different Oeconomies of Religion. In which respects,
these Books, tho' they did not contain a Moral Law, would notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
be, as the most mystical, so also the most valuable Books
in the World.</p>
                     <p>This Treatise, you see, will consist of Two Parts: The former
whereof is to give an account of the <hi>Conflagration;</hi> and the latter,
of the <hi>New Heavens</hi> and <hi>New Earth</hi> following upon it; together
with the state of Mankind in those New Habitations. As to the
Conflagration, we first enquire, what the Antients thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the present frame of this World; whether it was to perish
or no: whether to be destroyed, or to stand eternally in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture.
Then in what manner they thought it would be destroy'd;
by what force or violence; whether by Fire or other ways. And
with these opinions of the Antients we will compare the doctrine
of the Prophets and Apostles, to discover and confirm the truth of
them. In the second place, We will examine what Calculations
or Conjectures have been made concerning the time of this great
Catastrophe, or of the end of this World. Whether that period be
defineable or no: and whether by Natural Arguments, or by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies.
Thirdly, We will consider the Signs of the approaching
Conflagration: Whether such as will be in Nature, or in the
state of Humane Affairs; but especially such as are taken notice of
and recorded in Scripture. Fourthly, Which is the principal point,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41970:133"/>
and yet that wherein the Ancients have been most silent, <hi>What
Causes</hi> there are in Nature, what preparations, for this Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Where are the Seeds of this Universal Fire, or fewel suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for the nourishing of it? Lastly, In what order and by what
degrees the Conflagration will proceed: In what manner the frame
of the Earth will be dissolv'd: and what will be the dreadful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of a <hi>Burning World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These heads are set down more fully in the Argument of each
Chapter; and seem to be sufficient for the explication of this whole
matter: Taking in some additional discourses, which, in pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these heads, enter of their own accord, and make the work more
even and entire. In the Second Part, we restore the World that
we had destroy'd: Build New Heavens and a New Earth, <hi>wherein
Righteousness shall dwell.</hi> Establish that new order of things, which
is so often celebrated by the Prophets: A Kingdom of Peace and
of Justice, where the Enemy of Mankind shall be bound, and the
Prince of Peace shall rule. A Paradise without a Serpent, and a
Tree of Knowledge, not to wound, but to heal the Nations. Where
will be neither <hi>curse,</hi> nor <hi>pain,</hi> nor <hi>death,</hi> nor <hi>disease.</hi> Where all
things are new, all things are more perfect, both the World it self,
and its Inhabitants. Where the First-born from the Dead, have the
First-fruits of glory.</p>
                     <p>We dote upon this present World, and the enjoyments of it:
and 'tis not without pain, and fear, and reluctancy, that we are
torn from them: as if our hopes lay all within the compass of this
life. Yet, I know not by what good fate, my thoughts have been
always fixt upon things to come, more than upon things present.
These I know, by certain experience, to be but trifles; and if there
be nothing more considerable to come, the whole being of Man is
no better than a trifle. But there is room enough before us in that
we call <hi>Eternity,</hi> for great and Noble Scenes: and the Mind of Man
feels it self lessen'd and straiten'd in this low and narrow state:
wishes and waits to see something greater. And if it could discern
another World a coming, on this side Eternal Life; a beginning
Glory, the best that Earth can bear, It would be a kind of Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality

is dissolv'd, where we shall act next, and what parts. What
Saints and Hero's, if I may so say, will appear upon that Stage;
and with what luster and excellency. How easie would it be, under
a view of these futurities, to despise the little pomps and honours,
and the momentany pleasures of a Mortal Life. But I proceed to

                        </gap>Tis not to be imagin'd that we
understand this of the <hi>Great Universe;</hi> Sun, Moon, and Stars, and
the Highest Heavens: as if these were to perish or be destroy'd
some few years hence, whether by Fire or any other way. This
Question is only to be understood of the <hi>Sublunary World,</hi> of this
Earth and its Furniture; which had its original about six thousand
years ago, according to the History of <hi>Moses;</hi> and hath once al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

the Abyss issuing forth,<note place="margin">Gen. 7. 11. Iob 38. 8.</note> as out of a womb, overflow'd all the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable

                        </gap>what
in the same manner. But the celestial Regions, where the Stars and
Angels inhabit, are not concern'd in this fate: Those are not made
of combustible matter, nor, if they were, cou'd our flames reach
them. Possibly those Bodies may have changes and revolutions pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to themselves, but in ways unknown to us, and after long
and unknown periods of time. Therefore when we speak of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he
Conflagration of the World, These have no concern in the question;
nor any other part of the Universe, than the Earth and its depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances.
As will evidently appear when we come to explain the
Manner and Causes of the Conflagration.</p>
                     <p>And as this Conflagration can extend no further than to the
Earth and its Elements, so neither can it destroy the matter of the
Earth; but only the form and fashion of it, as it is an habitable
World. Neither Fire, nor any other Natural Agent can destroy
Matter, that is, reduce it to nothing: It may alter the modes and
qualities of it, but the substance will always remain. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
the Apostle, when he speaks of the mutability of this World,
says only,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 31.</note> 
                        <hi>The figure</hi> or fashion of <hi>this World passes away.</hi> This
structure of the Earth and disposition of the Elements: And all the
<hi>works</hi> of the Earth,<note place="margin">2 Epist. 3.</note> as S. <hi>Peter</hi> says; All its natural productions, and
all the works of art or humane industry; these will perish, melted
or torn in pieces by the Fire; but without an annihilation of the
Matter, any more than in the former Deluge. And this will be
further prov'd and illustrated in the beginning of the following
Book.</p>
                     <p>The question being thus stated, we are next to consider the sense
of Antiquity upon these two Points: First, Whether this Sublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41970:134"/>
World is mutable and perishable. Secondly, By the force and
action of what causes, and in what manner it will perish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether
by Fire or otherwise. <hi>Aristotle</hi> is very irregular in his Sentiments
about the state of the World; He allows it neither beginning not
ending<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rise nor fall, but wou'd have it eternal and immu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>able.
And this he understand not only of the Great Universe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but of
this Sublunary World, this Earth which we inhabit: wherein he
will not admit there ever have been or over will be either general
Deluges or Conflagrations. And as if he was ambitious to be
thought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> singular in his opinion about the Eternity of the World,
He says, <hi>All</hi> the <hi>Ancients</hi> before him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> gave some beginning or origin
to the World: But were not indeed so unanimous as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

fate: Some believing it immutable, or as the Philosophers call it,
incorruptible; Others, That it had its fatal times and Periods, as
lesser Bodies have; and a term of age prefixt to it, by Providence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </p>
                     <p>But before we examine this Point any further, it will be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to reflect upon that which we noted before, an ambiguity in the
use of the word <hi>World,</hi> which gives frequent occasion of mistakes in
reading the Ancients: when that which they speak of the <hi>great Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,</hi>
we apply to the <hi>Sublunary World:</hi> or on the contrary, what
they speak of this Earth, we extend to the whole Universe. And
if some of them, besides <hi>Aristotle,</hi> made the World incorruptible,
they might mean that of the <hi>Great Universe,</hi> which they thought
would never be dissolv'd or perish as to its Mass and bulk: But
single parts and points of it (and our Earth is no more) may be
variously transform'd, and made habitable and unhabitable, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to certain periods of time, without any pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>udi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d to their
Philosophy. So <hi>Plato,</hi> for instance, thinks this World will have no
Dissolution: for, being a work so beautiful and noble, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God, he says, will always preserve it. It is most reasonable to
understand this of the Great Universe; for, in our Earth, <hi>Plato</hi> himself
admits such dissolutions, as are made by general Delug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagrations;
and we contend for no other. So likewise in other
Authors, if they speak of the immortality of the World, you must
observe what World they apply it to: and whether to the Matter
or the Form of it: and if you remember that our Discourse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
only upon the Sublunary World, and the Dissolution of its
form, you will find little in antiquity contrary to this doctrine. I
always except <hi>Aristotle,</hi> (who allow'd of no Providence in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
World) and some <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> falsly so call'd, being either
fictitious Authors, or Apostates from the doctrine of their Master.
These being excepted, upon a view of the rest, you will find very
few dissenters from this general doctrine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plato</hi>'s argument against the dissolution of the World, from the
goodness and wisdom of God, wou'd not be altogether unreasonable,
tho' apply'd to this Earth, if it was so to be dissolv'd, as never to
be restor'd again. But we expect <hi>New Heavens</hi> and a <hi>New Earth</hi>
upon the dissolution of these: Better in all respects more commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
and more beautiful. And the several perfections of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature, Wisdom, Power, Goodness, Justice, Sanctity, cannot
be so well display'd and exemplifi'd in any one single state of Nature,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41970:135"/>
as in a succession of States: fitted to receive one another according
to the dispositions of the Moral World, and the order of Divine
Providence. Wherefore <hi>Plato</hi>'s argument from the Divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
all things consider'd, doth rather prove a succession of Worlds,
than that one single World should remain the same throughout all
ages, without change or variation. Next to the <hi>Platonists,</hi> the
<hi>Stoicks</hi> were most considerable in matters relating to Morality and
Providence. And their opinion, in this case, is well known; they
being lookt upon by the Moderns, as the principal authors of the
doctrine of the <hi>Conflagration.</hi> Nor is it less known that the School
of <hi>Democra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>us</hi> and <hi>Epicurus</hi> made all their Worlds subject to dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and by a new concourse of Atomes restor'd them again.
Lastly, The <hi>Ionick</hi> Philosophers, who had <hi>Thales</hi> for their Master,
and were the first Naturalists amongst the <hi>Greeks,</hi> taught the same
doctrine. We have indeed but an imperfect account left us of this
Sect, and 'tis great pity; for as it was one of the most ancient, so
it seems to have been one of the most considerable amongst the
<hi>Greeks</hi> for Natural Philosophy. In those remains which <hi>Diogenes
Laertius</hi> hath preserv'd, of <hi>Anaxagoras, Anaximenes, Archelaus, &amp;c.</hi>
All great men in their time, we find that they treated much of the
Origin of the World, and had many extraordinary Notions about
it, which come lame and defective to us. The doctrine of their
Founder, <hi>Thales,</hi> which made all things to consist of Water, seems
to have a great resemblance to the doctrine of <hi>Moses</hi> and S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 2. Pet. 2. 5.</note>
about the constitution of the First Heavens and Earth. But there
is little in <hi>Laertius</hi> what their opinion was about the Dissolution of
the World.<note place="margin">Ecl. Phys. l. 1. c. 24.</note> Other Authors inform us more of that. <hi>Stobaeus</hi> joyns
them with <hi>Leucippus</hi> and the <hi>Epicureans: Simplicius</hi> with <hi>Heracli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
and the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> in this doctrine about the corruptibility of the
World. So that all the Schools of the Greek Philosophers, as we
noted before, were unanimous in this point, excepting the <hi>Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

whose Master, <hi>Aristotle,</hi> had neither modesty enough to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the doctrine of his Predecessors, nor wit enough to invent any
thing better.</p>
                     <p>Besides these Sects of Philosophers, there were Theologers amongst

                           </gap>.</note> Such
were <hi>Orpheus</hi> and his followers, who had more of the Ancient
Oriental Learning than the succeeding Philosophers. But they writ
their Philosophy, or Theology rather, Mythologically and Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically,
in Parables and Allegories, that needed an interpretation.
All these Theologers supposed the Earth to rise from a Chaos:
and as they said that <hi>Love</hi> was the principle at first, that united
the loose and severed Elements, and formed them into an Habitable
World: So they supposed that if <hi>Strife</hi> or <hi>Contention</hi> prevail'd,
that would again dissolve and disunite them, and reduce things
into a Chaos: Such as the Earth will be in, upon the Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And it further appears, that both these Orders of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Greece</hi> suppos'd this present frame of Nature might perish,
by their doctrine of <hi>Periodical Revolutions,</hi> or of the Renovation of
the World after certain periods of time: which was a doctrine
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41970:135"/>
common amongst the learned <hi>Greeks,</hi> and received by them from
the ancient Barbarick Nations. As will appear more at large in the
following Book, <hi>Ch.</hi> 3. In the mean time we may observe that <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi>
in answering <hi>Celsus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lib. 5.</note> about the point of the Resurrection, tells
him, That Doctrine ought not to appear so strange or ridiculous to
him, seeing their own Authors did believe and teach the <hi>Renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the World,</hi> after certain Ages or Periods. And the truth is,
this Renovation of the World, rightly stated, is the same thing with
the <hi>First Resurrection</hi> of the Christians. And as to the Second and
general Resurrection, when the Righteous shall have Celestial Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
'tis well known that the <hi>Platonists</hi> and <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> cloath'd
the Soul with a Celestial Body, or, in their Language, an Ethereal
Vehicle, as her last Beatitude or Glorification. So that <hi>Origen</hi> might
very justly tell his adversary, he had no reason to ridicule the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Doctrine of the Resurrection, seeing their own Authors had
the main strokes of it in their Traditionary Learning.</p>
                     <p>I will only add one remark more, before we leave this Subject,
to prevent a mistake in the word <hi>Immortal</hi> or <hi>Immortality,</hi> when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to the World. As I told you before, the equivocation that
was in that term <hi>World,</hi> it being us'd sometimes for the whole
Universe, sometimes for this inferiour part of it where we live;
so likewise we must observe, that when this Inferiour World is
said to be <hi>Immortal,</hi> by the Philosophers, as sometimes it is, that
commonly is not meant of any single state of Nature, or any single
World, but of a succession of Worlds, consequent one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
As a family may be said immortal, not in any single person,
but in a succession of Heirs. So as, many times, when the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
mention the immortality of the World, they do not thereby
exclude the Dissolution or Renovation of it: but suppose a vicissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
or series of World succeeding one another. This observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is not mine, but was long since made by <hi>Simplicius, Stobaeus,</hi>
and others, who tell us in what sense some of those Philosophers
who allowed the World to be perishable, did yet affirm it to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal:
namely, by successive renovations.</p>
                     <p>Thus much is sufficient to shew the sence and judgment of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
as to the chargeableness or perpetuity of the World. But
Ancient Learning is like Ancient Medals, more esteemed for their
rarity, than their real use; unless the Authority of a Prince make
them currant. So neither will these Testimonies be of any great
effect, unless they be made good and valuable by the Authority of
Scripture. We must therefore add the Testimonies of the Prophets
and Apostles to these of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> that the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
may be full and undeniable. That the Heavens and the
Earth will perish or be chang'd into another form, is, sometimes,
plainly exprest, sometimes suppos'd and alluded to in Scripture.
The Prophet <hi>David</hi>'s testimony is express, both for the beginning
and ending of the World:<note place="margin">Ver. 25, 26, 27.</note> in the 102. <hi>Psalm, Of old hast thou laid
the foundation of the Earth, and the heavens are the work of thy hands.
They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old
like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be
changed. But thou art the same, and thy Years shall have no end.</hi>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:41970:136"/>
The Prophet <hi>Esay</hi>'s testimony is no less express,<note place="margin">Ch. 51. 6.</note> to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
<hi>Lift up your Eyes to the heavens, and look upon the Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath:
for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the Earth shall
was old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like
manner.</hi> These Texts are plain and explicite; and in allusion to
this day of the Lord, and this destruction of the World, the same
Prophet often useth phrases that relate to it.<note place="margin">Isa. 13. 13. c. 24. 18, 19. c. 34. 4.</note> As the <hi>Concussion of the
Heavens and the Earth.</hi> The <hi>shaking of the foundations of the World.</hi>
The <hi>dissolution of the Host of Heaven.</hi> And our Sacred Writers have
expressions of the like force, and relating to the same effect. As the
<hi>Hills melting like wax, at the presence of the Lord:</hi> Psal. 97. 5. Shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
<hi>once more</hi> all the parts of the Creation: <hi>Hagg. 2. 6. Overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the mountains, and making the pillars of the Earth to tremble:</hi> Job
9. 5, 6. If you reflect upon the explication given of the Deluge in
the first part of this Theory, and attend to the manner of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration,
as it will be explain'd in the sequel of this Discourse, you
will see the justness and fitness of these expressions: That they are
not Poetical Hyperboles, or random expressions, of great and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
things in general, but a true account of what hath been, or
will be, at that great day of the Lord. 'Tis true, the Prophets some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
use such-like expressions figuratively, for commotions in States
and Kingdoms, but that is only by way of Metaphor and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation;
the true basis they stand upon, is that ruine, overthrow,
and dissolution of the Natural World, which was once at the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge,
and will be again, after another manner, at the general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration.</p>
                     <p>As to the New Testament, our Saviour says, <hi>Heaven and Earth
shall pass away, but his words shall not pass away,</hi> Matth. 24. 35. S. <hi>Paul</hi>
says, the <hi>Scheme of this World;</hi> the fashion, form, and composition
of it, <hi>passeth away, 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 31. And when mention is made of <hi>New
Heavens</hi> and a <hi>New Earth,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Isa. 65. 17 &amp; 66. 22. Rev. 21. 1. 2. Pet. 3. 13.</note> which both the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> and the
Apostles S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> mention, 'tis plainly imply'd that the
old ones will be dissolv'd. The same thing is also imply'd, when
our Saviour speaks of a <hi>Renascency</hi> or <hi>Regeneration, Matt.</hi> 19. 28.
and S. <hi>Peter,</hi> of a <hi>Restitution</hi> of all things, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 21. For what is
now, must be abolish'd, before any former order of things can be
restor'd or reduc'd. In a word, If there was nothing in Scripture
concerning this subject, but that discourse of S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, in his <hi>2d.</hi>
Epistle and <hi>3d.</hi> Chapter, concerning the triple order and succession
of the Heavens and the Earth; past, present, and to come; that
alone wou'd be a conviction and demonstration to me, that this
present World will be dissolv'd.</p>
                     <p>You will say, it may be, in the last place, we want still the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Natural Reason and Philosophy to make the evidence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat.
I answer, 'tis enough, if They be silent, and have nothing to
say to the contrary. Here are witnesses, Humane and Divine, and
if none appear against them, we have no reason to refuse their testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
or to distrust it. Philosophy will very readily yield to this
Doctrine, that All material compositions are dissolvable: and she
will not wonder to see that die, which she had seen born; I mean,
this Terrestrial World. She stood upon the Chaos, and see it row<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it self, with difficulty and after many struglings, into the form of
an habitable Earth: And that form she see broken down again at
the Deluge; and can as little hope or expect now, as then, that it
should be everlasting and immutable. There would be nothing great
or considerable in this Inferiour World, if there were not such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions
of Nature. The Seasons of the Year, and the fresh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
of the Spring,<note place="margin">Annus Magnus.</note> are pretty in their way; But when the <hi>Great
Year</hi> comes about, with a new order of all things, in the Heavens
and on the Earth, and a new dress of Nature throughout all her
Regions, far more goodly and beautiful than the fairest Spring;
This gives a new Life to the Creation, and shows the greatness of
its Author. Besides, These Fatal Catastrophes are always a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to degenerate Mankind, that are overwhelm'd in the ruines of
these perishing Worlds. And to make Nature her self execute the
Divine Vengeance against Rebellious Creatures, argues both the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and Wisdom of that Providence that governs all things here below.
These things Reason and Philosophy approve of; but if you further
require that they should shew a <hi>Necessity</hi> of this future destruction
of the World, from <hi>Natural Causes,</hi> with the time and all other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of this effect; your demands are unreasonable, seeing these
things do not depend solely upon Nature. But if you will content
your self to know what dispositions there are in Nature towards such
a change, how it may begin, proceed, and be consummate, under
the conduct of Providence, be pleased to read the following Discourse
for your further satisfaction.</p>

                  <div n="3" type="chapter">
                     <head>CHAP. III. That the World will be destroy'd by Fire, is the doctrine of
the Ancients, especially of the Stoicks. That the same
doctrine is more ancient than the Greeks, and deriv'd
from the Barbarick Philosophy, and That probably from
Noah; the Father of all Traditionary Learning. The
same doctrine expresly authoriz'd by Revelation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll'd
into the Sacred Canon.</head>
                     <p>THAT the present World, or the present frame of Nature, will
be destroy'd, we have already shewn. In what manner this
destruction will be, by what force or what kind of fate, must be our
next enquiry. The Philosophers have always spoken of <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
those two unruly Elements, as the only Causes that can destroy
the World, and work our ruine; and accordingly they say, all the
great and fatal Revolutions of Nature, either past or to come, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the violence of these Two; when they get the mastery,
and overwhelm all the rest and the whole Earth, in a Deluge or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration.
But as they make these Two the Destroying Elements, so
they also make them the Purifying Elements. And accordingly in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41970:137"/>
their Lustrations, or their rites and ceremonies for purging sin, Fire
and Water were chiefly made use of, both amongst the <hi>Romans, Greeks</hi>
and <hi>Barbarians.</hi> And when these Elements over run the World, it
is not, they say, for a final destruction of it, but to purge Mankind
and Nature from their impurities. As for purgation by Fire and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the stile of our Sacred Writings does very much accommodate
it self to that sence; and the Holy Ghost, who is the great Purifier
of Souls, is compared in his operation upon us, and in our regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,<note place="margin">1 Ep. 3. 21.</note>
to fire or water. And as for the external world, S. <hi>Peter</hi>
makes the Flood to have been a kind of <hi>Baptziing</hi> or renovation of
the World.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 13.</note> And S. <hi>Paul</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> make the last
Fire,<note place="margin">Mal. 3. 2, 3.</note> to be a purging and re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ire. But to return to the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Stoicks</hi> especially, of all other Sects amongst the <hi>Greeks,</hi> have
preserved the doctrine of the Conflagration, and made it a consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
part of their Philosophy, and almost a character of their order.
This is a thing so well known that I need not use any Citations to
prove it. But they cannot pretend to have been the first Authors of
it neither. For, besides that amongst the <hi>Greeks</hi> themselves, <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clitus</hi>
and <hi>Empedocles,</hi> more ancient than <hi>Zeno,</hi> the Master of the
<hi>Stoicks,</hi> taught this doctrine, 'tis plainly a branch of the Barbarick
Philosophy, and taken from thence by the <hi>Greeks.</hi> For it is well
known that the most ancient and mystick Learning amongst the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> was not originally their own, but borrowed of the more
Eastern Nations, by <hi>Orpheus, Pythagoras, Plato,</hi> and many more:
who travel'd thither, and traded with the Priests for knowledge and
Philosophy; and when they got a competent stock, returned home,
and set up a School, or a Sect, to instruct their Country-men. But
before we pass to the Eastern Nations, let us, if you please, compare
the <hi>Roman</hi> Philosophy upon this subject, with that of the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> were a great people, that made a shew of Learning,
but had little in reality, more than Words and Rhetorick. Their
curiosity or emulation in Philosophical Studies was so little, that it
did not make different Sects and Schools amongst them, as amongst
the <hi>Greeks.</hi> I remember no Philosophers they had but such as <hi>Tully,
Seneca,</hi> and some of their Poets. And of these <hi>Lucretius, Lucan</hi> and
<hi>Ovid,</hi> have spoken openly of the Conflagration. <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Verses are
well known,

                     </p>
                     <p>We see <hi>Tully</hi>'s sence upon this matter in <hi>Scipio</hi>'s <hi>Dream.</hi> When
the old man speaks to his Nephew <hi>Africanus,</hi> and shews him from
the clouds, this spot of Earth, where we live; He tells him, tho' our
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41970:137"/>
actions should be great, and fortune favour them with success, yet
there wou'd be no room for any lasting glory in this World; for the
World it self is transient and fugitive. And a Deluge or a Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration,
which necessarily happen after certain periods of time, sweep
away all records of humane actions. As for <hi>Seneca,</hi> he being a profest
<hi>Stoick,</hi> we need not doubt of his opinion in this point. We may add
here, if you please, the <hi>Sibylline verses,</hi> which were kept with great
Religion, in the Capitol at <hi>Rome,</hi> and consulted with much ceremony
upon solemn occasions. These <hi>Sibyls</hi> were the Prophetesses of the
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> and tho' their Writings now have many spurious additions,
yet none doubt but that the Conflagration of the World was one
of their original Prophecies.</p>
                     <p>Let us now proceed to the Eastern Nations. As the <hi>Romans</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiev'd
the small skill they had in the Sciences, from the <hi>Greeks;</hi>
so the <hi>Greeks</hi> receiv'd their chief Mystick Learning from the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians:</hi>
that is, from the <hi>Aegyptians, Persians, Phoenicians,</hi> and other
Eastern Nations: For 'tis not only the Western or Northern people,
that they called <hi>Barbarians,</hi> but indeed all Nations besides themselves.
For that is commonly the vanity of great Empires, to uncivilize in a
manner all the rest of the World; and to account all those People
<hi>Barbarous,</hi> that are not subject to their dominion. These however,
whom they call'd so, were the most ancient People, and had the first
Learning that was ever heard of after the Flood. And amongst these,
the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> were as famous as any: whose Sentiment in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
of the Conflagration is well known. For <hi>Plato,</hi> who liv'd
amongst them several years, tell us in his <hi>Timaeus,</hi> that it was the
doctrine of their Priests, that the fatal Catastrophes of the World
were by <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Water.</hi> In like manner the <hi>Persians</hi> made their
beloved God, <hi>Fire,</hi> at length to consume all things that are capable
of being consum'd. For that is said to have been the doctrine of
<hi>Hydaspes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iust. Mar. Apol. 2.</note> one of their great <hi>Magi</hi> or Wise Men. As to the <hi>Phoeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi>
I suspect very much that the Stoicks had their Philosophy from
them, and amongst other things the Conflagration. We shall take
notice of that hereafter.</p>
                     <p>But to comprehend the <hi>Arabians</hi> also, and <hi>Indians,</hi> give me leave
to reflect a little upon the story of the <hi>Phoenix.</hi> A story well known,
and related by some ancient Authors, and is in short this. The <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix,</hi>
they say, is a Bird in <hi>Arabia, India,</hi> and those Eastern parts,
single in her kind, never more than one at a time, and very long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liv'd:
appearing only at the expiration of the <hi>Great Year,</hi> as they
call it: And then she makes her self a Nest of Spices, which being
set on fire by the Sun, or some other secret power, she hovers upon
it, and consumes her self in the flames. But, which is most won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful,
out of these ashes riseth a second <hi>Phoenix;</hi> so that it is not so
much a death as a renovation. I do not doubt but the story is a
fable, as to any such kind of Bird, single in her species, living and
dying, and reviving in that manner: But 'tis an Apologue, or a
Fable with an interpretation, and was intended as an Emblem of the
World: which, after a long age, will be consum'd in the last fire:
and from its ashes or remains will arise another World, or a new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
Heavens and Earth. This, I think, is the true mystery of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41970:138"/>
the <hi>Phoenix,</hi> under which Symbol the Eastern Nations preserv'd the
doctrine of the Conflagration and Renovation of the World.
They tell somewhat a like story of the Eagle, soaring a-loft so near
the Sun, that by his warmth and enlivening rays, she renews her
age and becomes young again. To this the <hi>Psalmist</hi> is thought to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude,
Psal. 103. 5. <hi>Thy Youth shall be renew'd like the Eagles:</hi> which
the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrast renders, <hi>In mundo venturo renovabis, sicut A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilae,
juventutem tuam.</hi> These things to me seem plainly to be Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical,
representing that World to come, which the Paraphrast men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and the firing of this. And this is after the manner of the
Eastern Wisdom; which always lov'd to go fine, cleath'd in figures
and fancies.</p>
                     <p>And not only the Eastern <hi>Barbarians,</hi> but the Northern and We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
also, had this doctrine of the Conflagration amongst them.
The <hi>Scythians,</hi> in their dispute with the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> about Antiquity,
argue upon both suppositions, of Fire or Water, destroying the Last
World, or beginning This. And in the West, the <hi>Celts,</hi> the most
Ancient People there, had the same Tradition; for the <hi>Druids,</hi> who
were their Priests and Philosophers, deriv'd, not from the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
but of the old race of Wise Men, that had their Learning traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
and, as it were, hereditary from the First Ages: These, as
<hi>Strabo</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">L. 4.</note> gave the World a kind of Immortality by repeated re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations;
and the principle that destroy'd it, according to them,
was always Fire or Water. I had forgot to mention in this List,
the <hi>Chaldeans:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Nat. Quaest. 3. c. 29.</note> whose opinion we have from <hi>Berosus</hi> in <hi>Seneca.</hi>
They did not only teach the Conflagration, but also fixt it to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
period of time, when there should happen a great Conjunction
of the Planets in <hi>Cancer.</hi> Lastly, We may add, to close the account,
the Modern <hi>Indian</hi> Philosophers, the reliques of the old <hi>Bragmans;</hi>
These,<note place="margin">L. 16. Hist. Ind.</note> as <hi>Maffeus</hi> tells us, declare, that the World will be renew'd,
after an Universal Conflagration.</p>
                     <p>You see of what extent and universality throughout all Nations,
this doctrine of the Conflagration hath been. Let us now consider
what defects or excesses there are in these ancient opinions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this fate of the World, and how they may be rectified:
That we may admit them no further into our belief, than they are
warranted by reason, or by the authority of Christian Religion.
The first fault they seem to have committed about this point, is this,
That they made these revolutions and renovations of Nature, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite
or endless: as if there would be such a succession of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luges
and Conflagrations to all eternity. This, the <hi>Stoicks</hi> seem
plainly to have asserted, as appears from <hi>Numenius, Philo, Simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
and others,<note place="margin">Epist. 60.</note> S. <hi>Ierome</hi> imputes this Opinion also to <hi>Origen:</hi> but
he does not always hit the ture sence of that Father, or is not fair
and just in the representation of it. Whosoever held this Opinion,
'tis a manifest errour, and may be easily rectified by the Christian
Revelation; which teaches us plainly, that there is a final period
and consummation of all things that belong to this Sublunary or
Terrestrial World. When the <hi>Kingdom shall be deliver'd up to the
Father:</hi> and Time shall be no more.</p>

Another Errour they committed in this doctrine, is, the Identity,
or sameness, if I may so say, of the Worlds succeeding one another.
They are made indeed of the same Lump of Matter, but they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
them to return also in the same Form. And, which is worse,
that there would be the same face of humane affairs; The same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and the same actions over again; So as the Second World would
be but a bare repetition of the former, without any variety or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity.
Such a revolution is commonly call'd the <hi>Platonick Year<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
A period, when all things return to the same posture they had some
thousands of years before; As a Play acted over again, upon the
same Stage, and to the Same Auditory. This is a groundless and
injudicious supposition. For, whether we consider the Nature of
things, The Earth after a dissolution, by Fire or by Water, could
not return into the same form and fashion it had before; Or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we consider Providence, it would no ways suit with the Divine
Wisdom and Justice to bring upon the stage again those very Scenes,
and that very course of humane affairs, which it had so lately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
and destroy'd. We may be assured therefore, that, upon
the dissolution of a World, a new order of things, both as to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Providence, always appears: And what that new order
will be, in both respects, after the <hi>Conflagration,</hi> I hope we shall,
in the following Book, give a satisfactory account.</p>
                     <p>These are the Opinions, true or false, of the Ancients; and chiefly
of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> concerning the mystery of the Conflagration. It will
not be improper to enquire in the last place, how the <hi>Stoicks</hi> came
by this doctrine: whether it was their discovery and invention,
or from whom they learned it. That it was not their own inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we have given sufficient ground to believe, by shewing the
antiquity of it beyond the times of the <hi>Stoicks.</hi> Besides, what a man
invents himself, he can give the reasons and causes of it, as things
upon which he founded his invention: But the <hi>Stoicks</hi> do not this,
but according to the ancient traditional way, deliver the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
without proof or premisses. We nam'd <hi>Heraclitus</hi> and <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docles</hi>
amongst the <hi>Greeks</hi> to have taught this doctrine before the
<hi>Stoicks:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">De defec. Orac.</note> And, according to <hi>Plutarch, Hesiod</hi> and <hi>Hesiod</hi> and <hi>Orpheus,</hi> authors
of the highest antiquity, sung of this last Fire, in their Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick
Poetry. But I suspect the <hi>Stoicks</hi> had this doctrine from the
<hi>Phoenicians;</hi> for if we enquire into the original of that Sect, we
shall find that their Founder <hi>Zeno,</hi> was a Barbarian or Semi-barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,
deriv'd from the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> as <hi>Laertius</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> give an
account of him. And the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> had a great share in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental
knowledge, as we see by <hi>Sanchoniathon</hi>'s remains in <hi>Eusebius.</hi>
And by their mystical Books which <hi>Suidas</hi> mentions, from whence
<hi>Pherecydes, Pythagoras</hi> his Master, had his learning. We may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
reasonably presume that it might be from his Country-men,
the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> that <hi>Zeno</hi> had the doctrine of the <hi>Conflagration.</hi> Not
that he brought it first into <hi>Greece,</hi> but strongly reviv'd it, and
made it almost peculiar to his Sect.</p>
                     <p>So much for the <hi>Stoicks</hi> in particular, and the <hi>Greeks</hi> in general.
We have also, you see, trac'd these Opinions higher, to the first
Barbarick Philosophers: who were the first race of Philosophers
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41970:139"/>
after the Flood. But <hi>Iosephus</hi> tells a formal story of Pillars set up
by <hi>Seth,</hi> before the Flood; implying the foreknowledge of this
Fiery destruction of the World, even from the beginning of it. His
words are to this effect, give what credit to them you think fit.
<hi>Seth and his fellow students having found out the knowledge of the caelesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Bodies,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">L. 1. c. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>and the order and disposition of the Universe; and having also
receiv'd from</hi> Adam <hi>a Prophecy, that the World should have a double de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
one by Water, another by Fire; To preserve and transmit their
knowledge, in either case, to posterity, They raised two Pillars, one of
Brick, another of Stone, and ingrav'd upon them their Philosophy and
inventions. And one of these pillars,</hi> the Author says, <hi>was standing in</hi>
Syria,<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>even to his time.</hi> I do not press the belief of this story; there
being nothing, that I know of, in Antiquity Sacred or prophane,
that gives a joynt testimony with it. And those that set up these
Pillars, do not seem to me to have understood the Nature of the
Deluge or <hi>Conflagration;</hi> if they thought a Pillar, either of Brick or
Stone, would be secure, in those great dissolutions of the Earth.
But we have pursued this doctrine high enough without the help
of these ante-diluvian Antiquities: Namely, to the earliest people
and the first appearances of Wisdom after the Flood. So that, I
think, we may justly look upon it as the doctrine of <hi>Noah,</hi> and of
his immediate posterity. And as that is the highest source of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the present World; so we should endeavour to carry our
Philosophical Traditions to that Original: for I cannot perswade my
self but that they had amongst them, even in those early days, the
main strokes or conclusions of the best Philosophy: or, if I may so
say, a form of sound doctrine concerning Nature and Providence.
Of which matter, if you will allow me a short digression, I will
speak my thoughts in a few words.</p>
                     <p>In those First Ages of the World after the Flood, when <hi>Noah</hi> and
his Children peopled the Earth again, as he gave them Precepts of
Morality and Piety for the conduct of their Manners; which are
usually call'd <hi>Praecepta Noachidarum,</hi> the <hi>Precepts</hi> of <hi>Noah,</hi> frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mention'd both by the Jews and Christians: So also he deliver'd
to them, at least, if we judge aright, certain Maxims or Conclusions
about Providence, the state of Nature, and the fate of the World:
And these, in proportion, may be call'd <hi>Dogmata Noachidarum,</hi> the
<hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>his Children.</hi> Which made a System of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
or secret knowledge amongst them, deliver'd by Tradition
from Father to Son; but especially preserv'd amongst their Priests and
Sacred Persons, or such others as were addicted to Contemplation.
This I take to be more ancient than <hi>Moses</hi> himself, or the <hi>Iewish</hi>
Nation. But it would lead me too far out of my way, to set down
in this place, the reasons of my judgment. Let it be sufficient to
have pointed only at this Fountain head of knowledge, and so return
to our Argument.</p>
                     <p>We have heard, as it were, a Cry of Fire, throughout all Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
and throughout all the People of the Earth. But those ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rums
are sometimes false, or make a greater noise than the thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves.
For my part, I never trust Antiquity barely upon its own
account, but always require a second witness either from Nature, or
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41970:139"/>
from Scripture: What the voice of Nature is, we shall hear all
along in the following Treatise: Let us then examine at present,
what testimony the Prophets and Apostles give to this ancient do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Conflagration of the World. The Prophets see the
World a-fire at a distance and more imperfectly, as a brightness
in the Heavens, rather than a burning flame: but S. <hi>Peter</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
it, as if he had been standing by, and seen the Heavens
and Earth in a red fire: heard the cracking flames and the tumbling
Mountains: 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 10. In the day of the Lord, <hi>The Heavens shall
pass away with a great noise, and the Elements shall melt with fervent
heat: The Earth also, and the works that are therein, shall be burnt up.</hi>
Then, after a pious Ejaculation, he adds, Ver. 12. <hi>Looking for and
hastening the coming of the day of God, wherein the Heavens, being on
fire, shall be dissolved; and the Elements shall melt with fervent heat.</hi>
This is as lively, as a Man could express it, if he had the dreadful
spectacle before his Eyes. S. <hi>Peter</hi> had before taught the same do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<hi>(ver. 5, 6, 7.)</hi> but in a more Philosophick way; describing the
double fate of the World, by Water and Fire, with relation to the
Nature and Constitution of either World, past or present. <hi>The
Heavens and the Earth were of old, consisting of water and by water:
whereby, the World that then was, being overflow'd with water, perish'd.
But the Heavens and the Earth which are now, by the same Word are kept
in store, reserved unto fire against the day of Iudgment, and perdition of
ungodly, or Atheistical men.</hi> This testimony of S. <hi>Peter</hi> being full, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect,
and explicit, will give light and strength to several other passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Scripture, where the same thing is exprest obscurely or by
allusion.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 12, 13.</note> As when S. <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>The fire shall try every man's work in
that day.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matt. 13. 40, 41, 42.</note> And our Saviour says, <hi>The tares shall be burnt in the fire,
at the end of the World.</hi> Accordingly it is said, both by the Apostles
and Prophets, that <hi>God</hi> will come to judgment <hi>in Fire.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> to
the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Thess. 2. 7, 8.</note> promiseth the persecuted Righteous, rest and ease,
<hi>When the Lord shall be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angels,
in flaming fire: taking vengeance on them that know not God, &amp;c.</hi> And
so to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> says,<note place="margin">ch. 10. 27.</note> that for wilful Apostates there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no more Sacrifice for sin, <hi>but a certain fearful looking for of judgment,
and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries,</hi> or enemies of
God.<note place="margin">ver. 26, 27, 28, 29.</note> And in the <hi>12th.</hi> Chapter, he alludes to the same thing, when
after he had spoken of <hi>shaking the Heavens</hi> and the <hi>Earth</hi> once more,
he exhorteth, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> does upon the same occasion, to <hi>reverence
and godly fear, For our God is a consuming Fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In like manner the Prophets, when they speak of destroying the
wicked, and the Enemies of God and Christ, at the end of the
World, represent it as a destruction</hi> by Fire. <hi>Psalm the</hi> 11th. 6.
Upon the wicked the Lord shall rain coals, fire, and brimstone, and a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tempest: This shall be the portion of their Cup. <hi>And Psal.</hi> 50. 3.
Our God shall come, and will not be slow: A fire shall devour before him,
<hi>and it</hi> shall be very tempestuous round about him. <hi>And in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of those two triumphal Psalms, the sixty-eighth, and ninety-se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
we see plain allusions to this coming of the Lord in fire.
The other Prophets speak in the same style, of a fiery indignation
against the wicked, in the day of the Lord: As in</hi> Isaiah 66. 15.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41970:140"/>

whirl-wind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of
fire. <hi>And in</hi> Daniel, (c. 7. 9, 10.) <hi>The Ancient of days is plac'd
upon his Seat of Judgment, cover'd in flames.</hi> I beheld till the
Thrones were set, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white
as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: His Throne was
like the fiery flame, his wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issued and
came forth from before him: Thousand thousands ministred unto him,
and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: The judgment was
set, and the Books were opened. <hi>The Prophet</hi> Malachy <hi>(c. 4. 1.) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
the Day of the Lord to the same effect, and in like colours;</hi>
Behold the Day cometh, that shall burn as an Oven: and all the proud,
yea, and all that do wickedly shall be as stubble; and the day that cometh
shall burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, that it shall leave them nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
root nor branch. <hi>And that nature her self, and the Earth shall
suffer in that fire, the Prophet</hi> Zephany <hi>tells us, (c. 3. 8.)</hi> All the Earth
shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousie. <hi>Lastly, This consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of the Earth by fire, even to the foundations of it, is exprest
livelily by</hi> Moses <hi>in his Song,</hi> Deut. 32. 22. A fire is kindled in my
anger, and shall burn unto the lowest Hell: and shall consume the Earth
with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the Mountains.</p>
                     <p>If we reflect upon these Witnesses; and especially the first and
last, <hi>Moses</hi> and S. <hi>Peter:</hi> at what a great distance of time they writ
their Prophecies, and yet how well they agree, we must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that they were acted by the same Spirit: and a Spirit that
see thorough all the Ages of the World, from the beginning to the
end. These Sacred Writers were so remote in time from one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
that they could not confer together, nor conspire, either in
a false testimony, or to make the same prediction. But being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
one common influence and inspiration, which is always consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
with it self, they have dictated the same things, tho' at two
thousand years distance sometimes from one another. This, besides
many other considerations, makes their authority incontestable. And
upon the whole account, you see, that the doctrine of the future
<hi>Conflagration of the World,</hi> having run through all Ages and Nations,
is, by the joynt consent of the Prophets and Apostles, adopted into
the Christian Faith.</p>

World. What the Astronomers say upon this Subject, and
upon what they ground their Calculations; The true
notion of the Great Year, or of the Platonick Year, stated
and explained.</head>
                     <p>HAVING, in this First Section, laid a sure foundation as to
the Subject of our Discourse; the truth and certainty of the
<hi>Conflagration</hi> whereof we are to treat; we will now proceed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after the <hi>Time, Causes,</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of it. We are naturally
more inquisitive after the End of the World, and the Time of that
Fatal Revolution, than after the Causes of it: For these, we know,
are irresistible, whensoever they come, and therefore we are only
sollicitous that they should not overtake us, or our near posterity.
The <hi>Romans</hi> thought they had the fates of their Empire in the
Books of the Sibyls, which were kept by the Magistrates as a Sacred
Treasure. We have also our Prophetical Books, more sacred and
more infallible than theirs, which contain the fate of all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of the Earth, and of that glorious Kingdom that is to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.
And of all futurities, there is none can be of such impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to be enquired after, as this last scene and close of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
affairs.</p>
                     <p>If I thought it possible to determine the time of the <hi>Conflagration</hi>
from the bare intuition of Natural Causes, I would not treat of it
in this place, but reserve it to the last; after we had brought into
view all those Causes, weigh'd their force, and examin'd how and
when they would concur to produce this great effect. But I am
satisfied that the excitation and concourse of those Causes does not
depend upon Nature only; and tho' the Causes may be sufficient
when all united, yet the union of them at such a time, and in such
a manner, I look upon as the effect of a particular Providence:
and therefore no foresight of ours, or inspection into Nature can
discover to us the time of this conjuncture. This method therefore
of Prediction from Natural Causes being laid aside as impracticable,
all other methods may be treated of in this place, as being indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
upon any thing that is to follow in the Treatise; and it will
be an ease to the Argument to discharge it of this part, and clear
the way by degrees to the principal point, which is, the <hi>Causes</hi> and
<hi>Manner</hi> of the Conflagration.</p>
                     <p>Some have thought it a kind of impiety in a Christian to enquire
after the End of the World; because of that check which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
gave his Disciples, when, after his Resurrection, enquiring of
him about the time of his Kingdom,<note place="margin">Act. 1. 7.</note> He answer'd, <hi>It is not for you
to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own
power.</hi> And, before his death, when he was discoursing of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41970:141"/>
Consummation of all things, He told them expresly, that tho' there
should be such and such previous Signs as he had mention'd,<note place="margin">Matt. 24. 36.</note> yet,
<hi>Of that day and hour knoweth no man. No, not the Angels that are in
Heaven, but my Father only.</hi> Be it so, that the Disciples deserv'd a
reprimand, for desiring to know, by a particular revelation from
our Saviour, the state of future times; when many other things
were more necessary for their instruction, and for their ministery.
Be it also admitted, that the Angels, at that distance of time, could
not see thorow all events to the End of the World; it does not at
all follow from thence that they do not know it now; when, in
the course of Sixteen Hundred Years, many things are come to pass,
that may be marks and directions to them to make a judgment of
what remains, and of the last period of all things. However there
will be no danger in our enquiries about this matter, seeing they are
not so much to discover the certainty, as the uncertainty of that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod,
as to humane knowledge. Let us therefore consider what me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
have been used, by those that have been curious and busie
to measure the duration of the World.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Stoicks</hi> tell us, <hi>When</hi> the Sun and the Stars have drunk up
the Sea, then the Earth shall be burnt. A very fair Prophecy: but
how long will they be a drinking? For unless we can determine
that, we cannot determine when this combustion will begin. Many
of the Ancients thought that the Stars were nourish'd by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
of the Ocean and of the moist Earth:<note place="margin">Cicer. de Nat. D. l. 2.</note> and when that nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment
was spent, being of a fiery nature, they would prey upon
the Body of the Earth it self, and consume that, after they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd
the Water. This is old-fashion'd Philosophy, and now, that
the nature of those Bodies is better known, will scarce pass for cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.
'Tis true, we must expect some dispositions towards the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustion
of the World, from a great drought and desiccation of the
Earth: But this helps us nothing on our way; for the question still
returns, <hi>When</hi> will this immoderate drought or dryness happen?
and that's us ill to resolve as the former. Therefore, as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I have no hopes of deciding the question by Physiology or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Causes; let us then look up from the Earth to the Heavens,
To the Astronomers and the Prophets; These think they can define
the age and duration of the World; The one by their Art, and the
other by Inspiration,</p>
                     <p>We begin with the Astronomers: whose Calculations are found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
either upon the Aspects and Configurations of the Planets, or
upon the Revolutions of the Fixt Stars: Or lastly, upon that which
they call <hi>Annus Magnus,</hi> or the <hi>Great Year,</hi> whatsoever that Notion
proves to be when it is rightly interpreted. As to the Planets, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

tells us,<note place="margin">Sen. Nat. qu. l. 3. c. 29.</note> The <hi>Chaldeans</hi> suppose Deluges to proceed from a great
conjunction of the Planets in <hi>Capricorn:</hi> and from a like coniunction
in the opposite Sign of <hi>Cancer,</hi> the Conflagration will ensue. So
that if we compute by the Astronomical Tables how long it will
be to such a Conjunction, we find at the same time how long it will
be to the <hi>Conflagration.</hi> This doctrine of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> some Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Authors have owned, and followed the same principles and
method.</p>

If these Authors would deal fairly with Mankind, they should
shew us some connexion betwixt these Causes and the Effects which
they make consequent upon them. For 'tis an unreasonable thing
to require a man's assent to a Proposition, where he sees no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
or connexion of Terms; unless it come by Revelation, or
from an infallible Authority. If you say, The Conflagration will
be at the first great Conjunction of the Planets in <hi>Cancer,</hi> and I say
it will be at the next Eclipse of the Moon, if you shew no more
reason for your assertion than I for mine, and neither of us pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to revelation or infallibility, we may justly expect to be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
credited. Pray what reason can you give why the Planets, when
they meet, should plot together, to set on Fire their Fellow-Planet,
the Earth, who never did them any harm? But now there is a
plausible reason for my opinion; for the Moon, when Eclips'd
may think herself affronted by the Earth, interposing rudely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
her and the Sun, and leaving her to grope her way in the
dark; She therefore may justly take her revenge as she can. But
you'll say, 'tis not in the power of the Moon to set the Earth on Fire,
if she had malice enough to do it. No, nor, say I, is it in the
power of the other Planets, that are far more distant from the Earth
than the Moon, and as stark dull lumps of Earth, as she is. The
plain truth is, The Planets are so many Earths; and our Earth is as
much a Planet as the brightest of them. 'Tis carried about the Sun
with the same common stream, and shines with as much lustre to
them, as they do to us: neither can they do any more harm to it,
than it can do to them. 'Tis now well known, that the Planets are dark
opake Bodies, generally made up of Earth and Water, as our Globe
is; and have no force or action, but that of reverberating the light
which the Sun casts upon them. This blind superstitious fear or
reverence for the Stars, had its original from the ancient Idolaters;
They thought them Gods, and that they had domination over hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
affairs. We do not indeed worship them, as they did; but
some men retain still the same opinion of their vertues, of their
rule and influence upon us and our affairs, which was the ground
of their worship. 'Tis full time now to sweep away these cobwebs
of superstition, these reliques of Paganism. I do not see how we
are any more concern'd in the postures of the Planets, than in the
postures of the Clouds; and you may as well build an art of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
or divination upon the one as the other. They must not
know much of the Philosophy of the Heavens, or little consider it,
that think the fate, either of single persons, or of the whole Earth,
can depend upon the aspects or figur'd dances of those Bodies.</p>
                     <p>But you'll say, it may be, tho' no reason can be given for such
effects, yet experience does attest the truth of them. In the first
place, I answer, no experience can be produc'd for this effect we are
speaking of, the Conflagration of the World. Secondly, Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
fallaciously recorded, or wholly in favour of one side, is no
proof. If a publick Register was kept of all Astrological Predictions,
and of all the Events that followed upon them, right or wrong,
agreeing or disagreeing, I could willingly refer the cause to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of such a Register, and such experience. But that which
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41970:142"/>
they call experience, is so stated, that if One Prediction of Ten, hits
right or near right, it shall make more noise, and be more taken
notice of, than all the Nine that are false. Just as in a Lottery,
where many Blanks are drawn for one Prize, yet these make all the
noise, and those are forgotten. If any one be so lucky as to draw a
good Lot, then the Trumpet sounds, and his Name is register'd,
and he tells his good fortune to every body he meets: whereas those
that lose, go silently away with empty Pockets, and are asham'd to
tell their losses. Such a thing is the Register of Astrological expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences;
they record what makes for their credit, but drop all
blank instances, that would discover the vanity or cheat of their
Art.</p>
                     <p>So much for the Planets. They have also a pretended calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the End of the World from the fixt Stars and the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Which in short is this: They suppose these Bodies, besides
the hurry of their Diurnal Motion from East to West, quite round
the Earth in four and twenty hours, to have another retrograde
Motion, from West to East; which is more slow and leisurely;
And when they have finish'd the Circle of this retrogradation, and
come up again to the same place from whence they started at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the World, then this course of Nature will be at an end;
and either the Heavens will cease from all motion, or a new set of
motions will be put a foot, and the World begin again. This is a
bundle of fictions tied up in a pretty knot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the first place, there
is no such thing as a solid Firmament, in which the Stars are fixt, as
nails in a board. The Heavens are as fluid as our Air, and the
higher we go, the more thin and subtle is the ethereal matter. Then,
the fixt Stars are not all in one Surface, as they seem to us, nor at
an equal distance from the Earth, but are plac'd in several Orbs high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and higher; there being infinite room in the great Deep of the
Heavens, every way, for innumerable Stars and Spheres behind one
another, to fill and beautify the immense spaces of the Universe.
Lastly, The fixt Stars have no motion common to them all, nor any
motion singly, unless upon their own Centres; and therefore, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
leaving their stations, they can never return to any common sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which they would suppose them to have had at the beginning
of the World. So as this Period they speak of, whereby they would
measure the duration of the World, is meerly imaginary, and hath
no foundation in the true Nature or Motion of the Celestial
Bodies.</p>
                     <p>But in the third place, They speak of an ANNUS MAGNUS,
a <hi>Great Year;</hi> A revolution so call'd, whatsoever it is, that is of the
same extent with the length of the World. This Notion, I confess,
is more Ancient and Universal, and therefore I am the more apt to
believe that it is not altogether groundless. But the difficulty is,
to find out the true notion of this <hi>Great Year,</hi> what is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by it, and then of what length it is. They all agree that it is
a time of some grand ins<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>auration of all things, or a Restitution of
the Heavens and the Earth to their former state; that is, to the state
and posture they had at the beginning of the World; such therefore
as will reduce the Golden Age, and that happy state of Nature
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41970:142"/>
wherein things were at first. If so, if these be the marks and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of this Revolution, which is call'd the <hi>Great Year,</hi> we need
not go so far to find the true notion and interpretation of it. Those
that have read the First Part of this Theory,<note place="margin">Chap. 3.</note> may remember that in
the Second Book we gave an account what the posture of the Earth
was at the beginning of the World, and what were the consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of that posture, <hi>A perpetual Spring</hi> and Equinox throughout all
the Earth: And if the Earth was restor'd again to that posture and
situation, all that is imputed to the <hi>Great Year,</hi> would immediately
follow upon it, without ever disturbing or moving the fix'd Stars,
Firmament, or Planets; and yet at the same time all these three
would return or be restor'd to the same posture they had at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the World; so as the whole character of the <hi>Great Year</hi>
would be truly fulfill'd, tho' not in that way which they imagin'd;
but in another, more compendious, and of easier conception. My
meaning is this, If the Axis of the Earth was rectified, and set paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
with the Axis of the Ecliptick, upon which the Planets, Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and fix'd Stars are suppos'd to move, all things would be as
they were at first; a general harmony and conformity of all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Universe would presently appear, such, as they say,
was in the Golden Age, before any disorder came into the Natural
or Moral World.</p>
                     <p>As this is an easie, so I do not doubt, but it is a true account of
that which was originally call'd the <hi>Great Year,</hi> or the Great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration;
which Nature will bring to pass in this simple method,
by rectifying the Axis of the Earth, without those operose revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which some Astronomers have fansied. But however, this
account being admitted, how will it help us to define what the
Age and duration of the World will be? 'Tis true, many have
undertaken to tell us the length of this <hi>Great Year,</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the World; but, besides that their accounts are very different,
and generally of an extravagant length, if we had the true account,
it would not assure us when the World would end; because we
do not know when it did begin, or what progress we have already
made in the line of Time. For I am satisfied, the Chronology of
the World, whether Sacred or Prophane, is lost; till Providence
shall please to retrieve it by some new discovery. As to Prophane
Chronology, or that of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi>
knew nothing above the <hi>Olympiads;</hi> which fell short many Ages of
the Deluge, much more of the beginning of the World. And the
Eastern Barbarous Nations, as they disagreed amongst themselves,
so generally they run the Origin of the World to such a prodigious
height, as is neither agreeable to Faith, nor Reason. As to Sacred
Chronology, 'tis well known, that the difference there is betwixt
the <hi>Greek, Hebrew,</hi> and <hi>Samaritan</hi> Copies of the Bible, makes the
Age of the World altogether undetermin'd: And there is no way
yet found out, how we may certainly discover which of the three
Copies is most Authentick, and consequently what the Age of the
World is, upon a true computation. Seeing therefore we have no
assurance how long the World hath stood already, neither could
we be assur'd how long it hath to stand, though, by this <hi>Annus
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41970:143"/>
Magnus,</hi> or any other way, the total sum, or whole term of its
duration was truly known.</p>
                     <p>I am sorry to see the little success we have had in our first search
after the End of the World, from Astronomical Calculations. But
'tis an useful piece of Knowledge to know the bounds of our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
that so we may not spend our time and thoughts about
things that lie out of our reach. I have little or no hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
this point by the Light of Nature, and therefore it only
remains now to enquire, whether Providence hath made it known
by any sort of Prophecy or Revelation. Which shall be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the following Chapter.</p>

                     <p>THE bounds of humane knowledge are so narrow, and the

                     <p>Amongst the Heathens I do not remember any Prophecies of this
nature, except the <hi>Sibylline Oracles,</hi> as they are usually call'd. The
Ancient Eastern Philosophers have left us no account that I can
call to mind, about the time of this fatality. They say when the

the age of the <hi>Phoenix</hi> they make as various and uncertain, as they
do the computation of their <hi>Great Year:</hi>

one and the same in effect. Some of them, I confess, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Six Thousand Years for the whole Age of the World: which
being the famous Prophecy of the <hi>Iews,</hi> we shall speak to it large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hereafter: and reduce to that head what broken Traditions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
amongst the Heathens of the same thing. As to the <hi>Sibyline
Oracles,</hi> which were so much in reputation amongst the <hi>Greeks</hi> and
<hi>Romans,</hi> they have been tamper'd with so much, and chang'd so
often, that they are become now of little authority. They seem to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41970:143"/>
have divided the duration of the World into Ten Ages, and the
last of these they make a Golden Age, a state of Peace, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
and Perfection: but seeing they have not determin'd, in
any definite numbers, what the length of every Age will be, nor
given us the summ of all, we cannot draw any conclusion from this
account as to the point in question before us. But must proceed to
the Jewish and Christian Oracles.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Iews</hi> have a remarkable Prophecy, which expresseth both
the whole and the parts of the World's duration. The World, they
say, will stand Six Thousand Years: <hi>Two Thousand before the Law,
Two Thousand under the Law, and Two Thousand under the Messiah.</hi> This
Prophecy they derive from <hi>Elias;</hi> but there were two of the Name,
<hi>Elias</hi> the <hi>Thesbite,</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> the <hi>Rabbin,</hi> or <hi>Cabbalist:</hi> and 'tis sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to belong immediately to the latter of these. Yet this does
not hinder in my opinion, but that it might come originally from
the former <hi>Elias,</hi> and was preserv'd in the School of this <hi>Elias</hi> the
<hi>Rabbin,</hi> and first made publick by him. Or he added, it may be,
that division of the time into three parts, and so got a Title to the
whole. I cannot easily imagine that a Doctor that liv'd two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years or thereabouts, before Christ, when Prophecy had ceas'd
for some Ages amongst the <hi>Iews,</hi> should take upon him to dictate a
Prophecy about the duration of the World, unless he had been sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by some antecedent Cabbalistical Tradition: which being kept
more secret before, he took the liberty to make publick, and so was
reputed the Author of the Prophecy. As many Philosophers amongst
the <hi>Greeks,</hi> were the reputed Authors of such doctrines as were much
more ancient than themselves: But they were the publishers of them in
their Country, or the revivers of them after a long silence; and
so, by forgetful posterity, got the honour of the first invention.</p>
                     <p>You will think, it may be, the time is too long and the distance
too great betwixt <hi>Elias</hi> the <hi>Thesbite,</hi> and this <hi>Elias</hi> the <hi>Rabbin,</hi> for a
Tradition to subsist all the while, or be preserv'd with any compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
integrity. But it appears from S. <hi>Iude</hi>'s Epistle, that the <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of Enoch,</hi> (who liv'd before the Floud) relating to the day of
judgment and the end of the World, were extant in his time, either
in Writing or by Tradition: And the distance betwixt <hi>Enoch</hi> and
S. <hi>Iude</hi> was vastly greater than betwixt the two <hi>Elias</hi>'s. Nor was
any fitter to be inspir'd with that knowledge, or to tell the first news of
that fatal period, than the old Prophet <hi>Elias,</hi> who is to come again
and bring the alarum of the approaching Conflagration. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
this conjecture may prove as to the original Author of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
the Prophecy it self concerning the <hi>Sexmillennial</hi> duration
of the World, is very much insisted upon by the Christian Fathers.
Which yet I believe is not so much for the bare Authority of the
Tradition, as because they thought it was founded in the History of
the <hi>Six days Creation,</hi> and the <hi>Sabbath</hi> succeeding: as also in some
other Typical precepts and usages in the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> But before
we speak of that, give me leave to name some of those Fathers to
you, that were of this judgment, and supposed the great Sabbatism
would succeed after the World had stood Six Thousand Years. Of
this opinion was S. <hi>Barnabas</hi> in his Catholick Epistle, <hi>ch.</hi> 15. Where
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41970:144"/>
he argues that the Creation will be ended in Six Thousand Years,
as it was finish'd in Six Days: Every day according to the Sacred
and mystical account, being a Thousand Years. Of the same judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is S. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> both as to the conclusion and the reason of it.
He saith,<note place="margin">L. 5. c. 28, 29, 30.</note> the History of the Creation in six days, <hi>is a narration as
to what is past, and a Prophecy of what is to come.</hi> As the Work was
said to be consummated in six days, and the Sabbath to be the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth;
So the consummation of all things will be in Six Thousand
Years, and then the great Sabbatism to come on in the blessed reign
of Christ. <hi>Hippolitus</hi> Martyr, disciple of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> is of the same judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as you may see in <hi>Photius, ch. 202. Lactantius</hi> in his <hi>Divine
Institutions, l. 7. c.</hi> 14. gives the very same account of the state and
continuance of the World, and the same proofs for it. And so does
S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in his <hi>Exhortation to Martyrdom, ch.</hi> 11. S <hi>Ierome</hi> more
than once declares himself of the same opinion; and S. <hi>Austin,</hi> tho'
he wavers and was doubtful as to the <hi>Millennium,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">C. D. l. 20. c. 7.</note> or Reign of
Christ upon Earth, yet he receives this computation without hesitancy,
and upon the foremention'd grounds. So <hi>Iohannes Damascenus de
fide Orthodoxâ,</hi> takes seven Millennaries for the entire space of the
World, from the Creation to the general Resurrection, the Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
being included. And that this was a received and approv'd
opinion in early times, we may collect from the Author of the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
and answers ad Orthodoxos in Iustin Martyr.</hi> Who giving an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to that enquiry about the six thousand-years term of the World,
says, <hi>We may conjecture from many places of Scripture, that those are in
the right, that say six thousand years is the time prefixt for the duration
of this present frame of the World.</hi> These Authors I have examin'd
my self: but there are many others brought in confirmation of this
opinion: as S. <hi>Hilary, Anastasius Sinaita,</hi> Sanctus <hi>Gaudentius,</hi> Q. <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Hilarion, Iunilius Africanus, Isidorus Hispalensis, Cassiodorus, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorius
Magnus,</hi> and others, which I leave to be examin'd by those
that have curiosity and leisure to do it.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time it must be confest that many of these Fathers
were under a mistake in one respect, in that they generally thought
the World was near an end in their time. An errour, which we
need not take pains to confute now; seeing we, who live twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
or fourteen hundred years after them, find the World still in
being, and likely to continue so for some considerable time. But it
is easie to discern whence their mistake proceeded: not from this
Prophecy alone, but because they reckon'd this Prophecy according
to the Chronology of the Septuagint: which setting back the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the World many Ages beyond the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> these six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
years were very near expir'd in the time of those Fathers;
and that made them conclude that the World was very near an end.
We will make no reflections, in this place, upon that Chronology
of the Septuagint, lest it should too much interrupt the thred of our
discourse. But it is necessary to shew how the Fathers grounded
this computation of Six Thousand Years, upon Scripture. 'Twas
chiefly, as we suggested before, upon the <hi>Hexameron,</hi> or the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
finish'd in <hi>Six Days,</hi> and the <hi>Sabbath</hi> ensuing. The Sabbath,
they said, was a type of the Sabbatism, that was to follow at the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41970:144"/>
end of the World,<note place="margin">Ch. 5.</note> according to S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> and then by
analogy and consequence, the six days preceding the Sabbath, must
note the space and duration of the World. If therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> could
discover how much a Day is reckon'd for, in this mystical compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
the sum of the six days would be easily found out. And
they think, that according to the Psalmist, <hi>(Psal. 90. 4.)</hi> and S. <hi>Peter,
(2 Epist. 3. 8.) a Day</hi> may be estimated <hi>a thousand years;</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
six days must be counted six thousand years, for the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the World. This is their interpretation, and their inference:
but it must be acknowledged, that there is an essential weakness in all
typical and allegorical argumentations, in comparison of literal. And
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s being allow'd in diminution of the proof, we may be bold to
say, that nothing yet appears, either in Nature, or Scripture, or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Affairs, repugnant to this supposition of Six Thousand Years:
which hath Antiquity, and the Authority of the Fathers, on its
side.</p>
                     <p>We proceed now to the Christian Prophecies concerning the end
of the World. I do not mention those in <hi>Daniel,</hi> because I am
not satisfied that any there (excepting that of the Fifth Kingdom it
self) extend so far. But in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> which is the
last Revelation we are to expect, there are several Prophecies that
reach to the Consummation of this World, and the First Resurrection.
The <hi>Seven Seals,</hi> the <hi>Seven Trumpets,</hi> the <hi>Seven Vials,</hi> do all termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
upon that great Period. But they are rather Historical
Prophecies than Chronological; they tell us, in their Language,
the Events, but do not measure or express the time wherein they
come to pass. Others there are that may be call'd Chronological,
as the <hi>treading under foot the holy City, forty and two months, Apoc.</hi> 11. 2.
The <hi>Witnesses</hi> opposing Antichrist, <hi>one thousand two hundred and sixty
days, Apoc.</hi> 11. 3. The flight of the <hi>Woman into the Wilderness,</hi> for the
same number of days, or for a <hi>Time, Times, and half a Time, Apoc.
12. 6. &amp;</hi> 14. And lastly, The War of the Beast against the Saints,
<hi>forty two months, Apoc.</hi> 13. 5. These all, you see, express a time for
their completion; and all the same time, if I be not mistaken: But
they do not reach to the End of the World. Or if some of them
did reach so far, yet because we do not certainly know where to
fix their beginning, we must still be at a loss, when, or in what
year they will expire. As for instance, If the Reign of the Beast, or
the Preaching of the Witnesses be 1260 years, as is reasonably sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd;
yet if we do not know certainly when this Reign, or this
Preaching begun, neither can we tell when it will end. And the
Epocha's or beginnings of these Prophecies are so differently calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
and are things of so long debate, as makes the discussion of
them altogether improper for this place. Yet it must be confest,
that the best conjectures that can be made concerning the approaching
End of the World, must be taken from a judicious examination of
these points: and according as we gather up the Prophecies of the
Apocalypse, in a successive completion, we see how by degrees we
draw nearer and nearer to the conclusion of all. But till some of
these enlightning Prophecies be accomplish'd, we are as a Man that
awakes in the Night, all is dark about him, and he knows not how
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41970:145"/>
far the Night is spent: but if he watch till the light appears, the
first glimpses of that will resolve his doubts. We must have a little
patience and, I think, but a little; still eyeing those Prophecies of
the <hi>Resurrection of the Witnesses,</hi> and the <hi>depression</hi> of <hi>Antichrist:</hi> till
by their accomplishment, the day dawn, and the Clouds begin to
change their colour. Then we shall be able to make a near guess,
when the Sun of righteousness will arise.</p>
                     <p>So much for Prophecies. There are also <hi>Signs,</hi> which are look'd
upon us forerunners of the coming of our Saviour: and therefore
may give us some direction how to judge of the distance or approach
of that great Day. Thus many of the Fathers thought the <hi>coming of
Antichrist</hi> would be a sign to give the World notice of its approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
end. But we may easily see, by what hath been noted before,
what it was that led the Fathers into that mistake. They thought
their six thousand years were near an end, as they truly were, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that Chronology they followed: and therefore they
concluded the Reign of Antichrist must be very short, whensoever
he came, and that he could not come long before the end of the
World. But we are very well assur'd from the Revelation of Saint
<hi>Iohn,</hi> that the reign of Antichrist is not to be so short and transient;
and from the prospect and history of Christendom, that he hath
been already upon his Throne many hundreds of Years. Therefore
this Sign wholly falls to the ground; unless you will take it from
the fall of Antichrist, rather than from his first entrance. Others
expect the <hi>coming</hi> of <hi>Elias</hi> to give warning of that day, and prepare
the way of the Lord. I am very willing to admit that <hi>Elias</hi> will
come,<note place="margin">Ch. 4. 5, 6.</note> according to the sence of the Prophet <hi>Malachi,</hi> but he will
not come <hi>with observation,</hi> no more than he did in the Person of
<hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist; He will not bear the name of <hi>Elias,</hi> nor tell us he
is the Man that went to Heaven in a fiery Chariot, and is now come
down again to give us warning of the last Fire. But some divine
person may appear before the second coming of our Saviour, as
there did before his first coming, and by giving a new light and life
to the Christian Doctrine, may dissipate the mists of error, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
all those little controversies amongst good men, and the divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and animosities that spring from them; enlarging their Spirits
by greater discoveries, and uniting them all in the bonds of love
and charity, and in the common study of truth and perfection.
Such an <hi>Elias,</hi> the Prophet seems to point at; And may be come,
and be the great Peace-maker and preparer of the ways of the Lord.
But at present, we cannot from this Sign make any judgment when
the World will end.</p>
                     <p>Another Sign preceeding the end of the World, is, <hi>The Conversi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on
of the Iews;</hi> and this is a wonderful sign indeed. S. <hi>Paul</hi> seems
expresly to affirm it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 25, 26. But it is differently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
either of their Conversion only, or of their Restoration to
their own Countrey, Liberties and Dominion. The Prophets bear
hard upon this sence sometimes, as you may see in <hi>Isaiah, Ezekiel,
Hosea, Amos.</hi> And to the same purpose the ancient promise of <hi>Moses</hi>
is interpreted, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. Yet this seems to be a thing very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable;
unless we suppose the Ten Tribes to be still in some
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41970:145"/>
hidden corner of the World, from whence they may be conducted
again into their own Countrey, as once out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> by a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Providence, and establish'd there. Which being known, will
give the alarum to all the other <hi>Iews</hi> in the World, and make an
universal confluence to their old home.<note place="margin">Ioh. 19. 37.</note> Then our Saviour by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
appearance to them,<note place="margin">Apoc. 1. 7.</note> as once to S. <hi>Paul:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 23. 39.</note> and by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
rais'd up amongst them for that purpose, may convince them
that he is the true Messiah, and convert them to the Christian
Faith; which will be no more strange, than was the first Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Gentile World. But if we be content with a Conversion
of the <hi>Iews,</hi> without their restoration; and of those Two Tribes
only which are now disperst throughout the Christian World and
other known parts of the Earth: That these should be Converted
to the Christian Faith, and incorporated into the Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
losing their national character and distinction. If this, I
say, will satisfie the Prophecies, it is not a thing very difficult to be
conceived. For when the World is reduc'd to a better and purer
state of Christianity, and that Idolatry in a great measure, remov'd,
which gave the greatest scandal to the <hi>Iews,</hi> they will begin to have
better thoughts of our Religion, and be dispos'd to a more ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and unprejudic'd examination of their Prophecies concerning
the Messiah: God raising up men amongst them of divine and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
Spirits, Lovers of Truth more than of any particular Sect or
Opinion; with light to discern it, and courage to profess it. Lastly,
it will be a cogent argument upon them, to see the Age of the
World so far spent, and no appearance yet of their long expected
Messiah. So far spent, I say, that there is no room left, upon any
computation whatsoever, for the Oeconomy of a Messiah yet to
come. This will make them reflect more carefully and impartially
upon him whom the Christians propose, <hi>Iesus of Nazareth,</hi> whom
their Fathers Crucified at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Upon the Miracles he wrought,
in his life and after his death: and upon the wonderful propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Doctrine throughout the World, after his Ascension. And
lastly, upon the desolation of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> upon their own scatter'd
and forlorn condition, foretold by that Prophet, as a judgment of
God upon an ungrateful and wicked People.</p>
                     <p>This I have said to state the case of the Conversion of the
<hi>Iews,</hi> which will be a sign of the approaching reign of Christ. But
alas, what appearance is there of this Conversion in our days, or
what judgment can we make from a sign that is not yet come to
pass? 'Tis ineffectual as to us, but may be of use to posterity. Yet
even to them it will not determine at what distance they are from
the end of the World, but be a mark only that they are not far
from it. There will be Signs also, in those last days, in the Heavens,
and in the Earth, and in the Sea, forerunners of the <hi>Conflagration;</hi>
as the obscuration of the Sun and Moon, Earth-quakes, roarings of
the troubled Sea, and such like disorders in the natural World. 'Tis
true, but these are the very pangs of death, and the strugglings of
Nature just before her dissolution, and it will be too late then to
be aware of our ruine when it is at the door. Yet these being Signs
or Prodigies taken notice of by Scripture, we intend, God willing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:41970:146"/>
after we have explained the causes and manner of the <hi>Conflagration,</hi>
to give an account also whence these unnatural commotions will
proceed, that are the beginnings or immediate introductions to the
last Fire.</p>
                     <p>Thus we have gone through the Prophecies and Signs that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the last day and the last fate of the World. And how little
have we learned from them as to the time of that great revolution?
Prophecies rise sometimes with an even gradual light, as the day
riseth upon the Horizon: and sometimes break out suddenly like a
fire, and we are not aware of their approach till we see them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish'd.
Those that concern the end of the World are of this
latter sort to unobserving men; but even to the most observing,
there will still be a latitude; We must not expect to calculate the
coming of our Saviour like an Eclipse, to minutes and half-minutes.
There are <hi>Times and Seasons which the Father hath put in his own power.</hi>
If it was designed to keep these things secret, we must not think to
out-wit Providence, and from the Prophecies that are given us,
pick out a discovery that was not intended we should ever make.
It is determin'd in the Councils of Heaven just how far we shall
know these events before hand, and with what degree of certainty:
and with this we must be content whatsoever it is. The <hi>Apocalypse</hi>
of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> is the last Prophetical declaration of the Will of God, and
contains the fate of the Christian Religion to the end of the World,
its purity, degeneracy, and reviviscency. The head of this degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
is call'd <hi>The Beast, the false Prophet, the Whore of Babylon,</hi> in
Prophetical terms: and in an Ecclesiastical term is commonly call'd
<hi>Antichrist.</hi> Those that bear Testimony against this degeneracy, are
call'd the <hi>Witnesses:</hi> who, after they have been a long time, in a
mean and persecuted condition, are to have their Resurrection and
Ascension: that is, be advanc'd to power and Authority. And this
Resurrection of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> and depression of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> is that
which will make the great turn of the World to righteousness, and
the great Crisis whereby we may judge of its drawing to an end.
'Tis true,<note place="margin">Apoc. c. 9.</note> there are other marks, as the passing away of the <hi>Second
Woe:</hi> which is commonly thought to be the Ottoman Empire: and
the Effusion of the <hi>Vials.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Apoc. c. 16.</note> The first of these will be indeed a very
conspicuous mark,<note place="margin">ch. 11. 14.</note> if it follow upon the Resurrection of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
as by the Prophecy it seems to do. But as to the Vials, tho'
they do plainly reach in a Series to the end of the World, I am not
satisfied with any exposition I have yet met with, concerning their
precise time on contents.</p>
                     <p>In a word, 'Tho the sum and general contents of a Prophecy be
very intelligible, yet the application of it to Time and Persons may
be very lubricous. There must be obscurity in a Prophecy, as well
as shadow in a Picture. All its lines must not stand in a full light.
For if Prophecies were open and bare-fac'd as to all their parts and
circumstances, they would check and obstruct the course of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
affairs; and hinder, if it was possible, their own accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Modesty and Sobriety are in all things commendable, but in
nothing more than in the explication of these Sacred Mysteries; and
we have seen so many miscarry by a too close and particular appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41970:146"/>
of them, that we ought to dread the Rock about which we
see so many shipwrecks. He that does not err above a Century in
calculation the last period of Time, from what evidence we have at
present, hath, in my opinion, cast up his accounts very well. But
the Scenes will change fast towards the Evening of this long day,
and when the Sun is near setting, they will more easily compute
how far he hath to run.</p>

Concerning the Causes of the Conflagration.</head>
                     <head type="sub">The difficulty of conceiving how this Earth can be set on fire.
With a general answer to that difficulty. Two suppos'd
causes of the Conflagration, by the Sun's drawing nearer
to the Earth, or the Earth's throwing out the central fire,
examin'd and rejected.</head>
                     <p>WE have now made our way clear to the principal point, <hi>The
Causes of the Conflagration:</hi> How the Heavens and the Earth
will be set on fire, what materials are prepar'd, or what train of
Causes, for that purpose. The Ancients, who have kept us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
pretty well thus far, here quite desert us. They deal more in
Conclusions than Causes, as is usual in all Traditional Learning.
And the <hi>Stoicks</hi> themselves, who inculcate so much the doctrine of
the Conflagration, and make the strength of it such as to dissolve
the Earth into a fiery Chaos, are yet very short and superficial in
their explications, how this shall come to pass. The latent seeds of
fire, they say, shall every where be let loose, and the Element will
prevail over all the rest, and transform every thing into its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
But these are general things that give little satisfaction to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive
Persons. Neither do the modern Authors that treat of the
same subject, relieve us in this particular: They are willing to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Conflagration a superficial effect, that so they may excuse
themselves the trouble of enquiring after causes. 'Tis, no doubt, in
a sort, supernatural: and so the Deluge was: yet <hi>Moses</hi> sets down
the Causes of the Deluge, the rains from above, and the disruption
of the Abyss. So there must be treasures of fire provided against
that day, by whose eruption this second Deluge will be brought
upon the Earth.</p>
                     <p>To state the case fairly, we must first represent the difficulty of
setting the Earth on Fire: Tie the knot, before we loose it; that
so we may the better judge whether the Causes that shall be brought
into view, may be sufficient to overcome so great opposition. The
difficulty, no doubt, will be chiefly from the great quantity of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that is about our Globe; whereby Nature seems to have made
provision against any invasion by Fire, and secur'd us from that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41970:147"/>
enemy more than any other. We see half of the Surface of the
Earth cover'd with the Seas: whose Chanel is of a vast depth and
capacity. Besides innumerable Rivers, great and small, that water
the face of the dry Land, and drench it with perpetual moisture.
Then within the bowels of the Earth, there are Store-houses of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
Waters: which are as a reserve, in case the Ocean and
the Rivers should be overcome. Neither is Water our only security,
for the hard Rocks and stony Mountains, which no Fire can bite
upon, are set in long ranges upon the Continents and Islands: and
must needs give a stop to the progress of that furious Enemy, in
case he should attack us. Lastly, The Earth it self is not combustible
in all its parts. 'Tis not every Soyl that is fit fewel for the Fire.
Clay, and Mire, and such like Soyls will rather choak and stifle it,
than help it on its way. By these means one would think the Body
of the Earth secur'd; and tho' there may be partial fires, or inu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lations
of fire, here and there, in particular regions, yet there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be an Universal Fire throughout the Earth. At least one would
hope for a safe retreat towards the Poles, where there is nothing
but Snow, and Ice, and bitter cold. These regions sure are in no
danger to be burnt, whatsoever becomes of the other climates of
the Earth.</p>
                     <p>This being the state and condition of the present Earth, one
would not imagine by these preparations, 'twas ever intended that
it should perish by an Universal Fire. But such is often the method
of Providence, that the exteriour face of things looks one way, and
the design lies another; till at length, touching a Spring, as it were,
at a certain time, all those affairs change posture and aspect, and
shew us which way Providence inclines. We must therefore sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
before the Conflagration begins, there will be dispositions and
preparatives suitable to so great a work: and all antiquity, sacred
and prophane, does so far concur with us, as to admit and suppose
that a great drought will precede, and an extraordinary heat and
driness of the Air, to usher in this fiery doom. And these being
things which often happen in a course of Nature, we cannot disal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
such easie preparations, when Providence intends so great a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence.
The Heavens will be shut up, and the Clouds yield no
rain; and by this, with an immoderate heat in the Air, the Springs
of Water will become dry, the Earth chap'd and parch'd, and the
Woods and Trees made ready fewel for the Fire. We have instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in History that there have been droughts and heats of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to that degree, that the Woods and Forests have taken fire,
and the outward Turf and Surface of the Earth, without any other
cause than the driness of the Season, and the vehemency of the Sun.
And which is more considerable, the Springs, and Fountains being
dry'd up, the greater Rivers have been sensibly lessen'd, and the
lesser quite emptied and exhal'd. These things which happen fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
in particular Countreys and Climates, may at an appointed
time, by the disposition of Providence, be more universal through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Earth; and have the same effects every where, that we see
by experience they have had in certain places. And by this means we
may conceive it as feisible to set the whole Earth on fire in some little
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41970:147"/>
space of time, as to burn up this or that Countrey after a great
drought. But I mean this, with exception still to the main Body of
the Sea: which will indeed receive a greater diminution from these
Causes than we easily imagine, but the final consumption of it will
depend upon other reasons, whereof we must give an account in the
following Chapters.</p>
                     <p>As to the Mountains and Rocks, their lofty heads will sink when
the Earthquakes begin to roar, at the beginning of the Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
as we shall see hereafter. And as to the Earth it self, 'tis true
there are several sorts of Earth that are not proper fewel for fire;
but those Soils that are not so immediately, as clayey Soils, and
such like, may by the strength of Fire be converted into Brick, or
Stone, or Earthen Metal, and so melted down and vitrified. For, in
conclusion there is no Terrestrial Body that does not finally yield
to the force of Fire, and may either be converted into flame, incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated
fire, or into a liquor more ardent than either of them. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
As to the Polar Regions, which you think will be a safe retreat
and inaccessible to the fire; 'Tis true, unless Providence hath laid sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
treasures of fire there unknown to us, those parts of the
Earth will be the last consum'd. But it is to be observ'd, that the
cold of those regions proceeds from the length of their Winter, and
their distance from the Sun when he is beyond the Aequator; and
both these causes will be remov'd at the Conflagration. For we
suppose the Earth will then return to its primitive situation, which
we have explain'd in the <hi>2d,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ch. 3.</note> Book of this Theory; and will have
the Sun always in its Aequator; whereby the several Climates of
the Earth will have a perpetual Equinox, and those under the Poles
a perpetual day. And therefore all the excess of cold, and all the
consequences of it, will soon be abated. However, the Earth will
not be burnt in one day, and those parts of the Earth being unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited,
there is no inconvenience that they should be more slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consum'd than the rest.</p>
                     <p>This is a general answer to the difficulty propos'd about the possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of the Conflagration; and being general only, the parts of it
must be more fully explain'd and confirm'd in the sequel of this
discourse. We should now proceed directly to the causes of the
Conflagration, and show in what manner they do this great execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon Nature. But to be just and impartial in this enquiry, we
ought first to separate the spurious and pretended Causes from those
that are real and genuine; to make no false musters, nor any
show of being stronger than we are; and if we can do our work
with less force, it will be more to our credit; as a Victory is more
honourable that is gain'd with fewer Men.</p>
                     <p>There are two grand capital Causes which some Authors make
use of, as the chief Agents in this work, the <hi>Sun,</hi> and the <hi>Central
Fire.</hi> These two great Incendiaries, they say, will be let loose upon
us at the Conflagration. The one drawing nearer to the Earth, and
the other breaking out of its bowels into these upper regions. These
are potent Causes indeed, more than enough to destroy this Earth,
if it was a thousand times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bigger than it is. But for that very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
I suspect they are not the true Causes; for God and Nature do
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41970:148"/>
not use to employ unnecessary means to bring about their designs.
Disproportion and over-sufficiency is one sort of false measures, and
'tis a sign we do not thoroughly understand our work, when we put
more strength to it than the thing requires. Men are forward to
call in extraordinary powers, to rid their hands of a troublesome
argument, and so make a short dispatch to save themselves the pains
of further enquiries: but such methods, as they commonly have no
proof, so they give little satisfaction to an inquisitive mind. This
supposition of burning the Earth, by the Sun drawing nearer and
nearer to it, seems to be made in imitation of the story of <hi>Phaeton,</hi>
who driving the Chariot of the Sun with an unsteddy hand, came
so near the Earth, that he set it on fire. But however we will not
reject any pretensions without a fair trial; Let us examine therefore
what grounds they can have for either of these suppositions, of the
Approximation of the Sun to the Earth, or the Eruption of the
Central Fire.</p>
                     <p>As to the Sun, I desire first to be satisfied in present matter of Fact:
whether by any instrument or observation it hath or can be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd,
that the Sun is nearer to the Earth now, than he was in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ages? or if by any reasoning or comparing calculations such
a conclusion can be made? If not, this is but an imaginary cause,
and as easily deny'd as propos'd. Astronomers do very little agree in
their opinions about the distance of the Sun, <hi>Ptolomy, Albategnius,
Copernious, Ticho, Kepler,</hi> and others more modern, differ all in
their calculations; but not in such a manner or proportion, as
should make us believe that the Sun comes nearer to the Earth, but
rather goes further from it. For the more modern of them make
the distance greater than the more ancient do <hi>Kepler</hi> says, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Sun from the Earth lies betwixt 700 and 2000 semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diameters
of the Earth: but <hi>Ricciolus</hi> makes it betwixt 700 and
7000. And <hi>Gottefrid Wendeline</hi> hath taken 14656. semidiameters, for
a middle proportion of the Sun's distance; to which <hi>Kepler</hi> himself
came very near in his later years. So that you see how groundless
our fears are from the approaches of an enemy, that rather flies
from us, if he change posture at all. And we have more reason to
believe the report of the modern Astronomers than of the ancient,
in this matter; both because the nature of the Heavens and of the
celestial Bodies is now better known, and also because they have
found out better instruments and better methods to make their
observations.</p>
                     <p>If the Sun and Earth were come nearer to one another, either
the circle of the Suns diurnal arch would be less, and so the day
shorter: or the Orbit of the Earths annual course would be less,
and so the Year shor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>er: Neither of which we have any experience
of. And those that suppose us in the centre of the World, need not
be afraid till they see <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> in a combustion, for they
lie betwixt us and danger; and the Sun cannot come so readily at
us with his fiery darts, as at them, who stand in his way. Lastly,
this languishing death by the gradual approaches of the Sun, and
that irreparable ruine of the Earth which at last must follow from
it, do neither of them agree with that Idea of the <hi>Conflagration,</hi>
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:41970:148"/>
which the Scripture hath given us; for it is to come suddenly and
unexpectedly, and take us off like a violent Feaver, not as a lingring
Consumption. And the Earth is also so to be destroyed by Fire, as
not to take away all hopes of a Resurrection or Renovation. For we
are assur'd by Scripture that there will be new Heavens and a new
Earth after these are burnt up. But if the Sun should come so near
us as to make the <hi>heavens pass away with a noise, and melt the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with fervent heat,</hi> and destroy the form and all the works of
the Earth, what hopes or possibility would there be of a Renovation
while the Sun continued in this posture? He would more and more
consume and prey upon the Carcass of the Earth, and convert it at
length either into an heap of Ashes, or a lump of vitrified me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</p>
                     <p>So much for the Sun. As to the <hi>Central Fire,</hi> I am very well satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
it is no imaginary thing. All Antiquity hath preserv'd some sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Monument of it. The <hi>Vestal</hi> fire of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which was so
religiously attended: The <hi>Prytoneia</hi> of the <hi>Greeks</hi> were to the same
purpose, and dedicated to <hi>Vesta:</hi> and the <hi>Pyretheia</hi> of the <hi>Persians,</hi>
where fire was kept continually by the <hi>Magi.</hi> These all, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
had the same origine and the same signification. And tho' I
do not know any particular observation, that does directly prove or
demonstrate that there is such a mass of fire in the middle of the
Earth; yet the best accounts we have of the generation of a Planet,
do suppose it; and 'tis agreeable to the whole Oeconomy of Nature;
as a fire in the heart, which gives life to her motions and producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But however the question is not at present, about the exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of this fire, but the eruption of it, and the effect of that Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
which cannot be, in my judgment, such a <hi>Conflagration</hi> as is
describ'd in Scripture.</p>
                     <p>This Central Fire must be enclos'd in a shell of great strength and
firmness; for being of it self the lightest and most active of all Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
it would not be detained in that lowest prison without a strong
guard upon it. 'Tis true, we can make no certain judgment of what
thickness this shell is, but if we suppose this fire to have a twentieth
part of the semidiameter of the Earth, on either side the centre, for
its sphere, which seems to be a fair allowance; there would still
remain nineteen parts, for our safeguard and security. And these
nineteen parts of the semidiameter of the Earth will make 3268
miles, for a partition-wall betwixt us and this Central Fire. Who
wou'd be afraid of an Enemy lock'd up in so strong a prison? But
you'l say, it may be, tho' the Central Fire, at the beginning of the
World, might have no more room or space than what is mentioned:
yet being of that activity that it is, and corrosive nature, it may, in
the space of some thousands of years, have eaten deep into the sides
of its prison; and so come nearer to the surface of the Earth, by
some hundreds or thousands of miles than it was at first. This would
be a material exception if it could be made out. But what Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon
is there in Nature that proves this? How does it appear by
any observation that the Central Fire gains ground upon us? Or is
increased in quantity, or come nearer to the surface of the Earth?
I know nothing that can be offered in proof of this: and if there
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41970:149"/>
be no appearance of a change, nor any sensible effect of it, 'tis an
argument there is none, or none considerable. If the quantity of
that fire was considerably increas'd, it must needs, besides other
effects, have made the Body of the Earth considerably lighter. The
Earth having, by this conversion of its own substance into fire, lost
so much of its heaviest matter, and got so much of the lightest and
most active Element in stead of it: and in both these respects its
gravity would be manifestly lessen'd. Which if it really was in any
considerable degree, it would discover it self by some change, either
as to the motion of the Earth, or as to its place or station in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.
But there being no external change observable, in this or any
other respect, 'tis reasonable to presume that there is no considerable
inward change, or no great consumption of its inward parts and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:
and consequently no great increase of the Central Fire.</p>
                     <p>But if we should admit both an encrease and eruption of this fire,
it would not have that effect which is pretended. It might cause
some confusion and disorder in those parts of the Earth where it
broke out, but it would not make an universal Conflagration, such
as is represented to us in Scripture. Let us suppose the Earth to be
open or burst in any place, under the Pole, for instance, or under
the Aequator: and let it gape as low as the Central Fire. At this
chasm or rupture we suppose the fire would gush out; and what
then would be the consequence of this when it came to the surface
of the Earth? It would either be dissipated and lost in the air, or
fly still higher towards the Heavens in a mass of flame. But what
execution in the mean time would it do upon the Body of the
Earth? 'Tis but like a flash of lightning, or a flame issuing out of a
pit, that dies presently. Besides, this Central Fire is of that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
and tenuity that it is not able to inflame gross Bodies: no
morethan those Meteors we call <hi>Lambent Fires,</hi> inflame the bodies
to which they stick. Lastly, in explaining the manner of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration,
we must have regard principally to Scripture; for the
explications given there are more to the purpose, than all that the
Philosophers have said upon that subject. Now, as we noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
'tis manifest in Scripture that after the Conflagration there
will be a <hi>Restauration, New Heavens</hi> and a <hi>New Earth.</hi> 'Tis the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
doctrine of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> besides other Prophets: We must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
suppose the Earth reduc'd to such a Chaos by this last fire, as
will lay the foundation of a new World.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 12, 13.</note> Which can never be, if
the inward frame of it be broke, the Central Fire exhausted, and
the exterior region suck'd into those central vacuities. This must
needs make it lose its former poise and libration, and it will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
be thrown into some other part of the Universe, as the useless
shell of a broken Granado, or as a dead carkass and unprofitable
matter.</p>
                     <p>These reasons may be sufficient why we should not depend upon
those pretended causes of the Conflagration, The Suns advance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Earth, or such a rupture of the Earth as will let out the
Central Fire. These Causes, I hope, will appear superfluous, when
we shall have given an account of the Conflagration without them.
But young Philosophers, like young Soldiers, think they are never
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41970:149"/>
sufficiently armed; and often take more weapons, than they can
make use of, when they come to fight. Not that we altogether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
the influence of the Sun, or of the Central Fire; especially the
latter. For in that great estuation of Nature, the Body of the
Earth will be much open'd and relaxated; and when the pores
are enlarg'd, the steams of that fire will sweat out more plentifully
into all its parts; but still without any rupture in the vessels or in
the skin. And whereas these Authors suppose the very Veins burst,
and the vital blood to gush out, as at openflood gates, we only allow
a more copious perspiration, and think that sufficient for all purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in this case.</p>

                     <p>AS we have, in the preceding Chapter, laid aside those Causes
of the Conflagration, which we thought too great and cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bersome;
so now we must, in like manner, examine the Effect, and
reduce that to its just measures and proportions; that there may be
nothing lest superfluous on either side: Then, by comparing the
real powers with the work they are to do, bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>h being stated within
their due bounds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we may the better judge how they are proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
to one another.</p>
                     <p>We noted before, that the Conflagration had nothing to do with
the Stars and superiour Heavens, but was wholly confin'd to this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary
World. And this Deluge of Fire will have much what the
same bounds, that the Deluge of Water had formerly. This is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s. doctrine, for he makes the same parts of the
Universe to be the subject of both: namely, the inferiour Heavens
and the Earth. <hi>The Heavens and the Earth which were then, perish'd
in a Deluge of Water:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 5. 6. Ver. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>But the Heavens and the Earth that are now, are
reserv'd to fire.</hi> The present Heavens and Earth are substituted in
the place of those that perish'd at the Deluge, and these are to be
over-run and destroy'd by fire, as those were by water. So
that the Apostle takes the same Regions, and the same space and
compass for the one as for the other, and makes their fate different
according to their different constitution, and the different order of
Providence. This is the sence St. <hi>Austin</hi> gives us of the Apostle's
words, and these are the bounds he sets to the last Fire; whereof
a modern Commentator is so well assur'd, that he says, <hi>They neither
understand Divinity,</hi>

                        <pb n="36" facs="tcp:41970:150"/>
Let these be then its limits upwards, the Clouds, Air, and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosphere
of the Earth. But the question seems more doubtful, <hi>How</hi>
far it will extend downwards, into the bowels of the Earth. I
answer still, to the same depth that the Waters of the Deluge reach'd:
To the lowest Abysses and the deepest Caverns within the ground.
And seeing no Caverns are deeper or lower, at least according to our
Theory, than the bottom of the great Ocean, to that depth, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
the rage of this fire will pene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rate, and devour all before it.
And therefore we must not imagine, that only the outward turf
and habitable surface of the Earth will be put into a flame and laid
wast; the whole exteriour region of the Earth, to the depth of
the deepest part of the Sea, will suffer in this Fire; and suffer to
that degree, as to be melted down, and the frame of it dissolv'd.
For we are not to conceive that the Earth will be only scorcht or
charkt in the last Fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there will be a sort of liquefaction and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution;<note place="margin">Rev. 15. 2. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pet. 3. 10. Psal. 97. 5.</note>
it will become a <hi>molten Sea mingled with fire,</hi> according to
the expression of Scripture. And this dissolution may reasonably be
suppos'd to reach as low as the Earth hath any hollownesses, or can
give <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Wherefore taking these for the bounds and limits of the last great
Fire, the next thing to be enquir'd into are the <hi>Natural Causes</hi> of
it. How this strange fate will seize upon the Sublunary World,
and with an irresistible fury subdue all things to it self. But when
I say <hi>Natural Causes,</hi> I would not be so understood, as if I thought
the Conflagration was a pure <hi>Natural Fatality,</hi> as the <hi>Stoicks</hi> seem
to do. No, 'tis a <hi>mixt Fatality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> The Causes indeed are Natural,
but the administration of them is from an higher hand. Fire is the
Instrument, or the executive power, and hath no more force given
it, than what it hath naturally; but the concurrence of these
Causes or of these fiery powers, at such a time, and in such a
manner, and the conduct of them to carry on and compleat the
whole work without cessation or interruption, that I look upon as
more than what material Nature could effect of it self, or than could
be brought to pass by such a government of matter, as is the bare
result of its own laws and determinations. When a Ship fails
gently before the Wind, the Mariners may stand idle; but to guide
her in a storm, all hands must be at work. There are rules and
measures to be observ'd, even in these tumults and desolations of
Nature, in destroying a World, as well as in making one, and
therefore in both it is reasonable to suppose a more than ordinary
Providence to superintend the work. Let us not therefore be too posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
or presumptuous in our conjectures about these things, for if
there be an invisible hand, Divine or Angelical, that touches the
Springs and Wheels; it will not be easie for us to determine, with
certainty, the order of their motions. However 'tis our duty to
search into the ways and works of God, as far as we can: And
we may without offence look into the Magazines of Nature, see
what provisions are made, and what preparations for this great
Day; and in what method 'tis most likely the design will be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>
                     <p>

But before we proceed to mark out Materials for this Fire, give
me leave to observe one condition or property in the Form of this
present Earth, that makes it capable of Inflammation. 'Tis the
manner of its construction, in an hollow eavernous form; By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
whereof, containing much Air in its cavities, and having many
inlets and outlets, 'tis in most places capable of ventilation, pervious
and passable to the Winds, and consequently to the Fire. Those
that have read the former part of this Theory,<note place="margin">Book 1. ch. 6, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </note> know how the Earth
came into this hollow and broken form, from what causes and at
what time; namely, at the Universal Deluge; when there was a
disruption of the exteriour Earth that fell into the Abyss, and so,
for a time, was overflow'd with Water. These Ruines recover'd
from the Water, we inhabit, and these Ruines only will be burnt
up; For being not only unequal in their Surface, but also hollow,
loose, and incompact within, as ruines use to be, they are made there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
by capable of a second fate, by inflammation. <hi>Thereby,</hi> I say, they
are made combustible; for if the exteriour Regions of this Earth
were as close and compact in all their parts, as we have reason to
believe the interiour Regions of it to be, the Fire could have little
power over it, nor ever reduce it to such a state as is requir'd in a
compleat Conflagration, such as ours is to be.</p>
                     <p>This being admitted, that the Exteriour Region of the Earth stands
hollow, as a well set Fire, to receive Air freely into its parts, and
hath issues for smoke and flame: It remains to enquire what fewel
or Materials Nature hath fitted to kindle this Pile, and to continue
it on Fire till it be consum'd; or, in plain words, What are the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Causes and preparatives for a Conflagration.</hi> The first and most
obvious preparations that we see in Nature for this effect, are the
<hi>Burning Mountains</hi> or Volcano's of the Earth. These are lesser Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>says
or preludes to the general Fire; set on purpose by Providence
to keep us awake, and to mind us continually, and forewarn us of
what we are to expect at last. The Earth you see is already kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
blow but the Coal, and propagate the Fire, and the work will
go on.<note place="margin">Isa. 30. 33.</note> 
                        <hi>Tophet is prepar'd of old,</hi> and when the Day of Doom is
come, and the Date of the World expir'd, <hi>the breath of the Lord</hi> shall
make it burn.</p>
                     <p>But besides these Burning Mountains, there are Lakes of pitch
and brimstone and oily Liquors disperst in several parts of the Earth.
These are in enrage the Fire as it goes, and to fortifie it against any
resistance or opposition. Then all the vegetable productions upon
the Surface of the Earth, as Trees, shrubs, grass, corn, and such
like; Every thing that grows out of the ground, is fewel for the
Fire; and tho' they are now accommodated to our use and service,
they will then turn all against us; and with a mighty blaze, and
rapid course, make a devastation of the outward fumrniture of the
Earth, whether natural or artificial. But these things deserve some
further consideration, especially that strange Phaenomenon of the
<hi>Voleano</hi>'s or <hi>Burning Mountains,</hi> which we will now consider more
particularly.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing certainly more terrible in all Nature than Fiery
Mountains, to those that live within the view or noise of them;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41970:151"/>
but it is not easie for us, who never see them nor heard them, to
represent them to our selves with such just and lively imaginations
as shall excite in us the same passions, and the same horrour as they
would excite, if present to our senses. The time of their eruption
and of their raging, is, of all others, the most dreadful; but, many
times, before their eruption, the symptomes of an approaching fit
are very frightful to the People. The Mountain begins to roar and
bellow in its hollow caverns; cries out, as it were, in pain to be
deliver'd of some burthen, too heavy to be born, and too big to be
easily discharg'd. The Earth shakes and trembles, in apprehension
of the pangs and convulsions that are coming upon her; And the
Sun often hides his head, or appears with a discolour'd face, pale,
or dusky, or bloudy, as if all Nature was to suffer in this Agony.
After these forerunners or symptomes of an eruption, the wide jaws
of the Mountain open: And first, clouds of smoke issue out, then
flames of fire, and after that a mixture of all sorts of burning mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
red hot stones, lumps of metal, half-dissolv'd minerals, with
coals and fiery ashes. These fall in thick showres round about the
Mountain, and in all adjacent parts; and not only so, but are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
partly by the force of the expulsion, and partly by the winds,
when they are aloft in the Air, into far distant Countries. As from
<hi>Italy</hi> to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and cross the Mediterranean Sea into <hi>Africk;</hi>
as the best Historians, <hi>Procopius, Ammianus Marc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>llinus,</hi> and <hi>Dion
Cassius,</hi> have attested.</p>
                     <p>These Volcano's are planted in several regions of the Earth, and
in both Continents, This of ours, and the other of <hi>America.</hi> For
by report of those that have view'd that new-found World, there
are many Mountains in it that belch out Smoke and Fire; some
constantly, and others by fits and intervals. In our Continent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
hath variously disperst them, without any rule known to
us; but they are generally in Islands or near the Sea. In the Asi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atick
Oriental Islands they are in great abundance, and Historians
tell us of a Mountain in the Island <hi>Iava,</hi> that in the year, 1586. at
one eruption kill'd ten thousand people in the neighbouring Cities
and Country. But we do not know so well the History of those
remote Volcano's, as of such as are in <hi>Europe</hi> and nearer home.
In <hi>Iseland,</hi> tho' it lie within the Polar Circle, and is scarce habitable
by reason of the extremity of cold, and abundance of Ice and Snow,
yet there are three burning Mountains in that Island; whereof the
chief and most remarkable is <hi>Hecla.</hi> This hath its head always co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with Snow, and its belly always fill'd with Fire; and these
are both so strong in their kind, and equally powerful, that they
cannot destroy one another. It is said to cast out, when it rages,
besides Earth, stones and ashes, a sort of flaming water. As if all
contrarieties were to meet in this Mountain to make it the more
perfect resemblance of Hell, as the credulous inhabitants fancy it
to be.</p>
                     <p>But there are no Volcano's in my opinion, that deserve our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
so much, as those that are in and about the <hi>Mediterranean
Sea;</hi> There is a knot of them called the <hi>Vulcanian Islands,</hi> from
their fiery eruptions, as if they were the Forges of <hi>Vulcan;</hi> as
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41970:151"/>
                        <hi>Strombolo, Lipara,</hi> and others, which are not so remarkable now as
they have been formerly. However, without dispute, there are
none in the Christian World to be compared with <hi>Aetna</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suvius;</hi>
one in the Island of <hi>Sicily;</hi> and the other in <hi>Campanid,</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking
the Port and City of <hi>Naples.</hi> These two, from all memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Man and the most ancient Records of History, have been fam'd
for their Treasures of subterraneous Fiers: which are not yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted,
nor diminish'd, so far as is perceivable; for they rage
still, upon occasions, with as much fierceness and violence, as they
ever did in former Ages; as if they had a continual supply to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
their expences, and were to stand till the last Fire, as a type
and prefiguration of it, throughout all generations.</p>
                     <p>Let us therefore take these two Volcano's as a pattern for the
rest; seeing they are well known, and stand in the heart of the
Christian World, where, 'tis likely, the last fire will make its first
assault. <hi>Aetna,</hi> of the two, is more spoken of by the ancients, both
Poets and Historians; and we should scarce give credit to their rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
concerning it, if some later eruptions did not equal or exceed
the same of all that hath been reported from former ages. That it
heated the Waters of the Sea, and cover'd them over with ashes;
crack'd or dissolv'd the neighbouring Rocks; darkened the Sun and
the Air; and cast out, not only mighty streams of flame, but a
floud of melted Ore and other Materials; These things we can
now believe, having had experience of greater, or an account of them
from such as have been eye-witnesses of these fires, or of the fresh
ruines and sad effects of them.</p>
                     <p>There are two things especially, in these Eruptions of <hi>Aetna,</hi>
that are most prodigious in themselves and most remarkable for our
purpose. The Rivers of fiery matter that break out of its bowels,
or are spew'd out of its mouth; and the vast burning stones which
it slings into the Air, at a strange height and distance. As to these
fiery Rivers or Torrents, and the matter whereof they are compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
we have a full account of them by <hi>Alphonsus Borellus,</hi> a learned
Mathematician at <hi>Pisa;</hi> who, after the last great Eruption in the
year 1669. went into <hi>Sicily,</hi> while the fact was fresh, to view and
survey what <hi>Aetna</hi> had done or suffer'd. And he says the quantity
of matter thrown out of the Mountain at that time, upon survey
amounted to Ninety three millions, eight hundred thirty eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
seven hundred and fifty cubical paces. So that if it had been
extended in length upon the surface of the Earth, at the breadth
and depth of 3 foot, it would have reacht further than ninety three
millions of paces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is more than four times the Circuit of
the whole Earth, taking a thousand paces to a mile. This is strange
to our imagination and almost incredible, that one Mountain should
throw out so much fiery matter, besides all the ashes that were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perst
through the Air, far and near, and could be brought to no
account.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, all this matter was not actually inflam'd or liquid fire.
But the rest that was sand, stone and gravel, might have run into
glass or some melted liquor like to it, is it had not been thrown out
before the heat fully reacht it. However, sixty million paces of this
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41970:152"/>
matter, as the same Author computes, were liquid fire, or came
out of the mouth of the pit in that form. This made a River of
fire, sometimes two miles broad, according to his computation; but
according to the observation of others who also viewed it, the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of fire was six or seven miles broad, and sometimes ten or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
fathoms deep; and forc'd its way into the Sea near a mile, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
it self alive in the midst of the waters.</p>
                     <p>This is beyond all the infernal Lakes and Rivers, <hi>Acheron, Phlege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
Cocytus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> all that the Poets have talkt of. Their greatest ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
about He I have not come up to the reality of one of our bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Mountains upon Earth. Imagin then all our <hi>Volcano</hi>'s raging
at once in this manner.—But I will not pursue that supposition
yet; Give me leave only to add here what I mentioned in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
place, The vast <hi>Burning Stones</hi> which this Mountain, in the
time of its rage and estuation, threw in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o the Air with an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
force. This same Author tells us of a stone fifteen foot long, that
was slung out of the mouth of the pit, to a miles distance. And
when it fell, it came from such an height and with such a violence,
that it buried it self in the ground eight foot deep. What trifles
are our Mortar-pieces and Bombes, when compar'd with these En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
of Nature? When she flings out of the wide throat of a Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano,
a broken Rock, and twirles it in the air like a little bullet;
then lets it fall to do execution here below, as Providence shall
point and direct it. It would be hard to give an account how so
great an impulse can be given to a Body so ponderous. But there's
no disputing against matter of fact; and as the thoughts of God are
not like our thoughts, so neither are his works like our works.</p>

the</hi> Roman <hi>History) hath given us an account of one that happened
in the time of</hi> Titus Vespatian; <hi>and tho' he hath not set down
particulars, as the former Author did, of the quantity of fiery
matter thrown out at that time: yet supposing that proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to its fierceness in other respects, this seems to me as dreadful
an Eruption as any we read of; and was accompanied with such
Prodigies and commotions in the Heavens and the Earth, as made
it look like the beginning of the last Conflagration. As a prelude to
this Tragedy, He says there were strange sights in the air, and after
that followed an extraordinary drought,</hi> Then the Earth begun to
tremble and quake, and the Concussions were so great that the ground seem'd
to rise and boyl up in some places, and in others the tops of the mountains
sunk in or tumbled down. At the same time were great noises and sounds
heard, some were subterraneous, like thunder within the Earth; others
above ground, like groans or bellowings. The Sea roar'd, The heavens
ratled with a fearful noise, and then came a sudden and mighty crack, as
if the frame of Nature had broke, or all the mountains of the Earth had
faln down at once. At length <hi>Vesuvius</hi> burst, and threw out of its womb,
first, huge stones, then a vast quantity of fire and smoke, so as the air was

                        </gap>all darkned, and the Sun was hid, as if he had been under a great Eclipse.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41970:152"/>
The day was turn'd into night, and light into darkness; and the frighted
people thought the Gyants were making war against heaven, and fansied
they see the shapes and images of Gyants in the smoak, and heard the
sound of their trumpets. Others thought the World was returning to its
first Chaos, or going to be all consum'd with fire. In this general confusion
and consternation they knew not where to be safe, some run out of the fields
into the houses, others out of the house into the fields; Those that were at
Sea hasten'd to Land, and those that were at Land endeavour'd to get to
Sea; still thinking every place safer than that where they were. Besides
grosser lumps of matter, there was thrown out of the Mountain such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
quantity of ashes, as cover'd the Land and Sea, and fill'd the Air,
so as, besides other damages, the Birds, Beasts, and Fishes, with Men,
Women and Children, were destroy'd, within such a compass; and two en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Cities, <hi>Herculanium</hi> and <hi>Pompeios,</hi> were overwhelm'd with a
showre of ashes, as the People were sitting in the Theater. Nay, these
ashes were carried <hi>by the winds</hi> over the Mediterranean into Africk, and
into Aegypt and Syria. And at <hi>Rome</hi> they choak'd the Air on a sudden,
so as to hid the face of the Sun. Whereupon the People, not knowing the
cause, as not having yet got the News from Campania of the Eruption of
Vesuius, could not imagine what the reason should be; but thought the
Heavens and the Earth were coming together, The Sun coming down, and
the Earth going to take its place above. <hi>Thus far the Historian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You see what disorders in Nature, and what an alarum, the Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of one fiery Mountain is capable to make; These things, no
doubt, would have made strong impressions upon us, if we had been
eye-witnesses of them; But I know, representations made from
dead history, and at a distance, though the testimony be never so
credible, have a much less effect upon us than what we see our
selves, and what our senses immediately inform us of. I have only
given you an account of two Volcano's, and of a single Eruption in
either of them; These Mountains are not very far distant from one
another: Let us suppose two such Eruptions, as I have mention'd,
to happen at the same time, and both these Moutains to be raging
at once, in this manner; By that violence you have seen in each of
them singly, you will easily imagine what a terrour and desolation
they would carry round about, by a conjunction of their fury and
all their effects, in the Air and on the Earth. Then, if to these
two, you should joyn two more, the Sphere of their activity would
still be enlarg'd, and the Scenes become more dreadful. But, to
compleat the supposition, Let us imagine all the Volcano's of the
whole Earth, to be prepar'd and set to a certain time; which time
being come, and a signal given by Providence, all these Mines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to play at once; I mean, All these Fiery Mountains burst out,
and discharge themselves in flames of fire, tear up the roots of the
Earth, throw hot burning stones, send out streams of flowing Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
and Minerals, and all other sorts of ardent matter, which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath lodg'd in those Treasuries. If all these Engines, I say, were
to play at once, the Heavens and the Earth would seem to be in a
flame, and the World in an universal combustion. But we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
presume, that against that great Day of vengeance and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
not only all these will be employ'd, but also new Volcano's
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41970:153"/>
will be open'd, and new Mountains in every Region will break out
into smoke and flame; just as at the Deluge, the Abyss broke out
from the Womb of the Earth, and from those hidden stores sent an
immense quantity of water, which, it may be, the Inhabitants of
that World never thought of before. So we must expect new Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and also new sulphureous Lakes and Fountains of Oyl, to
boyl out of the ground; And these all united with that Fewel that
naturally grows upon the Surface of the Earth, will be sufficient to
give the first onset, and to lay wast all the habitable World, and the
Furniture of it.</p>
                     <p>But we suppose the Conflagration will go lower, pierce under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground,
and dissolve the substance of the Earth to some considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
depth; therefore besides these outward and visible preparations,
we must consider all the hidden invisible Materials within the Veins
of the Earth; Such are all Minerals or Mineral juices and concreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that are igniferous, or capable of inflammation; And these can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
easily be reckon'd up or estimated. Some of the most common
are, Sulphur, and all sulphureous bodies, and Earths impregnated
with Sulphur, Bitumen and bituminous concretions; inflammable
Salts, Coal and other fossiles that are ardent, with innumerable
mixtures and compositions of these kinds, which being open'd by
heat, are unctuous and inflammable; or by attrition discover the
latent seeds of fire. But besides consistent Bodies, there is also much
volatile fire within the Earth, in fumes, steams, and exudations,
which will all contribute to this effect. From these stores under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground
all Plants and Vegetables are fed and supply'd, as to their
oily and sulphureous parts; And all hot Waters in Baths or Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
must have their original from some of these, some mixture or
participation of them. And as to the <hi>British</hi> Soyl, there is so much
Coal incorporated with it, that when the Earth shall burn, we have
reason to apprehend no small danger from that subterraneous
Enemy.</p>
                     <p>These dispositions, and this Fewel we find, in and upon the Earth,
towards the last Fire. The third sort of Provision is in the Air;
All fiery Meteors and Exhalations engender'd and form'd in those
Regions above, and discharg'd upon the Earth in several ways. I
believe there were no fiery Meteors in the ante-diluvian Heavens;
which therefore St. <hi>Peter</hi> says, <hi>were constituted of water;</hi> had nothing
in them but what was watery. But he says, <hi>the Heavens that are now</hi>
have treasures of fire, or are reserv'd for fire, as things laid up in a
store house for that purpose. We have thunder and lightning, and
fiery tempests, and there is nothing more vehement, impetuous, and
irresistible, where their force is directed. It seems to me very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
that the Holy Writers describe the <hi>coming of the Lord,</hi> and
the destruction of the wicked, in the nature of a tempest, or a storm
of fire.<note place="margin">Psal. 11. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Upon the wicked the Lord shall rain coals, fire and brimstone, and
a burning tempest, this shall be the portion of their cup.</hi> And in the
lofty Song of <hi>David (Psal. 18.)</hi> which, in my judgment, respects
both the past Deluge and the future Conflagration, 'tis said, <hi>The
Lord also thundred in the heavens,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">ver. 13, 14, 15.</note> 
                        <hi>and the Highest gave his voice, hail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones
and coals of fire. Yea, he sent forth his arrows and scattered them,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41970:153"/>
and he shot out lightnings and discomfited them. Then the Chanels of
waters were seen, and the foundations of the World were discover'd; at thy
rebuke, O Lord, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.</hi> And a like
fiery coming is describ'd in the ninety seventh Psalm,<note place="margin">Isa. 66. 15.</note> as also by <hi>Isaiah,
Daniel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dan. 7. 9, 10.</note> and S. <hi>Paul.</hi> And lastly, in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> when the World
draws to a conclusion,<note place="margin">2 Thess. 1. 8.</note> as in the seventh Trumpet <hi>(ch. 11. 19.)</hi> and
the seventh Vial <hi>(ch. 16. 18.)</hi> we have still mention made of this
Fiery Tempest of Lightnings and Thunderings.</p>
                     <p>We may therefore reasonably suppose, that, before the Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration,
the Air will be surcharg'd every where, (by a precedent
drought) with hot and fiery exhalations; And as against the Deluge,
those regions were burthened with water and moist vapours, which
were pour'd upon the Earth, not in gentle showres, but like rivers
and cataracts from Heaven; so they will now be fill'd with hot
fumes and sulphureous clouds, which will sometimes flow in streams
and fiery impressions throgh the Air, sometimes make Thunder and
Lightnings, and sometimes fall down upon the Earth in flouds of
Fire. In general, there is a great analogy to be observed betwixt
the two Deluges, of Water and of Fire; not only as to the bounds
of them, which were noted before; but as to the general causes and
sources upon which they depend, from above and from below. At
the Floud the Windows of Heaven were opened above, and the
Abyss was opened below; and the Waters of these two joyn'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to overflow the World. In like manner, at the Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
God will rain down Fire from Heaven, as he did once upon
<hi>Sodom;</hi> and at the same time the subterraneous store-houses of Fire
will be broken open, which answers to the disruption of the Abyss:
And these two meeting and mingling together, will involve all the
Heaven and Earth in flames.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This is a short account of the ordinary stores of Nature, and the
ordinary preparations for a general Fire; And in contemplation of
these,</hi> Pliny <hi>the Naturalist, said boldly,</hi> It was one of the greatest won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the World, that the World was not every day set on fire. <hi>We
will conclude this Chapter with his words, in the second Book of
his</hi> Natural History;<note place="margin">ch. 106, 107.</note> 
                        <hi>having given an account of some fiery Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and other parts of the Earth that are the seats and sources of
Fire, He makes this reflection;</hi> Seeing this Element is so fruitful that
it brings forth it self, and multiplies and encreases from the least sparks,
what are we to expect from so many fires already kindled on the Earth?
How does nature feed and satisfie so devouring an Element, and such a
great voracity throughout all the World, without loss or diminution of her
self? Add to these fires we have mentioned, the Stars and the Great
Sun, then all the fires made for humane uses; fire in stones, in wood,
in the clouds and in thunder; IT EXCEEDS ALL MIRACLES,
IN MY OPINION, THAT ONE DAY SHOULD PASS
WITHOUT SETTING THE WORLD ALL ON FIRE.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VIII. Some new dispositions towards the Conflagration, as to the
matter, form, and situation of the Earth. Concerning
miraculous Causes, and how far the ministery of Angels
may be engaged in this Work.</head>
                     <p>WE have given an account, in the preceding Chapter, of
the ordinary preparatious of Nature for a general fire; We
now are to give an account of the extraordinary, or of any new
dispositions, which towards the End of the World, may be super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added
to the ordinary state of Nature. I do not, by these, mean
things openly miraculous, and supernatural, but such a change
wrought in Nature as shall still have the face of Natural Causes,
and yet have a greater tendency to the Conflagration. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
suppose a great Drought, as we noted before, to precede
this fate, or a general heat and dryness of the Air and of the Earth;
because this happens sometimes in a course of Nature, it will not be
lookt upon as prodigious. 'Tis true, some of the Ancients speak of
a Drought of Forty Years, that will be a forerunner of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration,
so that there will not be a watery Cloud, nor a Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow
seen in the Heavens, for so long time. And this they impute
to <hi>Elias,</hi> who, at his coming, will stop the Rain and shut up the
Heavens to make way for the last Fire. But these are excessive and
ill-grounded suppositions, for half forty years drought will bring an
universal sterility upon the Earth, and thereupon an Universal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
with innumerable diseases; so that all mankind would be
destroyed before the Conflagration could overtake them.</p>
                     <p>But we will readily admit an extraordinary drought and desic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of all bodies to usher in this great fatality. And therefore
whatsoever we read in Natural History, concerning former droughts,
of their drying up Fountains and Rivers, parching the Earth and
making the outward Turf take fire in several places; filling the
Air with fiery impressions, making the Woods and Forests ready
Fewel, and sometimes to kindle by the heat of the Sun or a flash
of Lightning: These and what other effects have come to pass in
former droughts, may come to pass again; and that in an higher
measure, and so as to be of more general extent. And we must
also allow, that by this means, a great degree of inflammability, or
easiness to be set on Fire, will be superinduc'd, both into the body
of the Earth, and of all things that grow upon it. The heat of
the Sun will pierce deeper into its bowels, when it gapes to receive
his beams, and by chinks and widened pores makes way for their
passage to its very heart. And, on the other hand, it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable,
but that upon this general relaxation and incalescency
of the Body of the Earth, the <hi>General Fire</hi> may have a freer efflux,
and diffuse it self in greater abundance every way; so as to affect
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41970:154"/>
even these exteriour Regions of the Earth, so far as to make them
still more catching and more combustible.</p>
                     <p>From this external and internal heat acting upon the Body of
the Earth, all Minerals that have the seeds of fire in them, will be
open'd, and exhale their effluvium's more copiously: as Spices, when
warm'd, are more odoriferous, and fill the Air with their perfumes;
so the particles of fire, that are shut up in several bodies, will easily
flie abroad, when by a further degree of relaxation you shake off
their chains, and open the Prison-doors. We cannot doubt, but
there are many sorts of Minerals, and many sorts of Fire-stones, and
of Trees and Vegetables of this nature, which will sweat out their
oily and sulphureous atomes, when by a general heat and driness
their parts are loosen'd and agitated.</p>
                     <p>We have no experience that will reach so far, as to give us a full
account what the state of Nature will be at that time; I mean, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this drought, towards the end of the world; But we may help
our imagination, by comparing it with other seasons and tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Air. As therefore in the Spring the Earth is fragrant,
and the Fields and Gardens are fill'd with the sweet breathings of
Herbs and Flowers; especially after a gentle rain, when their Bodies
are softned, and the warmth of the Sun makes them evaporate more
freely; So a greater degree of heat acting upon all the bodies of the
Earth, like a stronger fire in the Alembick, will extract another sort
of parts or particles, more deeply incorporated and more difficult
to be disintangled; I mean oily parts, and such undiscover'd parcels
of fire, as lie fix'd and imprison'd in hard bodies. These, I imagine,
will be in a great measure set a float, on drawn out into the Air;
which will abound with hot and dry Exhalations, more than with
vapours and moisture in a wet season; and by this means, all Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and elementary Bodies will stand ready, and in a proximate
disposition to be inflam'd.</p>
                     <p>Thus much concerning the last drought, and the general effects
of it. In the next place, we must consider the Earthquakes that
will precede the Conflagration, and the consequences of them. I
noted before, that the cavernous and broken construction of the
present Earth, was that which made it obnoxious to be destroy'd by
fire; as its former construction over the Abyss, made it obnoxious
to be destroy'd with Water. This hollowness of the Earth is most
sensible in mountainous and hilly Countreys, which therefore I look
upon as most subject to burning; but the plain Countreys may also
be made hollow and hilly by Earth-quakes, when the vapours not
finding an easie vent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> raise the ground and make a forcible eruption,
as at the springing of a Mine. And tho' plain Countreys are not so
subject to Earthquakes as Mountainous, because they have not so
many cavities and subterraneous Vaults to lodge the vapours in;
yet every Region hath more or less of them: And after this drought
the vacuities of the Earth being every where enlarg'd, the quantity
of exhalations much encreas'd, and the motion of them more strong
and violent, they will have their effects in many places where they
never had any before. Yet I do not suppose that this will raise new
ridges of Mountains, like the <hi>Alpes</hi> or <hi>Pyreneans,</hi> in those Countreys
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41970:155"/>
that are now plain, but that they will break and loosen the ground,
make greater inequalities in the surface, and greater cavities with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
than what are at present in those places; And by this means,
the fire will creep under them, and find a passage thorow them,
with more ease, than if they were compact, and every where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
and unbroken.</p>
                     <p>But you will say, it may be, how does it appear, that there will
be more frequent Earth-quakes towards the end of the World? If
this precedent drought be admitted, 'tis plain that fiery exhalations
will abound every where within the Earth, and will have a greater
agitation than ordinary; and these being the causes of Earth-quakes,
when they are rarified or inflam'd, 'tis reasonable to suppose that in
such a state of Nature, they will more frequently happen, than at
other times. Besides, Earth-quakes are taken notice of in Scripture,
as signs and forerunners of the last day, as they usually are of all
great changes and calamities. The destruction of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was a
type of the destruction of the World, and the Evangelists always
mention Earth-quakes amongst the ominous Prodigies that were
to attend it. But these Earth-quakes we are speaking of at present,
are but the beginnings of sorrow, and not to be compar'd with those
that will follow afterwards, when Nature is convulst in her last
agony, just as the flames are seizing on her. Of which we shall have
occasion to speak hereafter.</p>
                     <p>These changes will happen as to the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>form</hi> of the Earth,
before it is attack'd by the last fire; There will be also another
change as to the <hi>situation</hi> of it; for that will be rectified, and the
Earth restor'd to the posture it had at first, namely, of a right aspect
and conversion to the Sun. But because I cannot determine at what
time this restitution will be, whether at the beginning, middle, or
end of the Conflagration, I will not presume to lay any stress upon
it. <hi>Plato</hi> seems to have imputed the Conflagration to this only;
which is so far true, that the Revolution call'd <hi>The Great Year,</hi> is
this very Revolution, or the return of the Earth and the Heavens
to their first posture. But tho' this may be contemporary with the last
fire, or some way concomitant; yet it does not follow that it
is the cause of it, much less the only cause. It may be an occasion
of making the fire reach more easily towards the Poles, when by this
change of situation their long Nights and long Winters shall be taken
away.</p>
                     <p>These new dispositions in our Earth which we expect before that
great day, may be look'd upon as extraordinary, but not as Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,
because they may proceed from Natural Causes. But now
in the last place, we are to consider <hi>miraculous causes:</hi> What in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
they may have, or what part they may bear, in this great
revolution of Nature. By <hi>miraculous causes</hi> we understand either
God's immediate Omnipotency, or the Ministry of Angels; and
what may be perform'd by the latter, is very improperly and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
thrown upon the former. 'Tis a great step to Omnipotency:
and 'tis hard to define what Miracles, on this side Creation, require
an infinite power. We are sure that the Angels are Ministring Spirits,
and ten thousand times ten thousand stand about the Throne of the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41970:155"/>
Almighty, to receive his commands and execute his judgments.
That perfect knowledge they have of the powers of nature, and of
conducting those powers to the best advantage, by adjusting causes
in a fit subordination one to another, makes them capable of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming,
not only things far above our force, but even above our
imagination. Besides, they have a radical inherent power, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the excellency of their nature, of determining the motions of
matter, within a far greater sphere than humane Souls can pretend
to. We can only command our spirits, and determine their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
within the compass of our own Bodies; but their activity and
empire is of far greater extent, and the outward World is much
more subject to their dominion than to ours. From these conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
it is reasonable to conclude, that the generality of miracles
may be and are perform'd by Angels; It being less decorous to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
a Sovereign power, where a subaltern is sufficient, and when
we hastily cast things upon God, for quick dispatch, we consult our
own ease more than the honouor of our Maker.</p>
                     <p>I take it for granted here, that what is done by an Angelical
hand, is truly providential, and of divine administration; and also
justly bears the character of a miracle. Whatsoever may be done
by pure material causes, or humane strength, we account Natural;
and whatsoever is above these we call supernatural and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
Now what is supernatural and miraculous is either the effect
of an Angelical power, or of a Sovereign and Infinite power. And
we ought not to confound these two, no more than Natural and
Supernatural; for there is a greater difference betwixt the highest
Angelical power and Omnipotency, than betwixt an Humane pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Angelical. Therefore as the first Rule concerning miracles is
this, That we must not flie to miracles, where Man and Nature are
sufficient; so the second Rule is this, that we must not flie to a sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
infinite power, where an Angelical is sufficient. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in both Rules is the same, namely, because it argues a defect of
Wisdom in all Oeconomiles to employ more and greater means than
are sufficient.</p>
                     <p>Now to make application of this to our present purpose, I think
it reasonable, and also sufficient, to admit the ministery of Angels
in the future Conflagration of the World. If Nature will not lay
violent hands upon her self, or is not sufficient to work her own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
Let us allow <hi>Destroying Angels</hi> to interest themselves in the
work, as the Executioners of the Divine Justice and Vengeance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a degenerate World. We have examples of this so frequently
in Sacred History, how the Angels have executed God's Judgments
upon a Nation or a People, that it cannot seem new or strange, that
in this last judgment, which by all the Prophets is represented as
the <hi>Great Day of the Lord,</hi> the day of his Wrath and of his Fury,
the same Angels should bear their parts, and conclude the last scene
of that Tragedy which they had acted in all along. We read of the
<hi>Destroying Angel in Aegypt;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 12. 23.</note> of Angels that presided at the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                        <note place="margin">Gen. 19. 13.</note> which was a Type of the future destrution of the
World,<note place="margin">

only, but Actors and Superintendants in this great Catastrophe.</p>
                     <p>This ministery of Angels may be either in ordering and conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such Natural Causes as we have already given an account of, or
in adding new ones, if occasion be; I mean, encreasing the quantity
of Fire, or of fiery materials, in and about the Earth. So as that
Element, shall be more abundant and more predominant, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
all opposition that either Water, or any other Body, can make
against it. It is not material whether of these two Suppositions we
follow, provided we allow that the Conflagration is a work of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and not a pure Natural Fatality. If it be necessary that
there should be an augmentation made of Fiery Matter, 'tis not hard
to conceive how that may be done, either from the Heavens or from
the Earth.<note place="margin">Isa. 30. 26.</note> The Prophets sometimes speak of multiplying or
strengthning the Light of the Sun, and it may as easily be conceiv'd
of his heat as of his light; as if the Vial that was to be pour'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it,<note place="margin">Rev. 26. 8.</note> and <hi>gave it a power to scorch men with fire,</hi> had something of a
Natural sence as well as Moral. But there is another stream of Ethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
matter that flows from the Heavens, and recruits the <hi>Central
Fire</hi> with continual supplies; This may be encreas'd and strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and its effects convey'd throughout the whole Body of the
Earth.</p>
                     <p>But if an augmentation is to be made of Terrestrial Fire, or of
such terrestrial principles as contain it most, as Sulphur, Oyl, and
such like, I am apt to believe, these will encrease of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
upon a general drought and desiccation of the Earth. For I
am far from the opinion of some Chymists, that think these princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
immutable, and incapable of diminution or augmentation. I
willingly admit that all such particles may be broken and disfigur'd,
and thereby lose their proper and specifick virtue, and new ones
may be generated to supply the places of the former. Which supplies,
or new productions being made in a less or greater measure, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the general dispositions of Nature; when Nature is height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into a kind of Feaver and Ebullition of all her juices and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
as she will be at that time, we must expect that more parts
than ordinary, should be made inflammable, and those that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd
should become more violent. Under these circumstances, when
all Causes lean that way, a little help from a superior power will
have a great effect, and make a great change in the state of the
World. And as to the power of Angels, I am of opinion that it is
very great as to the Changes and Modifications of Natural Bodies;
that they can dissolve a Marble as easily as we can crumble Earth
and Moulds, or fix any liquor, in a moment, into a substance as
hard as Crystal. That they can either make flames more vehement
and irresistible to all sorts of Bodies; or as harmless as Lambent
Fires, and as soft as Oyl. We see an instance of this last, in <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi>'s
fiery Furnace,<note place="margin">Dan. 3. 28.</note> where the three Children walk'd uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in the midst of the Flames, under the charge and protection
of an Angel. And the same Angel, if he had pleas'd, could have
made the same Furnace seven times hotter than the wrath of the
Tyrant had made it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:41970:156"/>
We will therefore leave it to their ministery to manage this great
Furnace, when the Heavens and the Earth are on Fire. To conserve,
encrease, direct, or temper the flames, according to instructions gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them, as they are to be <hi>Tutelary</hi> or <hi>Destroying.</hi> Neither let any
body think it a diminution of Providence to put things into the
hands of Angels; 'Tis the true rule and method of it; For to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
an Almighty power where it is not necessary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is to debase <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>
and give it a task fit for lower Beings. Some think it devotion and
piety to have recourse immediately to the arm of God to salve all
things; This may be done sometimes with a good intention, but
commonly with little judgment. God is as jealous of the glory
of his Wisdom, as of his Power; and Wisdom consists in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
and subordination of several causes to bring our purposes to
effect; but what is dispatched by an immediate Supreme Power,
leaves no room for the exercise of Wisdom. To conclude this
point, which I have touch'd upon more than once, We must not
be partial to any of God's Attributes, and Providence being a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
of many, Power, Wisdom, Justice, and Goodness, when
we give due place and honour to all these, then we most honour
DIVINE PROVIDENCE.</p>

                     <p>WE have now taken a view of the Causes of the Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
both ordinary and extraordinary: It remains to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the manner of it; How these Causes will operate, and bring
to pass an effect so great and so prodigious. We took notice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that the grand obstruction would be from the Sea, and from
the Mountains; we must therefore take these to task in the first
place; and if we can remove them out of our way, or overcome
what resistance and opposition they are capable to make, the rest of
the work will not be uneasie to us.</p>
                     <p>The Ocean indeed is a vast Body of Waters; and we must use all
our art and skill to dry it up, or consume it in a good measure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we can compass our design. I remember the advice a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
gave <hi>Amasis</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> when he had a command sent him
from the King of <hi>Aethiopia, That he should drink up the Sea. Amasis</hi>
being very anxious and sollicitous what answer he should make to
this strange command, the Philosopher <hi>Bias</hi> advis'd him to make
this round answer to the King; <hi>That he was ready to perform his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
and to drink up the Sea, provided he would stop the rivers from
flowing into his cup while he was drinking.</hi> This answer baffled the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41970:157"/>
King, for he could not stop the rivers; but this we must do, or we
shall never be able to drink up the Sea, or burn up the Earth.</p>
                     <p>Neither will this be so impossible as it seems at first sight, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon those preparations we have made towards it, by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
drought all over the Earth. This we suppose will precede <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he
Conflagration, and by drying up the Fountains and Rivers, which
daily feed the Sea, will by degrees starve that Monster, or reduce
it to such a degree of weakness, that it shall not be able to make
any great resistance. More than half an Ocean of Water flows into
the Sea every day, from the Rivers of the Earth, if you take them
all together. This I speak upon a moderate computation. <hi>Aristotle</hi>
says the Rivers carry more water into the Sea, in the space of a
year<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n would equal in bulk the whole Globe of the Earth.
Nay, some have ventur'd to affirm this of one single River, The
<hi>Volga,</hi> that runs into the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea. 'Tis a great River indeed,
and hath seventy mouths; and so it had need have, to disgorge a
mass of Water equal to the Body of the Earth, in a years time. But
we need not take such high measures; There are at least an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
great Rivers that flow into the Sea, from several parts of the
Earth, Islands and Continents, besides several thousands of lesser
ones; Let us suppose these, all together, to pour as much water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Sea-chanel, every day, as is equal to half the Ocean. And we
shall be easily convinc'd of the reasonableness of this supposition, if
we do but examine the daily expence of one River, and by that
make an estimate of the rest. This we find calculated to our hands
in the <hi>River Po</hi> in <hi>Italy;</hi> a River of much what the same bigness
with our <hi>Thames,</hi> and disburthens it self into the Gulph of <hi>Venice.
Baptista Riccioli</hi> hath computed how much water this River dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in an hour, <hi>viz.</hi> 18000000. cubical paces of Water, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
432000000. in a day; which is scarce credible to those that
do not distinctly compute it. Suppose then an hundred Rivers as
great as this or greater, to fall into the Sea from the Land; besides
thousands of lesser, that pay their tribute at the same time into the
great Receit of the Ocean; These all taken together, are capable to
renew the Sea every twice four and twenty hours. VVhich suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
being admitted, if by a great and lasting drought these Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
were dried up, or the Fountains from whence they flow, what
would then become of that vast Ocean, that before was so formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to us?</p>
                     <p>'Tis likely you will say, These great Rivers cannot be dry'd up,
tho' the little ones may; and therefore we must not suppose such an
Universal stop of waters, or that they will all fail, by any drought
whatsoever. But great Rivers being made up of little ones, if these
fail, those must be diminish'd, if not quite drain'd and exhausted.
It may be all Fountains and Springs do not proceed from the same
causes, or the same original; and some are much more copious than
others; for such differences we will allow what is due; but still
the driness of the Air and of the Earth continuing, and all the sour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and supplies of moisture, both from above and from below, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lessen'd or wholly discontinued, a general decay of all Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
and Rivers must necessarily follow, and consequently of the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41970:157"/>
Sea, and of its fulness that depends upon them. And that's enough
for our present purpose.</p>
                     <p>The first step therefore towards the Consumption of the Ocean
will be the diminution or suspension of the Rivers that run into it.
The next will be an Evacuation by Subterraneous passages; and the
last, by Eruptions of Fires in the very Chanel of it, and in the
midst of the Waters. As for Subterraneous Evacutions, we cannot
doubt but that the Sea hath out-lets at the bottom of it; whereby
it discharges that vast quantity of Water that flows into it every day,
and that could not be discharg'd so fast as it comes from the wide
mouths of the Rivers, by percolation or straining thorough the Sands.
Seas also communicate with one another by these internal passages;
as is manifest from those particular Seas that have no external out-let
or issue, tho' they receive into them many great Rivers, and
sometimes the influx of other Seas. So the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea receives not
only <hi>Volga,</hi> which we mention'd before, but several other Rivers,
and yet hath no visible issue for its Waters. The <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea,
besides all the Rivers it receives, hath a current flowing into it, at
either end, from other Seas; from the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean at the streights
of <hi>Gibralter,</hi> and from the Black Sea, above <hi>Constantinople:</hi> and yet
there is no passage above-ground, or visible derivation of the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean</hi>
waters out of their Chanel; which seeing they do not
overfil, nor overflow the Banks, 'tis certain they must have some
secret conveyances into the bowels of the Earth, or subterraneous
communication with other Seas. Lastly, From the Whirl-pools of
the Sea, that suck in Bodies that come within their reach, it seems
plainly to appear, by that attraction and absorption, that there is a
descent of waters in those places.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore when the current of the Rivers into the Sea is stopt,
or in a great measure diminish'd; The Sea continuing to empty it
self by these subterraneous passages, and having little or none of those
supplies that it us'd to have from the Land, it must needs be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
lessen'd; and both contract its Chanel into a narrower com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,
and also have less depth in the waters that remain. And in
the last place, we must expect fiery eruptions in several parts of the
Sea-chanel, which will help to suck up or evaporate the remaining
Waters. In the present state of Nature there have been several in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of such eruptions of Fire from the bottom of the Sea; and
in that last state of Nature, when all things are in a tendency to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation,
and when Earth-quakes and Eruptions will be more
frequent every where, we must expect them also more frequently by
Sea, as well as by Land. 'Tis true, neither Earth-quakes nor Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
can happen in the middle of the Great Ocean, or in the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Abyss, because there are no cavities, or mines below it, for the
vapours and exhalations to lodge in; But 'tis not much of the Sea-chanel
that is so deep, and in other parts, especially in streights and
near Islands, such Eruptions, like Sea-Volcano's, have frequently
happen'd, and new Islands have been made by such fiery matter
thrown up from the bottom of the Sea. Thus, they say, those
Islands in the Mediterranean call'd the <hi>Vulcanian</hi> Islands, had their
original; being matter cast up from the bottom of the Sea, by the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41970:158"/>
force of Fire; as new Mountains sometimes are rais'd upon the Earth.
Another Island in the <hi>Archipelago</hi> had the same original, whereof
<hi>Strabo</hi> gives an account.<note place="margin">Lib. 1.</note> The <hi>flames,</hi> he says, <hi>sprung up through the
waters, four days togeth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>r, so as the whole Sea was hot and burning;
and they rais'd by degrees, as with Engines, a mass of Earth, which
made a new Island, twelve furlongs in compass.</hi> And in the same <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chipelago,</hi>
flames and smoke have several times (particularly in the
year 1650.) rise out of the Sea, and fill'd the Air with sulphureous
scents and vapours. In like manner, in the Island of S. <hi>Michel,</hi> one
of the <hi>Tercera</hi>'s, there have been, of later years, such eructations of fire
and flames; so strong and violent, that, at the depth of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and sixty fathoms, they forc'd their way through the midst of
the Waters, from the bottom of the Sea into the open Air. As
has been related by those that were eye-witnesses.</p>
                     <p>In these three ways I conceive, the great force of the Sea will be
broken, and the mighty Ocean reduc'd to a standing Pool of putrid
waters, without vent and without recruits. But there will still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in the midst of the Chanel a great mass of troubled liquors,
like dregs in the bottom of the vessel; which will not be drunk up
till the Earth be all on fire, and torrents of melted and sulphureous
matter flow from the Land, and mingle with this Dead Sea. But
let us now leave the Sea in this humble posture, and go on to attack
the Rocks and Mountains which stand next in our way.</p>
                     <p>See how scornfully they look down upon us, and bid defiance
to all the Elements. They have born the Thunder and Lightning
of Heaven, and all the Artillery of the Skies, for innumerable Ages;
and do not fear the crackling of thorns and of shrubs that burn at
their feet. Let the Towns and Cities of the Earth, say they, be laid
in ashes; Let the Woods and Forests blaze away; and the fat Soyl of
the Earth fry in its own greafe; These things will not affect us; We can
stand naked in the midst of a Sea of Fire, with our roots as deep as
the foundations of the Earth, and our heads above the Clouds of
the Air. Thus they proudly defie Nature; and it must be confest,
that these, being, as it were, the Bones of the Earth, when the
Body is burning, will be the last consum'd; And I am apt to think, if
they could keep in the same posture they stand in now, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
themselves from falling, the fire could never get an entire
power over them. But Mountains are generally hollow, and that
makes them subject to a double casualty; First, Of Earth-quakes,
Secondly, Of having their roots eaten away by Water or by Fire;
but by Fire especially in this case: For we suppose there will be
innumerable subterraneous Fires smothering under ground, before
the general Fire breaks out; and these by corroding the bowels of
the Earth, will make it more hollow and more ruinous; And when
the Earth is so far dissolv'd, that the cavities within the Mountains
are fill'd with Lakes of Fire, then the Mountains will sink, and fall
into those boyling Caldrons; which, in time, will dissolve them,
tho' they were as hard as Adamant.</p>
                     <p>There is another Engine that will tear the Earth with great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and rend in pieces whatsoever is above or about those parts
of it. And that is the Element of Water, so gentle in it self, when
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41970:158"/>
undisturb'd. But 'tis found by experience, that when Water falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
liquid Metals, it flies about with an incredible impetuosity, and
breaks or bears down every thing that wou'd stop its motion and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pansion.
This force I take to come from the sudden and strong
rarefaction of its parts: which make a kind of explosion, when it
is sudden and vehement: And this is one of the greatest forces we
know in Nature. Accordingly I am apt to think, that the marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
force of Volcano's, when they throw out lumps of Rocks,
great fragments of Earth, and other heavy Bodies, to such a vast
height and distance, that it is done by this way of explosion: And
that explosion made by the sudden rarefaction of Sea-waters, that
fall into Pans or receptacles of molten Ore and ardent Liquors
within the cavities of the Mountain: and thereupon follow the
noises, roarings, and eruptions of those places. 'Tis observ'd that
Volcano's are in Mountains, and generally, if not always, near the
Sea: And when its waters by subterraneous passages, are driven
under the Mountain, either by a particular Wind, or by a great
agitation of the Waves, they meet there with Metals and fiery Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
dissolv'd, and are immediately, according to our supposition,
rarefied, and by way of explosion fly out at the mouth or funnel of
the Mountain, bearing before then whatsoever stands in their way.
Whether this be a true account or no, of the present Volcano's and
their Eruptions, 'tis manifest that such cases as we have mention'd,
will happen in the Conflagration of the Earth, and that such erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or disruptions of the Earth will follow thereupon: and that
these will contribute very much to the sinking of Mountains, the
splitting of Rocks, and the bringing of all strong Holds of Nature
under the power of the General Fire.</p>
                     <p>To conclude this point, the Mountains will all be brought low,
in that state of Nature, either by Earthquakes or subterraneous
fires;<note place="margin">Isa. 40. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall
be made low.</hi> Which will be literally true at the second coming of
our Saviour,<note place="margin">Luk. 3. 5.</note> as it was figuratively apply'd to his first coming. Now,
being once level'd with the rest of the Earth, the question will only
be, how they shall be dissolv'd. But there is no Terrestrial Body
indissolvable to Fire, if it have a due strength and continuance;
and this last Fire will have both, in the highest degrees; So that it
cannot but be capable of dissolving all Elementary compositions, how
hard or solid soever they be.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, these Mountains and Rocks, as I said before, will have
the priviledge to be the last destroy'd. These, with the deep parts
of the Sea, and the Polar Regions of the Earth, will undergo a flower
fate, and be consum'd more leisurely. The action of the last Fire
may be distinguish'd into two Times, or two assaults; The first as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
will carry off all Mankind, and all the works of the Earth that
are easily combustible; and this will be done with a quick and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
motion. But the second assault, being employ'd about the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
of such Bodies or such Materials as are not so easily sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to fire, will be of long continuance, and the work of some
years. And 'tis fit it should be so; that this Flaming World may be
view'd and consider'd by the neighbouring Worlds about it, as a
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41970:159"/>
dreadful spectacle, and monument of God's wrath against disloyal
and disobedient Creatures. That by this example, now before their
eyes, they may think of their own fate, and what may befal them,
as well as another Planet of the same Elements and composition.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for the Rocks and Mountains; which, you see, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to our Hypothesis, will be level'd, and the whole face of the
Earth reduc'd to plainness and equality; nay, which is more, melted
and dissolv'd into a Sea of liquid Fire. And because this may seem a
Paradox, being more than is usually supposed, or taken notice of,
in the doctrine of the Conflagration, it will not be improper in this
place to give an account, wherein our Idea of the Conflagration and
its effects, differs from the common opinion and the usual represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of it. 'Tis commonly suppos'd, that the Conflagration of
the World is like the burning of a City, where the Walls and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
of the Houses are not melted down, but scorch'd, inflam'd,
demolish'd, and made unhabitable. So they think in the Burning
of the World, such Bodies, or such parts of Nature, as are sit
Fewel for the Fire, will be inflam'd, and, it may be, consum'd, or
reduc'd to smoke and ashes; But other Bodies that are not capable
of Inflammation, will only be scorch'd and defac'd, the beauty and
furniture of the Earth spoil'd, and by that means, say they, it will
be laid wast and become unhabitable. This seems to me a very short
and imperfect Idea of the Conflagration; neither agreeable to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
nor to the deductions that may be made from Scripture. We
therefore suppose that this is but half the work, this destroying of
the outward garniture of the Earth is but the first onset, and that
the Conflagration will end in a dissolution and liquefaction of the
Elements and all the exteriour region of the Earth: so as to become
a true Deluge of Fire, or a Sea of Fire overspreading, the whole
Globe of the Earth. This state of the Conflagration, I think, may
be plainly prov'd, partly by the expressions of Scripture concerning
it, and partly from the <hi>Renovation</hi> of the Earth that is to follow
upon it. S. <hi>Peter,</hi> who is our chief Guide in the doctrine of the
Conflagration,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 10, 11.</note> says, <hi>The Elements will be melted with fervent heat</hi>
besides burning up the works of the Earth. Then adds, <hi>Seeing all
these things shall be dissolv'd, &amp;c.</hi> These terms of <hi>Liquefaction</hi> and
<hi>Dissolution</hi> cannot, without violence, be restrained to simple devasta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and superficial scorching. Such expressions carry the work a
great deal further, even to that full sence which we propose. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,<note place="margin">Isa. 34. 3, 4. &amp; 44. 1, 2.</note>
the Prophets often speak of the melting of the Earth, or of the
Hills and Mountains,<note place="margin">Nah. 1. 5.</note> at the presence of the Lord, in the day of his
wrath.<note place="margin">Ps. 97. 5.</note> And S. <hi>Iohn (Apoc. 15. 2.)</hi> tells us of a <hi>Sea of Glass, mingled
with Fire;</hi> where the Saints stood, singing the song of <hi>Moses,</hi> and
triumphing over their enemies, the Spiritual <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his host,
that were swallowed up in it. The <hi>Sea of Glass</hi> must be a Sea of
<hi>molten</hi> glass; it must be fluid, not solid, if a Sea; neither can a
solid substance be said to be <hi>mingled with Fire,</hi> as this was. And to
this answers the <hi>Lake of fire and brimstone,</hi> which the Beast and false
Prophet were thrown into alive, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 19. 20. These all refer to
the end of the World and the last Fire, and also plainly imply, or
express rather, that state of Liquefaction which we suppose and assert.</p>

                     <p>HAving remov'd the chief obstructions to our design, and show'd
a method for weakning the strength of Nature, by draining
the Trench, and beating down those Bulwarks, wherein she seems
to place her greatest confidence: we must now go to work; making
choice of the weakest part of Nature for our first attack, where the
fire may be the easiest admitted, and the best maintain'd and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd.</p>
                     <p>And for our better direction, it will be of use to consider what
we noted before, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Conflagration is not a pure <hi>Natural
Fatality,</hi> but a <hi>mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>t Fatality;</hi> or a Divine Judgment supported by
Natural Causes. And if we can find some part of the Earth, or of
the Christian World, that hath more of these natural dispositions
to Inflammation than the rest; and is also represented by Scripture
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41970:160"/>
as a more peculiar object of God's Judgments at the coming of our
Saviour, we may justly pitch upon that part of the World as first to
be destroyed. Nature and Providence conspiring to make that the
first Sacrifice to this Fiery Vengeance.</p>
                     <p>Now as to Natural dispositions, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> any Country or Region of the
Earth, to be set on Fire, They seem to be chiefly these two, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureousness
of the Soil, and an hollow, mountainous construction
of the ground. Where these two dispositions meet in the same
tract or territory, (the one as to the quality of the matter, and the
other as to the form) it stands like a Pile of fit materials, ready set
to have the Fire put to it. And as to Divine Indications where this
General Fire will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the Scripture points to the Seat of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
wheresoever that is, for the beginning of it. The Scripture,
I say, points at this, two ways, First, in telling us that our Saviour
at his coming <hi>in flames of Fire shall consume the wicked One.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Thess. 1. 7. ch. 2. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>The Man
of sin, the Son of perdition, with the Spirit of his mouth, and shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
him with the brightness of his presence.</hi> Secondly, under the
name of <hi>Mystical Babylon;</hi> which is allowed by all to be the Seat of
Antichrist, and by Scripture always condemn'd to the Fire. This
we find in plain words asserted by S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <hi>18th Chap.</hi> of his
<hi>Revelations,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">v. 8. &amp; ver. 19.</note> and in the <hi>19th. (ver. 3.)</hi> under the name of the <hi>Great
Whore;</hi> which is the same City and the same Seat, according to the
interpretation of Scripture it self.<note place="margin">ch. 17. 18.</note> And the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> when
he had set the <hi>Ancient of Days</hi> upon his fiery Throne,<note place="margin">Dan. 7. 9, 10, 11.</note> says, <hi>The Body
of the Beast was given to the burning flame.</hi> Which I take to be the
same thing with what S. <hi>Iohn</hi> says afterwards, <hi>(Apoc. 19. 20.) The
Beast and the false Prophet were cast alive into a Lake of fire burning
with brimstone.</hi> By these places of Scripture it seems manifest, that
Antichrist, and the Seat of Antichrist, will be consumed with Fire,
at the coming of our Saviour. And 'tis very reasonable and deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
that the Grand Traitor and Head of the Apostasie should be
made the first example of the divine vengeance.</p>
                     <p>Thus much being allow'd from Scripture, let us now return to
Nature again; to seek out that part of the Christian World, that
from its own constitution is most subject to burning; by the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureousness
of its Soil, and its fiery Mountains and Caverns. This
we shall easily find to be the <hi>Roman Territory,</hi> or the Countrey of
<hi>Italy:</hi> which, by all accounts, ancient and modern, is a store-house
of fire; as if it was condemn'd to that fate by God and Nature, and
to be an Incendiary, as it were, to the rest of the VVorld. And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Mystical Babylon,</hi> the Seat of Antichrist, is the same <hi>Rome,</hi> and
its Territory; as it is understood by most Interpreters, of former
and later Ages; you see both our lines meet in this point; And that
there is a fairness, on both hands, to conclude, that, at the glorious
appearance of our Saviour, the Conflagration will begin at the City
of <hi>Rome</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Territory.</p>
                     <p>Nature hath sav'd us the pains of kindling a fire in those parts of
the Earth, for, since the memory of man, there have always been
subterraneous fires in <hi>Italy.</hi> And the <hi>Romans</hi> did not preserve their
Vestal fire with more constancy, than Nature hath done her fiery
Mountains in some part or other of that Territory. Let us then sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41970:160"/>
when the fatal time draws near, all these Burning Mountains
to be fill'd and replenish'd with fit materials for such a design; and
when our Saviour appears in the Clouds, with an Host of Angels,
that they all begin to play, as Fire-works at the Triumphal Entry of
a Prince. Let <hi>Vesuvius, Aetna, Strongyle,</hi> and all the <hi>Vulcanian</hi>
Islands, break out into flames; and by the Earth-quakes, which
then will rage, let us suppose new Eruptions, or new Mountains
open'd, in the <hi>Apennines,</hi> and near to <hi>Rome;</hi> and to vomit out fire
in the same manner as the old Volcano's. Then let the sulphureous
ground take fire; and seeing the Soil of that Country, in several
places, is so full of brimstone, that the steams and smoke of it visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
rise out of the Earth; we may reasonably suppose, that it will
burn openly, and be inflam'd, at that time. Lastly, the Lightnings
of the Air, and the flaming streams of the melting Skies, will min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
and joyn with these burnings of the Earth. And these three
Causes meeting together, as they cannot but make a dreadful Scene,
so they will easily destroy and consume whatsoever lies within the
compass of their fury.</p>
                     <p>Thus you may suppose the beginning of the General Fire; And
it will be carried on by like causes, tho' in lesser degrees, in other
parts of the Earth. But as to <hi>Rome,</hi> there is still, in my opinion, a
more dreadful fate that will attend it; namely, to be absorpt or
swallowed up in a Lake of fire and brimstone, after the manner of
<hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha.</hi> This, in my judgment, will be the fare and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
conclusion of <hi>Mystical Babylon,</hi> to sink as a great Milstone into
the Sea, and never to appear more. Hear what the Prophet says,
<hi>A mighty Angel took up a stone,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Apoc. 18. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>like a great Milstone, and cast it into the
Sea, saying, thus, with violence, shall that great City Babylon be thrown
down; and shall be found no more at all.</hi> Simply to be burnt, does not
at all answer to this description of its perishing, by <hi>sinking like a
Milstone into the Sea, and never appearing more,</hi> nor of, <hi>not having its
place ever more found;</hi> that is, leaving no remains or marks of it.
A City that is only burnt, cannot be said to <hi>fall like a Milstone into
the Sea;</hi> or that it <hi>can never more be found:</hi> For after the burning of
a City, the ruines stand, and its place is well known. Wherefore,
in both respects, besides this exteriour burning, there must be an
absorption of this <hi>Mystical Babylon,</hi> the Seat of the Beast; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
a total disappearance of it. This also agrees with the sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the judgment, which is a repeated character of it. <hi>Chap.</hi> 18.
8, 10, 17, 19. Now what kind of absorption this will be, into
what, and in what manner, we may learn from what St. <hi>Iohn</hi> says
afterwards, (ch. 19. 20.) <hi>The Beast and the false Prophets were cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
into a Lake of fire and brimstone.</hi> You must not imagine that they
were bound, hand and foot, and so thrown headlong into this
Lake, but they were swallowed up alive, they and theirs, as <hi>Corah</hi>
and his company. Or, to use a plainer example, after the manner
of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha;</hi> which perisht by fire, and at the same time
sunk into a Dead Sea, or a Lake of brimstone.</p>
                     <p>This was a lively type of the fate of <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Mystical Babylon;</hi>
and 'tis fit it should resemble <hi>Sodom,</hi> as well in its punishment, as in
its crimes. Neither is it a hard thing to conceive how such an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorption
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41970:161"/>
may come to pass; That being a thing so usual in Earth-quakes,
and Earth-quakes being so frequent in that Region. And
lastly, that this should be after the manner of <hi>Sodom,</hi> turn'd into
a Lake of fire, will not be at all strange, if we consider, that
there will be many subterraneous Lakes of fire at that time,
when the bowels of the Earth begin to melt, and the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
spew out streams of liquid fire. The ground therefore
being hollow and rotten in those parts, when it comes to be
shaken with a mighty Earth-quake, the foundations will sink, and
the whole frame fall into an Abyss of fire below, as a Milstone
into the Sea. And this will give occasion to that Cry, <hi>Babylon the
Great is fallen, is fallen,</hi> and shall never more be found.</p>
                     <p>This seems to be a probable account, according to Scripture and
reason, of the beginning of the general fire, and of the particular
fate of <hi>Rome.</hi> But it may be propos'd here as an objection against this
Hypothesis, that the Mediterranean Sea, lying all along the Coast of
<hi>Italy,</hi> must needs be a sufficient guard to that Country against the
invasion of fire; or at least must needs extinguish it, before it can
do much mischief there, or propagate it self into other Countreys.
I thought we had in a good measure prevented this objection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
by showing how the Ocean would be diminish'd before the
Conflagration, and especially the Arms and Sinus's of the Ocean;
and of these none would be more subject to this diminution than
the Mediterranean; For, receiving its supplies from the Ocean and
the Black Sea, if these came to sink in their chanels, they would
not rise so high, as to be capable to flow into the Mediterranean,
at either end. And these supplies being cut off, it would soon emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
it self so far, partly by evaporation, and partly by subterraneous
passages, as to shrink from all its shores, and become only a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Pool of water in the middle of the Chanel. Nay, 'tis possible,
by flouds of fire descending from the many Volcano's upon its
shores, it might it self be converted into a Lake of fire, and rather
help than obstruct the progress of the Conflagration.</p>
                     <p>It may indeed be made a question, whether this fiery Vengeance
upon the seat of Antichrist, will not precede the general Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
at some distance of time, as a fore-runner and forewarner to
the World, that the rest of the People may have space to repent;
And particularly the <hi>Iews,</hi> being Spectators of this Tragedy, and of
the miraculous appearance of our Saviour, may see the hand of
God in it, and be convinc'd of the truth and divine authority of
the Christian Religion. I say, this supposition would leave room for
these and some other prophetick Scenes, which we know not well
where to place; But seeing <hi>The Day of the Lord</hi> is represented in
Scripture as one entire thing, without interruption or discontinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that it is to begin with the destruction of Antichrist, we
have warrant enough to pursue the rest of the Conflagration from
this beginning and introduction.</p>
                     <p>Let us then suppose the same preparations made in the other parts
of the Earth to continue the Fire; for the Conflagration of the
World being a work of Providence, we may be sure such measures
are taken, as will effectually carry it on, when once begun. The
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41970:161"/>
Body of the Earth will be loosen'd and broken by Earth-quakes,
the more solid parts impregnated with sulphur, and the cavities
fill'd with unctuous fumes and exhalations; so as the whole Mass
will be but as one great funeral Pile, ready built, and wanting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the hand of a destroying Angel, to give it fire. I will not
take upon me to determine which way this devouring Enemy will
steer his course from <hi>Italy,</hi> or in what order he will advance and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the several Regions of our Continent; that would be an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
as uncertain, as useless. But we cannot doubt of his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
which way soever he goes: unless where the Chanel of the
Ocean may chance to stop him. But as to that, we allow, that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Continents may have different Fires; not propagated from
one another, but of distinct sources and originals; and so likewise
in remote Islands; and therefore no long passage or trajection will
be requir'd from shore to shore. And even the Ocean it self, will
at length be as Fiery as any part of the Land; But that, with its
Rocks, like Death, will be the last thing subdued.</p>
                     <p>As to the Animate World, the Fire will over-run it with a swift
and rapid course, and all living Creatures will be suffocated or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed,
at the first assault. And at the same time, the beauty of
the Fields and the external decorations of Nature will be defac'd.
Then the Cities and the Towns, and all the works of man's hands,
will burn like stubble before the wind. These will be soon dispatch'd;
but the great burthen of the Work still remains; which is that <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quefaction</hi>
we mention'd before, or a <hi>melting fire,</hi> much more strong
and vehement than these transient blazes, which do but sweep the
surface of the Earth. This Liquefaction, I say, we prov'd before
out of Scripture,<note place="margin">ch. 9.</note> as the last state of the fiery Deluge. And 'tis this,
which at length, will make the Sea it self a <hi>Lake of fire and brimstone.</hi>
When instead of Rivers of Waters which used to flow into it from
the Land, there come streams and rivulets of Sulphureous Liquors,
and purulent melted matter, which following the tract of their
natural gravity will fall into this great drain of the Earth. Upon
which mixture, the remaining parts of sweet water will soon evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
and the salt mingling with the Sulphur will make a Dead Sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
an <hi>Asphaltites,</hi> a Lake of <hi>Sodom,</hi> a Cup of the dregs of the Wine of
the fierceness of God's Wrath.</p>
                     <p>We noted before two remarkable effects of the <hi>Burning Mountains;</hi>
which would contribute to the Conflagration of the World; and
gave instances of both in former Eruptions of <hi>Aetna</hi> and <hi>Vesuvius.</hi>
One was, of those Balls or lumps of Fire, which they throw about
in the time of their rage; and the other, of those torrents of liquid
Fire, which rowl down their sides to the next Seas or Valleys. In
the first respect these Mountains are as so many Batteries, planted by
Providence in several parts of the Earth, to fling those fiery Bombs
into such places, or such Cities, as are marked out for destruction.
And in the second respect, they are to dry up the Waters, and the
Rivers,<note place="margin">Annal. Sic. dec. 1. l. 2. c. 4.</note> and the Sea it self, when they fall into its Chanel. <hi>T. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zellus,</hi>
a <hi>Sicilian,</hi> who writ the History of that Island, tells us of
such a River of fire (upon an eruption of <hi>Aetna)</hi> near twenty eight
miles long; reaching from the Mountain to Port <hi>Longina;</hi> and

might have been much longer if it had not been stopt by the Sea.
Many such as these, and far greater, we ought in reason to imagin,
when all the Earth begins to melt, and to ripen towards a dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
It will then be full of these Sulphureous juices, as Grapes with
Wine; and these will be squeez'd out of the Earth into the Sea, as

                     <head>CHAP. XI. An account of those extraordinary Phaenomena and Wonders
in Nature, that, according to Scripture, will precede the
coming of Christ, and the Conflagration of the World.</head>
                     <p>IF we reflect upon the History of Burning Mountains, we cannot
but observe, that, before their Eruptions, there are usually some
changes in the Earth or in the Air, in the Sea or in the Sun it self;
as signs and forerunners of the ensuing storm. We may then easily
conclude that when the last great Storm is a coming, and all the
Volcano's of the Earth ready to burst, and the frame of the World
to be dissolv'd, there will be prevlous signs, in the Heavens and on
the Earth, to introduce this Tragical fate. Nature cannot come to
that extremity, without some symptomes of her illness, nor die si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently,
without pangs or complaint. But we are naturally heavy
of belief as to Futurities, and can scarce fancy any other Scenes, or
other state of Nature, than what is present, and continually before
our eyes; we will therefore, to cure our unbelief, take Scripture
for our guide, and keep within the limits of its Predictions.</p>
                     <p>The Scripture plainly tells us of Signs or Prodigies that will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
the coming of our Saviour, and the end of the World; both in
the Heavens and on the Earth. The Sun, Moon, and Stars, will be
disturb'd in their motion or aspect; The Earth and the Sea will
roar and tremble, and the Mountains fall at his Presence. These
things both the Prophets and Evangelists have told us; But what
we do not understand, we are flow to believe; and therefore those
that cannot apprehend how such Changes should come to pass in
the Natural World, chuse rather to allegorize all these expressions
of Scripture, and to make them signifie no more than political
changes of Governments and Empires, and the great confusions
that will be amongst the People and Princes of the Earth towards
the end of the World. So that <hi>darkning of the Sun, shaking of the
Earth,</hi> and such like phrases of Scripture, according to these Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters,
are to be understood only in a moral sence.</p>
                     <p>And they think they have a warrant for this interpretation from
the Prophetick style of the Old Testament, where the destruction
of Cities, and Empires, and great Princes, is often describ'd by
such Figures, taken from the Natural World. So much is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41970:164"/>
as to the phrase of the old Prophets in some places; but I
take the true reason and design of that, to be a typical adumbration
of what was intended should literally come to pass in the great
and universal destruction of the World; whereof these partial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
were only shadows and prefigurations. But to determine
this case, Let us take the known and approved rule for interpreting
Scripture, <hi>Not to recede from the literal sence without necessity,</hi> or
where the nature of the subject will admit of a literal interpretation.
Now as to those cases in the Old Testament, History and matter of
fact do show that they did not come to pass literally, therefore
must not be so understood; But as for those that concern the end
of the World, as they cannot be determin'd in that way, seeing they
are yet <hi>future;</hi> So neither is there any Natural repugnancy or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability
that they should come literally to pass: On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
from the intuition of that state of Nature, one would rather
conclude the probability or necessity of them; That there may
and must be such disorders in the external World before the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
dissolution. Besides, If we admit Prodigies in any case, or
Providential indications of God's judgments to come, there can be
no case suppos'd, wherein it will be more reasonable or proper to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them, than when they are to be the Messengers of an universal
Vengeance and Destruction.</p>
                     <p>Let us therefore consider what signs Scripture hath taken notice
of, as destin'd to appear at that time, to publish, as it were, and
proclaim the approaching end of the World; and how far they
will admit of a natural explication, according to those grounds we
have already given, in explaining the causes and manner of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration.
These Signs are chiefly, Earth-quakes, and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
commotions of the Seas. Then the darkness or bloudy colour
of the Sun and Moon; The shaking of the Powers of Heaven, the
fulgurations of the Air and the falling of Stars. As to Earth-quakes,
we have upon several occasions shown, that these will necessarily be
multiplied towards the end of the World; when, by an excess of
drought and heat, exhalations will more abound within the Earth;
and, from the same causes, their inflammation also will be more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
than in the ordinary state of Nature. And as all Bodies,
when dry'd, become more porous and full of Vacuities; so the
Body of the Earth will be at that time: And the Mines or Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
wherein the fumes and exhalations lodge, will accordingly be of
greater extent, open into one another, and continued through long
tracts and regions; By which means, when an Earth-quake comes,
as the shock will be more strong and violent, so it may reach to a
vast compass of ground, and whole Islands or Continents be shaken
at once, when these trains have taken fire. The effects also of such
concussions, will not only affect Mankind, but all the Elements and
the Inhabitants of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I do not wonder therefore that frequent and great Earth-quakes
should be made a sign of an approaching Conflagration; and the
highest expressions of the Prophets concerning the</hi> Day of the Lord,
<hi>may be understood in a literal sence, if they be finally referr'd to
the general destruction of the World, and not terminated solely
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41970:164"/>
upon those particular Countries or People, to whom they are at
first directed.<note place="margin">Ch. 38. 19, 20, 22.</note> Hear what</hi> Ezekiel <hi>says upon this subject:</hi> For in my
Iealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken; surely in that Day
there shall be a great shaking in the Land of Israel. So that the Fishes
of the Sea, and the Fowls of the Heaven, and the Beasts of the Field,
and all creeping things that creep upon the Earth; and all the Men that
are upon the face of the Earth, shall shake at my presence; and the
Mountains shall be thrown down, and the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eep places shall fall, and every
wall sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l fall to the ground.—And I will rain an over-flowing rain,
and great hail-stones,<note place="margin">Ch. 24. 18, 19, 20.</note> fire and brimstone. <hi>The Prophet</hi> Isaias <hi>describes
these judgments in terms as high, and relating to the Natural
World:</hi> The Windows from on high are open, and the foundations of
the Earth do shake. The Earth is utterly broken down, the Earth is
clean dissolv'd, the Earth is moved exceedingly. The Earth shall reel to
and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a Cottage, and the
transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it, and it shall fall and not rise
again.</p>
                     <p>To restrain all these things to <hi>Iudaea,</hi> as their adequate and final
object, is to force both the words and the sence. Here are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
allusions and foot-steps of the destruction of the World, and the
dissolution of the Earth; partly as it was in the Deluge, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as it will be in its last ruine; torn, broken, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d shatter'd. But
most Men have fallen into that errour, To fancy both the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the World, by Water and by Fire, quiet, noiseless things;
executed without any ruines or ruptures in Nature; That the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
was but a great Pool of still Waters, made by the rains and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation
of the Sea: and the Conflagration will be only a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
scorching of the Earth, with a running fire. These are false
Idea's, and unsuitable to Scripture: for as the Deluge is there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
a Disruption of the Abyss, and consequently of the
then habitable Earth; so the future combustion of it, according to
the representations of Scripture, is to be usher'd in and accompanied
with all sorts of violent impressions upon Nature; and the chief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of these violences will be Earth-quakes. These will tear
the Body of the Earth, and shake its foundations; rend the Rocks,
and pull down the tall Mountains, sometimes overturn, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
swallow up Towns and Cities; disturb and disorder the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and make a general confusion in Nature.</p>
                     <p>Next to Earth-quakes, we may consider the <hi>roarings of a troubled
Sea.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ch. 21. 25, 26, 27.</note> This is another sign of a dying World. S. <hi>Luke</hi> hath set down
a great many of them together; Let us hear his words: <hi>And there
shall be signs in the Sun, and in the Moon, and in the Stars; and upon
the Earth distress of Nations, with perplexity; The Sea and the Waves
roaring. Mens hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those
things which are coming on the Earth: for the powers of Heaven shall
be shaken. And then shall they see the Son of Man coming in a cloud,
with power and great glory,</hi> &amp;c. As some would allegorize these Signs,
which we noted before; so others would confine them to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ver. 28.</note> But 'tis plain, by this <hi>coming of the Son of
man in the clouds,</hi> and the <hi>redemption of the faithful,</hi> and at the same
time,<note place="margin">Matt. 24. 31.</note> the <hi>sound of the last trumpet,</hi> which all relate to the end of the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41970:165"/>
World, that something further is intended than the destruction of
<hi>Ierusalem.</hi> And though there were Prodigies at the destruction of
that City and State, yet not of this force, nor with these circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
'Tis true, those partial destructions and calamities, as we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
before, of <hi>Babylon, Ierusalem,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, being
types of an universal and final destruction of all God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s Enemies,
have, in the pictures of them, some of the same strokes, to show they
are all from the same hand; decreed by the same wisdom, foretold
by the same Spirit; and the same power and Providence that have
already wrought the one, will also work the other, in due time;
the former being still pledges, as well as prefigurations, of the
latter.</p>
                     <p>Let us then proceed in our explication of this sign, <hi>The roaring of
the Sea, and the Waves,</hi> applying it to the end of the World. I do
not look upon this ominous noise of the Sea, as the effect of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest,
for then it would not strike such a terror into the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the Earth, nor make them apprehensive of some great evil
coming upon the World, as this will do; what proceeds from vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
causes, and such as may happen in a common course of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
does not so much amaze us, nor affright us. Therefore 'tis
more likely these disturbances of the Sea proceed from below, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by sympathy and revulsions from the Land; by Earth-quakes
there, and exhausting the subterraneous cavities of Waters, which
will draw again from the Seas what supplies they can: And partly
by Earth-quakes in the very Sea it self; with exhalations and
fiery Eruptions from the bottom of it. Things indeed that happen
at other times, more or less, but at this conjuncture, all causes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring,
they will break out with more violence, and put the whole
Body of the Waters into a tumultuary motion. I do not see any
occasion, at this time, for high Winds; neither can think a superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
agitation of the Waves would answer this Phaenomenon; but
'tis rather from Contorsions in the bowels of the Ocean, which make
it roar, as it were, for pain. Some Causes impelling the Waters one
way, and some another, make intestine struglings and contrary
motions; from whence proceed unusual noises, and such a troubled
state of the Waters, as does not only make the Sea innavigable, but
also strikes terror into all the Maritime Inhabitants, that live within
the view or sound of it.</p>
                     <p>So much for the Earth and the Sea. The face of the Heavens
also will be chang'd in divers respects. The Sun and the Moon
darkned, or of a bloudy, or pale countenance; The Celestial Powers
shaken, and the Stars unsetled in their Orbs. As to the Sun and
Moon, their obscuration or change of colour is no more than what
happens commonly before the Eruption of a fiery Mountain; <hi>Dion
Cassius,</hi> you see, hath taken notice of it in that Eruption of <hi>Aetna</hi>
which he describes; and others upon the like occasions in <hi>Vesuvius.</hi>
And 'tis a thing of easie explication; for according as the Atmosphere
is more or less clear or turbid, the Luminaries are more or less
conspicuous; and according to the nature of those fumes or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations
that swim in the Air, the face of the Sun is discolour'd
sometimes one way, sometimes another. You see, in an ordinary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41970:165"/>
when we look upon one another through the fumes of
Sulphur, we appear pale like so many Ghosts; and in some foggy
days the Sun hangs in the Firmament as a lump of Bloud. And botl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
the Sun and Moon at their rising, when their light comes to us
through the thick vapours of the Earth, are red and fiery. These
are not changes wrought in the substance of the Luminaries, but in
the modifications of their light as it flows to us. For colours are
but Light in a sort of disguise; as it passes through <hi>Mediums</hi> of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rent
qualities, it takes different forms; but the matter is still the
same, and returns to its simplicity when it comes again into a pure
air.</p>
                     <p>Now the air may be changed and corrupted to a great degree,
tho' there appear no visible change to our eye. This is manifest from
infectious airs, and the changes of the air before storms and rains;
which we feel commonly sooner than we see, and some other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
perceive much sooner than we do 'Tis no wonder then if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this mighty storm the dispositions of the Air be quite alter'd;
especially if we consider, what we have so often noted before, that
there will be a great abundance of fumes and exhalations through
the whole Atmosphere of the Earth, before the last Fire breaks out;
whereby the Light of the Sun may be tinctur'd in several ways.
And lastly, it may be so order'd providentially, that the Body of
the Sun may contract at that time some Spots or <hi>Maculae</hi> far greater
than usual, and by that means be really darkened; not to us only,
but to all the neighbouring Planets. And this will have a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
effect upon the Moon too, for the diminution of her light.
So that upon all suppositions these Phaenomena are very intelligible,
if not necessary forerunners of the Conflagration.</p>
                     <p>The next Sign given us, is, that the <hi>powers of heaven will be shaken.</hi>
By the <hi>Heavens</hi> in this place is either understood the Planetary Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
or that of the <hi>Fix'd Stars;</hi> but this latter being vastly distant
from the Earth, cannot be really affected by the Conflagration. Nor
the powers of it, that is, its motions or the Bodies contain'd in it,
any way shaken or disorder'd. But in appearance these celestial
Bodies may seem to be shaken, and their motions disorder'd; as in a
tempest by night, when the ship is toss'd with contrary and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
motions, the Heavens seem to fluctuate over our heads, and the
Stars to reel to and fro, when the motion is only in our own Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel.
So possibly the uncertain motions of the Atmosphere, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of the Earth it self, may so vary the sight and aspect of this
starry Canopy, that it may seem to shake and tremble.</p>
                     <p>But if we understand this of the <hi>Planetary Heavens,</hi> They may
really be shaken. Providence either ordering some great changes
in the other Planets previously to the Conflagration of our Planet;
as 'tis probable there was a great change in <hi>Venus,</hi> at the time of our
<hi>Deluge.</hi> Or the great shakings and concussions of our Globe at that
time, affecting some of the neighbouring Orbs, at least that of the
Moon, may cause Anomalies and irregularities in their motions.
But the sence that I should pitch upon chiefly for explaining this
phrase of <hi>shaking the powers of heaven,</hi> comprehends, in a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
both these Heavens, of the Fix'd Stars and of the Planets;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41970:166"/>
'Tis that change of situation in the Axis of the Earth, which we
have formerly mention'd; whereby the Stars will seem to change
their places, and the whole Universe to take another posture. This
is sufficiently known to those that know the different consequences
of a strait or oblique posture of the Earth. And as the heavens and
the earth were, in this sence, once shaken before; namely at the
Deluge, when they lost their first situation; so now they will be
shaken again, and thereby return to the posture they had before
that first concussion. And this I take to be the true literal sence of
the Prophet <hi>Haggai,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ch. 2. 6. Heb. 12. 26.</note> repeated by S. <hi>Paul, Yet once more I shake not the
Earth only, but also heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The last Sign we shall take notice of, is that of <hi>Falling Stars. And
the Stars shall fall from Heaven,</hi> says our Saviour, <hi>Matt.</hi> 24. 29. We
are sure, from the nature of the thing, that this cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
either of fix'd Stars or Planets; for if either of these should
tumble from the Skies, and reach the Earth, they would break it all
in pieces, or swallow it up, as the Sea does a sinking ship; and at
the same time would put all the inferiour universe into confusion.
It is necessary therefore by these Stars to understand either <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>iery
Meteors falling from the middle Region of the Air, or Comets and
Blazing Stars. No doubt there will be all sorts of fiery Meteors at
that time; and amongst others, those that are call'd <hi>Falling Stars;</hi>
which, tho' they are not considerable singly, yet if they were mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied
in great numbers,<note place="margin">Isa. 34. 4.</note> falling, as the Prophet says, as <hi>leafs from
the Vine, or figs from the fig-tree,</hi> they would make an astonishing fight.
But I think this expression does chiefly refer to Comets; which are
dead Stars, and may truly be said to fall from heaven, when they
leave their seats above, and those ethereal regions wherein they
were fixt, and sink into this lower World; where they wander a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
with a blaze in their tail, or a flame about their head, as if
they came on purpose to be the Messengers of some fiery Vengeance.
If numbers of these blazing Stars should fall into our heaven toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they would make a dreadful and formidable appearance; And
I am apt to think that Providence hath so contriv'd the periods of
their motion, that there will be an unusual concourse of them at
that time, within the view of the Earth, to be a prelude to this last
and most Tragical Scene of the Sublunary World.</p>
                     <p>I do not know any more in Scripture relating to the last Fire, that,
upon the grounds laid down in this discourse, may not receive a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
explication. It reaches, beyond the Signs before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd,
to the highest expressions of Scripture, As <hi>Lakes of fire and
brimstone, a molten Sea mingled with fire, the Liquefaction of Mountains,</hi>
and of the Earth it self. We need not now look upon these things
as Hyperbolical and Poetical strains, but as barefac'd Prophecies,
and things that will literally come to pass as they are predicted.
One thing more will be expected in a just hypothesis or Theory of
the Conflagration, namely, that it should answer, not only all the
conditions and characters belonging to the last Fire, but should also
make way and lay the foundation of another World to succeed
this, or of <hi>New Heavens</hi> and a <hi>New Earth.</hi> For S. <hi>Peter</hi> hath taught
this doctrine of the <hi>Renovation</hi> of the World, as positively and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41970:166"/>
as that of its Conflagration. And therefore they that so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
the destruction of the present World, as to leave it afterwards
in an eternal rubbish, without any hopes of restoration, do not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
the Christian Doctrine concerning it. But as to our Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,
we are willing to stand this far ther trial, and be accountable for
the consequences of the Conflagration, as well as the Antecedents
and manner of it. And we have accordingly in the following Book,
from the Ashes of this, rais'd a New Earth; which we leave to the
enjoyment of the Readers. In the mean time, to close our discourse,
we will bid farewel to the present World, in a short review of its
last flames.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XII. An imperfect description of the Coming of our Saviour, and
of the World on Fire.</head>
                     <p>CErtainly there is nothing in the whole course of Nature, or of
Humane Affairs, so great and so extraordinary, as the two
last Scenes of them, THE COMING OF OUR SAVIOUR, and the
BURNING OF THE WORLD. If we could draw in our minds
the Pictures of these, in true and lively colours, we should scarce be
able to attend to any thing else, or ever divert our imagination from
these two objects. For what can more affect us than the greatest
Glory that ever was visible upon Earth, and at the same time the
greatest Terror. A God descending in the Head of an Army of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and a Burning World under his feet.</p>
                     <p>These are things truly above expression; and not only so, but
so different and remote from our ordinary thoughts and concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that he that comes nearest to a true description of them, shall
be look'd upon as the most extravagant. 'Tis our unhappiness to
be so much used to little trifling things in this life, that when any
thing great is represented to us, it appears phantastical: An Idea,
made by some contemplative or melancholy person. I will not
venture therefore, without premising some grounds out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
to say any thing concerning This Glorious Appearance. As
to the Burning of the World, I think we have already laid a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
sufficient to support the highest description that can be made
of it; But the coming of our Saviour being wholly out of the way
of Natural Causes, it is reasonable we should take all directions we
can from Scripture, that we may give a more fitting and just account
of that Sacred Pomp.</p>
                     <p>I need not mention those places of Scripture that prove the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
coming of our Saviour in general,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Matt. 24. 30, 31. Act. 1. 11. &amp; 3. 20, 21. Apoc. 1. 7. Heb.</hi> 9. 28.</note> or his return to the Earth
again at the end of the World: no Christian can doubt of this, 'tis
so often repeated in those Sacred Writings. But the manner and
circumstances of this Coming, or of this Appearance, are the things
we now enquire into. And in the first place, we may observe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41970:167"/>
                        <hi>that Scripture tells us our Saviour will come in</hi> Flaming Fire, <hi>and
with an</hi> Host of mighty Angels;<note place="margin">1 Ep. 1. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>so says S.</hi> Paul <hi>to the</hi> Thessalonians,
The Lord Iesus shall be revealed from Heaven with mighty Angels; in
flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not
the Gospel of our Lord Iesus Christ. <hi>In the second place, our Saviour
says himself,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matt. 16. 27.</note> The Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with
his Angels. <hi>From which two places we may learn, first, that the
appearance of our Saviour will be with flames of Fire. Secondly,
With an Host of Angels. Thirdly, In the glory of his Father. By
which Glory of the Father I think is understood that Throne of
Glory represented by</hi> Daniel <hi>for the</hi> Ancient of Days. <hi>For our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our

them; And the Glory of the Father which they were most likely
to understand, would be either the Glory wherein God appeared at

                        <hi>or that which</hi> Daniel <hi>represents
Him in at the day of Judgment. And this latter being more proper
to the subject of our Saviour's discourse, 'tis more likely this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
refers to it. Give me leave therefore to set down that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of the Glory of the Father upon his Throne, from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
Daniel, <hi>ch.</hi> 7. 9. And I beheld <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </note> set, and the
Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair
of his head like the pure wool: His Throne was like the fiery flame, and
his wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from
before him, thousand thousands ministred unto him, and ten thousand times
ten thousand stood before him, <hi>With this Throne of the Glory of the
Father, let us if you please, compare the Throne of the Son of God,
as it was seen by S.</hi> Iohn <hi>in the Apocalypse,</hi> ch. 4. 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
I was in the Spirit: and behold a throne was set in heaven, and
one sat on the Throne. And he that fat, was to look upon <hi>like</hi> a Iasper,
and a Sardine Stone: and there was a Rain-bow round about the Throne,
in appearance like unto an Emerald. And out of the Throne proceeded
Lightnings, and Thunderings, and Voices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and before the Throne was
a Sea of glass like unto Crystal.</p>
                     <p>In those representations you have some beams of the Glory
of the Father and of the Son; which may be partly a direction to
us, in conceiving the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> of our Saviour's appearance. Let us fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
observe, if you please, how external Nature will be affected at
the sight of God, or of this approaching Glory. The Scripture often
takes notice of this, and in terms very high and eloquent. The
Psalmist seems to have lov'd that subject above others; to set out
the greatness of the day of the Lord, and the consternation of all
Nature at that time. He throws about his thunder and lightning,
makes the Hills to melt like wax at the presence of the Lord, and
the very foundations of the Earth to tremble, as you may see in the
<hi>18th. Psalm,</hi> and the 97. and the 104. and several others, which are
too long to be here inserted. So the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> in his
Prophetick Prayer, <hi>Chap. 3d.</hi> hath many Ejaculations to the like
purpose. And the Prophet <hi>Nahum</hi> says, <hi>The mountains quake at him,
and the hills melt, and the Earth is burnt at his presence: yea, the world,
and all that dwell therein.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:41970:167"/>
But more particularly, as to the face of Nature just before the
coming of our Saviour, that may be best collected from the signs of
his coming mention'd in the precedent Chapter. Those all meeting
together, help to prepare and make ready a Theater, fit for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
God to come down upon. The countenance of the Heavens will
be dark and gloomy; and a Veil drawn over the face of the Sun.
The Earth in a disposition every where to break into open flames.
The tops of the Mountains smoaking; the Rivers dry; Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes
in several places; the Sea sunk and retir'd into its deepest
Chanel, and roaring, as against some mighty storm. These things
will make the day dead and melancholy, but the Night-Scenes will
have more of horrour in them. When the <hi>Blazing Stars</hi> appear, like
so many Furies, with their lighted Torches, threatning to set all on
fire. For I do not doubt but the Comets will bear a part in this
Tragedy, and have something extraordinary in them, at that time;
either as to number, or bigness, or nearness to the Earth. Besides,
the Air will be full of flaming Meteors, of unusual forms and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudes;
Balls of fire rowling in the Skie, and pointed lightnings
darted against the Earth; mixt with claps of thunder, and unusual
noises from the Clouds. The Moon and the Stars will be confus'd
and irregular, both in their light and motions; as if the whole
frame of the Heavens was out of order, and all the laws of Nature
were broken or expir'd.</p>
                     <p>When all things are in this languishing or dying posture, and
the Inhabitants of the Earth under the fears of their last end; The
Heavens will open on a sudden, and the Glory of God will appear.
A Glory surpassing the Sun in its greatest radiancy; which, tho' we
cannot describe, we may suppose it will bear some resemblance or
proportion with those representations that are made in Scripture,
of <hi>God upon his Throne.</hi> This wonder in the Heavens, whatsoever
its form may be, will presently attract the eyes of all the Christian
World. Nothing can more affect them than an object so unusual
and so illustrious; and that, (probably) brings along with it their
last destiny, and will put a period to all humane affairs.</p>
                     <p>Some of the Ancients have thought that this coming of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
would be in the dead of the night,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 10.</note> and his first glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
in the midst of darkness. God is often describ'd in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as Light or Fire,<note place="margin">Psal. 18. 9, 11, 12.</note> with darkness round about him. <hi>He bowed
the Heavens and came down, and darkness was under his feet. He made
darkness his secret place:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 97.</note> 
                        <hi>His pavilion round about him were dark Waters
and thick Clouds of the Skies. At the brightness that was before him, the
thick Clouds passed.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Deut. 4. 11.</note> And when God appear'd upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> the
<hi>Mountain burnt with fire unto the midst of Heaven with darkness, clouds,
and thick darkness:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hebr. 12. 18.</note> Or, as the Apostle expresses it, with <hi>blackness</hi> and
<hi>darkness,</hi> and <hi>tempest.</hi> Light is never more glorious than when sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with darkness; and it may be the Sun, at that time, will
be so obscure, as to make little distinction of Day and Night. But
however this Divine Light over-bears and distinguishes it self from
common Light, tho' it be at Mid-day. 'Twas about Noon that the
Light shin'd from Heaven and surrounded St. <hi>Panl.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 22. 6.</note> And 'twas on
the Day-time that St. <hi>Stephen</hi> saw the <hi>Heavens opened;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 7. 55, 56.</note> 
                        <hi>saw the glory
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41970:168"/>
of God, and Iesus standing at the right hand of God.</hi> This light, which
flows from a more vital source, be it Day or Night, will always be
predominant.</p>
                     <p>That appearance of God upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> which we mention'd,
if we reflect upon it, will help us a little to form an Idea of this last
appearance. When God had declar'd, that he would come down in
the sight of the People; The Text says, <hi>There were thunders and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
and a thick Cloud upon the Mount, and the voice of the Trumpet
exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the Camp trembled. And
Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord descended upon
it in fire. And the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and
the whole Mount quaked greatly.</hi> If we look upon this Mount as an
Epitome of the Earth, this appearance gives us an imperfect resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of that which is to come. Here are the several parts or main
strokes of it; first, the Heavens and the Earth in smoke and fire,
then the appearance of a Divine Glory, and the sound of a Trumpet
in the presence of Angels. But as the second coming of our Saviour
is a Triumph over his Enemies, and an entrance into his Kingdom,
and is acted upon the Theater of the whole Earth; so we are to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
in proportion, all the parts and circumstances of it, more
great and magnificent.</p>
                     <p>When therefore this mighty God returns again to that Earth,
where he had once been ill treated, not Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> only, but all
the Mountains of the Earth, and all the Inhabitants of the World,
will tremble at his presence. At the first opening of the Heavens,
the brightness of his Person will scatter the dark Clouds, and shoot
streams of light throughout all the Air. But that first appearance,
being far from the Earth, will seem to be only a great mass of
light, without any distinct form; till, by nearer approaches, this
bright Body shows it self to be an Army of Angels, with this King
of kings for their Leader. Then you may imagine how guilty Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
will tremble and be astonish'd; and while they are gazing at
this heavenly Host, the Voice of the <hi>Archangel is heard,</hi> the shrill
sound of the Trumpet reaches their ears. And this gives the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Alarum to all the World. <hi>For he cometh, for he cometh,</hi> they
cry, <hi>to judge the Earth.</hi> The crucified God is return'd in Glory, to
take Vengeance upon his Enemies: Not only upon those that pierc'd
his Sacred Body, with Nails and with a Spear, as <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> but
those also that pierce him every day by their prophaneness and
hard speeches, concerning his Person and his Religion. Now they
see that God whom they have mock'd, or blasphem'd, laugh't at his
meanness, or at his vain threats; They see Him, and are confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with shame and fear; and in the bitterness of their anguish
and despair call for the Mountains to fall upon them. <hi>Fly into the
clefts of the Rocks,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>As it is not possible for us to express or conceive the dread and
majesty of this appearance; so neither can we, on the other hand,
express the passions and consternation of the People that behold it.
These things exceed the measures of humane affairs, and of humane
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41970:168"/>
thoughts; we have neither words, nor comparisons, to make them
known by. The greatest pomp and magnificence of the Emperors
of the East, in their Armies, in their Triumphs, in their Inaugura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
is but like the sport and entertainment of Children, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
with this Solemnity. When God condescends to an external
glory, with a visible Train and Equipage: When, from all the
Provinces of his vast and boundless Empire, he summons his Nobles,
as I may so say: The several orders of Angels and Arch-Angels, to
attend his Person; tho' we cannot tell the form or manner of this
Appearance, we know there is nothing in our experience, or in the
whole History of this World, that can be a just representation of the
least part of it. No Armies so numerous as the Host of Heaven: and
in the midst of those bright Legions, in a flaming Chariot, will sit
the Son of Man, when he comes to be glorified in his Saints, and
triumph over his Enemies. And instead of the wild noises of
the rabble, which makes a great part of our worldly state: This
blessed company will breath their <hi>Halleluiahs</hi> into the open Air; and
repeated acclamations of <hi>Salvation to God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Apoc. 7. 10. &amp; 12. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>which sits upon the Throne,
and to the Lamb. Now is come salvation and strength, and the kingdom
of our God, and the power of his Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I leave the rest to our silent devotion and admiration. Only
give me leave, whilst this object is before our eyes, to make a short
reflection upon the wonderful history of our Saviour; and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
states, which that Sacred Person, within the compass of our
knowledge, hath undergone. We now see him coming in the
Clouds in glory and triumph, surrounded with innumerable Angels.
This is the same Person, who, so many hundred years ago, enter'd
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> with another sort of Equipage: mounted upon an Ass's
Colt, while the little people and the multitude cry'd, <hi>Hosanna</hi> to the
<hi>Son of David.</hi> Nay, This is the same Person, that, at his first come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into this World, was laid in a Manger instead of a Cradle; A
naked Babe dropt in a Crib at <hi>Bethlehem:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luke 2. 12.</note> His poor Mother not
having wherewithal to get her a better Lodging, when she was to
be deliver'd of this Sacred Burthen. This helpless Infant, that often
wanted a little Milk to refresh it, and support its weakness: That
hath often cry'd for the Breast, with hunger and tears: now appears
to be the Lord of Heaven and Earth. If this Divine Person had
faln from the Clouds in a mortal Body, cloath'd with Flesh and
Bloud, and spent his life here amongst sinners; That alone had been
an infinite condescension. But as if it had not been enough to take
upon him Humane Nature, he was content, for many months, to
live the life of an Animal, or of a Plant, in the dark Cell of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
Womb. <hi>This is the Lord's doing, it is marvellous in our eyes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Neither is this all that is wonderful in the story of our Saviour.
If the manner of his death be compar'd with his present glory, we
shall think, either the one, or the other, incredible. Look up, first, into
the Heavens: see how they bow under him, and receive a new light
from the Glory of his Presence. Then look down upon the Earth,
and see a naked Body hanging upon a cursed Tree in <hi>Golgotha <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi>
Crucified betwixt Two Thieves: wounded, spit upon, mock'd,
abus'd. Is it possible to believe that one and the same person can
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41970:169"/>
act or suffer such different parts? That he, that is now Lord and
Master of all Nature: not only of Death and Hell, and the powers
of darkness: but of all Principalities in heavenly places: is the same
Infant Jesus, the same crucified Jesus, of whose life and death the
Christian records give us an account? The History of this Person
is the Wonder of this World;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 11, 12.</note> and not of this World only, but of
the Angels above, that desire to look into it.</p>
                     <p>Let us now return to our Subject. We left the Earth in a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
condition, ready to be made a Burnt-offering, to appease
the wrath of its offended Lord. When <hi>Sodom</hi> was to be destroy'd,
<hi>Abraham</hi> interceded with God that he would spare it for the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
sake:<note place="margin">Gen. 18.</note> And <hi>David</hi> interceded to save his guiltless People from
God's Judgments and the Destroying Angel.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24. 17.</note> But here is no Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
for Mankind in this last extremity: None to interpose where
the Mediator of our Peace is the party offended. Shall then <hi>the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
perish with the wicked? Shall not the Iudge of all the Earth do
right?</hi> Or if the Righteous be translated and delivered from This
Fire, what shall become of innocent Children and Infants? Must
these all be given up to the merciless flames, as a Sacrifice to <hi>Moloch?</hi>
and their tender flesh, like burnt incense, send up fumes to feed
the nostrils of evil Spirits? Can the God of <hi>Israel</hi> smell a sweet
favour from such Sacrifices? The greater half of Mankind is made
up of Infants and Children: and if the wicked be destroyed, <hi>yet
these Lambs, what have they done?</hi> Are there no bowels of compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for such an harmless multitude? But we leave them to their
Guardian Angels,<note place="margin">Matt. 18. 10.</note> and to that Providence which watches over all
things.</p>
                     <p>It only remains therefore, to let fall that Fire from Heaven, which
is to consume this Holocaust. Imagine all Nature now standing in
a silent expectation to receive its last doom: The Tutelary and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
Angels to have their instructions: Every thing to be ready
for the fatal hour: And then, after a little silence, all the Host of
Heaven to raise their voice and sing aloud, <hi>LET GOD ARISE:
Let his enemies be scatter'd. As smoak is driven away, so drive them
away, As wax melteth before the fire, so LET the wicked perish at
the presence of God.</hi> And upon this, as upon a signal given, all the
sublunary World breaks into Flames, and all the Treasuries of Fire
are open'd, in Heaven and in Earth.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Conflagration begins. If one should now go about to
represent <hi>the World on Fire,</hi> with all the confusions that necessarily
must be, in Nature and in Mankind, upon that occasion, it would
seem to most Men a Romantick Scene. yet we are sure there must
be such a Scene. <hi>The heavens will pass away with a noise, and the
Elements will melt with fervent heat, and all the works of the Earth will
be burm up.</hi> And these things cannot come to pass without the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
disorders imaginable, both in the minds of Men and in external
Nature: and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>addest spectacles that eye can behold. We think
it a great matter to see a single person burnt alive: here are Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
shrieking in the flames at once. 'Tis frightful to us to look
upon a great City in flames, and to see the distractions and misery
of the people: here is an Universal Fire through all the Cities of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41970:169"/>
the Earth, and an Universal Massacre of their Inhabitants. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever

                        </gap>s History.</p>
                     <p>The disorders in Nature and the inanimate World will be no less,
nor less strange and unaccountable, than those in Mankind. Every Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and every Region, so far as the bounds of this Fire extend,
will be in a tumult and a fury, and the whole habitable World
running into confusion. A World is sooner destroyed than made,
and Nature relapses hastily into that Chaos-state, ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of which she
came by slow and leisurely motions. As an Army advances into
the field by just and regular marches, but when it is broken and
routed, it flies with precipitation, and one cannot describe its posture.
Fire is a barbarous Enemy, it gives no mercy; there is nothing but
fury, and rage, and ruine, and destruction, wheresoever it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails.

                        </gap> Thunder and Earthquakes are the Sons of
Fire: and we know nothing in all Nature, more impetuous, or
more irresistibly destructive than these two. And accordingly in this
last war of the Elements, we may be sure, they will bear the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>
parts, and do great execution in the several regions of the World.
Earthquakes and Subterraneous Eruptions will tear the body and
bowels of the Earth; and Thunders and convulsive motions of the
Air, rend the Skies. The waters of the Sea will boyl and struggle
with streams of Sulphur that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>un into them; which will make them
fume, and smoak, and roar, beyond all storms and tempests. And
these noises of the Sea will be answered again from the Land by
falling Rocks and Mountains. This is a small part of the disorders of
that day.</p>
                     <p>But 'tis not possible, from any station, to have a full prospect of
this last Scene of the Earth: for 'tis a mixture of fire and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
This New Temple is fill'd with smoak, while it is consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and none can enter into it. But I am apt to think, if we could
look down upon this burning World from above the Clouds, and
have a full view of it, in all its parts, we should think it a lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
of <hi>Hell</hi> it self. For, Fire and darkness are the two
chief things by which that state, or that place, uses to be describ'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and they are both here mingled together: with all other ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
that make that Tophet that is prepar'd of old.<note place="margin">Isa. 30.</note> Here are Lakes
of fire and brimstone: Rivers of melted glowing matter: Ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Volcano's vomiting flames all at once. Thick darkness, and
Pillars of smoak twisted about with wreaths of flame, like fiery
Snakes. Mountains of Earth thrown up into the Air, and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
dropping down in lumps of fire. These things will all be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally
true, concerning that day, and that state of the Earth. And
if we suppose <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> and his Apostate crew, in the midst of this
fiery furnace: (and I know not where they can be else.) It will be
hard to find any part of the Universe, or any state of things, that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41970:170"/>
answers to so many of the properties and characters of <hi>Hell,</hi> as this
which is now before us.</p>
                     <p>But if we suppose the storm over, and that the fire hath got an
entire victory over all other bodies, and subdued every thing to it
self, the Conflagration will end in a Deluge of fire: Or, in a Sea of
fire, covering the whole Globe of the Earth. For, when the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
region of the Earth is melted into a fluor, like molten glass, or
running metal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it will, according to the nature of other Fluids, fill
all vacuities and depressions, and fall into a regular surface, at an
equal distance, every where, from its center. This Sea of fire, like
the first Abyss, will cover the face of the whole Earth: make a kind
of second Chaos: and leave a capacity for another World to rise
from it. But that is not our present business. Let us only, if you
please to take leave of this subject<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reflect upon this occasion, on
the transient and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> glory of all this habitable World. How,
by the force of one Element, breaking loose upon the rest, all the
Varieties of Nature all the works of Art, all the labours of Men
are reduc'd to nothing. All that we admir'd and ador'd before,
as great and magnificent, is obliterated or vanish'd. And another
form and face of things, plain, simple, and every where the same,
overspreads the whole Earth. Where are now the great Empires
of the World, and their great Imperial Cities? Their Pillars, Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

impressions, what difference or distinction do you see in this mass
of fire? <hi>Rome</hi> it self, <hi>Eternal Rome,</hi> the Great City, the Empress of
the World, whose domination and superstition, <hi>ancient and modern,</hi>
make a great part of the History of this Earth: What is become of
her now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> She laid her foundations deep, and her Palaces were
strong and sumptuous: <hi>She glorified her self, and liv'd deliciously: and
said in her heart, I sit a Queen, and shall see no sorrow.</hi> But her hour
is come, she is wip'd away from the face of the Earth, and buried in
perpetual oblivion. But 'tis not Cities only, and works of Men's
hands, but the everlasting Hills, the Mountains and Rocks of the
Earth, are melted as Wax before the Sun; and <hi>their place is no where
found.</hi> Here stood the <hi>Alpes,</hi> a prodigious range of Stone, the Load
of the Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that cover'd many Countries, and reach'd their arms
from the Ocean to the <hi>Black Sea;</hi> This huge mass of Stone is
soften'd and dissolv'd, as a tender Cloud into rain. Here stood the

was frozen <hi>Caucasus,</hi> and <hi>Taurus,</hi> and <hi>Imaus,</hi> and the Mountains of

                     <p>IF the Conflagration of the World be a reality, as, both by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

and convinc'd of this: 'Tis a thing of that nature, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

upon it. 'Tis both great in it self, and of universal concern

                        </gap>lames, or no? What is my security that I shall not
fall under this fiery vengeance, which is the wrath of an angry
God? St. <hi>Peter,</hi> when he had deliver'd the doctrine of the Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration,<note place="margin">2 Epist. 3. 11.</note>
makes this pious reflection upon it: <hi>Seeing then that all these
things shall be dissolv'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what manner of persons ought you to be, in holy
conversation and godliness?</hi> The strength of his argument depends
chiefly upon what he had said before in the <hi>7th.</hi> Verse, where he
told us, that the <hi>present Heavens and Earth were reserv'd unto fire, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Day of Iudgment, and the perdition of irreligious men.</hi> We
must avoid the crime then, if we would escape the punishment.
But this expression of <hi>irreligious</hi> or <hi>ungodly men,</hi> is still very general<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
St. <hi>Paul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> when he speaks of this fiery indignation, and the Persons
it is to fall upon, is more distinct in their characters. He seems to
mark out for this destruction, three sorts of men chiefly, <hi>The Atheists,
Infidels,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Thess. 1. 7, 8.</note> 
                        <hi>and the Tribe of Antichrist.</hi> These are his words: <hi>When the
Lord Iesus shall be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angels, in fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God: and that obey
not the Gospel of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> Then as for Antichrist and
his adherents, he says, in the <hi>2d.</hi> Chapt. and <hi>8th.</hi> Verse, <hi>The Lord
shall consume that Wicked one with the Spirit of his mouth, and shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
him with the brightness of his coming,</hi> or of his Presence. These,
you see, all refer to the same time with St. <hi>Peter:</hi> namely, to the
coming of our Saviour, at the Conflagration; and three sorts of
Persons are characteriz'd as his Enemies, and set out for destruction
at that time. First, those that know not God: that is, that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
not God, that will not own the Deity. Secondly, those that
hearken not to the Gospel; that is, that reject the Gospel and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, when they are preach'd and made known to them.
For you must not think that it is the poor barbarous and ignorant
Heathens, that scarce ever heard of God, or the Gospel, that are
threaten'd with this fiery vengeance. No, 'tis the Heathens, that
live amongst Christians; those that are Infidels, as to the existence
of God, or the truth of Christian Religion, tho' they have had a
full manifestation of both. These are properly the Adversaries of
God and Christ. And such adversaries, St. <hi>Paul</hi> says in another
place,<note place="margin">Heb. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 27.]</note> 
                        <hi>A fearful judgment, and fiery indignation shall devour:</hi> which
still refers to the same time, and the same Persons we are speaking
of. Then as to the third sort of Men, Antichrist and his Followers,
besides this Text of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> 'tis plain to me in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41970:171"/>
the Apocalypse, that <hi>Mystical Babylon</hi> is to be consum'd by fire: and
the <hi>Beast</hi> and <hi>False Prophet</hi> to be thrown into the <hi>Lake that burns with
fire and</hi> brimstone: Which Lake is no where to be found till the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration.</p>
                     <p>You see then for whom <hi>Tophet</hi> is prepar'd of old. For Atheists,
isfidels, and Antichristian Persecutors. And they will have for their
Companions, the Devil and his Angels, the heads of the Apostasie.
These are all in open rebellion against God and Christ, and at defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
as it were, with Heaven. Excepting Antichrist, who is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a secret conspiracy, than an open rebellion. For, under a
pretended Commission from Jesus Christ, He persecutes his Servants,
dishonours his Person, corrupts his Laws and his Government, and
makes War against his Saints. And this is a greater affront and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,
if possible, than a bare fac'd opposition would be.</p>
                     <p>There are other Men, besides these, that are unacceptable to God:
All sorts of sinners and wicked persons: but they are not so proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Enemies of God, as these we have mention'd. An intemperate
Man is an Enemy to himself, and an injust Man is an Enemy to his
Neighbour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But those that deny God, or Christ, or persecute their
Servants, are directly and immediately Enemies to God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when the Lord comes in flames of fire to triumph over his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
To take vengeance upon all that are Rebels or Conspirators
against him and his Christ, these Monsters of Men will be the
first and most exemplary Objects of the divine wrath and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                     <p>To under take to speak to these three Orders of men, and convince
them of their errour, and the danger of it, would be too much for
the Conclusion of a short Treatise. And as for the third sort, the
Subjects of Antichrist, none but the Learned amongst them are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
to be inqulsitive, or to read such things as condemn their
Church, or the Governours of it. Therefore I do not expect that
this English Translation should fall into many of their hands. But
those of them, that are pleas'd to look into the <hi>Latin,</hi> will find, in
the Conclusion of it, a full and fair warning to come out of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon:</hi>
which is there prov'd to be the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Then as to
those that are Atheistically inclin'd, which I am willing to believe
are not many, I desire them to consider, How mean a thing it is, to
have hopes only in this Life: and how uneasie a thing, to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but fears as to the Future. Those, sure, must be little nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Souls, that can make themselves a portion and a sufficiency out
of what they enjoy here: That think of no more, that desire no
more. For what is this life, but a circulation of little mean acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
We lie down and rise again: dress and undress: feed and wax
hungry: work, or play, and are weary: and then we lie down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and the circle returns. We spend the day in trifles, and
when the Night comes, we throw our selves into the Bed of folly,
amongst dreams and broken thoughts and wild imaginations. Our
reason lies asleep by us; and we are, for the time, as arrant Brutes,
as those that sleep in the Stalls, or in the Field. Are not the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities
of Man higher than these? and ought not his ambition and
expectations to be greater? Let us be Adventurers for another
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41970:171"/>
World: 'Tis, at least, a fair and noble Chance: and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in this, worth our thoughts or our passions. If we should be
disappointed, we are still no worse than the rest of our fellow mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals:
and if we succeed in our expectations, we are eternally
happy.</p>
                     <p>For my part, I cannot be perswaded, that any man of Atheistical
inclinations can have a great and generous Soul. For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
great in the World, if you take God out of it. Therefore
such a person can have no great thought, can have no great aims,
or expectations, or designs; for all must lie within the compass of
this Life, and of this dull Body. Neither can he have any great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stincts
or noble passions: For if he had, they would naturally excite
in him greater Idea, inspire him with higher notions, and open
the Scenes of the Intellectual World. Lastly, He cannot have any
great sefice of Order, Wisdom, Goodness, Providence, or any of
the Divine Perfections. And these are the greatest things that can
enter into the thoughts of man, and that do most enlarge and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble
his mind. And therefore I say again, That, He that is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
inclined to Atheism, being also naturally destitute of all these,
must have a little and narrow soul.</p>
                     <p>But you'l say, it may be, This is to expostulate rather than to
prove: or to upbraid us with our make and temper, rather than
to convince us of an error in speculation. 'Tis an error it may be
in practice, or in point of prudence; but we seek Truth, whether
it make for us or against us; convince us therefore by just reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and direct arguments, That there is a God, and then wee'l en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to correct these defects in our natural complexion. You
say well; and therefore I have endeavour'd to do this before, in
another part of this Theory, in the <hi>Second Book, ch.</hi> 11. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Author of Nature:</hi> where you may see, that the Powers of
Nature, or of the Material World, cannot answer all the Phano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena
of the Universe, which are there represented. This you may
consult at leisure. But, in the mean time, 'tis a good perswasive
why we should not easily give our selves up to such inclinations or
opinions, as have neither generosity, nor prudence on their side.
And it cannot be amiss, that these persons should often take into
their thoughts, this last scene of things, The <hi>Conflagration</hi> of the
World. Seeing if there be a God, they will certainly be found in
the number of his Enemies, and of those that will have their porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Lake that burns with Fire and Brimstone.</p>
                     <p>The Third sort of persons that we are to speak to, are the Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous,
or such as do not believe the truth of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> tho'
they believe there is a God. These are commonly men of Wit and
Pleasure, that have not patience enough to consider, coolely and in
due order, the grounds upon which it appears, that Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is from Heaven, and of Divine Authority. They ought, in
the first place, to examine <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> and the History of our
Saviour: That there was such a Person, in the Reigns of <hi>Augustus</hi>
and <hi>Tiherius,</hi> that wrought such and such Miracles in <hi>Iudaea;</hi> taught
such a Doctrine: was Crucified at <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> rise from the dead the
Third Day, and visibly ascended into Heaven. If these matters of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41970:172"/>
Fact be denied, then the controversie turns only to an Historical
question, <hi>Whether</hi> the Evangelical History be a fabulous, or true
History: which it would not be proper to examine in this place.
But if matter of Fact recorded there; and in the Acts
of the Apostles, and the first Ages of Christianity, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
as I suppose it is, then the Question that remains
is this, <hi>Whether</hi> such matter of Fact does not sufficiently prove
the divine authority of Jesus Christ and of his Doctrine. We
suppose it possible, for a person to have such Testimonials of
divine authority, as may be sufficient to convince Mankind, or
the more reasonable part of Mankind; And if that be possible,
what, pray, is a wanting in the Testimonies of Jesus Christ? The
Prophecies of the Old Testament bear witness to him: His Birth
was a miracle, and his Life a train of Miracles: not wrought out of
levity and vain ostentation, but for useful and charitable purposes.
His Doctrine and Morality not only blameless, but Noble: designed
to remove out of the World the imperfect Religion of the <hi>Iews,</hi>
and the false Religion of the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> All Idolatry and Superstition:
and thereby to improve Mankind, under a better and more perfect
dispensation. He gave an example of a spotless innocency in all his
Conversation, free from Vice or any evil; and liv'd in a neglect of
all the Pomp or Pleasures of this Life, referring his happiness whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to another World. He Prophesied concerning his own Death,
and his Resurrection: and concerning the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem:</hi>
which all came to pass in a signal manner. He also Prophesied of the
Success of his Gospel: which, after his Death, immediately took
root, and spread it self every way throughout the World: mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre
all opposition or persecution, from <hi>Iews</hi> or <hi>Heathens.</hi> It was
not supported by any temporal power for above three hundred
Years: nor were any arts us'd, or measures taken, according to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
prudence, for the conservation of it. But, to omit other
things, That grand article of his Rising from the Dead, Ascending
visibly into Heaven, and pouring down the miraculous Gifts of the
Holy Ghost, (according as he had promis'd) upon his Apostles and
their followers: This alone is to me a Demonstration of his Divine
Authority. To conquer Death: To mount, like an Eagle, into the
Skies: and to inspire his followers with inimitable gifts and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
are things, without controversie, beyond all humane power:
and may and ought be esteemed sure Credentials of a person sent
from Heaven.</p>
                     <p>From these matters of Fact we have all possible assurance, that
Jesus Christ was no Impostor or deluded person: (one of which
two Characters all unbelievers must fix upon him) but Commission'd
by Heaven to introduce a New Religion: to reform the World, to
remove Judaism and Idolatry; The beloved Son of God, the great
Prophet of the later Ages, the True Messiah that was to come.</p>
                     <p>It may be, you will confess, that these are great arguments that
the Author of our Religion was a Divine Person, and had superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
powers: but withal, that there are so many difficulties in
Christian Religion, and so many things unintelligible, that a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
man knows not how to believe it, tho' he be inclin'd to admire
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41970:172"/>
the person of Jesus Christ. I answer, If they be such difficulties as
are made only by the Schools and disputacious Doctors, you are
not to trouble your self about them, for they are of no Authority.
But if they be in the very words of Scripture, then tis either in
things practical, or in things meerly speculative. As to the Rules of
Practice in Christian Religion, I do not know any thing in Scripture,
obscure or unintelligible. And as to Speculations, great discretion
and moderation is to be us'd in the conduct of them. If these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Fact, which we have alledg'd, prove the Divinity of the
Revelation, keep close to the Words of that Revelation, asserting
no more than it asserts, and you cannot err. But if you will expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate,
and determine modes, and forms, and consequences; you may
easily be puzled by your own forwardness. For besides some things that
are in their own nature, Infinite and Incomprehensible, there are
many other things in Christian Religion that are incompleatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd;
the full knowledge whereof, it has pleased God to reserve to
another life, and to give us only a summary account of them at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
We have so much deference for any Government, as not to
expect that all their Councels and secrets should be made known
to us, nor to censure every action whose reasons we do not fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend;
much more in the Providential administration of a World,
we must be content to know so much of the Councels of Heaven and
of supernatural Truths, as God has thought fit to reveal to us. And
if these Truths be no otherwise than in a general manner, summarl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and incompleatly revealed in this life, as commonly they are, we
must not therefore throw off the Government, or reject the whole
Dispensation: of whose Divine Authority we have otherways full
proof and satisfactory evidence. For this would be, To lose the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in catching at a Shadow.</p>
                     <p>But Men that live continually in the noise of the World, amidst
business and pleasures, their time is commonly shar'd betwixt those
two. So that little or nothing is left for Meditation, at least, not
enough for such Meditations as require length, justness, and order.
They should retire from the crowd for one Month or two, to study
the truth of Christian Religion, if they have any doubt of it. They
retire sometimes to cure a Gout, or other Diseases, and diet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
according to rule: but they will not be at that pains, to cure
a disease of the Mind, which is of far greater and more fatal conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
If they perish by their own negligence or obstinacy, the
Physician is not to blame. Burning is the last remedy in some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers:
and they would do well to remember, that the World
will flame about their heads one of these days: and whether they
be amongst the Living, or amongst the Dead, at that time, the
Apostle makes them a part of the Fewel, which that fiery venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
will prey upon. Our Saviour hath been true to his Word hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto:
whether in his Promises, or in his Threatnings; He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
the Apostles to send down the Holy Ghost upon them after his
Ascension, and that was fully accomplish'd. He foretold and
threaten'd the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> and that came to pass ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
soon after he had left the World. And he hath told us
also,<note place="margin">Matt. 24. 30. &amp; 25. 32, &amp;c.</note> that he will come again in <hi>the Clouds of Heaven, with power and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41970:173"/>
great glory;</hi> and that will be to judge the World. <hi>When the Son of
Man shall come in his glory, and all the holy Angels with him, then shall
he sit upon the Throne of his glory. And before him shall be gather'd all
Nations,</hi> and he will separate the good from the bad; and to the
wicked and unbelievers he will say,<note place="margin">Ver. 41.</note> 
                        <hi>Depart from me ye cursed, into
everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> This is the same
Coming, and the same Fire, with that which we mention'd before
out of S. <hi>Paul.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Thess. 1. 7, 8, 9.</note> As you will plainly see, if you compare S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>'s
words with S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, which are these, <hi>When the Lord Iesus
shall be revealed from heaven, with his mighty Angels: In flaming fire,
taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that hearken not to
the Gospel of our Lord Iesus Christ. Who shall be punished with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
destruction, from, or by the presence of the Lord, and the glory of
his power.</hi> This, me thinks, should be an awakening thought, that
there is such a threatning upon record, (by one who never yet fail'd
in his word) against those that do not believe his Testimony. Those
that reject him now as a Dupe, or an Impostor, run a hazard of
seeing him hereafter coming in the Clouds to be their Judge. And
it will be too late then to correct their errour, when the bright Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of Angels fill the Air, and the Earth begins to melt at the
Presence of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Thus much concerning those three ranks of Men, whom the
Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> seems to point at principally, and condemn to the
flames. But, as I said before, the rest of sinners and vitious Persons
amongst the Professors of Christianity, tho' they are not so directly
the Enemies of God, as these are; yet being transgressors of his Law,
they must expect to be brought to Justice. In every well-govern'd
State, not only Traitors and Rebels, that offend more immediately
against the Person of the Prince, but all others, that notoriously
violate the Laws, are brought to condign punishment, according to
the nature and degree of their crime. So in this case, <hi>The fire shall
try every man's work, of what sort it is.</hi> 'Tis therefore the concern
of every man to reflect often upon that Day, and to consider what
his fate and sentence is likely to be, at that last Trial. The <hi>Iews</hi>
have a Tradition that <hi>Elias</hi> sits in Heaven, and keeps a Register of
all Mens actions, good or bad. He hath his Under Secretaries for
the several Nations of the World, that take minutes of all that passes:
and so hath the History of every Man's life before him, ready to be
produc'd at the Day of Judgment. I will not vouch for the literal
truth of this, but it is true in effect. Every Man's fate shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd
that Day, according to the history of his Life: according
to the works done in the flesh, whether good or bad. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it ought to have as much influence upon us, as if every single
action was formally register'd in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>If Men would learn to contemn this World, it would cure a
great many Vices at once. And, methinks, S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s argument,
from the approaching dissolution of all things, should put us out of
conceit with such perishing vanities. Lust and Ambition are the
two reigning Vices of great Men: and those little fires might be
soon extinguish'd, if they would frequently and seriously meditate
on this last and Universal Fire; which will put an end to all Passions
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41970:173"/>
and all Contentions. As to Ambition, the Heathens themselves
made use of this argument, to abate and repress the vain affectation
of glory and greatness in this World. I told you before the lesson
that was given to <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> by his Uncle's Ghost, upon this
Subject. And upon a like occasion and consideration, <hi>Caesar</hi> hath a
lesson given him by <hi>Lucan,</hi> after the Battle of <hi>Pharsalia;</hi> where
<hi>Pompey</hi> lost the day, and <hi>Rome</hi> its liberty. The Poet says, <hi>Caesar</hi> took
pleasure in looking upon the dead Bodies, and would not suffer
them to be buried, or, which was their manner of burying, to be
burnt. Whereupon he speaks to him in these words:
<q>
                           <l>Hos, <hi>Caesar,</hi> populos si nunc non usserit Ignis,</l>
                           <l>Uret cum Terris, uret cum gurgite Ponti.</l>
                           <l>Communis mundo superest Rogus, Ossibus astra</l>
                           <l>Misturus. Quocunque Tuam Fortuna vocabit,</l>
                           <l>Hae quoque eunt Animae; non altiùs ibis in auras,</l>
                           <l>Non meliore loco Stygiâ sub nocte jacebis.</l>
                           <l>Libera fortuna Mors est: Capit omnia Tellus</l>
                           <l>Quae genuit; Coelo tegitur Qui non habet urnam.</l>
                        </q>
Caesar,
<q>
                           <l>If now these Bodies want their pile and urn,</l>
                           <l>At last, with the whole Globe, they're sure to burn.</l>
                           <l>The World expects one general Fire: and Thou</l>
                           <l>Must go where these poor Sculs are wand'ring now.</l>
                           <l>Thou'l reach no higher, in th' Ethereal Plain,</l>
                           <l>Nor 'mongst the Shades a better place obtain.</l>
                           <l>Death levels all: And He that has not room</l>
                           <l>To make a Grave, Heaven's Vault shall be his Tomb.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>These are mortifying thoughts to ambitious Spirits. And surely
our own Mortality, and the Mortality of the World it self, may be
enough to convince all considering Men, That, <hi>Vanity of Vanities, all
is vanity under the Sun:</hi> any otherwise than as they relate to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Life.</p>

                  <head>PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
                  <p>YOU see it is still my lot, to travel into New Worlds: having
never found any great satisfaction in this. As an active people
leaves their habitations in a barren soil, to try if they can make
their fortune better elsewhere. I first lookt backwards, and waded through
the Deluge, into the Primaeval World: to see how they liv'd there, and
how Nature stood in that original constitution. Now I am going forwards,
to view the <hi>New Heavens</hi> and <hi>New Earth,</hi> that will be after the Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration.
But, <hi>Gentle Reader,</hi> let me not take you any further, if you
be weary. I do not love a querulous Companion. Unless your Genius there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
press you forwards, chuse rather to rest here, and be content with that
part of the Theory which you have seen already. Is it not fair, to have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
Nature so far as to have seen her twice in her ruins? Why should
we still pursue her, even after death and dissolution, into dark and remote
Futurities? To whom therefore such disquisitions seem needless, or over-cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
let them rest here; and leave the remainder of this Work, which is
a kind of <hi>PROPHECY concerning the STATE of things after the
Conflagration,</hi> to those that are of a disposition suited to such studies and
enquiries.</p>
                  <p>Not that any part of this Theory requires much Learning, Art, or Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
to be Master of it; But a love and thirst after Truth, freedom of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and a resignation of our Understanding to clear Evidence, let it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
us which way it will. An honest <hi>English Reader</hi> that looks only at the
Sence as it lies before him, and neither considers nor cares whether it be
New or Old, so it be true, may be a more competent Iudge than a great
Scholar fall of his own Notions, and puff'd up with the opinion of his mighty
knowledge. For such men think they cannot in honour own any thing to be
true, which they did not know before. To be taught any new knowledge,
is to confess their former ignorance; and that lessens them in their own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and, as they think, in the opinion of the World; which are both
uneasie reflections to them. Neither must we depend upon age only for
soundness of Iudgment. Men in discovering and owning truth seldom
change their Opinions after threescore: especially if they be leading Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
It is then too late, we think, to begin the World again; and as we
grow old, the Heart contracts; and cannot open wide enough to take in a
great thought.</p>
                  <p>The Spheres of mens Understandings are as different, as Prospects upon
the Earth. Some stand upon a Rock or a Mountain, and see far round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout;
Others are in an hollow, or in a Cave, and have no prospect at all.
Some men consider nothing but what is present to their Senses: Others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb facs="tcp:41970:176"/>
their thoughts both to what is past and what is future. And yet the
fairest prospect in this Life is not to be compar'd to the least we shall have
in another. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>irty and hazy: We see not far, and
what we do see is in a had light. But when we have got better Bodies in
the first Resurrection, whereof we are going to Treat; better Senses and a
better Understanding, a clearer light and an higher station, our Horizon
will be enlarg'd every way, both as to the Natural World and as to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellecual.</p>
                  <p>Two of the greatest Speculations that we are capable of in this Life, are,
in my Opinion, The REVOLUTION OF WORLDS, and the REVO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LUTION
OF SOULS; one for the Material World, and the other for
the Intellectual. Toward the former of these Our Theory is an Essay: and
in this our Planet, (which I hope to conduct into a Fix'd Star, before I
have done with it) we give an instance of what may be in other Planets.
'Tis true, we took our rise no higher than the Chaos: because that was a
known principle, and we were not willing to amuse the <hi>Reader</hi> with too
many strange Stories: as that, I am sure, would have been thought one,
TO HAVE brought this Earth from a Fix'd Star, and then carried it up
again into the same Sphere. Which yet I believe, is the true circle of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Providence.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Revolution</hi> of <hi>Souls,</hi> the footsteps of that Speculation are
more obscure than of the former. For tho' we are assur'd by Scripture,
that all good Souls will at length have Celestial Bodies; yet, that this is
a returning to a Primitive State, or to what they had at their first Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that, Scripture has not acquainted us with. It tells us indeed that
Angels fell from their Primitive Celestial Glory; and consequently we
might be capable of a lapse as well as they, if we had been in that high
condition with them. But that we ever were there, is not declared to us by
any revelation. Reason and Morality would indeed suggest to us, that an
innocent Soul, fresh and pure from the hands of its Maker, could not be
immediately cast into Prison, before it had, by any act of its own Will, or
any use of its own Understanding, committed either error or sin. I call this
Body a Prison, both because it is a confinement and restraint upon our best
Faculties and Capacities, and is also the seat of diseases and loathsomness;
and; as prisons use to do, commonly tends more to debauch mens Natures,
than to improve them.</p>
                  <p>But tho' we cannot certainly tell under what circumstances humane
Souls were plac'd at first, yet all Antiquity agrees, Oriental and Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental,
concerning their pre existence in general, in respect of these mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Bodies. And our Saviour never reproaches or corrects the <hi>Jews,</hi> when
they speak upon that supposition, <hi>Luk. 9. 18, 19. Joh.</hi> 9. 2. Besides, it
seems to me beyond all controversie,<note place="margin">Joh. 3. 13. &amp; 6. 38. &amp; 62. &amp; 17. 5.</note> that the Soul of the Messiah did exist
before the Incarnation, and voluntarily descended from Heaven to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it a Mortal Body. And tho' it does not appear that all humane Souls
were at first plac'd in Glory, yet, from the example of our Saviour, we see
something greater in them: Namely, a capacity to be united to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.
And what is possible to one, is possible to more. But these thoughts
are too high for us: while we find our selves united to nothing, but diseased
bodies and houses of clay.</p>
                  <p>The greatest fault we can commit in such Speculations, is to be over-posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and Dogmatical. To be inquisitive into the ways of Providence and the
<pb facs="tcp:41970:176"/>
works of God, is so far from being a fault, that it is our greatest perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
We cultivate the highest principles and best inclinations of our Nature,
while we are thus employ'd: and 'tis littleness or secularity of Spirit, that
is the greatest Enemy to Contemplation. Those that would have a true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of this World, must suffer the Soul to be sometimes upon the Wing,
and to raise her self above the sight of this little dark Point, which we now
inhabit. Give her a large and free prospect of the immensity of God's works,
and of his inexhausted wisdom and goodness, if you would make her Great
and Good. As the warm Philosopher says,
<q>
                        <lg>
                           <l>Give me a Soul so great, so high,</l>
                           <l>Let her dimensions stretch the Skie:</l>
                           <l>That comprehends within a thought,</l>
                           <l>The whole extent 'twixt God and Nought.</l>
                           <l>And from the World's first birth and date,</l>
                           <l>Its Life and Death can calculate:</l>
                           <l>With all th' adventures that shall pass,</l>
                           <l>To ev'ry Atome of the Mass.</l>
                        </lg>
                        <lg>
                           <l>But let her be as GOOD as GREAT,</l>
                           <l>Her highest Throne a Mercy-Seat.</l>
                           <l>Soft and dissolving like a Cloud,</l>
                           <l>Losing her self in doing good.</l>
                           <l>A Cloud that leaves its place above,</l>
                           <l>Rather than dry, and useless move:</l>
                           <l>Falls in a showre upon the Earth,</l>
                           <l>And gives ten thousand Seeds a birth.</l>
                           <l>Hangs on the Flow'rs, and infant Plants,</l>
                           <l>Sucks not their Sweets, but feeds their Wants.</l>
                           <l>So let this mighty Mind diffuse</l>
                           <l>All that's her own to others use;</l>
                           <l>And free from private ends, retain</l>

THE INTRODVCTION.</head>
                     <head type="sub">That the World will not be annihilated in the last Fire.
That we are to expect, according to Scripture and the
Christian Doctrine, New Heavens and a New Earth,
when these are dissolv'd or burnt up.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E are now so far advanc'd in the Theory of the
Earth, as to have seen the End of Two Worlds:
One destroy'd by Water, and another by Fire. It
remains only to consider, whether we be yet come
to the final period of Nature: The last Scene of
all things, and consequently the utmost bound of
our enquiries. Or, whether Providence, which is
inexhausted in Wisdom and Goodness, will raise up, from this
dead Mass, New Heavens and a New Earth. Another habitable
World, better and more perfect than that which was destroyed.
That, as the first World began with a Paradise, and a state of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
so the last may be a kind of Renovation of that happy state;
whose Inhabitants shall not die, but be translated to a blessed Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="90" facs="tcp:41970:178"/>
I know 'tis the opinion of some, that this World will be anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated,
or reduc'd to nothing, at the Conflagration: and that would
put an end to all further enquiries. But whence do they learn this?
from Scripture, or Reason, or their own imagination? What in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
or example can they give us, of this they call <hi>Annihilation?</hi> Or
what place of Scripture can they produce, that says the World, in
the last Fire, shall be reduc'd to nothing? If they have neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
nor proof of what they affirm, 'tis an empty Imagination of
their own: neither agreeable to Philosophy, nor Divinity. Fire
does not consume any substance: It changes the form and qualities
of it, but the matter remains. And if the design had been <hi>Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation,</hi>
the employing of fire would have been of no use or effect.
For smoak and ashes are at as great a distance from <hi>Nothing,</hi> as the
bodies themselves out of which they are made. But these Authors
seem to have but a small tincture of Philosophy, and therefore it
will be more proper to confute their opinion from the words of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
which hath left us sufficient evidence, that another World
will succeed after the Conflagration of that we now inhabit.</p>
                     <p>The Prophets, both of the Old and New Testament, have left
us their predictions concerning <hi>New Heavens and a New Earth.</hi> So
says the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> ch. 65. 17. <hi>Behold I create New Heavens and
a New Earth, and the former shall not be remembred, or come into mind.</hi>
As not worthy our thoughts, in comparison of those that will arise
when these pass away. So the Prophet S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> in his <hi>Apocalypse,</hi>
when he was come to the End of this World,<note place="margin">Apoc. 21. 1.</note> says, <hi>And I saw a new
heaven and a new earth. For the first heaven and the first earth were
passed away, and there was no more Sea.</hi> Where he does not only
give us an account of a New Heaven and a New Earth, in general:
but also gives a distinctive character of the <hi>New Earth:</hi> that it shall
have <hi>no Sea.</hi> And in the <hi>5th ver.</hi> He that sat upon the Throne,
says, <hi>Behold I make all</hi> things <hi>New;</hi> which, consider'd with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedents
and consequents, cannot be otherwise understood than of a
New World.</p>
                     <p>But some Men make evasions here as to the words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and say they are to be understood in a figurate and allegorical
sence: and to be applyed to the times of the Gospel, either at first
or towards the latter end of the World. So as this <hi>New Heaven
and New Earth</hi> signifie only a great change in the moral World. But
how can that be, seeing S. <hi>Iohn</hi> places them after the end of the
World.<note place="margin">Ch. 65.</note> And the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> connects such things with his
New Heavens and New Earth, as are not competible to the present
state of Nature? However to avoid all shuffling and tergiversation
in this point, let us appeal to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> who uses a plain literal style,
and discourses down-right concerning the Natural World. In his
<hi>2d. Epist. and 3d. Chap:</hi> when he had foretold and explain'd the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Conflagration, he adds, But we expect <hi>New Heavens and a New
Earth according to his promises.</hi> These Promises were made by the
Prophets: and this gives us full authority to interpret their <hi>New
Heavens and New Earth</hi> to be after the <hi>Conflagration.</hi> S. <hi>Peter,</hi> when
he had describ'd the Dissolution of the World in the last Fire, in
full and emphatical terms, as <hi>the passing away of the Heavens with a
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41970:178"/>
noise: the melting of the Elements, and burning up all the works of the
Earth:</hi> he subjoyns, <hi>Nevertheless,</hi> notwithstanding this total disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of the present World, <hi>We, according to his promises, look for
new heavens and a new earth: wherein dwelleth Righteousness.</hi> As if
the Apostle should have said, Notwithstanding this strange and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
dissolution of the present Heavens and Earth, which I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
to you, we do not at all distrust God's Promises concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
New Heavens and a New Earth, that are to succeed these, and
to be the seat of the Righteous.</p>
                     <p>Here's no room for Allegories or allegorical expositions: unless
you will make the Conflagration of the World an Allegory. For,
as Heavens and Earth were destroy'd, so Heavens and Earth are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored:
and if in the first place you understand the natural material
World, you must also understand it in the second place: They are
both Allegories, or neither. But to make the Conflagration an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legory,
is not only to contradict S. <hi>Peter,</hi> but all Antiquity, Sacred
or Prophane. And I desire no more assurance that we shall have
New Heavens and a New Earth, in a literal Sence, than we have
that the present Heavens and Earth shall be destroyed in a literal
Sence, and by material Fire. Let it therefore rest upon that issue as
to this first evidence and argument from Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Some will fancy, it may be, that we shall have New Heavens and
Earth, and yet that these shall be annihilated; They would have
These first reduc'd to nothing, and then others created, spick and
span New, out of nothing. But why so, pray, what's the humour
of that? Lest Omnipotency should want employment, you would
have it do, and undo, and do again. As if new-made Matter, like
new Clothes, or new Furniture, had a better Gloss, and was more
creditable. Matter never wears: as fine Gold, melt it down ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so often, it loses nothing of its quantity. The substance of the
World is the same, burnt or unburnt: and is of the same Value
and Virtue, New or Old: and we must not multiply the actions of
Omnipotency without necessity. God does not make, or unmake
things, to try experiments: He knows before hand the utmost ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities
of every thing, and does no vain or superfluous work. Such
imaginations as these proceed only from want of true Philosophy,
or the true knowledge of the Nature of God and of his Works;
which should always be carefully attended to, in such Speculations as
concern the Natural World. But to proceed in our Subject.</p>
                     <p>If they suppose part of the World to be annihilated, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
so, they Philosophize still worse and worse. How high shall
this Annihilation reach? Shall the Sun, Moon, and Stars be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to nothing? but what have They done, that they should un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
so hard a fate? must they be turn'd out of Being for our
faults? The whole material Universe will not be Annihilated at
this bout, for we are to have Bodies after the Resurrection, and to
live in Heaven. How much of the Universe then will you leave
standing: or how shall it subsist with this great <hi>Vacuum</hi> in the heart
of it? This shell of a World is but the fiction of an empty Brain:
For God and Nature in their works, never admit of such gaping
vacuities and emptinesses.</p>

If we consult Scripture again, we shall find that that makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a <hi>Restitution</hi> and <hi>Reviviscency</hi> of all things: At the End of
the World,<note place="margin">Act. 3.</note> or at the Coming of our Saviour. S. <hi>Peter,</hi> whose do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
we have hitherto followed, in his Sermon to the <hi>Iews</hi> after
our Saviour's Ascension, tells them that He will come again, and
that there will be then a <hi>Restitution of all things:</hi> such as was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
by the Prophets.<note place="margin">ver. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>The Heavens,</hi> says he, <hi>must receive him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the time of Restitution of all things: which God hath spoken by the
mouth of his holy Prophets, since the world began.</hi> If we compare this
passage of S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, with that which we alledged before out of his
second Epistle, it can scarce be doubted but that he refers to the
same Promises in both places: and what he there calls a <hi>New Heaven</hi>
and a <hi>New Earth,</hi> he calls here a <hi>Restitution of all things.</hi> For the
Heavens and the Earth comprehend all, and both these are but
different phrases for the Renovation of the World. This gives us
also light how to understand what our Saviour calls the <hi>Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
or <hi>Reviviscency,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matt. 19. 28, 29.</note> when he shall sit upon his Throne of Glory,
and will reward his followers an hundred fold, for all their Losses
in this World: Besides Everlasting Life as the Crown of all. I
know, in our English Translation, we separate <hi>the Regeneration</hi> from
<hi>sitting upon his Throne:</hi> but without any warrant from the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.
And seeing our Saviour speaks here of Bodily goods, and seems
to distinguish them from <hi>everlasting life,</hi> which is to be the final
reward of his Followers, This <hi>Regeneration</hi> seems to belong to his
Second Coming, when the World shall be renew'd or regenerated:
and the Righteous shall possess the Earth.</p>
                     <p>Other places of Scripture that foretel the fate of this Material
World, represent it always as a <hi>Change,</hi> not as an <hi>Annihilation.</hi>
S. <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>The Figure of this World passes away:</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 31. The
form, fashion and disposition of its parts: But the substance still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains.
As a Body that is melted down and dissolv'd, the Form pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,<note place="margin">Psal. 102. 26.</note>
but the Matter is not destroy'd. And the Psalmist says, The
Heavens and the Earth shall be <hi>chang'd:</hi> which answers to this
Transformation we speak of. The same Apostle, in the Eighth
Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ver. 21, 22, 23, 24.</note> shows also that this <hi>change</hi> shall be, and shall
be for the better: and calls it a <hi>Deliverance of the Creation from
vanity and corruption:</hi> and a participation of the <hi>glorious liberty of
the Children of God.</hi> Being a sort of <hi>Redemption,</hi> as they have a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of their Bodies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, seeing, the <hi>Renovation</hi> of the World is a Doctrine generally
receiv'd, both by ancient and modern Authors, as we shall have
occasion to show hereafter: We need add no more, in this place,
for confirmation of it. Some Men are willing to throw all things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a state of <hi>Nothing</hi> at the Conflagration, and bury them there,
that they may not be oblig'd to give an account of that state of things,
that is to succeed it. Those who think themselves bound in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
to know every thing in Theology that is knowable: and
find it uneasie to answer such questions and speculations, as would
arise upon their admitting a New World, think it more adviseable
to stifle it in the birth, and so to bound all knowledge at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration.
But surely, so far as Reason or Scripture lead us, we
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41970:179"/>
may and ought to follow: otherwise we should be ungrateful to
Providence, that sent us those Guides. Provided, we be always du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sensible of our own weakness: and, according to the difficulty of
the subject, and the measure of light that falls upon it, proceed
with that modesty and ingenuity, that becomes such fallible enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
after Truth, as we are. And this rule I desire to prescribe to
my self, as in all other Writings, so especially in this: where, tho'
I look upon the principal Conclusions as fully prov'd, there are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
particulars, that are rather propos'd to examination, than po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively
asserted.</p>

the second Chaos, or the remains of the old World. The
form, order, and qualities of the new Earth, according to
Reason and Scripture.</head>
                     <p>HAving prov'd from Scripture, that we are to expect <hi>New Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi>
and a <hi>New Earth,</hi> after the Conflagration; it would be
some pleasure and satisfaction to see how this new Frame will arise:
and what foundation there is in Nature for the accomplishment of
these promises. For, tho' the Divine Power be not bound to all the
Laws of Nature, but may dispence with them when there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity;
yet it is an ease to us in our belief, when we see them both
conspire in the same effect. And in order to this, we must consider
in what posture we left the demolish'd World: what hopes there is
of a Restauration. And we are not to be discourag'd, because we see
things at present wrapt up in a confus'd Mass: for, according to the
methods of Nature and Providence, in that dark Womb usually
are the seeds and rudiments of an Embryo World.</p>
                     <p>Neither is there, possibly, so great a confusion in this Mass, as we
imagine. The Heart and interiour Body of the Earth is still entire:
and that part of it that is consum'd by the fire, will be divided, of
its own accord, into two Regions. What is dissolv'd and melted,
being the heaviest, will descend as low as it can: and cover and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close
the kernel of the Earth round about, as a molten Sea or Abyss:
according as is explain'd and set down in the precedent Book. But
what is more light and volatile, will float in the Air: as fumes,
smoak, exhalations, vapours of Water, and whatsoever terrestrial
parts can be elevated, and supported by the strength of fire. These
all mingled together, of different sizes, figures, and motions, will
constitute an opake Cloud, or thick region of darkness round the
Earth: So as the Globe of the Earth, with its Atmosphere, after the
Conflagration is finish'd, will stand much what in the form repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
in this Scheme.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41970:180"/>
                        <figure/>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now as to the lower of these two regions, the region of melted
matter, A. A. we shall have little occasion to take notice of it: see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it will contribute nothing to the formation of the new World.
But the upper region, or all above that Orb of fire, is the true
draught of a Chaos: or a mixture and confusion of all the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
without order or distinction. Here are particles of Earth,
and of Air, and of Water, all promiscuously jumbled together, by
the force and agitation of the fire. But when that force ceases, and
every one is left to its own inclination, they will, according to their
different degrees of gravity, separate and sort themselves after this
manner. First, the heaviest and grossest parts of the Earth will
subside; then the watery parts will follow; then a lighter sort of
Earth; which will stop and rest upon the Surface of the Water,
and compose there a thin film or membrane; this membrane or
tender Orb is the first rudiment or foundation of a new habitable
Earth. For according as terrestrial parts fall upon it, from all the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41970:180"/>
regions and heighths of the Atmosphere, or of the Chaos, this Orb
will grow more firm, strong, and immoveable: able to support it
self and Inhabitants too. And having in it all the Principles of a
fruitful Soil, whether for the production of Plants or of Animals,
it will want no property or character of an habitable Earth. And
particularly, will become such an Earth, and of such a form, as the
first Paradisiacal Earth was. Which hath been fully describ'd in the
first and second Books of this Theory.</p>
                     <p>There is no occasion of examining more accurately the formation
of this Second Earth, seeing it is so much the same with that of the
First; which is set down fully and distinctly in the Fifth Chapter of
the first Book of this Theory. Nature here repeats the same work,
and in the same method; only the materials are now a little more
refin'd and purg'd by the fire. They both rise out of a Chaos, and
That, in effect, the same in both cases; For though in forming the
first Earth, I suppos'd the Chaos or confus'd Mass to reach down
to the Center, I did that only for the ease of our imagination; that
so the whole Mass might appear more simple and uniform. But in
reality, that Chaos had a solid kernel of Earth within, as this hath;
and that matter which fluctuated above in the regions of the Air,
was the true Chaos, whose parts, when they came to a separation,
made the several Elements, and the form of an habitable Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Air and Water. This Chaos upon separation, will fall
into the same form and Elements: and so in like manner create or
constitute a second Paradisiacal World.</p>
                     <p>I say a <hi>Paradisiacal</hi> World: for it appears plainly, that this new-form'd
Earth must agree with that Primigenial Earth, in the two
principal and fundamental properties. First, It is of an even, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
uniform and regular Surface, without Mountains or Sea. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly.
That it hath a straight and regular situation to the Sun, and
the <hi>Axis</hi> of the <hi>Ecliptick.</hi> From the manner of its formation, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
manifestly, that it must be of an even and regular Surface.
For the Orb of liquid fire, upon which the first descent was made,
being smooth and uniform every where, the matter that fell upon
it would take the same form and mould. And so the second or
third Region, that were superinduc'd, would still imitate the fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the first: there being no cause or occasion of any inequality.
Then as to the situation of its <hi>Axis,</hi> this uniformity of figure would
determine the center of its gravity to be exactly in the middle, and
consequently there would be no inclination of one Pole more than
another to the general center of its motion; But, upon a free li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration
in the liquid Air, its <hi>Axis</hi> would lie parallel with the <hi>Axis</hi>
of the Ecliptick where it moves. But these things having been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
more fully in the second Book about <hi>Paradise</hi> and the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genial
Earth,</hi> they need no further explication in this place.</p>
                     <p>If Scripture had left us several distinct Characters of the <hi>New
Heavens,</hi> and the <hi>New Earth,</hi> we might, by compare with those,
have made a full proof of our Hypothesis. One indeed St. <hi>Iohn</hi> hath
left us in very express terms, <hi>There was no Sea there,</hi> He says. His
words are these: <hi>And I saw a New Heaven, and a New Earth: for the
first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away; AND THERE
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41970:181"/>
WAS NO MORE SEA.</hi> This character is very particular, and
you see it exactly answers to our Hypothesis: for in the new-form'd
Earth, the Sea is cover'd and inconspicuous: being an Abyss, not a Sea;
and wholly lodg'd in the Womb of the Earth. And this one Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
being inexplicable upon any other supposition, and very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from the present Earth, makes it a strong presumption that
we have hit upon the true model of the New Heavens and New
Earth which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saw.</p>
                     <p>To this sight of the New Heavens and New Earth, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
subjoyns the sight of the <hi>New Ierusalem, ver.</hi> 2. as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary,
and in some respects the same thing. 'Tis true, the
Characters of the New <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in these two last Chapters of the
<hi>Apo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>alypse,</hi> are very hard to be understood: some of them being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competible
to a <hi>Terrestrial</hi> state, and some of them to a <hi>Celestial;</hi> so
as it seems to me very reasonable to suppose, that the New <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
spoken of by S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> is twofold: That which he saw himself,
<hi>ver.</hi> 2. and that which the Angel shewed him afterwards, <hi>ver.</hi> 9.
For I do not see what need there was of an <hi>Angel,</hi> and of <hi>taking him
up into a great and high mountain,</hi> only to shew him that which he had
seen before, at the foot of the Mountain. But however that be, we are
to consider in this place the Terrestrial New <hi>Ierusalem</hi> only, or that
which is in the New Heavens and New Earth. And as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> hath
joyned these two together,<note place="margin">Ch. 65. 17, 18.</note> so the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> had done the same
thing before; when he had promised <hi>New Heavens and a New Earth,</hi>
he calls them, under another name, <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> and they both use
the same character in effect, in the description of their <hi>Ierusalem.
Isaiah</hi> says,<note place="margin">Ver. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>And I will rejoyce in Ierusalem, and joy in my people: and
the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.</hi>
S. <hi>Iohn</hi> says also in his Jerusalem,<note place="margin">Apoc. 21. 3, 4.</note> 
                        <hi>God shall dwell with them, and
they shall be his people: And he shall wipe away all tears from their eyes:
and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall
there be any more pain.</hi> Now in both these Prophets, when they
treat upon this subject, we find they make frequent allusions to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise
and a Paradisiacal state; so as that may be justly taken as a
Scripture-Character of the <hi>New Heavens and the New Earth.</hi> The
Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> seems plainly to point at a Paradisiacal state,
throughout that Chapter, by an universal innocency, and harmles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of animals; and peace, plenty, health, longaevity or immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the inhabitants. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> also hath several allusions to Paradise,
in those two Chapters where he describes the New Jerusalem.<note place="margin">Ch. 21. &amp; ch. 23.</note> And
in his discourse to the seven Churches, in one place (ch. 2. 7.) <hi>To
him that overcometh</hi> is promised <hi>to eat of the tree of life, which is in the
midst of the Paradise of God.</hi> And in another place (ch. 3. 12.) <hi>to him
that overcometh</hi> is promised, <hi>to have the name of the New Ierusalem
writ upon him.</hi> These I take to be the same thing, and the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of Christian Victors, The <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> or the New Heavens
and New Earth, and the <hi>Paradise of God.</hi> Now this being the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Character of the New Earth, That it is <hi>Paradifiacals:</hi> and the
particular Character, That it <hi>hath no Sea:</hi> and both these agreeing
with our Hypothesis, as apparently deducible from those principles
and that manner of its formation which we have set down: We
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41970:181"/>
cannot but allow, that the Holy Scriptures and the Natural Theory
agree in their Testimony, as to the conditions and properties of the
<hi>New Heavens and New Earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From what hath been said in this and the precedent Chapter, it
will not be hard to interpret what S. <hi>Paul</hi> meant by his <hi>Habitable
Earth to come:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">T'<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> Isa. 9. 6.</note> which is to be subjected to our Saviour, and not to
the Angels. In the second chapter to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> ver. 5. he says,
<hi>For unto the Angels hath he not put in subjection the WORLD TO
COME:</hi> So we read it, but, according to the strictest and plainest
Translation, it should be <hi>The habitable Earth to come.</hi> Now what
Earth is this, where our Saviour is absolute Soveraign: and where
the Government is neither Humane, nor Angelical, but peculiarly
Theocratical? In the first place, this cannot be the present World
or the present Earth, because the Apostle calls it <hi>Future,</hi> or the <hi>Earth
to come.</hi> Nor can it be understood of the days of the Gospel: see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Apostle acknowledges, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. That this subjection, whereof
he speaks, is not yet made. And seeing Antichrist will not finally
be destroy'd till the appearance of our Saviour, <hi>(2 Thess. 2. 8.)</hi> nor
Satan bound, while Antichrist is in power: during the reign of
these two,<note place="margin">Ephes. 6. 12.</note> (who are the Rulers of the darkness of the World) our
Saviour cannot properly be said to begin his reign here. 'Tis true,
He exercises his Providence over his Church, and secures it from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
destroy'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He can, by a power paramount, stop the rage either
of Satan or Antichrist; <hi>Hitherto shall you go and no further.</hi> As some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
when he was upon Earth, he exerted a Divine Power, which
yet did not destroy his state of Humiliation; so he interposes now
when he thinks fit, but he does not finally take the power out of
the hands of his Enemies, nor out of the hands of the Kings of the
Earth. The <hi>Kingdom is not deliver'd up to him,</hi> and all <hi>dominion,
and power;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">ch. 7. 13. 25, 26.</note> That <hi>all Tongues and Nations should serve him.</hi> For S. <hi>Paul</hi>
can mean no less in this place than that Kingdom in <hi>Daniel:</hi> See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he calls it <hi>putting all things in subjection under his feet,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hebr. 2. 8.</note> and says
that it is not yet done. Upon this account also, as well as others, our
Saviour might truly say to <hi>Pilate (Ioh. 18: 36.) my kingdom is not of
this World.</hi> And to his Disciples, <hi>The Son of man came not to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
unto, but to minister, Matt.</hi> 20. 28. When he comes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
his Kingdom, he comes in the clouds of Heaven <hi>(Dan. 7. 13,
14.)</hi> not in the womb of a Virgin. He comes with the equipage of
a King and Conquer or; with thousands and ten thousands of Angels:
not in the form of a Servant, or of a weak Infant; as he did at his
first coming.</p>

                     <p>THUS we have setled the True Notion, according to Reason
and Scripture, of the <hi>New Heavens</hi> and <hi>New Earth.</hi> But
where are the Inhabitants, you'l say? You have taken the pains to
make us a New World, and now that it is made, it must stand
empty. When the first World was destroyed, there were Eight
Persons preserv'd, with a Set of Living Creatures of every Kind, as
a Seminary or foundation of another World: But the Fire, it
seems, is more merciless than the Water; for in this destruction of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41970:182"/>
the World, it does not appear that there is one living Soul left, of
any sort, upon the face of the Earth. No hopes of posterity, nor
of any continuation of Mankind, in the usual way of propagation.
And Fire is a barren Element, that breeds no living Creatures in it,
nor hath any nourishment proper for their food or sustenance.</p>
                     <p>We are perfectly at a loss, therefore, so far as I see, for a new
race of Mankind, or how to People this new-form'd World. The
Inhabitants, if ever there be any, must either come from Heaven,
or spring from the Earth: There are but these two ways. But <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Reason</hi> can determine neither of these: sees no tract to follow
in these unbeaten paths, nor can advance one step further. Farewel
then, dear Friend, I must take another Guide: and leave you here,
as <hi>Moses</hi> upon Mount <hi>Pisgah,</hi> only to look into that Land, which
you cannot enter. I acknowledge the good service you have
done, and what a faithful Companion you have been, in a long
journey; from the beginning of the World to this hour, in a tract
of time of six thousand years. We have travel'd together through
the dark regions of a First and Second <hi>Chaos:</hi> seen the World twice
shipwrackt. Neither Water, nor Fire, could separate us. But now
you must give place to other Guides.</p>
                     <p>Welcom, <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> The Oracles of God, a Light shining
in darkness, a Treasury of hidden Knowledge, and, where <hi>humane
faculties</hi> cannot reach, a seasonable help and supply to their defects.
We are now come to the utmost bounds of their dominion: They
have made us a New World, but, how it shall be inhabited, they
cannot tell: know nothing of the History or affairs of it. This
we must learn from other Masters, inspir'd with the knowledge of
things to come. And such Masters we know none, but the holy
Prophets and Apostles. We must therefore now put our selves whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
under their conduct and instruction, and from them only receive
our information concerning the moral state of the future habitable
Earth.</p>
                     <p>In the first place therefore,<note place="margin">Isa. 45. 18.</note> The Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> tells us, as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
to our further enquiries, <hi>The Lord God created the Heavens,
God himselfe that formed the Earth, He created it not in vain, he form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it to be inhabited.</hi> This is true, both of the present Earth and the
<hi>Future,</hi> and of every habitable World whatsoever. For to what
purpose is it made habitable, if not to be inhabited? That would
be, as if a man should manure, and plough, and every way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
his ground for seed, but never sow it. We do not build houses
that they should stand empty, but look out for Tenants as fast as we
can; as soon as they are made ready, and become Tenantable. But
if man could do things in vain and without use or design, yet God
and Nature never do any thing <hi>in vain;</hi> much less so great a work
as the making of a World. Which if it were in vain, would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
ten thousand vanities or useless preparations in it. <hi>We</hi> may
therefore in the first place, safely conclude, <hi>That the New Earth will
be inhabited.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>by whom will it be inhabited?</hi> This makes the second enquiry.
S. <hi>Peter</hi> answers this question for us, and with a particular applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to this very subject of the New Heavens and New Earth. They
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41970:183"/>
shall be inhabited, he says, by the <hi>Iust</hi> or the <hi>Righteous.</hi> His words,
which we cited before, are these. When he had describ'd the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration
of the World, he adds, But we <hi>expect New Heavens and
a New Earth, WHEREIN DWELLETH RIGHTEOUS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS.</hi>
By <hi>Righteousness</hi> here, it is generally agreed must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
Righteous Persons. For Righteousness cannot be without
Righteous Persons: It cannot hang upon Trees, or grow out of the
ground; 'Tis the endowment of reasonable Creatures. And these
Righteous Persons are eminently such, and therefore call'd Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
in the abstract, or purely Righteous without mixture of
Vice.</p>
                     <p>So we have found Inhabitants for the New Earth: Persons of an
high and noble Character. Like those describ'd by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> (1 Ep.
2. 9.) <hi>A chosen generation, a Royal Priesthood, an Holy Nation, a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
People.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Apoc 21. 27.</note> As if into that World, as into S. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s <hi>New Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
nothing impure or unrighteous was to be admitted. These
being then the happy and holy Inhabitants: The next enquiry is,
<hi>Whence do they come?</hi> From what off-spring, or from what Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal?
We noted before, that there was no remnant of Mankind
left at the Conflgration, as there was at the Deluge: nor any
hopes of a Restauration that way. Shall we then imagine that these
New Inhabitants are a Colony wafted over from some neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
World: as from the Moon, or Mercury, or some of the higher
Planets. You may imagine what you please, but that seems to me
not imaginary only but impracticable; And that the Inhabitants of
those Planets are Persons of so great accomplishments, is more than
I know: but I am sure they are not the Persons here understood.
For these must be such as inhabited this Earth before. WE look
for New Heavens and New Earth, says the Apostle: Surely to have
some share and interest in them; otherwise there would be no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in that expectation. And the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> said before, I
create New Heavens and a New Earth, and the former shall come
no more into remembrance: But be <hi>YOU glad and rejoyce for ever
in that which I create.</hi> The truth is, none can have so good preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
to this spot of ground we call the Earth, as the Sons of Men,
seeing they once possest it. And if it be restor'd again, 'tis their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
and inheritance. But 'tis not Mankind in general that must
possess this New World, but the <hi>Israel of God,</hi> according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Isaiah;</hi> or the <hi>Iust,</hi> according to S. <hi>Peter.</hi> And especially
those that have suffer'd for the sake of their Religion. For this is
that <hi>Palingenesia,</hi> as we noted before, that <hi>Renovation,</hi> or <hi>Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of all things, where our Saviour says, Those, that suffer loss for
his sake, shall be recompenced: <hi>Matt.</hi> 19. 28, 29.</p>
                     <p>But they must then be raised from the Dead. For all Mankind
was destroy'd at the Conflagration: and there is no resource for
them any other way,<note place="margin">Ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>c. 20.</note> than by a Resurrection. 'Tis true: and S. <hi>Iohn</hi>
gives us a fair occasion to make this supposition, <hi>That</hi> there will be
some raised from the Dead, before the General Day of Judgment.
For he plainly distinguisheth of a <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Second</hi> Resurrection, and
makes the First to be a Thousand Years before the Second, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the general Day of Judgment. Now, If there be truly and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41970:183"/>
really a two-fold Resurrection, as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us; and at a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Years distance from one another: It may be very rationally
presum'd, that, Those that are raised in the first Resurrection, are
those <hi>Iust</hi> that will inhabit the <hi>New Heavens and new Earth.</hi> Or whom
our Saviour promis'd to reward in the Renovation of the World.</p>
                     <p>For otherwise, who are those <hi>Iust</hi> that shall inhabit the <hi>New
Earth,</hi> and whence do they come? Or when is that Restauration
which our Saviour speaks of, wherein those that suffer'd for the
sake of the Gospel shall be rewarded? St. <hi>Iohn</hi> says, the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> at
this first Resurrection, shall live again and reign with Christ. Which
seems to be the reward promis'd by our Saviour, to those that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
for his sake: and the same Persons in both places. <hi>And I saw
the Souls of them,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Apoc. 20. 4.</note> says St. <hi>Iohn, that were beheaded for the witness of
Iesus, and for the Word of God: and which had not worshipped the
Beast,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and They lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.</hi>
These, I say, seem to be the same Persons to whom Christ had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
promis'd and appropriated a particular reward. And this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d
of theirs, or this Reign of theirs, is upon <hi>Earth:</hi> upon some
Earth, new or old: not in Heaven. For, besides that we read no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of their Ascension into Heaven after their Resurrection: There
are several marks that shew it must necessarily be understood of a
state upon Earth. For <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> came from the <hi>four quarters
of the Earth,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ver. 9.</note> and besieged the <hi>Camp of the Saints, and the beloved City.</hi>
That Camp and that City therefore were upon the Earth. And <hi>fire
came down from Heaven and devoured them.</hi> If it came down from
Heaven, it came upon the Earth. Furthermore, those Persons that
are rais'd from the Dead, are said to be <hi>Priests of God and of Christ,
and to reign with him a thousand years.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ver. 6.</note> Now these must be the same
Persons with the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Kings,</hi> mention'd in the Fifth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:<note place="margin">Ver. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.</note>
which are there said expresly <hi>to reign upon Earth,</hi> or that
they should <hi>reign upon Earth.</hi> It remains therefore only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,
<hi>What Earth</hi> this is, where the <hi>Sons of the first
Resurrection</hi>
will live and reign. It cannot be the present Earth,
in the same state, and under the same circumstances it is now. For
what happiness or priviledge would that be, to be call'd back into
a mortal life, under the necessities and inconveniences of sickly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and an incommodious World? such as the present state of
mortality is, and must continue to be, till some change be made in
Nature. We may be sure therefore, that a change will be made in
Nature before that time, and that the state they are rais'd into, and
the Earth they are to inhabit, will be, at least, <hi>Paradisiacal:</hi> And
consequently can be no other than the <hi>New Heavens</hi> and <hi>New Earth,</hi>
which we are to expect after the Conflagration.</p>
                     <p>From these Considerations, there is a great fairness to conclude,
both as to the Characters of the Perons, and of the place or state,
that <hi>the Sons of the first Resurrection,</hi> will be Inhabitants of the <hi>New
Earth,</hi> and reign there with Christ a thousand years. But seeing
this is one of the principal and peculiar Conclusions of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
and bears a great part in this last Book of the Theory of the
Earth, it will deserve a more full explication, and a more ample
proof, to make it out. We must therefore take a greater compass
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41970:184"/>
in our discourse, and give a full account of that State which is usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
call'd the <hi>Millennium:</hi> The Reign of the Saints a thousand years,
or the Kingdom of Christ upon Earth. But before we enter upon
this new Subject, give me leave to close our present Argument, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the <hi>Renovation of the World,</hi> with some Testimonies of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Philosophers, to that purpose. 'Tis plain to me, that there
were amongst the Ancients several Traditions, or traditionary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions,
which they did not raise themselves, by reason and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
but receiv'd them from an unknown Antiquity. An instance
of this is the <hi>Conflagration of the World:</hi> A Doctrine, as ancient, for
any thing I know, as the World it self. At least as ancient as we
have any Records. And yet none of those Ancients that tell us of
it, give any argument to prove it. Neither is it any wonder, for
they did not invent it themselves, but receiv'd it from others with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
proof, by the sole authority of Tradition. In like manner the
<hi>Renovation of the World,</hi> which we are now speaking of, is an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Doctrine: both amongst the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Eastern</hi> Philosophers:
But they shew us no method <hi>how</hi> the World may be <hi>renew'd,</hi> nor
make any proof of its future Renovation; For it was not a disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
which they first made, but receiv'd it, with an implicite faith,
from their Masters and Ancestors. And these Traditionary Doctrines
were all fore-runners of that Light that was to shine more clearly
at the opening of the Christian dispensation; to give a more full
account of the fate and revolutions of the Natural World, as well
as of the Moral.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Iews,</hi> 'tis well known, held the <hi>Renovation</hi> of the World, and
a <hi>Sabbath</hi> after six thousand years: according to the Prophecy that
was currant amongst them, whereof we have given a larger ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
in the precedent Book, <hi>ch.</hi> 5. And that future state they call'd
<hi>Olam Hava,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">.<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </note> or the <hi>World to come,</hi> which is the very same with St.
<hi>Paul'</hi>s <hi>Habitable Earth to come, Heb.</hi> 2. 6. Neither can I easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that those constitutions of <hi>Moses</hi> that proceed so much upon
a <hi>Septenary,</hi> or the number <hi>Seven,</hi> and have no ground or reason,
in the nature of the thing, for that particular number: I cannot ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
believe, I say, that they are either accidental or humoursome:
without design or signification. But that they are typical, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative
of some <hi>Septenary</hi> state, that does eminently deserve
and bear that Character. <hi>Moses,</hi> in the History of the Creation,
makes six days work, and then a Sabbath. Then, after six years,
he makes a <hi>Sabbath-year:</hi> and after a Sabbath of years a year of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee,
<hi>Levit.</hi> 25. All these lesser revolutions seem to me to point at
the grand Revolution, the great <hi>Sabbath</hi> or <hi>Iubilee,</hi> after six Millena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
which as it answers the type in point of time, so likewise in
the nature and contents of it: Being a state of Rest from all labour
and trouble and servitude: a state of joy and triumph: and a state
of <hi>Renovation,</hi> when things are to return to their first condition and
pristine order. So much for the <hi>Iews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Heathen Philosophers, both <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> had the
same doctrine of the <hi>Renovation</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> currant amongst them.
And that under several names and phrases; as of the <hi>Great Year,</hi>
the <hi>Restauration,</hi> the <hi>Mundane periods,</hi> and such like. They suppos'd
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41970:184"/>
stated and fix'd periods of time, upon expiration whereof there
would always follow some great, revolution of the World, and the
face of Nature would be renew'd. Particularly after the Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration,
the <hi>Stoicks</hi> always suppos'd a new World to succeed, or
another frame of Nature to be erected in the room of that which
was destroy'd. And they use the same words and phrases upon this
occasion that Scripture useth;<note place="margin">Lact. l. 7. c. 23.</note> 
                        <hi>Chrysippus</hi> calls it <hi>Apocatastalis,</hi> as St.
<hi>Peter</hi> does, <hi>Act. 3. 21. Marcus Antoninus</hi> in his <hi>Meditations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> several
times calls it <hi>Palingenesia,</hi> as our Saviour does, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 28. And
<hi>Numenius</hi> hath two Scripture-words,<note place="margin">Euseb. prap.</note> 
                        <hi>Resurrection</hi> and <hi>Restitution,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ev. l. 7. c. 23.</note> to
express this renovation of the World. Then as to the <hi>Platonicks,</hi>
that Revolution of all things, hath commonly been call'd the <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi>
year, as if <hi>Plato</hi> had been the first author of that opinion; But
that's a great mistake; he receiv'd it from the <hi>Barbarick</hi> Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
and particularly from the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Priests, amongst whom
he liv'd several years, to be instructed in their learning. But I do
not take <hi>Plato</hi> neither to be the first that brought this doctrine into
<hi>Greece:</hi> for, besides that the Sibylls, whose antiquity we do not
well know, sung this Song of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d, as we see it copyed from them
by <hi>Virgil</hi> in his fourth Eclogue; <hi>Pythagoras</hi> taught it before <hi>Plato:</hi>
and <hi>Orpheus</hi> before them both. And that's as high as the <hi>Greek</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
reaches.</p>
                     <p>The Barbarick Philosophers were more ancient: namely the
<hi>Aegyptians, Persians, Chaldeans, Indian Brackmans,</hi> and other Eastern
Nations. Their Monuments indeed are in a great measure lost, yet
from the remains of them which the <hi>Greeks</hi> have transcrib'd, and
so preserv'd, in their writings, we see plainly they all had this
doctrine of the <hi>Future Renovation.</hi> And to this day the posterity of
the <hi>Brackmans</hi> in the <hi>East Indies,</hi> retain the same notion, <hi>That</hi> the
World will be renewed after the last Fire. You may see the cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
if you please, for all these Nations, in the <hi>Latin</hi> Treatise,
<hi>Ch.</hi> 5. Which I thought would be too dry and tedious to be render'd
into <hi>English.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To these Testimonies of the Philosophers of all Ages, for the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Renovation of the World, we might add the Testimonies of
the Christian Fathers: <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> ancient and modern. I will
only give you a bare List of them, and refer you to the <hi>Latin</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise

                     <p>WE have given fair presumptions, if not proofs, in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Chapter, That the Sons of the first Resurrection will
be the persons that shall inhabit the <hi>New Earth,</hi> or the World to

told you it would be necessary to take a larger compass in our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
and to examine what is meant by <hi>That Reign with Christ a
thousand years,</hi> which is promis'd to the Sons of the <hi>First Resurrection;</hi>
by St. <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypse;</hi> and in other places of Scripture is
usually call'd the <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> and the reign of the Saints. And
by Ecclesiastical Authors, in imitation of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> it is commonly
styled the <hi>Millennium.</hi> We shall indifferently use any of these words
or phrases; and examine, First, the truth of the Notion and Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
whether in Scripture there be such an happy state promised to
the Saints, under the conduct of Christ. And then we will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to examine the nature, characters, place and time of it. And
I am in hopes when these things are duly discuss'd and stated, you
will be satisfied that we have found out the true Inhabitants of the
New Heavens and New Earth: and the true mystery of that state
which is call'd the <hi>Millennium,</hi> or the Reign of Christ and of his
Saints.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>We begin with S.</hi> Iohn; <hi>whose words, in the twentieth Chapter
of the</hi> Apocalypse, <hi>are express, both as to the first Resurrection, and
as to the reign of those Saints, that rise, with Christ, for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
years. Satan in the mean time being bound, or disabled from
doing mischief and seducing mankind. The words of the Prophet are
these,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ver. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6.</note> And I saw an Angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless

that old Serpent, which is the Devil and Satan; and bound him a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
years. And I saw Thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was
given unto them: and I saw the Souls of them that were beheaded for the
witness of Iesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped
the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their
fore-heads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a
thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand
years were finished. This is the first Resurrection. Blessed and holy is he
that hath part in the first Resurrection: on such the second death hath no
power, but they shall be priests of God, and of Christ, and shall reign with
him a thousand years. <hi>These words do fully express a Resurrection,
and a reign with Christ a thousand years. As for that particular
space of time, of a</hi> thousand years, <hi>it is not much material to our
present purpose: but the Resurrection here spoken of, and the reign
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:41970:185"/>
with Christ, make the substance of the controversie, and in effect
prove all that we enquire after at present. This Resurrection, you
see, is call'd the</hi> First Resurrection, <hi>by way of distinction from the
Second and general Resurrection; which is to be plac'd a thousand
years after the First. And both this First Resurrection and the Reign
of Christ, seem to be appropriated to the Martyrs in this place. For
the Prophet says,</hi> The Souls of those that were beheaded for the witness
of Iesus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. <hi>From
which words, if you please, we will raise this Doctrine: That,</hi> Those
that have suffered for the sake of Christ and a good Conscience, shall be
raised from the dead a thousand years before the general Resurrection,
and reign with Christ in an happy state. <hi>This Proposition seems to be
plainly included in the words of S.</hi> Iohn, <hi>and to be the intended
sence of this Vision; but you must have patience a little as to your
enquiry into particulars, till, in the progress of our discourse, we
have brought all the parts of this conclusion into a fuller light.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the mean time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is but one way, that I know of, to
evade the force of these words, and of the conclusion drawn from
them; and that is by supposing that the <hi>First Resurrection</hi> here
mentioned, is not to be understood in a literal sense, but is Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
and mystical; signifying only a Resurrection from sin to a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Life. As we are said to be <hi>dead in sin,</hi> and to be <hi>risen with
Christ,</hi> by Faith and Regeneration. This is a manner of Speech
which S. <hi>Paul</hi> does sometimes use: as <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 6. and 5. 14. and
<hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1. But how can this be applyed to the present case? Were
the Martyrs dead in sin? 'Tis they that are here rais'd from the
dead. Or, after they were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
dead and laid in their graves, were they then regenerate by
Faith? There is no congruitiy in allegories so applyed. Besides,
Why should they be said to be regenerate a thousand years before
the day of Judgment: Or, to reign with Christ, after this Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Resurrection, such a limited time, a Thousand Years? Why not
to Eternity? For in this allegorical sence of <hi>rising</hi> and <hi>reigning,</hi> they
will reign with him for everlasting. Then, after a Thousand Years
must all the wicked be regenerate, and rise into a Spiritual Life?
'Tis said here, <hi>The rest of the Dead lived not again,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">ver. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>until the thousand
years were finished.</hi> That implyes, that at the end of these thousand
years, the rest of the dead did live again; which, according to the
Allegory must be, that, after a thousand years, all the wicked will
be regenerate, and rais'd into a Spiritual Life. These absurdities
arise upon an allegorical exposition of this Resurrection, if apply'd
to single Persons.</p>
                     <p>But Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> a Learned and worthy Divine, (but one that
loves to contract and cramp the sence of Prophecies) making this
First Resurrection allegorical, applies it not to single Persons, but to
the state of the Church in general; The Christian Church, he
says, shall have a Resurrection for a thousand years: that is, shall
rise out of Persecution, be in a prosperous condition, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disturb'd
profession of the true Religion, for so long a time. But
this agrees with the Prophecy as little as the former; If it be a state
of the Church in general, and of the Church then in being, why
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41970:186"/>
is this Resurrection apply'd to the Martyrs? Why are they said to
rise? seeing the state they liv'd in, was a troublesome state of the
Church, and it would be no happiness to have that reviv'd again.
Then as to the Time of this Resurrection of the Church, where will
you fix it? The Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> places this Reign of Christ, at, or
after the dissolution of the fourth Monarchy and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> places
it a thousand years before the last Day of Judgment: How will
you adjust the Allegorical Resurrection of the Church to these limits?
Or if, in point of time, you was free, as to Prophecy; yet how
would you adjust it to History? Where will you take these thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
years of happiness and prosperity to the Church? These Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
suppose them past, and therefore must begin them either from
the first times of the Gospel, or from the time of <hi>Constantine.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the first Ages of the Gospel, were, you know, the great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions
by the <hi>Heathen</hi> Emperours: Could those be call'd the
Reign of Christ and of His Saints? Was Sathan then bound? or
was this Epocl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>a but a thousand years before the Day of Judgment?
And if you begin this Resurrection of the Church from the days
of <hi>Constantine,</hi> when the Empire became Christian, how will you
reckon a thousand years from that time, for the continuance of the
Church in <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>purity?</hi> for the reign of Christ and of his
Saints must necessarily imply both those Characters. Besides, who
are the <hi>rest of the Dead,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">ver. 5.</note> that liv'd after the expiration of those
thousand years, if they begun at <hi>Constantine?</hi> And why is not the
Second Resurrection and the Day of Judgment yet come? Lastly,
You ought to be tender of interpreting the First Resurrection in an
Allegorical sence, left you expose the second Resurrection to be made
an allegory also.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, The words of the Text are plain and express for
a literal Resurrection, as to the First, as well as the Second; and
there is no Allegorical interpretation that I know of, that will hold
through all the particulars of the Text, consistently with it self and
with History. And when we shall have prov'd this future King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Christ from other places of the Apocalypse, and of Holy
Writ, you will the more easily admit the literal sence of this place:
Which, you know, according to the receiv'd rule of Interpreters,
is never to be quitted or forsaken, without necessity. But when I
speak of confirming this Doctrine from other passages of Scripture,
I do not mean as to that definite time of a <hi>thousand years,</hi> for that
is no where else mention'd in the Apocalypse or in Scripture, that
I know of; and seems to be mention'd here, in this close of all
things, to mind us of that type that was propos'd in the beginning
of all things, <hi>Of Six days and a Sabbath.</hi> Whereof each Day Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
a thousand years, and the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> which is the <hi>Millennial
state,</hi> hath its thousand. According to the known Prophecy of
<hi>Elias,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Book 3. ch. 5.</note> which, as I told you before, was not only receiv'd amongst
the <hi>Iews,</hi> but also own'd by very many of the Christian Fathers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To proceed therefore to other parts of S.</hi> Iohn' <hi>s Prophecies, that
set forth this Kingdom of Christ. The Vision of the</hi> Seven Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
<hi>is one of the most remarkable in the Apocalypse; and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Trumpet, which plainly reaches to the end of the World,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41970:186"/>
and the Resurrection of the Dead, opens the Scene to the</hi> Millenni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.<note place="margin">Ch. 11. 15, 16, 17, 18.</note>
                        <hi>Hear the sound of it.</hi> The seventh Angel sounded, and there were great
voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of our Lord, and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ver. And the four and twenty Elders, which sat before God on their
Seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God: Saying, We give thee
thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come;
because thou hast taken to thee thy great power and hast reigned. And the
Nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the Dead,
that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy
servants the Prophets, and to the Saints, and them that fear thy Name,
small and great, and shouldest destroy them that destroy the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.
This is manifestly the Kingdom of Christ: and with this is joyn'd
the Resurrection of the Dead, and the rewarding of the suffering
Prophets and Saints; as in the</hi> 20th. Chapter. <hi>This is that</hi> mystery
of God that was to be finish'd in the days of the voice of the seventh
Angel: <hi>as is said in the</hi> 20th. <hi>Chap. ver.</hi> 7. As he hath declared to his
servants the Prophets. <hi>Namely, the mystery of this Kingdom, which
was foretold by the Prophets of the Old Testament: and more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
by</hi> Daniel, <hi>as we shall see hereafter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> (as it is set down, <hi>Apoc. 21. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.)</hi>
is another instance or image of this Kingdom of Christ. And the <hi>Palm-bearing
Company,</hi> Chap. 7. 9, &amp;c. are some of the Martyrs that shall
enjoy it. They are plainly describ'd there as Christian Martyrs;
<hi>(ver. 14.)</hi> And their reward, or the state of happiness they are to
enjoy, <hi>(ver. 15, 16, 17.)</hi> is the same with that of the Inhabitants of
the <hi>New Ierusalem:</hi> Ch. 21. 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. as, upon comparing those
two places, will easily appear. Furthermore, at the opening of the
<hi>Seals, Chap.</hi> 5. which is another principal Vision, and reaches to the
end of the World, there is a prospect given us of this Kingdom of
Christ, and of that reward of his Saints. For when they sing the
new Song to the Lamb, <hi>(ver. 9, 10.)</hi> they say, <hi>Thou art worthy to
take the Book, and to open the Seals thereof: For thou wast slain and hast
redeemed us to God, by thy bloud. And hast made us unto our God Kings
and Priests: and we shall reign on the Earth.</hi> This must be the same
state, and the same thousand-years-reign mention'd in the <hi>20th.</hi>
Chapter. Where 'tis said, <hi>(ver. 6.)</hi> the partakers of it <hi>shall be Priests
of God, and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another completory Vision, that extends it self to the end of the
World, is that of the <hi>seven Vials, Ch. 15, &amp;</hi> 16. And as at the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Seals, so at the pouring out of the Vials, a triumphal
Song is sung,<note place="margin">ch. 15. 3.</note> and 'tis call'd the <hi>Song of Moses and of the Lamb.</hi> 'Tis
plainly a Song of Thanksgiving for a Deliverance: but I do not look
upon this deliverance as already wrought, before the pouring out of
the Vials, though it be plac'd before them: as often the grand design
and issue of a Vision is plac'd at the beginning. It is wrought by the
Vials themselves, and by their effusion, and therefore upon the
pouring out of the last Vial. The Voice came out of the Temple of
Heaven,<note place="margin">ch. 16. 17.</note> from the Throne, saying, <hi>Consummatum est: It is done.</hi> Now
the Deliverance is wrought, now the work is at an end: or, <hi>The my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of God is finish'd,</hi> as the phrase was before, concerning the <hi>7th.</hi>
                        <pb n="108" facs="tcp:41970:187"/>
Trumpet: <hi>Ch.</hi> 10. 7. You see therefore this terminates upon the
same time, and consequently upon the same state, of the <hi>Millennium.</hi>
And that they are the same Persons that triumph here, and reign
there, <hi>Ch.</hi> 20. You may see by the same Characters given to both
of them.<note place="margin">ch. 15. 2.</note> Here, those that triumph, are said <hi>to have gotten the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory</hi>
over the Beast, and over his Image, <hi>and over his mark, and over
the number of his name.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">ch. 20. 4.</note> And there, Those that reign with Christ,
are said to be those <hi>that had not worshipped the Beast, neither his image,
neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands.</hi>
These are the same Persons therefore, triumphing over the same
Enemies, and enjoying the same reward.</p>
                     <p>And you shall seldom find any <hi>Doxology</hi> or <hi>Hallelujah</hi> in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypse,
but 'tis in prospect of the Kingdom of Christ, and the <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennial</hi>
state. That is still the burthen of the Sacred Song: The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
of every grand Vision, and the life and strength of the
whole Systeme of Prophecies in that Book. Even those <hi>Halleluja's</hi>
that are sung at the destruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">ch. 19. 6, 7.</note> in the <hi>19th.</hi> Chapter, are
rais'd upon the view of the succeeding state, <hi>the Reign of Christ.</hi> For
the Text says, <hi>And I heard as it were a voice of a great multitude, and
as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunders, saying,
Hallelujah. FOR THE LORD GOD OMNIPOTENT REIGNETH.
Let us be glad and rejoyce and give honour to him: FOR THE
MARRIAGE OF THE LAMB IS COME, AND HIS WIFE
HATH MADE HER SELF READY.</hi> This appears plainly to be
the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> if you consult the <hi>21th. ch. ver. 2. And I Iohn saw
the Holy City, New Ierusalem, coming down from God out of Heaven,
PREPARED AS A BRIDE ADORNED FOR HER HUSBAND.</hi>
'Tis, no doubt, the same Bride and Bridegroom, in both places;
the same marriage or preparations for marriage; which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated
in the Millennial bliss, in the Kingdom of Christ and of his
Saints.</p>
                     <p>I must still beg your patience a little longer, in pursuing this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
throughout the Apocalypse. As towards the latter end of
S. <hi>Iohn'</hi>s Revelation this Kingdom of Christ shines out in a more
full glory, so there are the dawnings of it in the very beginning and
entrance into his Prophecies. As at the beginning of a Poem, we
have commonly in a few words the design of the Work, in like
manner S. <hi>Iohn</hi> makes this Preface to his Prophecies,<note place="margin">ch. 1. 5, 6.</note> 
                        <hi>From Iesus
Christ, who is the faithful witness, the first begotten of the dead, and
the Prince of the Kings of the Earth: unto him that loved us, and wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us from our sins in his own bloud: And hath made us Kings and
Priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever
and ever, Amen. Behold, he cometh in the clouds,</hi> &amp;c. In this Prologue
the grand argument is pointed at, and that happy Catastrophe and
last Scene which is to crown the Work: The Reign of Christ and of
his Saints at his second coming. He hath <hi>made us Kings and Priests
unto God:</hi> This is always the Characteristick of those that are to
enjoy the Millennial Happiness, as you may see at the opening of
the Seals, <hi>ch.</hi> 5. 10. and in the Sons of the <hi>First Resurrection, ch.</hi> 20. 6.
And this being joyned to the coming of our Saviour, puts it
still more out of doubt. That expression also, of being <hi>washt
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41970:187"/>
from our sins in his bloud,</hi> is repeated again both at the opening of the
Seals, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 9. and in the <hi>Palm-bearing</hi> Company, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 14.
both which places we have cited before as referring to the Millenni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
State.</p>
                     <p>Give me leave to add further, that as in this general Preface, so
also in the Introductory visions of the <hi>Seven Churches,</hi> there are, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertly
or expresly, in the conclusion of each, glances upon the <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennium.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ch. 2. 7.</note>
As in the first to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> the Prophet concludes, <hi>He that
hath an ear, let him hear, what the Spirit says to the Churches: TO
HIM THAT OVERCOMETH WILL I GIVE TO FAT OF THE
TREE OF LIFE, WHICH IS IN THE MIDST OF THE PARA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DISE
OF GOD.</hi> This is the Millennial happiness which is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to the Conquerour; as we noted before concerning that phrase.
In like manner in the second to <hi>Smyrna,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ch. 2. 11.</note> He concludes: <hi>He that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh,
shall not be hurt of the second death.</hi> This implyes, he shall be
partaker of the <hi>first Resurrection,</hi> for that's the thing understood;
as you may see plainly by their being joyn'd in the <hi>20th. Ch. ver. 6.
Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first Resurrection: on such the
second death hath no power: but they shall be Priests of God and of Christ,
and shall reign with him a thousand years.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ch. 2. 17.</note> In the <hi>3d</hi> to <hi>Pergamus,</hi> the
Promise is, <hi>to eat of the hidden Manna, to have a white stone, and a
new name written in it.</hi> But seeing the Prophet adds, <hi>which no man
knoweth saving he that receiveth it,</hi> we will not presume to interpret
that new state,<note place="margin">Ch. 2. 26, 27.</note> whatsoever it is. In <hi>Thyatira,</hi> the reward is, <hi>To
have power over the Nations,</hi> and to have the <hi>Morning Star.</hi> Which
is to reign with Christ, who is the Morning Star, in his Millennial
Empire: both these phrases being us'd in that sence in the close of
this Book.<note place="margin">Ch. 3. 5.</note> In <hi>Sardis</hi> the promise is, <hi>To be clothed in white raiment, and
not to be blotted out of the Book of Life.</hi> And you see afterwards the
<hi>Palm-bearing</hi> Company are clothed in <hi>white robes;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ch. 7. 9, 14.</note> and those that are
admitted into the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ch. 3. 12.</note> are such as are <hi>written in the
Lamb's book of life, Ch.</hi> 21. 27. Then as to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> the reward
promised there does openly mark the Millennial state, by the <hi>City of
God, New Ierusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from God:</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
with <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. 2. Lastly,<note place="margin">Ch. 3. 21.</note> to the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> is said,
<hi>To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my Throne.</hi> And
that is the usual phrase to express the dignity of those that reign
with Christ, in his Millennial Kingdom: as you may see, <hi>Apoc. 20. 4.
Mat. 19. 28. Dan.</hi> 7. 9, 13, 14. So all these promises to the Churches
aim at one and the same thing, and terminate upon the same point;
'Tis the same reward express'd in different ways; and seeing 'tis still
fixt upon a victory, and appropriated to those that overcome, it
does the more easily carry our thoughts to the <hi>Millennium,</hi> which is
the proper reward of Victors, that is, of Martyrs and Confessors.</p>
                     <p>Thus you see how this notion and mystery of the Millennial King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Christ, does both begin and end the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> and run
thorough all its parts: As the Soul of that Body of Prophecies: A
Spirit or ferment that actuates the whole mass. And if we could
thoroughly understand that illustrious Scene at the opening of this
Apocalyptical Theatre in the <hi>4th.</hi> and <hi>5th. Chap.</hi> I do not doubt but
we should find it a Representation of the Majesty of our Saviour in
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41970:188"/>
the Glory of his future Kingdom. But I dare not venture upon the
explication of it, there are so many things of difficult and dubious
interpretation, coucht under those Schemes. Wherefore having
made these observations upon the Prophecies of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> we will
now add to them some reflections upon the Prophecies of <hi>Daniel.</hi> That
by the agreement and concurrence of these two great Witnesses, the
Conclusion we pretend to prove, may be fully established.</p>
                     <p>In the Prophecies of <hi>Daniel</hi> there are two grand Visions, that of
the <hi>Statue</hi> or Image, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. and that of the four Beats, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.
And both these Visions terminate upon the <hi>Millennium,</hi> or the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Christ. In the Vision of the Statue, representing to us the
four great Monarchies of the World successively, (whereof, by the
general consent of Interpreters, The <hi>Roman</hi> is the fourth and last)
after the dissolution of the last of them, a fifth Monarchy, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Christ, is openly introduc'd, in these words: <hi>And in the
days of these kingdoms,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ch. 2. v. 44.</note> 
                        <hi>shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which
shall never be destroy'd, and the kingdom shall be left to other people,
but it shall break in pieces, and consume all those kingdoms, and it shall stand
for ever.</hi> This may be verified, in some measure, by the first coming
of our Saviour in the days of the <hi>4th.</hi> Kingdom; when his Religion
from small beginnings, in a short time overspread the greatest part
of the known World.<note place="margin">Ver. 34, 35.</note> As the <hi>stone cut out without hands,</hi> became a
great <hi>mountain and filled the whole Earth.</hi> But the full and final accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of this Prophecy cannot be till the second coming of our
Saviour. For not till then, will he <hi>break in pieces and consume all those
kingdoms;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ver. 35.</note> 
                        <hi>and that in such a manner, that they shall become like the
chaff of the Summer threshing floor, carried away by the wind: so as no
place shall be found for them.</hi> This, I say, will not be done, nor an
everlasting Kingdom erected in their place, over all the Nations of
the Earth, till his Second Coming, and his Millennial Reign.</p>
                     <p>But this Reign is declared more expresly, in the Vision of the
four Beasts, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. For after the destruction of the fourth Beast,
the Prophet says,<note place="margin">Ch. 7. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>I saw in the night, Visions, and behold one like the Son
of man, came with the clouds of heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and came to the Ancient of days,
and they brought him near before him: And there was given him dominion,
and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages should
serve him: His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass
away: and his kingdom that which shall not be destroy'd.</hi> Accordingly he
says, ver. 21, 22. <hi>The last Beast and the little Horn made war against the
Saints, until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the
Saints of the most High; and the time came that the Saints possessed the
kingdom.</hi> And lastly, in pursuit still of the same argument, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes

brings in this kingdom of Christ, in the conclusion of two or three
Visions; but St. <hi>Iohn</hi> hath interwoven it every where with his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies,
from first to last. And you may as well open a Lock with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Key, as interpret the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> without the <hi>Millennium.</hi> But
after these two great Witnesses, the one for the Old Testament, the
other for the New, we must look into the rest of the Sacred Writers;
for tho' every single Author there, is an Oracle, yet the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of Oracles is still a further demonstration, and takes away all
remains of doubt or incredulity.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. V. A View of other places of Scripture concerning the Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium
or future Kingdom of Christ. In what sence all the
Prophets have born Testimony concerning it.</head>
                     <p>THE Wife of <hi>Zebedee</hi> came to our Saviour,<note place="margin">Mat. 20. 21.</note> and begg'd of him,
like a fond Mother, that her two Sons might sit, one at his
right hand, th'other at his left, when he came into his Kingdom.
Our Saviour does not deny the supposition, or general ground of
her request, that <hi>he was to have a Kingdom;</hi> but tells her, The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of that Kingdom were not then in his disposal. He had not
drunk his Cup, nor been baptiz'd with his last Baptism: which were
conditions, both to him and others, of entring into that Kingdom.
Yet,<note place="margin">Mat. 19. 28.</note> in another place, our Saviour is so well assur'd of his interest
and authority there, by the good will of his Father, that he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to his Disciples and followers, that for the losses they should su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
here, upon his account, and for the sake of his Gospel, they
should receive there an hundred fold; and sit upon Thrones with
him, judging the Tribes of <hi>Israel.</hi> The words are these: <hi>And Iesus
said unto them, verily I say unto you, that ye which have followed me,</hi> in
the Regeneration or Renovation, <hi>when the Son of man shall sit in the
Throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve Thrones, judging the twelve
tribes of Israel.</hi> These Thrones, in all reason, must be understood
to be the same with those which we mention'd in the foregoing
Chapter,<note place="margin">Dan. 7. 9.</note> out of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Apocalypse:</hi> and therefore mark the
same time and the same state.<note place="margin">Apoc. 20. 4.</note> And seeing, in those places, they
plainly signified the <hi>Millennial</hi> state, or the Kingdom of Christ and
of his Saints, they must here signifie the same, in this promise of our
Saviour to his suffering Followers. And as to the word <hi>Palingenesia,</hi>
which is here translated <hi>Regeneration,</hi> 'tis very well known, that,
both the <hi>Greek</hi> Philosophers, and <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers, use that very word
for the <hi>Renovation of the World.</hi> Which is to be, as we shall hereafter
make appear, at or before the <hi>Millennial</hi> state.</p>
                     <p>Our Saviour also, in his Divine Sermon upon the Mount, makes
this one of his <hi>Beatitudes, Blessed are the Meek, for they shall inherit
the Earth.</hi> But <hi>how,</hi> I pray, or <hi>where,</hi> or <hi>when,</hi> do the Meek inherit
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41970:189"/>
the Earth? neither at present, I am sure, nor in any past Ages. 'Tis
the Great Ones of the World, ambitious Princes and Tyrants, that
slice the Barth amongst them: and those that can flatter them best,
or serve them in their interests or pleasures, have the next best shares.
But a meek, modest, and humble Spirit, is the most unqualified
Person that can be for a Court, or a Camp: to scramble for Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or Plund<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as things of no use, and proceeding from meanness and
poorness of Spirit. <hi>David,</hi> who was a Person of an admirable devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but of an unequal Spirit; subject to great dejections, as well
as elevations of mind; was so much affected with the prosperity of
the wicked in this World, that he could scarce forbear charging
Providence with injustice. You may see several touches of a repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Spirit in his Psalms: and in the Seventy-third <hi>Psalm,</hi> compos'd
upon that Subject, you have both the wound and the cure. Now
this Bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>de pronounc'd here by our Saviour, was spoken before
by <hi>David, psal.</hi> 37. 11. The same <hi>David</hi> that was always so sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the hard usage of the Just in this life. Our Saviour also, and
his Apostles, preach the Doctrine of the Cross every where, and
foretell the sufferings that shall attend the Righteous, in this World.
Therefore neither <hi>David,</hi> nor our Saviour, could understand this
<hi>inheritance of the Earth,</hi> otherwise than of some future state, or of
a state yet to come. But as it must be a future state, so it must be a
Terrestrial state; for it could not be call'd the <hi>inheritance of the Earth,</hi>
if it was not so. And 'tis to be a state of <hi>peace,</hi> as well as <hi>plenty,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the words of the <hi>Psalmist, But the meek shall inherit the Earth,
and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.</hi> It follows there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
from these premisses, that, both our Saviour, and <hi>David,</hi> must
understand some future state of the Earth, wherein the <hi>Meek</hi> will
enjoy both peace and plenty. And this will appear to be the future
Kingdom of Christ, when, upon a fuller description, we shall have
given you the marks and characters of it.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, why should we not suppose, this Earth, which
the Meek are to inherit, to be that <hi>habitable Earth to come,</hi> which
St. <hi>Paul</hi> mentions <hi>(Hebr. 2. 6.)</hi> and represents as subject to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
in a pecuilar manner: at his disposal and under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as his Kingdom: Why should not that Earth be the subject
of this Beatitude: The promis'd Land, the Lot of the Righ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eous?
This I am sure of, that both this Text and the former deserve our
serious thoughts; and tho' they do not expresly, and in terms, prove
the future Kingdom of our Saviour, yet upon the fairest interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
they imply such a state. And it will be very uneasie to give a
satisfactory account, either of the <hi>Regeneration</hi> or <hi>Renovation,</hi> when
our Saviour and his Disciples shall sit upon Thrones: Or of that
<hi>Earth</hi> which the <hi>Meek shall inherit:</hi> Or lastly, of that <hi>Habitable World,</hi>
which is peculiarly subject to the dominion of Jesus Christ, without
supposing, on this side Heaven, some other reign of Christ and his
Saints, than what we see, or what they enjoy, at present.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed in this argument. It will be necessary, as I told
you, to set down some notes and characters of this Reign of Christ
and of his Saints, whereby it may be distinguish'd from the present
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41970:189"/>
state, and present Kingdoms of the World. And these characters are
chiefly three, <hi>Iustice, Peace,</hi> and <hi>Divine Presence</hi> or Conduct, which
uses to be called <hi>Theocrasie.</hi> By these characters it is sufficiently distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd
from the Kingdoms of this World; which are generally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
in their titles or exercise: stain'd with bloud: and so far from
being under a particular Divine Conduct, that humane passions and
humane vices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are the Springs that commonly give motion to their
greatest designs. But more particularly and restrainedly, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Christ, is opposed to the Kingdom and Government of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,
whose characters are diametrically opposite to these, being
<hi>Injustice, cruelty,</hi> and <hi>humane or diabolical artifices.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon this short view of the Kingdom of Christ, let us make en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
after it amongst the Prophets of the Old Testament. And we
shall find, upon examination, that there is scarce any of them,
greater or lesser, but take notice of this mystical kingdom; either
expresly, or under the types of <hi>Israel, Sion, Ierusalem,</hi> and such like.
And therefore I am apt to think, that, when S. <hi>Peter</hi> in his Sermon
to the <hi>Iews, Act.</hi> 3. says, All the holy Prophets spoke of <hi>The Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of all things,</hi> he does not mean the Renovation of the World
separately from the Kingdome of Christ, but complexly, as it may
imply both. For there are not many of the old Prophets that have
spoken of the Renovation of the <hi>Natural</hi> World; but a great many
have spoken of the Renovation of the <hi>Moral,</hi> in the Kingdom of
Christ. These are S. <hi>Peter'</hi>s words: <hi>Act. 3. 19, 20, 21. Repent ye
therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the
times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord. And he
shall send Iesus Christ which before was preached unto ye: whom the
heavens must receive until the times of RESTITUTION OF ALL
THINGS.</hi> The Apostle here mentions three things, The <hi>Times of
refreshing,</hi> The <hi>Second Coming</hi> of our Saviour, And the <hi>Times of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of all things.</hi> And to the last of these he immediately sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns,
<hi>which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy Prophets, since
the world began.</hi> This <hi>Restitution of all things,</hi> I say, must not be
understood abstractly from the reign of Christ, but as in conjunction
with it; and in that sence, and no other, it is the general subject of
the Prophets.</p>
                     <p>To enter therefore into the Schools of the Prophets, and enquire
their sence concerning this Mystery, let us first address our selves to
the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> and the Royal Prophet <hi>David;</hi> who seem to have
had many noble thoughts, or inspirations, upon this subject. <hi>Isaiah</hi>
in the <hi>65th chap.</hi> from the <hi>17th ver.</hi> to the end, treats upon this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument:
and joyns together the Renovation of the Natural and
Moral World; as S. <hi>Peter,</hi> in the place forementioned, seems to do.
And accordingly the Prophet, having set down several natural cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of that State, as indolency and joy, longevity, ease, and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
from <hi>ver.</hi> 18. to the <hi>24th.</hi> He there begins the moral characters,
of divine favour, and such a particular protection, that they are
heard and answer'd before they pray. And lastly, He represents it
as a state of universal peace and innocency, <hi>ver. 23. The Wolf and
the Lamb shall feed together,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:41970:190"/>
                        <hi>This last character, which comprehends</hi> Peace, Iustice, <hi>and</hi> Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
<hi>is more fully display'd by the same Prophet, in the</hi> 11th.
chap. <hi>where he treats also of the Kingdom of Christ. Give me leave
to set down his words,</hi> ver. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. But with Righteousness
shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the Earth:
and he shall smite the Earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the
breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked. And righteousness shall be the
girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins. The Wolf also
shall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard shall lye down with the Kid:
and the Calf and the young Lyon, and the fatling together, and a little
child shall lead them. And the Cow and the Bear shall feed, their young
ones shall lye down together: and the Lyon shall eat straw like the Ox.
And the suckling ohbild shall play on the hole of the Asp, and the weaned
child shall put his hand on the Cockatrice-den. They shall not hurt, nor
destroy in all my holy mountain: for the Earth shall be full of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Lord, as the waters cover the Sea. <hi>Thus far the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet:
Now if we joyn this to what we noted before, from his</hi>
65th. chap. <hi>concerning the same state, 'twill be impossible to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it of any order of things, that is now, or hath been hitherto
in the World. And consequently it must be the Idea of some state
to come, and particularly of that which we call the Future King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The same pacifick temper, Innocency and Justice, are celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by this Prophet when the <hi>Mountain of the Lord shall be established
in the top of the mountains,</hi> chap. 2. 2, 4. <hi>And he shall judge amongst the
nations, and shall rebuke many people; and they shall heat their swords
into plow-shares, and their spears into pruning-hooks. Nation shall not
lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</hi> And
as to righteousness, he says in the 23. chap. <hi>Behold a King shall reign
in righteousness, and Princes shall rule in judgment,</hi> &amp;c. These places,
I know, usually are applyed to the first coming of our Saviour;
the peaceableness of his doctrine, and the propagation of it through
all the World. I willingly allow this to be a true sence, so far as
it will go. But 'tis one thing to be a true sence, to such a degree;
and another thing to be the final sence and accomplishment of a
Prophecy. The affairs of the first and second coming of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
are often mingled together in the Prophecies of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but in that mixture there are some characters whereby you
may distinguish what belongs to his first, and what to his second
coming; what to the time when he came to suffer, and what to
the time when he shall come to reign. For instance, In these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
recited, though there are many things very applicable to his
first coming, yet that <hi>Regality</hi> which is often spoken of, and that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Peace and Innocency that will accompany it, cannot be veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
of his coming in the flesh. Seeing it is plain, that in his state
of humiliation he did not come as a King, to rule over the Nations
of the Earth.<note place="margin">Mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>. 20. 21.</note> And he says himself expresly, <hi>That his Kingdom is not
of this World,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 23. 42.</note> 
                        <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. 36. And the Prayer of <hi>Salome,</hi> and of the good
Thief upon the Cross, suppose it not then present, but to come.
Then as to the establishment of <hi>Peace</hi> in his Kingdom, it does not at
all appear to me that there is more Peace in the World now than
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41970:190"/>
there was before our Saviour came into it; or that the Christian
parts of the World are more peaceable than the unchristian. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
these great promises of a <hi>Pacifick Kingdom,</hi> which are exprest
in terms as high and emphatical as can be imagin'd, must belong to
some other days, and some other ages, than what we have seen hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto.</p>
                     <p>You'l say, it may be, 'tis not the fault of the Gospel that the World
is not peaceable, but of those that profess it, and do not practise it.
This is true, but it does not answer the Prophecy; for that makes
no such exception. And by such a reserve as this, you may elude
any Prophecy. So the <hi>Iews</hi> say, Their <hi>Messiah</hi> defers his coming
beyond the time appointed by Prophecy, because of their sins: but
we do not allow this for a good reason. The <hi>Israelites</hi> had their
promised <hi>Canaan,</hi> tho' they had render'd themselves unworthy of
it; and by this method of interpreting Prophecies, all the happiness
and glory promised in the Millennial Kingdom of Christ may come
to nothing, upon a pretended forfeiture. Threatnings indeed may
have a tacit condition; God may be better than his word, and, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
repentance, divert his judgments; but he cannot be worse than
his word, or fail of performance, when, without any condition ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest,
he promises or prophesies good things to come. This would
destroy all assurance of Hope or Faith. Lastly, This Prophecy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Pacifick times or a <hi>Pacifick Kingdom,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Isa. 65.</note> is in the <hi>65th. chap.</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd
to the <hi>Renovation of the Heavens and the Earth,</hi> and several
marks of a change in the Natural World; which things we know did
not come to pass at the first coming of our Saviour: there was no
change of Nature then, nor has been ever since. And therefore this
happy change, both in the Natural and Moral World, is yet to
come.</p>
                     <p>But, as we said before, we do not speak this exclusively of the
first coming of our Saviour, as to other parts of these Prophecies; for no
doubt that was one great design of them. And in the Prophecies
of the Old Testament, there are often three gradations, or gradual
accomplishments; The first, in some King of <hi>Israel,</hi> or some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or affair relating to <hi>Israel,</hi> as National only. The second, in
the Messiah at his first coming. And the last, in the Messiah, and
his Kingdom at his second coming. And that which we affirm and
contend for, is, that the Prophecies foremention'd have not a final
and total accomplishment, either in the Nation of the <hi>Iews,</hi> or at
the first coming of our Saviour. And this we bide by.</p>
                     <p>The next Prophet that we mention'd as a witness of the future
Kingdom of Christ, is <hi>David.</hi> Who, in his Psalms, seems to be
pleas'd with this subject above all others; And when he is most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
in his thoughts and Prophetical raptures, the Spirit carries him
into the Kingdom of the Messiah, to contemplate its glory, to sing
praises to its King, and triumph over his Enemies: <hi>Psal. 68. Let God
arise, let his enemies be scattered: Let them also that hate him flie before
him. As Smoke is driven away, so drive them away; as wax melteth
before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God. But let
the Righteous be glad, &amp;c.</hi> The plain ground he goes upon in this
Psalm, is the Deliverance out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and bringing the <hi>Israelites</hi>
                        <pb n="116" facs="tcp:41970:191"/>
unto the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ver. 18.</note> But when he is once upon the wing, he
soars to an higher pitch: from the type to the Antitype: To the
days of the Messiah,<note place="margin">Ver. 32, &amp;c.</note> the Ascension of our Saviour; and, at length,
to his Kingdom and Dominion over all the Earth. The <hi>45th.</hi> Psalm
is an <hi>Epithalamium</hi> to Christ and the Church, or to the <hi>Lamb</hi>
and his <hi>Spouse.</hi> And when that will be, and in what state, we may
learn from S. <hi>Iohn, Apoc.</hi> 19. 7, 8. and <hi>ch.</hi> 21. 2, 9. Namely, after the
destruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> in the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> glory. The words and
matter of the two Prophets answer to one another; Here, in this
Psalm, there is a Fight and Victory celebrated as well as a Marriage: and
so there is in that <hi>19th.</hi> Chapter of S. <hi>Iohn.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ps. 45. 3, 4, 6.</note> Here, the Prophet says,

and righteousness: and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.

                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There S. <hi>Iohn</hi> says, having describ'd a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
on a white Horse, <hi>Out of his mouth goeth a sharp Sword, that
with it he should smite the Nations: and he shall rule them with a rod
of Iron: and he treadeth the Wine-press of the fierceness and wrath of
Almighty God. And he hath on his vesture, and on his thigh a Name
written KING of KINGS, and LORD of LORDS.</hi> This is
the same glorious Conqueror and Bridegroom in both places: and
this Victory is not gain'd, nor these Nuptials compleated till the second
coming of our Saviour.</p>
                     <p>In many other Psalms, there are reflections upon this happy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and the triumph of Christ over his Enemies: as <hi>Psal. 2. Psal.
9. Psal.</hi> 21. and 24. and 47. and 85. and 110. and others. In these,
and such like Psalms, there are lineaments and colours of a fairer
state, than any we have yet seen upon Earth. Not but that in their
first instan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>es and grounds they may sometimes respect the state of
<hi>Israel,</hi> or the Evangelical state: but the eye of the Prophet goes fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
this does not terminate his sight: His Divine Enthusiasm reaches
into another World: A World of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Iustice,</hi> and <hi>Holiness:</hi>
of Joy, and Victory, and Trumph over all the wicked: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
such a World, as neither we, nor our Fathers, have yet
seen.</p>
                     <p>This is an account of Two Prophets, <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Isaiah:</hi> and of
what they have more openly declar'd concerning the future King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Christ. But to verifie S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s words, in that forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
place, <hi>Act. 3. 21. viz.</hi> That all the <hi>Holy Prophets since the World
began,</hi> have spoken of the Restauration of all things at the second
coming of Christ. I say, to verifie this assertion of S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, we
must suppose, that, where the Prophets speak of the Restauration
and future glory of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> they do, under those Types,
represent to us the glory and happiness of the Church in the future
Kingdom of Christ. And most of the Prophets, in this sence, and
under these forms, have spoken of this Kingdom: In foretelling the
Restauration of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Sion;</hi> and happy days, peace, plenty,
and prosperity to the People of <hi>Israel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Most of the Prophets, I say, from <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Malachy,</hi> have spoken
of this <hi>Restauration. Moses</hi> in the <hi>30th.</hi> of <hi>Deut. ver. 4, 5, 9. David,</hi> in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41970:191"/>
many of those Psalms we have cited. <hi>Isaiah,</hi> besides the places fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd,
treats amply of this subject, <hi>Chap.</hi> 51. and in several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places.<note n="*" place="margin">Isaiah ch. 11. ch. 43. ch. 49. 13, &amp;c. ch. 66. Ezekiel, ch. 28. ch. 37. Hos. ch. 3. &amp; ch. 14. Ioel 3. 18. Amos, ch. 9. Obad. ver. 17, &amp;c. Mich. ch. 4. ch. 5.</note> So likewise the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Ioel,
Amos, Obadiah, Micab, Zephany, Haggai, Zachary, Malachy.</hi> All
these have, either expresly, or under the Types of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and
<hi>Sion,</hi> foretold happy days, and a glorious triumph to the Church of
God. And seeing in the New Testament, and in the Prophecies of
St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> the Christian Church is still represented, as under perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
and distress, till the fall of Antichrist, and the Millennial
Kingdom;<note place="margin">Zeph. 3. 14, &amp;c. Hag. ch. 2. Zac. 2. 10, &amp;c. &amp; ch. 9. 9, &amp;c. &amp; ch. 14. Mal. ch. 3. ch. 4.</note> 'Tis then, and not till then, that we must expect the
full accomplishment of these Prophecies; The <hi>Restauration</hi> that St.
<hi>Peter</hi> says was spoken of, by <hi>all the Prophets:</hi> and the <hi>mystery,</hi> which
St. <hi>Iohn</hi> says, <hi>(Apoc. 10. 7.)</hi> was <hi>declared by his Servants the Prophets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
and would be finish'd under the <hi>Seventh Trumpet,</hi> which ushers in
the Kingdom of Christ.</p>
                     <p>It would be too long to examine all these places in the Prophets,
which you may consult at leisure. However it cannot seem strange
that <hi>Ierusalem</hi> should be us'd in a typical or allegorical sence, seeing
we often find such applications of it in the New Testament: as <hi>Gal.
4. 26. Heb. 12. 22. Apoc.</hi> 3. 12. And 'tis very natural that <hi>Ierusalem
restor'd,</hi> should signifie the same thing as <hi>New Ierusalem;</hi> and therefore
that S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> by his <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> intended the same thing, or the
same state, that the ancient Prophets did by their Restauration of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi>
And if neither can be understood in a literal sence, which, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
you will not contend for; they must both be interpreted of the
future happiness and glory of the Church in the Kingdom of Christ.</p>
                     <p>But to conclude this point wholly as to Scripture; If we make
reflection upon all the passages alledg'd in this and the foregoing
Chapter, whether out of the Old or New Testament, we must at
least acknowledge thus much; That there are happy days, at one
time or other: Days of Peace and Righteousness: of Joy and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph:
of external Prosperity and internal Sanctity: when Vertue
and Innocency shall be in the Throne, and Vice and vitious Men out
of power or credit. That there are such happy days Prophesied of
in Scripture, and promised to the Church of God. Whether you
call this the <hi>Reign of Christ</hi> and of his Saints, or by any other name,
it is not material at present to determine; let the title be what you
will, as to the substance it cannot be denied to be a general Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Prophetical Scripture. And we must not imagine, that the
Prophets writ like the Poets: feigned an Idea of a Romantick state,
that never was, nor ever will be; only to please their own fancies,
or the credulous people. Neither is it the state of Heaven and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life that is here meant or intended: For, besides that they had
little or no light concerning those Notions, in the Old Testament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The Prophets generally in their description of this happiness, either
express the Earth, or at least give plain marks of a Terrestrial state.
Wherefore the only question that remains, is this, <hi>Whether</hi> these
happy Days are past already, or to come: Whether this blessed
state of the Church is behind us, or before us: whether our Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
have enjoy'd it, or our posterity is to expect it? For we are
very sure that it is not present; The World is full of Wars, and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41970:192"/>
rumours of Wars: of Vice and Knavery, of Oppression and Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution:
and these are things directly contrary to the genius and
characters of the state which we look after.</p>
                     <p>And if we look for it in times past, we can go no further back
than the beginning of Christianity. For S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> the last of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
Prophesied of these times, as to come: and plac'd them at the
end of his systeme of Prophecies; whereby one might conclude
that they are not only within the compass of the Christian ages, but
far advanc'd into them. But however, not to insist upon that at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
where will you find a thousand years, from the birth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
to this present age, that deserves the name, or answers to
the characters of this <hi>Pure</hi> and <hi>Pacifick</hi> state of the Church. The first
ages of Christianity, as they were the most pure, so likewise were
they the least peaceable. Continually, more or less, under the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
of the Heathen Emperours; and so far from being the
Reign and Empire of Christ and his Saints over the Nations, that
Christians were then, every where, in subjection or slavery; A
poor, feeble, helpless people, thrust into Prisons, or thrown to the
Lyons, at the pleasure of their Princes or Rulers. 'Tis true, when
the Empire became Christian under <hi>Constantine,</hi> in the fourth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury,
there was, for a time, peace and prosperity in the Church,
and a good degree of Purity and Piety. But that peace was soon
disturb'd, and that piety soon corrupted. The growing pride and
ambition of the Ecclesiasticks, and their easiness to admit or intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Superstitious Practices, destroy'd the purity of the Church.
And as to the peace of it, Their contests about Opinions and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
tore the Christians themselves into pieces; and, soon after,
an inundation of Barbarous People fell into Christendom, and put
it all into flames and confusion. After this Eruption of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Nations, <hi>Mahometanism</hi> rose in the East; and swarms of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens,</hi>
like armies of Locusts, invaded, conquer'd, and planted
their Religion in several parts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and of the
Christianiz'd World. And can we call such times the Reign of
Christ, or the imprisonment of Satan? In the following ages, the
<hi>Turks</hi> over-run the Eastern Empire and the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, and still
hold that miserable people in slavery. Providence seems to have so
order'd affairs, that the Christian World should never be without
a WOE upon it, lest it should fansie it self already in those happy
days of Peace and Prosperity, which are reserv'd for future times.
Lastly, whosoever is sensible of the corruptions and persecutions
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> since she came to her greatness; whosoever
allows her to be <hi>mystical Babylon,</hi> which must fall before the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Christ comes on; will think that Kingdom duly plac'd by
S. <hi>Iohn</hi> at the end of his Prophecies, concerning the Christian
Church: and that there still <hi>remains, according</hi> to the words of St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> (Hebr. 4. 9.) <hi>a Sabbatism to the people of God.</hi>

the future Kingdom of Christ. Next to these, the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Fathers</hi> are accounted of good authority; Let us therefore
now enquire into their Sence concerning this Doctrine, that we
may give satisfaction to all parties; And both those that are guided
by Scripture alone, and those that have a Veneration for Antiquity,
may find proofs suitable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o their inclinations and judgment.</p>
                     <p>And to make few words of it, we will lay down this Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>That the Millennial Kingdom of Christ was the general Doctrine of
the Primitive Church, from the times of the Apostles to the</hi> Nicene
<hi>Council;</hi> inclusively. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> out-liv'd all the rest of the Apostles,
and towards the latter end of his life, being banish'd into the Isle
of <hi>Pathmos,</hi> he writ his <hi>Apocalypse;</hi> wherein he hath given us a more
full and distinct account of the Millennial Kingdom of Christ, than
any of the Prophets or Apostles before him. <hi>Papias,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapolis,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iren. Lib. 5. c. 33.</note>

                        </gap>s, as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> testifies;
taught the same Doctrine after S. <hi>Iohn.</hi> He was the familiar friend
of <hi>Polycarp,</hi> another of S. <hi>Iohn'</hi>s Disciples; and either from him, or
immediately from S. <hi>Iohn'</hi>s mouth, he might receive this Doctrine.
That he taught it in the Church, is agreed on by all hands; both
by those that are his followers, as <hi>Irenaeus;</hi> and those that are not
well-wishers to this Doctrine, as <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>sebius</hi> and <hi>Ierome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>There is also another chanel wherein this Doctrine is Tradition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
deriv'd from S.</hi> Iohn, <hi>namely by the Clergy of</hi> Asia; <hi>as</hi> Irenaeus
<hi>tells us in the same Chapter. For, arguing the point, he shows that
the Blessing promis'd to</hi> Iacob <hi>from his Father</hi> Isaac, <hi>was not made
good to him in this life, and therefore he says,</hi> without doubt those
words had a further aim and prospect upon the times of the Kingdom:
<hi>(so they us'd to call the Millennial state)</hi> when the Iust rising from the
dead, shall reign: and when Nature renew'd and set at liberty, shall yield
plenty and abundance of all things; being blest with the dew of Heaven,
and a great fertility of the Earth. According as has been related by those
Ecclesiasticks or Clergy, who sce. St. <hi>John,</hi> the Disciple of Christ; and
heard of him WHAT OUR LORD HAD TAUGHT CONCERNING
THOSE TIMES. <hi>This, you see, goes to the Fountain-head. The
Christian Clergy receive it from St.</hi> Iohn, <hi>and St.</hi> Iohn <hi>relates it
from the mouth of our Saviour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So much for the Original authority of this Doctrine, as a Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
that it was from St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and by him from Christ. And as
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41970:193"/>
to the propagation and prevailing of it in the Primitive Church, we
can bring a witness beyond all exception,<note place="margin">Dial. with <hi>Tryphon</hi> the Iew.</note> 
                        <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
with <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and his Senior. He says, <hi>that himself, and all
the Orthodox Christians of his time, did acknowledge the Resurrection of
the flesh</hi> (suppose the first Resurrection) <hi>and a thousand years reign in
Ierusalem restor'd,</hi> or in the New Jerusalem. <hi>According as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
Ezekiel, and Isaiah, and Others, attest with common consent.</hi> As
St. <hi>Peter</hi> had said before, <hi>Act. 3. 21. That all the Prophets had spoken
of it.</hi> Then he quotes the <hi>65th. Chapter</hi> of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> which is a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark
for this Doctrine, that never can be broken. And to shew
the <hi>Iew,</hi> with whom he had this discourse, that it was the sence of
our Prophets, as well as of theirs, He tells him, that <hi>a certain Man
amongst us Christians, by name Iohn, one of the Apostles of Christ, in a
Revelation made to him did prophesie, that the faithful believers in Christ
should live a thousand years in the New Ierusalem; and after that should
be the general Resurrection and day of Iudgment.</hi> Thus you have the
thoughts and sentiment of <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> as to himself: as to all the
reputed Orthodox of his time; As to the sence of the Prophets in
the Old Testament, and as to the sence of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi>
All conspiring in confirmation of the Millenary Doctrine.</p>
                     <p>To these three Witnesses, <hi>Papias, Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> we
may add two more within the second Age of the Church: <hi>Melito,</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Sardis,</hi> and St. <hi>Barnabas,</hi> or whosoever was the Author of
the Epistle under his name. This <hi>Melito,</hi> by some is thought to be
the Angel of the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> to whom St. <hi>Iohn</hi> directs the
Epistle to that Church: <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3. 1. But I do not take him to be so
ancient; However he was Bishop of that place, at least in the second
Century, and a Person of great Sanctity and Learning. He writ
many Books, as you may see in St. <hi>Ierome:</hi> and, as He notes out of
<hi>Tertullian,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">De Script. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note> 
                        <hi>was by Christians reputed a Prophet.</hi> He was also a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
<hi>Millenary,</hi> and is recorded as such, both by <hi>Ierome</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadius.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dogm. Eccl. c. 55.</note>
As to the Epistle of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> which we mention'd, it must
be very ancient, whosoever is the Author of it, and before the third
Century; seeing it is often cited by <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> who was
himself within the second Century. The genius of it is very much
Millenarian, in the interpretation of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> the <hi>promis'd Land,</hi>
a <hi>Day</hi> for a <hi>thousand years,</hi> and concerning the <hi>Renovation of the World.</hi>
In all which, He follows the foot-steps of the Orthodox of those times:
that is, of the <hi>Millenarians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So much for the first and second Centuries of the Church. By
which short account it appears, that the Millenary Doctrine was
<hi>Orthodox</hi> and <hi>Catholick</hi> in those early days. For these Authors do not
set it down as a private opinion of their own, but as a <hi>Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>
or an <hi>Apostolical Tradition.</hi> 'Tis remarkable what <hi>Papias</hi> says
of himself, and his way of Learning, in his Book call'd, <hi>The Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Words of the Lord,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">De Script. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note> as St. <hi>Ierome</hi> gives us an account of
it: He says in his Preface, <hi>He did not follow various opinions, but had
the Apostles for his Authors. And that he consider'd what</hi> Andrew, <hi>what</hi>
Peter <hi>said; what</hi> Philip, <hi>what</hi> Thomas, <hi>and other Disciples of the Lord.
As also what</hi> Aristion, <hi>and</hi> John <hi>the Senior, Disciples of the Lord, what
they spoke. And that he did not profit so much by reading Books, as by the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41970:193"/>
living voice of these persons which resounded from them to that day.</hi> This
hath very much the air of Truth and Sincerity, and of a Man, that,
in good earnest, sought after the Christian Doctrine, from those
that were the most Authentick Teachers of it. I know <hi>Eusebius</hi> in
his <hi>Ecclesiastical History,</hi> gives a double Character of this <hi>Papias;</hi> in
one place,<note place="margin">Vide Hieron. Epist. 28. ad Lucinium.</note> he calls him, <hi>A very eloquent Man in all things, and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in Scripture;</hi> and in another, he makes him a Man of a <hi>small un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</hi>
But what reason there is to suspect <hi>Eusebius</hi> of partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in this point of the <hi>Millennium;</hi> we shall make appear hereafter.
However, We do not depend upon the Learning of <hi>Papias,</hi> or the
depth of his understanding: allow him but to be an honest Man,
and a fair Witness, and 'tis all we desire. And we have little reason
to question his testimony in this point, seeing it is backt by others
of good credit; and also because there is no counter-evidence, nor
any witness that appears against him. For there is not extant, either
the Writing, Name, or Memory, of any Person, that contested this
doctrine in the first or second Century. I say, that call'd in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
this Millenary Doctrine, propos'd after a Christian manner;
unless such Hereticks as deny'd the Resurrection wholly: or such
Christians as deny'd the Divine Authority of the Apocalypse.</p>
                     <p>We proceed now to the Third Century. Where you find <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,
Origen, Victorinus,</hi> Bishop and Martyr: <hi>Nepos Aegyptius, Cyprian,</hi>
and, at the end of it, <hi>Lactantius:</hi> All openly, prosessing, or impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly
favouring the Millenary Doctrine. We do not mention <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
Alexandrinus,</hi> contemporary with <hi>Tertullian,</hi> because he hath
not any thing, that I know of, expresly either for, or against the
<hi>Millennium.</hi> But he takes notice that the <hi>Seventh Day</hi> hath been
accounted <hi>Sacred,</hi> both by the Hebrews and Greeks, because of the
<hi>Revolution</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>Renovation of all things.</hi> And giving
this as a reason why they kept that day <hi>Holy,</hi> seeing there is not a
Revolution of the World every seven days, it can be in no other
sence than as the <hi>Seventh Day</hi> represents the <hi>seventh Millenary,</hi> in
which the Renovation of the World and the Kingdom of Christ, is
to be. As to <hi>Tertullian,</hi> S. <hi>Ierome</hi> reckons him, in the first place,
amongst the Latin <hi>Millenaries.</hi> And tho' his Book, about the <hi>Hope</hi>
of the <hi>Faithful,</hi> as also that about <hi>Paradise,</hi> which should have given
us the greatest light in this affair, be both lost or suppress'd; yet
there are sufficient indications of his Millenary opinion in his Tracts
against <hi>Marcion,</hi> and against <hi>Hermogenes.</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> was <hi>Tertullian'</hi>s
admirer, and inclines to the same opinion, so far as one can judge,
in this particular; for his period of <hi>Six Thousand Years,</hi> and making
the <hi>Seventh Millenary</hi> the Consummation of all, is wholly according
to the Analogy of the Millenary Doctrine. As to the Two Bishops,
<hi>Victorinus</hi> and <hi>Nepos,</hi> S. <hi>Ierome</hi> vouches for them. The Writings of
the one are lost, and of the other so chang'd, that the sence of the
Author does not appear there now. But <hi>Lactantius,</hi> whom we
nam'd in the last place, does openly and profusely teach this doctrine,
in his <hi>Divine Institutions:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Book 7.</note> and with the same assurance that he does
other parts of the Christian Doctrine. For he concludes thus, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>Millennium, This is the doctrine of the Holy Prophets, which
we Christians follow. This is our wisdom,</hi> &amp;c. Yet he acknowledges
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41970:194"/>
there that it was kept as a mystery or secret amongst the Christians,
lest the Heathens should make any perverse or odious interpretation
of it. And for the same or like reason, I believe, The Book of the
<hi>Apocalypse</hi> was kept out of the hands of the Vulgar for some time,
and not read publickly, lest it should be found to have spoken
too openly of the fate of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, or of this Millennial
State.</p>
                     <p>So much for the First, Second, and Third Century of the Church.
But, by our conclusion, we engag'd to make out this proof as far
as the <hi>Nicene Council,</hi> inclusively, The <hi>Nicene Council</hi> was about
the year of Christ 325. and we may reasonably suppose, <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
was then living; at least he came within the time of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>'s
Empire. But however the Fathers of that Council are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
our witnesses in this point. For, in their <hi>Ecclesiastical Forms</hi>
or <hi>Constitutions,</hi> in the <hi>chapter about the Providence of God,</hi> and <hi>about
the World,</hi> They speak thus; <hi>The World was made meaner or less per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
providentially; for God foresee that man would sin. Wherefore we
expect New Heavens and a New Earth, according to the Holy Scriptures:
at the appearance and Kingdom of the great God, and our Saviour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ.</hi> And then, as <hi>Daniel</hi> says (ch. 7. 18.) <hi>The Saints of the
most High shall take the Kingdom. And the Earth shall be Pure, Holy,
the Land of the Living, not of the dead. Which</hi> David <hi>foreseeing by
the eye of Faith,</hi> cryes out (Ps. 27. 13.) <hi>I believe to see the good things
of the Lord, in the Land of the Living. Our Saviour says, Happy are
the meek, for they shall inherit the Earth,</hi> Matt. 5. 5. <hi>and the Prophet</hi>
Isaiuh <hi>says, (chap. 26. 6.) the feet of the meek and lowly shall tread upon
it.</hi> So you see, according to the judgment of these Fathers, there
will be a Kingdom of Christ upon Earth; and moreover, that it will
be in the <hi>New Heavens</hi> and the <hi>New Earth.</hi> And, in both these
points, they cite the Prophets and our Saviour in confirmation of
them.</p>
                     <p>Thus we have discharg'd our promise, and given you an account
of the doctrine of the <hi>Millennium,</hi> or future Kingdom of Christ,
throughout the Three First Ages of the Church, before any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
corruptions were crept into the Christian Religion. And
those Authorities of single and successive Fathers, we have seal'd up
all together, with the declaration of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers, in a Body.
Those that think Tradition a Rule of Faith, or a considerable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to it, will find it hard to turn off the force of these Testimonies.
And those that do not go so far, but yet have a reverence for Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
and the Primitive Church, will not easily produce better Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities,
more early, more numerous, or more uncontradicted, for
any Article that is not Fundamental. Yet these are but Seconds to
the Prophets and Apostles, who are truly the Principals in this
Cause. I will leave them altogether, to be examin'd and weigh'd
by the Impartial Reader. And because they seem to me to make a
full and undeniable proof, I will now at the foot of the account set
down our second Proposition, which is this, <hi>That there is a Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
State,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Propos. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>or a Future Kingdom of Christ and his Saints, Prophesied of
and Promised, in the Old and New Testament; and receiv'd by the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church as a Christian and Catholick Doctrine.</hi>

                        <pb n="123" facs="tcp:41970:194"/>
HAVING dispatch'd this main point. To conclude the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and this Head of our Discourse, it will be some satisfaction
possibly to see, <hi>How</hi> a Doctrine so generally receiv'd and approv'd,
came to decay and almost wear out of the Church, in following
Ages. The Christian Millenary Doctrine was not call'd into questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
so far as appears from History, before the middle of the third
Century; when <hi>Dionysius Alexandrinus</hi> writ against <hi>Nepos,</hi> an <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi>
Bishop, who had declar'd himself upon that subject. But
we do not find that this Book had any great effect; for the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or constitution of the <hi>Nicene Fathers</hi> was after: and in S. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>'s
time, who writ towards the end of the fourth Century,
this Doctrine had so much Credit, that, He, who was its greatest
adversary, yet durst not condemn it, as he says himself. <hi>Quae licet
non sequamur, tamen damnare non possumus; quià multi Ecclesiastico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
virorum &amp; Martyres ista dixerunt. Which things, or doctrines,</hi>
speaking of the Millennium, <hi>tho' we do not follow, yet we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn.
Because many of our Church-men, and Martyrs, have affirmed
these things.</hi> And when <hi>Apollinarius</hi> replyed to that Book of <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi>
S. <hi>Ierome</hi> says, that, <hi>not only those of his own Sect, but a great
multitude of other Christians did agree with</hi> Apollinarius <hi>in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.
Ut praesagâ mente jam cernam, quantorum in me rabies concitanda
sit. That I now foresee, how many will be enrag'd against me, for what
I have spoken against the Millenary Doctrine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We may therefore conclude that in S. <hi>Ierome</hi>'s time the Millena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
made the greater party in the Church; for a little matter would
not have frighted him from censuring their opinion. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> was
a rough and rugged Saint, and an unfair adversary, that usually run
down, with heat and violence, what stood in his way. As to his
unfairness, he shews it sufficiently in this very cause, for he gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
represents the Millenary Doctrine after a Judaical rather than a
<hi>Christian</hi> manner. And in reckoning up the chief Patrons of it, he
always skips <hi>Iustin Martyr.</hi> Who was not a Man so obscure as to be
over<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>look'd: and he was a Man that had declar'd himself sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon this point, for he says, <hi>both himself and all the Orthodox of
his time, were of that judgment,</hi> and applyes both the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> of
S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the <hi>65th chap.</hi> of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> for the proof of it. As we
noted before.</p>
                     <p>As S. <hi>Ierome</hi> was an open enemy to this Doctrine, so <hi>Eusebius</hi> was
a back friend to it; and represented every thing to its disadvantage,
so far as was tolerably consistent with the fairness of an Historian.
He gives a slight character of <hi>Papias,</hi> without any authority for
it;<note place="margin">Eccles. Hist. 3. 22. <gap reason="foreign">

of the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> and of the <hi>Millennium:</hi> and calls the Visions there
<hi>monstrous stories.</hi> He himself is willing to shuffle off that Book from
<hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Evangelist</hi> to another <hi>Iohn</hi> a <hi>Presbyter:</hi> and to shew his
skill in the interpretation of it,<note place="margin">l. 3. 32. de vit. Constan.</note> he makes the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> in
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41970:195"/>
the <hi>21th chap.</hi> to be <hi>Constantine</hi>'s <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> when he turn'd the
Heathen Temples there into Christian. A wonderful invention. As
S. <hi>Ierome</hi> by his flouts, so <hi>Eusebius</hi> by sinister insinuations, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to lessen the reputation of this Doctrine; and the Art they
both us'd, was, to misrepresent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap> as <hi>Iudaical.</hi> But we must not
cast off every doctrine which the Jews believ'd, only for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
for we have the same Oracles which they had, and the same
Prophets: and they have collected from them same general doctrine
that we have, namely, that <hi>There will be an happy and pacifick state
of the Church, in future times.</hi> But as to the circumstances of this
state we differ very much; They suppose the Mosaical Law will be
restor'd, with all its pomp, rites, and ceremonies: whereas we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Christian Worship, or something more perfect, will then
take place. Yet S. <hi>Ierome</hi> has the confidence, even there where he
speaks of the many Christian Clergy, and Martyrs that held this
doctrine: has the confidence, I say, to represent it, as if they held
that <hi>Circumcision, Sacrifices,</hi> and all the Judaical rites, should then
be restor'd. Which seems to me to be a great slander, and a great
instance how far mens passions will carry them, in misrepresenting
an opinion which they have a mind to disagrace.</p>
                     <p>But as, we have reason to blame the partiality of those that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
this doctrine, so, on the other hand, we cannot excuse the
Patrons of it from all indiscretions. I believe they might partly
themselves make it obnoxious; by mixing some things with it, from
pretended Traditions, or the Books of the Sibylls, or other private
Authorities, that had so sufficient warrant from Scripture; and
things, sometimes, that Nature would not easily bear. Besides, in
later ages, they seem to have dropt one half of the doctrine, namely,
the <hi>Renovation of Nature,</hi> which <hi>Irenaeus, Iustin Martyr,</hi> and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,
joyn inseparably with the Millennium. And by this omission,
the doctrine hath been made less intelligible, and one part of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with another. And when their pretensions were to reign
upon this present Earth, and in this present state of Nature, it gave
a jealousie to Temporal Princes, and gave occasion likewise to many
of Eanatical Spirits, under the notion of Saints, to aspire to domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
after a violent and tumultuary manner. This I reckon as one
great cause that brought the doctrine into discredit. But I hope by
reducing of it to the true state, we shall cure this and other abuses,
for the future.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, It never pleas'd the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and so far as the
influence and authority of that would go, you may be sure it would
be deprest and discountenanc'd. I never yet met with a Popish
Doctor that held the <hi>Millennium;</hi> and <hi>Baron us</hi> would have it pass
for an Heresie, and <hi>Papias</hi> for the Inventor of it; whereas, if <hi>Irenaeus</hi>
may be credited, it was receiv'd from S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and by him from the
mouth of our Saviour. And neither S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> nor his friend Pope <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masus,</hi>
durst ever condemnoit for an <hi>heresie.</hi> It was always indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie,
and gave offence, to the Church of <hi>Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> because it does not
suit to that Scheme of Christianity, which they have drawn. They
suppose Christ reigns already, by his Vicar, the Pope: and treads
upon the Necks of Emperors and Kings. And if they could but
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:41970:195"/>
suppress the <hi>Northern Heresie,</hi> as they call it, they do not know what
a <hi>Millennium</hi> would signifie, or how the Church could be in an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier
condition than she is. The <hi>Apocalypse</hi> of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> does suppose
the true Church under hardship and persecution, more or less, for
the greatest part of the Christian Ages: namely for 1260 years,
while the Witnesses are in Sack cloth. But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath
been in prosperity and greatness, and the commanding Church in
Christendom, for so long or longer, and hath rul'd the Nations
with a Rod of Iron; so as that mark of the true Church; does not
favour her at all. And the <hi>Millennium</hi> being properly a reward and
triumph for those that come out of Persecution, such as have liv'd
always in pomp and prosperity can pretend to no share in it, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
by it. This has made the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have always an ill
eye upon this Doctrine, because it seem'd to have an ill eye
upon her. And as she grew in splendor and greatness, she eclips'd
and obscur'd it more and more: so that it would have been lost
out of the World as an obsolete errour, if it had not been reviv'd
by some of the Reformation.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VII. The true state of the Millennium, according to Characters
taken from Scripture; some mistakes concerning it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd.</head>
                     <p>WE have made sufficient proof of a Millennial state, from
Scripture and Antiquity; and upon that firm Basis have
setled our second Proposition. We should now determine the <hi>Time</hi>
and <hi>Place</hi> of this future Kingdom of Christ: Not whether it is to
be in Heaven, or upon Earth: for that we suppose determin'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready;
but whether it is to be in the present Earth, and under the
present constitution of Nature, or in the <hi>New Heavens,</hi> and <hi>New
Earth,</hi> which are promis'd after the <hi>Conflagration.</hi> This is to make
our <hi>Third Proposition:</hi> and I should have proceeded immediately to
the examination of it, but that I imagine it will give us some light
in this affair, if we enquire further into the true state of the <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennium,</hi>
before we determine its Time and Place.</p>
                     <p>We have already noted some <hi>moral</hi> Characters of the <hi>Millennial</hi>
state; And the great <hi>Natural</hi> Character of it, is this in general,
That it will be <hi>Paradisiacal.</hi> Free from all inconveniences, either of
external Nature, or of our own Bodies. For my part, I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
how there can be any considerable degree of happiness
without <hi>Indolency:</hi> nor how there can be Indolency, while we have
such Bodies as we have now, and such an external constitution of
Nature. And as there must be <hi>Indolency,</hi> where there is happiness;
so there must not be <hi>Indigency,</hi> or want of any due comforts of life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For where there is <hi>Indigency,</hi> there is sollicitude, and distraction, and
uneasiness, and fear: Passions, that do as naturally disquiet the Soul,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41970:196"/>
as pain does the Body. Therefore Indolency and Plenty seem to be
two essential Ingredients of every happy state; and these two in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
make that state we call <hi>Paradisiacal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now the Scripture seems plainly to exempt the Sons of the <hi>New
Ierusalem,</hi> or of the <hi>Millennium,</hi> from all <hi>pain</hi> or <hi>want,</hi> in those
words, <hi>Apoc. 21. 4. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
And there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying: neither shall
there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.</hi> And the
Lord of that Kingdom, <hi>He that sate upon the Throne,</hi> said, <hi>Behold I
make all things new,</hi> ver. 5. This Renovation is a restauration to some
former state: and I hope not to that state of indigency, and misery,
and diseasedness, which we languish under at present. But to that
pristine Paradisiacal state, which was the blessing of the first Heavens
and the first Earth.</p>
                     <p>As Health and Plenty are the Blessings of Nature, so, in Civil af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
<hi>Peace</hi> is the greatest blessing. And this is inseparably annext
to the <hi>Millennium:</hi> an indelible character of the Kingdom of Christ.
And by <hi>Peace</hi> we understand, not onely freedom from Persecution
upon religious accounts, but that <hi>Nation shall not rise up against Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
upon any account whatsoever. That bloody Monster, <hi>War,</hi> that
hath devour'd so many Millions of the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> is now at
length to be chain'd up: and the Furies, that run throughout the
Earth, with their Snakes and Torches, shall be thrown into the
Abyss, to sting and prey upon one another. All evil and mischievous
passions shall be extinguish'd: and that not in men onely, but even
in Brute creatures, according to the Prophets. <hi>The Lamb and the Lyon
shall lie down together, and the sucking Child shall play with the Basilisk.</hi>
Happy days, when not onely the Temple of <hi>Ianus</hi> shall be shut up
for a thousand years, and the <hi>Nations shall beat their swords into plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shares:</hi>
but all enmities and antipathies shall cease, all acts of hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
throughout all nature. And this Universal Peace is a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
also of the former character, <hi>Universal Plenty:</hi> for where
there is want and necessitousness, there will be quarrelling.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, 'Tis a Kingdom of Righteousness, as well as of Peace.
These also must go together; for unrighteous Persons will not live
long in peace, no more than indigent Persons. The <hi>Psalmist</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
joyns them together: and <hi>Plenty</hi> also, as their necessary preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative:
in his description of the Kingdom of Christ: Psal. 85. 10, 11,
12. <hi>Mercy and truth are met together: Righteousness and peace have
kissed each other. Truth shall spring out of the Earth, and righteousness
shall look down from Heaven. Yea the Lord shall give good, and our Land
shall yield her increase.</hi> This will not be a medley-state, as the present
World is, good and bad mingled together; but a <hi>chosen generation,
a royal Priesthood, an holy Nation, a peculiar people.</hi> Those that have a
part in the first Resurrection, the Scripture pronounceth them <hi>Holy
and Blessed:</hi> and says, <hi>the second death shall have no power over them.</hi>
Satan also is bound and shut up in the bottomless Pit, and has no
liberty of tempting or seducing this People, for a thousand years:
but at the end of that time, he will meet with a degenerate crew,
separate and aliens to the Holy City, that will make war against it,
and perish in the attempt.<note place="margin">Apoc. 5. 9,</note> In a word, those that are to enjoy this
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41970:196"/>

any but the righteous.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, This will be a state under a peculiar divine presence and
conduct. It is not easie indeed to determine the manner of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
but the Scripture plainly implies some extraordinary divine
presence to enligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>divine presence,</hi> comes from a word of the like significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and sound with the <hi>Greek</hi> word here us'd. Therefore there will
be a <hi>Shekinah</hi> in that Kingdom of Christ; but as to the mode of it,
I am very willing to confess my ignorance.</p>
                     <p>The last Character that belongs to this state, or rather to those
that enjoy it, is, that they are <hi>Kings and Priests unto God.</hi> This is a
character often repeated in Scripture, and therefore the more to be
regarded. It occurs thrice in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> in formal terms, <hi>Ch. 1. 6.
Ch. 5. 10. Ch.</hi> 20. 6. And as to the Regal dignity apart, that is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
exprest, either by the <hi>Donation of a Kingdom,</hi> as in <hi>Daniel's</hi>
phrase, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 18, 22, 27. Or by <hi>placing upon Thrones,</hi> with a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
power; which is the New Testament style, <hi>Mat. 19. 28. Luk.
22. 29, 30. Revel.</hi> 20. 4. These two Titles, no doubt, are intended
to comprehend the highest honours that we are capable of: these
being the highest dignities in every Kingdom; and such as were by
the Ancients, both in the East and in the West, commonly united
in one and the same Person. Their Kings being Priests, like <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedeck:</hi>
or as the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour was <hi>Pontifex Maximus.</hi> But as to
the Sacerdotal character, that seems chiefly to respect the temper
of the mind; to signife a People dedicated to God and his Service:
Separate from the World, and from secular affairs: Spending their
time in devotion and contemplation, which will be the great em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
of that happy state. For where there is ease, peace, and
plenty of all things; refin'd Bodies, and purified Minds, there will
be more inclination to intellectual exercises and entertainments:
which they may attend upon, without any distraction, having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
want, pain, nor worldly business.</p>
                     <p>The Title of <hi>King</hi> implies a confluence of all things that constitute
temporal happiness. 'Tis the highest thing we can wish any in this
World, to be a King. So as the <hi>Regal</hi> dignity seems to comprehend
all the Goods of Fortune, or external felicity: And the <hi>Sacerdotal,</hi>
                        <pb n="128" facs="tcp:41970:197"/>
the Goods of the Mind, or internal: Both which concur in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of true happiness. There is also a further force and empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis
in this notion, <hi>of the Saints being made Kings,</hi> if we consider it <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively,</hi>
with respect to what they were before in this World;
where they were not only mean and despicable, in subjection and
servility, but often under persecution, abus'd and trampled upon,
by the secular and Ecclesiastical Powers. But now the Scene is
chang'd, and you see the reverse of Providence, according as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
said to the Rich <hi>man, Son, remember that thou in thy life time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivedst
thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things. But now he is
comforted, and thou art tormented.</hi> Now they are set upon Thrones
and Tribunals, who were before arraigned as Criminals, and
brought before tyrannical Judicatures. They are now Laws and
Law-givers to themselves: in a true state of Royal Liberty, neither
under the domination of evil men, nor of their own evil pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
                     <p>Some possibly may think, that this high character of <hi>being made
Priests</hi> and <hi>Kings to God,</hi> is not general to all that enjoy the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>llen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi>
but a prerogative belonging to the Apostles and some of the
chief Martyrs, who are eminently rewarded for their eminent ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.
But Scripture, as far as I perceive, applyes it to all that inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
that Kingdom. <hi>The redeemed out of every kindred, and tongue, and
people, and nation,</hi> are made <hi>Kings and Priests to God, and shall reign
on the earth, Apoc.</hi> 5. 9, 10. And in the <hi>20th chap. ver.</hi> 6. all the Sons
of the first Resurrection are made <hi>Priests of God and shall reign with
him a thousand years.</hi> Here is no distinction or discrimination thus
far. Not that we suppose an universal equality of conditions in the
Millennial state, but as to all these characters which we have given
of it, I do not perceive that they are restrain'd or confin'd by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to single persons, but make the general happiness of that state,
and are the portion of every one that is admitted into the New Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</p>
                     <p>Others possibly may think that this priviledge of the <hi>first Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
is not common to all that enjoy the Millennial State. For tho'
S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> who is the only person that hath made express mention of
the <hi>first Resurrection,</hi> and of the <hi>thousand years reign</hi> of Christ, does
joyn these two as the same thing, and common to the same persons;
yet I know there are some that would distinguish them as things of
a different extent, and also of a different nature. They suppose the
Martyrs only will rise from the dead; and will be immediately
translated into Heaven, and there pass their <hi>Millennium</hi> in celestial
glory. While the Church is still here below, in her <hi>Millennium,</hi> such
as it is; a state indeed bet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>er than ordinary, and free from persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
but obnoxious to all the inconveniences of our present mortal
life, and a medly of good and bad people, without separation. This
is such an Idea of the <hi>Millennium,</hi> as, to my eye, hath neither beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in it, nor foundation in Scripture. That the Citizens of the <hi>New
Ierusalem</hi> are not a miscellaneous company, but a Community of
righteous persons, we have noted before: and that the state of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
will be better than it is at present. But, besides this, what war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
have they for this Ascension of the Martyrs into Heaven at that
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:41970:197"/>
time? Where do we read of that in Scripture? And in those things
that are not matters of Natural Order, but of Divine Oeconomy,
we ought to be very careful how we add to Scripture.</p>
                     <p>The Scripture speaks only of the Resurrection of the Martyrs, <hi>Apoc.</hi>
20. 45. But not a word concerning their Ascension into Heaven. Will
that be visible? We read of our Saviour's Resurrection and Ascension,
and therefore we have reason to affirm them both. We read also
of the Resurrection and Ascension of the <hi>Witnesses, (Apoc. 11.)</hi> in a
figurate sence, and in that sence we may assert them upon good
grounds. But as to the Martyrs, we read of their Resurrection on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
without any thing exprest of imply'd about their Ascension. By
what Authority then shall we add this New Notion to the History
or Scheme of the Millennium? The Scripture on the contrary, makes
mention of the descent of the <hi>New Ierusalem, Apoc.</hi> 21. 2. making the
Earth the Theatre of all that affair. And the Camp of the Saints
is upon the Earth, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. and these Saints are the same persons, so
far as can be collected from the text, that rise <hi>from the dead, and
reign'd with Christ,</hi> and were <hi>Priests to God, ver.</hi> 4, 5, 6. Neither is
there any distinction made, that I find, by S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> of two sorts of
Saints in the <hi>Millennium,</hi> the one in Heaven, and the other upon
Earth. Lastly, The four and twenty Elders, <hi>ch.</hi> 5. 10. tho' they were
<hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Priests unto God,</hi> were content to reign upon Earth. Now
who can you suppose of a superiour order to these four and twenty
Elders: Whether they represent the twelve Patriarchs and twelve
Apostles, or whomsoever they represent, they are plac'd next to him
that sits upon the Throne,<note place="margin">ch. 11. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

than these are; and therefore seeing these highest Dignitaries in the

there is no ground to suppose the assumption of any other into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

                     <p>This is a short and general draught of the Millennial state, or fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

                     <p>WE come now to the Third and last head of our Discourse:
To determine the <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place</hi> of the <hi>Millennium.</hi> And

we will lay down the Conclusion in the first place, that our

part of the Chapter. Our Third and last Proposition therefore
is this,<note place="margin">Propos. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>That the Blessed Millennium,</hi> (properly so called) <hi>according as
it is describ'd in Scripture, cannot obtain in the present Earth, nor under

in the New Heavens and New Earth, after the Conflagration.</hi> This
Proposition, it may be, will seem a Paradox or singularity to many,
even of those that believe a <hi>Millennium;</hi> We will therefore make it
the business of this Chapter, to state it, and prove it; by such Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
as are manifestly founded in Scripture and in Reason.</p>
                     <p>And to prevent mistakes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we must premise this in the first place;<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

That, tho the Blessed <hi>Millennium</hi> will not be in this Earth, yet we
allow that the state of the Church here, will grow much better
than it is at present. There will be a better Idea of Christianity, and
according to the Prophecies, a full <hi>Resurrection of the Witnesses,</hi> and
an <hi>Ascension</hi> into power, and the tenth part of the City will fall;
which things imply ease from Persecution, The Conversion of some
part of the Christian World to the reformed Faith, and a consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
diminution of the power of Antichrist. But this still comes
short of the happiness and glory wherein the future Kingdom of
Christ is represented. Which cannot come to pass till the <hi>Man of Sin</hi>
be destroy'd, with a total destruction. After the Resurrection of
the Witnesses, there is a Third <hi>WOE</hi> yet to come: and how long
that will last, does not appear. If it bear proportion with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
<hi>WOES,</hi> it may last some hundreds of years. And we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
imagine the <hi>Millennium</hi> to begin till that <hi>WOE</hi> be finish'd. As
neither till the <hi>Vials</hi> be poured out, in the <hi>15th. chap.</hi> which cannot
be all pour'd out till after the Resurrection of the Witnesses; those
<hi>Vials</hi> being the last plagues that compleat the destruction of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.
Wherefore allowing that the Church, upon the Resurrection
and Ascension of the Witnesses, will be advanc'd into a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
yet that condition cannot be the Millennial state; where the
Beast is utterly destroy'd, and Satan bound, and cast into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless
pit.</p>
                     <p>This being premis'd, let us now examine what grounds there are
for the Translation of that blessed state into the New Heavens and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:41970:198"/>
New Earth: seeing that Thought, it may be, to many persons,
will appear new and extraordinary. In the first place, We suppose
it out of dispute, that there will be New Heavens and a New Earth
after the Conflagration. This was our first Proposition, and we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon it, as sufficiently prov'd both from Scripture and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.
This being admitted, How will you stock this New Earth?
What use will you put it to? 'Twill be a much nobler Earth, and
better built than the present: and 'tis pity it should only float about,
empty and useless, in the wild Air. If you will not make it the seat
and habitation of the Just in the blessed <hi>Millennium,</hi> what will you
make it? How will it turn to account? What hath Providence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
it for? We must not suppose New Worlds made without
counsel or design. And as, on the one hand, you cannot tell what
to do with this New Creation, if it be not thus employ'd: so, on
the other hand, it is every way fitted and suited to be an happy and
Paradisiacal habitation, and answers all the natural Characters of
the Millennial state; which is a great presumption that it is design'd
for it.</p>
                     <p>But to argue this more closely upon Scripture-grounds. S. <hi>Peter</hi>
says, the Righteous shall inhabit the New Heavens and the New
Earth: <hi>2. Pet. 3. 13. Nevertheless, according to his promise, we look
for New Heavens and New Earth, WHEREIN DWELLETH RIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEOUSNESS:</hi>
that is, a Righteous People, as we have shewn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
But who are these Righteous People? That's the great que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.
If you compare S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s New Heavens and New Earth with
S. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21. 1, 2. it will go far towards the resolution of this
question: For S. <hi>Iohn</hi> seems plainly to make the Inhabitants of the
<hi>New Ierusalem</hi> to be in this <hi>New Earth. I saw,</hi> says he, <hi>New Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
and a New Earth:</hi> and the <hi>New Ierusalem descending from God
out of Heaven;</hi> therefore descending into this <hi>New Earth,</hi> which he
had mention'd immediately before. And there <hi>the Tabernacle of God
was with men, ver.</hi> 3. and there He that sat upon the Throne, said,
<hi>Behold I make all things New.</hi> Referring still to this New Heavens
and New Earth, as the Theatre where all these things are acted, or
all these Scenes exhibited: from the first Verse to the eighth. Now
the New Jerusalem state being the same with the Millennial, if the
one be in the New Heavens and New Earth, the other is there also.
And this interpretation of S. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s word is confirm'd and fully
assur'd to us by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah;</hi> who also placeth the joy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
of the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> in the New Heavens and New Earth:
Chap. 65. 17, 18. <hi>For behold I create new Heavens and a new Earth:
and the former shall not be remembred: but be you glad and rejoyce for
ever in that which I create: for behold, I create Ierusalem a rejoycing,
and her people a joy.</hi> Namely, in that New Heavens and New Earth.
Which answers to S. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Vision of the New <hi>Ierusalem</hi> being let
down upon the New Earth.</p>
                     <p>To these Reasons, and deductions from Scripture, we might add
the testimony of several of the Fathers; I mean of those that were
Millenaries. For we are speaking now to such as believe the <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennium,</hi>
but place it in the present Earth before the Renovation;
whereas the ancient Millenaries suppos'd the regeneration and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41970:199"/>
of the World before the Kingdom of Christ came. As
you may see in<note n="*" place="margin">Li. 5. ch. 32, &amp;c.</note> 
                        <hi>Irenaeus,</hi>

and<note n="(d)" place="margin">Quaest. &amp; respon. 93.</note> the Author <hi>ad Orthodoxos.</hi> And the neglect of this, I
look upon as one reason, as we noted before, that brought that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
into discredit and decay. For when they plac'd the Kingdom
of the Saints upon this Earth, it bec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>me more capable of being abus'd,
by fanatical spirits, to the disturbance of the World, and the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the rights of the Magistrate, Civil or Ecclesiastical, under that
notion of Saints. And made them also dream of sensual pleasures,
such as they see in this life: Or at least gave an occasion and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to those, that had a mind to make the doctrine odious, of
charging it with these consequences. All these abuses are cut off,
and these scandals prevented, by placing the Millennium aright.
Namely, not in this present Life, or on this present Earth, but in the
New Creation, where Peace and Righteousness will dwell. And this
is our first Argument why we place the Millennium in the New
Heavens and New Earth: and 'tis taken partly, you see, from the
reason of the thing it self, the difficulty of assigning any other use
of the New Earth, and its fitness for this; and partly from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-evidence,
and partly from Antiquity.</p>
                     <p>The second argument for our opinion, is this; The present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of Nature will not bear that happiness, that is promis'd
in the Millennium, or is not consistent with it. The diseases of our
Bodies, the disorders of our Passions, the incommodiousness of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Nature; Indigency, servility, and the unpeaceableness of the
World; These are things inconsistent with the happiness that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
in the Kingdom of Christ. But these are constant attendants
upon this Life, and inseparable from the present state of Nature.
Suppose the Millennium was to begin Nine or Ten Years hence, as
some pretend it will. How shall this World, all on a sudden, be
metamorphos'd into that happy state?<note place="margin">Apoc. 21. 4.</note> No more <hi>sorrow, nor crying,
nor pain, nor death,</hi> says S. <hi>Iohn: All former things are past away.</hi> But
how past away? Shall we not have the same Bodies: and the same
external Nature: and the same corruptions of the Air: and the
same excesses and intemperature of Seasons? Will there not be the
same ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>enness of the ground: the same number of People to be
fed: and must they not get their living by the sweat of their brows,
with servile labour and drudgery? How then are all former evils past
away? And as to publick affairs, while there are the same necessities
of humane Life, and a distinction of Nations, those Nations some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
will have contrary interests, will clash and interfere one with
another: whence differences, and contests, and Wars will arise, and
the <hi>Thousand Years Truce,</hi> I am afraid, will be often broken. We
might add also, that if our Bodies be not chang'd, we shall be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the same appetites, and the same passions: and upon those,
vices will grow: as bad fruit upon a bad Tree. To conclude, so
long as our Bodies are the same: external Nature the same: The
necessities of humane Life the same: which things are the roots
of evil; you may call it a <hi>Millennium,</hi> or what you please, but
there will be still diseases, vices, wars, tears and cries, pain and
sorrow in this <hi>Millenuium;</hi> and if so, 'tis a <hi>Millennium</hi> of your
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:41970:199"/>
own making; for that which the Prophets describe is quite another
thing.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, if you suppose the Millennium will be upon this
Earth, and begin, it may be, ten or twenty years hence, How will
it be introduc'd; how shall we know when we are in it, or when
we enter upon it? If we continue the same, and all Nature continue
the same, we shall not discern when we slip into the Millennium.
And as to the Moral state of it, shall we all, on a sudden, <hi>become
Kings and Priests to God?</hi> wherein will that change consist, and
how will it be wrought? St. <hi>Iohn</hi> makes the <hi>First Resurrection</hi> intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Millennium; and that's a conspicuous mark and bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
But as to the modern or vulgar Millennium, I know not how
'tis usher'd in. Whether they suppose a visible resurrection of the
Martyrs, and a visible Ascension: and that to be a Signal to all the
World that the Jubilee is beginning: or whether 'tis gradual and
creeps upon us insensibly: or the fall of the Beast marks it. These
things need both explication and proof; for to me they seem either
arbitrary, or unintelligible.</p>
                     <p>But to pursue our design and Subject. That which gives me the
greatest scandal in this doctrine of the vulgar Millennium, is, their
joyning things together that are really inconsistent; a natural
World of one colour, and a moral World of another. They will
make us happy in spight of Nature: as the Stoicks would make a
man happy in <hi>Phalaris his Bull;</hi> so must the Saints be in full bliss in
the Millennium, tho' they be under a fit of the Gout, or of the Stone.
For my part, I could never reconcile pain to happiness: It seems to
me to destroy and drown all pleasure, as a loud noise does a still
voice. It affects the Nerves with violence, and over-bears all other
motions. But if, according to this modern supposition, they have
the same Bodies, and breath the same air, in the Millennium, as we
do now, there will be both private and Epidemical distempers, in
the same manner as now; Suppose then a Plague comes and sweeps
away half an hundred thousand Saints in the Millennium, is this no
prejudice or dishonour to the State? Or a War makes a Nation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate:
or, in single Persons, a lingring disease makes life a burthen:
or a burning Fever, or a violent Colick tortures them to death.
Where such evils as these reign, christen the thing what you will,
it can be no better than a Mock-Millennium. Nor shall I ever be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that such a state as our present life, where an akeing Tooth,
or an akeing Head, does so discompose the Soul, as to make her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
for business, study, devotion, or any useful employment: And
that all the powers of the mind, all its vertue, and all its wisdom,
are not able to stop these little motions, or to support them with
tranquillity: I can never perswade my self, I say, that such a state
was designed by God or Nature, for a state of happiness.</p>
                     <p>Our third argument is this: The future Kingdom of Christ will
not take place, till the Kingdom of Antichrist be wholly destroy'd.
But that will not be wholly destroy'd till the end of the World, and
the appearing of our Saviour. Therefore the Millennium will not
be till then. Christ and Antichrist cannot reign upon Earth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
their Kingdoms are opposite, as Light to darkness. Besides,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:41970:200"/>
the Kingdom of Christ is universal, extends to all the Nations, and
leaves no room for other Kingdoms at that time. Thus it is describ'd
in <hi>Daniel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

Night visions, and behold, one like the Son of man, came with the Clouds
of Heaven, and came to the Ancient of days; And there was given him
dominion and glory,</hi> and a Kingdom; <hi>that all People, Nations, and
Language, should serve him.</hi> And again, ver. 27. <hi>And the Kingdom
and dominion and the greatness of the Kingdom under the whole heaven,
shall be given to the people of the Saints of the most High; whose King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is an everlasting Kingdom, and all dominion shall serve and obey him.</hi>
The same character<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of universality is given to the Kingdom of
Christ by <hi>David,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 2. &amp; Psal. 72.</note> 
                        <hi>Isaih,</hi> and other Prophets. But the most direct
proof of this,<note place="margin">Isa. 2. 2.</note> is from the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> where the <hi>Beast</hi> and <hi>false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
are thrown into the Lake of Fire and Brimstone, <hi>(Chap. 19. 20)</hi>
before the Millennium comes on: <hi>ch.</hi> 20. This, <hi>being cast into a Lake
of fire burning with brimstone,</hi> must needs signifie utter destruction.
Not a diminution of power only, but a total perdition and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.
And that this was before the Millennium, both the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the narration shows, and its place in the Prophecy; And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
because notice is taken, at the end of the Millennium, of the
Beast and false Prophet's being in the Lake of fire, as of a thing past,
and formerly transacted. For when Satan, at length, is thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the same Lake, 'tis said, He is thrown into the Lake of fire and
brimstone, <hi>where the Beast and false Prophet are: Apoc. 20. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>0.</hi> They
were there before, it seems; namely, at the beginning of the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennium;
land now at the conclusion of it, the Devil is thrown in
to them. Besides, the Ligation of Satan proves this point effectually.
For so long as Antichrist reigns, Satan cannot be said to be bound;
but he is bound at the beginning of the Millennium, therefore An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist's
reign was then totally expir'd. Lastly, the destruction of
<hi>Babylon,</hi> and the destruction of Antichrist go together: but you see
<hi>Babylon</hi> utterly and finally destroy'd, <hi>(Apoc. 18. and 19.)</hi> before the
Millennium comes on. I say <hi>utterly and finally destroy'd.</hi> For she is not
only said to be made an utter desolation, but to be consum'd by fire:
and absorpt as a Milstone thrown into the Sea: and that he shall be
found no more at all, <hi>Chap.</hi> 18. 21. Nothing can express a total and
universal destruction more effectually, or more emphatically. And
this is before the Millennium begins; as you may see both by the
order of the Prophecies, and particularly, in that upon this destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
the Hallelujah's are sung, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. and concluded thus, <hi>(ver.
6. 7.) Hallelujah, for the God omnipotent reigneth. Let us be glad and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
and give honour to him; for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and
his wife hath made her self ready.</hi> This, I suppose, every one allows to
be the Millennial state, which now approaches, and is making ready,
upon the destruction of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus much for the first part of our argument, That the Kingdom
of Christ will not take place, till the Kingdom of Antichrist be
wholly destroy'd. We are now to prove the second part: That the
Kingdom of Antichrist will not be wholly destroy'd till end of
the World, and the coming of our Saviour. This, one would think,
is sufficiently prov'd from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words alone, <hi>2 Thess. 2. 8. The
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:41970:200"/>
Lord shall consume the man of sin,</hi> who is suppos'd the same with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,
<hi>with the Spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy him with the
brightness of his coming.</hi> He will not then be destroy'd before the
coming of our Saviour: and that will not be till the end of the
World. For St. <hi>Peter</hi> says, <hi>Act. 3. 21. The Heaven must receive him,</hi>
speaking of Christ, <hi>until the times of restitution of all things:</hi> that is,
the renovation of the World. And if we consider that our Saviour's
coming will be in <hi>flames of fire,</hi> as the same Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us,
2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 7, 8. 'tis plain that his coming will not be till the Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration:
in which last flames Antichrist will be universally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd.
This manner of destruction agrees also with the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi>
and with <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the Prophets of the Old Testament. As to the
Apocalypse, <hi>Babylon,</hi> the seat of Antichrist, is represented there as
destroy'd by Fire, <hi>Chap. 18. 8, 18. Chap. 14. 11. Chap.</hi> 19. 3, 20. And
in <hi>Daniel,</hi> when the Beast is destroy'd, <hi>Chap. 7. 11. His body was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the burning flame.</hi> Then as to the other Prophets, they do
not, you know, speak of Antichrist or the Beast in terms: but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Types of <hi>Babylon, Tyre,</hi> and such like; and these places or
Princes are represented by them as to be destroy'd by fire, <hi>Isa. 13. 19.
Ier. 51. 25. Ezek.</hi> 28. 18.</p>
                     <p>So much for this third Argument. The fourth Argument is this:
The Future Kingdom of Christ will not be till the day of Judgment
and the Resurrection. But that will not be till the end of the World.
Therefore neither the Kingdom of Christ. By the day of Judgment
here I do not mean the final and universal Judgment: Nor by the
Resurrection, the final and universal Resurrection: for these will not
be till after the Millennium. But we understand here the first day of
Judgment and the first Resurrection, which will be at the end of this
present World; according as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> does distinguish them, in the
<hi>20th. Chap.</hi> of the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi> Now that the Millennium will not
be till the day of Judgment in this sence, we have both the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of <hi>Daniel</hi> and of S. <hi>Iohn.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ver. 9, &amp;c.</note> 
                        <hi>Daniel</hi> in the <hi>7th. Chap.</hi> supposes
the Beast to rule <hi>till judgment shall sit,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ver. 26, &amp;c.</note> and then <hi>they shall take away
his dominion,</hi> and it shall be given to the people of the Saints of the
most High. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> makes an explicite declaration of both these, in
his <hi>20th. Chap.</hi> of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> which is the great Directory in this
point of the Millennium; He says there were Thrones set, as for a
Judicature.<note place="margin">Ver. 4.</note> Then there was a Resurrection from the Dead: and
those that rise, reigned with Christ a Thousand years. Here's a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
Session, a Resurrection, and the reign of Christ joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
There is also another passage in S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> that joyns the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Dead with the Kingdom of Christ. 'Tis in the <hi>11th.
Chap.</hi> under the seventh Trumpet. The words are these, <hi>ver. 15. And
the seventh Angel sounded, and there were great voices in heaven, saying,
the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his
Christ: and he shall reign for ever and ever. And the four and twenty
Elders,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the
time of the Dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldst give
reward unto thy servants the Prophets, and to the Saints, and them that
fear thy name.</hi> Here are two things plainly express'd and link'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<hi>The judging of the Dead,</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom of Christ;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:41970:201"/>
the Prophets and Saints are rewarded. Now as the <hi>judging of
the Dead</hi> is not in this life, so neither is the reward of the Prophets
and Saints in this life: as we are taught sufficiently in the Gospel
and by the Apostles, <hi>Mat. 19. 28. 1 Thess. 1. 7. 2 Tim. 4. 8. 1 Pet. 1. 7.
and Ch. 5. 4.)</hi> Therefore the Reign and Kingdom of Christ which is
joyned with these two, cannot be in this life, or before the end of
the world. And as a further testimony and confirmation of this,
we may observe that S. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> hath joyn'd together these
three things; The <hi>appearance of Christ,</hi> the <hi>Reign of Christ,</hi> and the
<hi>judging of the Dead. I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord
Iesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead, at his appearing and
his Kingdom,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 1.</p>
                     <p>This might also be prov'd from the order, extent, and progress,
of the Prophecies of the <hi>Apocalypse;</hi> whereof some are such as reach
to the end of the World, and yet must be accomplish'd before the
Millennium begin: as the Vials. Others are so far already advanc'd
towards the end of the World, as to leave no room for a thousand
years reign; as the Trumpets. But because every one hath his own
interpretation of these Prophecies, and it would be tedious here to
prove any single Hypothesis in contradistinction to all the rest, we
will therefore leave this remark, to have more or less effect,
according to the minds it falls upon. And proceed to our fifth
Argument.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The <hi>New Ierusalem</hi>-state is the same with the Millennial
state: But the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> state will not be till the end of the
World, or till after the Conflagration: Therefore neither the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennium.
That the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi>-state is the same with the Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,
is agreed upon, I think, by all Millenaries, Ancient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern.
<hi>Iustin Martyr, Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> speak of it in that
sence; and so do the later Authors, so far as I have observ'd. And
St. <hi>Iohn</hi> seems to give them good authority for it. In the <hi>20th. Chap.</hi>
of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> he says, the <hi>Camp of the Saints,</hi> and <hi>the Beloved
City</hi> were besieg'd by Satan and his Gigantick crew at the end of
the Millennium. That <hi>Beloved City</hi> is the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> and you
see it is the same with the Camp of the Saints, or, at least, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
with it. Besides, the Marriage of the Lamb was in, or at
the appearance of the New Jerusalem, for that was the <hi>Spouse of
the Lamb, Apoc.</hi> 21. 2. Now this Spouse was ready, and this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
was said to be come, at the destruction of <hi>Babylon:</hi> which was
the beginning of the Millennium, <hi>Chap.</hi> 18. 7. Therefore the New
Jerusalem run all along with the Millennium, and was indeed
the same thing under another name. Lastly, What is this New
Jerusalem, if it be not the same with the Millennial state? It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
as a reward to the sufferers for Christ, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3. 12. and you
see its wonderful priviledges, <hi>Ch.</hi> 21. 3, 4. and yet it is not Heaven
and eternal Life; for it is said to come down from God out of
Heaven, <hi>Ch.</hi> 21. 2. and <hi>Ch.</hi> 3. 12. It can therefore be nothing but the
glorious Kingdom of Christ upon Earth, where the Saints shall reign
with him a Thousand Years.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="137" facs="tcp:41970:201"/>
Now as to the second part of our Argument, that the New Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem
will not come down from Heaven till the end of the World:
of this S. <hi>Iohn</hi> seems to give us a plain proof or demonstration: for
he places the New Jerusalem in the New Heavens and New Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which cannot be till after the Conflagration. Let us hear his words,
<hi>Apoc. 21. 1, 2. And I saw a New Heaven and a New Earth, for the first
heaven and the first earth were passed away, and there was no more sea.
And I Iohn saw the Holy City, New Ierusalem, coming down from God
out of Heaven: prepared as a Bride adorned for her husband.</hi> When
the New Earth was made, he sees the New Jerusalem coming down
upon it; and this Renovation of the Earth not being till the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration,
The New Jerusalem could not be till then, neither. The
Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> had long before said the same thing, though not in
terms so express;<note place="margin">Isa. 65. 17, 18.</note> He first says, <hi>Behold I create new heavens and a new
earth, wherein you shall rejoyce.</hi> Then subjoyns immediately, <hi>Behold,
I create Ierusalem a rejoycing.</hi> This rejoycing is still in the same place;
in the New Heavens and New Earth, or in the New Jerusalem.
And S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in a like method, first sets down the New Earth, then
the New Jerusalem; and expresses the mind of the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi>
more distinctly.</p>
                     <p>This leads me to a Sixth Argument to confirm our Conclusion.
The time of the <hi>Restitution</hi> or <hi>Restauration of all things,</hi> spoken of by
S. <hi>Peter</hi> and the Prophets, is the same with the Millennium: But that
Restauration will not be till the coming of Christ, and the end of
the World: Therefore neither the Millennium. That this Restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all things will not be till the coming of our Saviour, S. <hi>Peter</hi>
declares in his Sermon, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 21. and that the coming of our Saviour
will not be till the end of the World, or till the Conflagration,
both S. <hi>Paul</hi> and S. <hi>Peter</hi> signifie to us, 1 <hi>Thess. 1. 7, 8. 2 Pet.</hi> 3. 10.
Therefore it remains only to prove, that this Restitution of all things
spoken of here by the Apostle, is the same with the Millennium. I
know that which it does directly and immediately signifie, is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation
of the World: but it must include the Moral World as
well as the Natural: otherwise it cannot be truly said, as S. <hi>Peter</hi>
does there, that all the Prophets have spoken of it. And what is
the Renovation of the Natural and Moral World, but the New Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem
or the Millennium.</p>
                     <p>These Arguments, taken together, have, to me, an irresistible
evidence for the proof of our Conclusion; That the Blessed Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium
cannot obtain in the present Earth, or before the Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
But when Nature is renew'd, and the Saints and Martyrs rais'd
from the Dead, then they shall reign together with Christ, in the
New Heavens and New Earth, or in the New Jerusalem; Satan
being bound for a Thousand Years.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. IX. The chief employment of the Millennium, DEVOTION
and CONTEMPLATION.</head>
                     <p>WE have now done with the substance of our Discourse;
which is comprehended in these Three Propositions:
<list>
                           <item>I. After the Conflagration of this World, there will be New Heavens
and a New Earth: and That Earth will be inhabited.</item>
                           <item>II. That there is an happy Millennial state; Or a future Kingdom of
Christ and his Saints, prophesied of and promis'd in the Old and
New Testament: and receiv'd by the Primitive Church, as a
Christian and Catholick Doctrine.</item>
                           <item>III. That this blessed Millennial state, according as it is describ'd in
Scripture, cannot take place in the present Earth, nor under the
present constitution of Nature and Providence: But is to be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
in the New Heavens and New Earth, after the Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>These Three Propositions support this Work; and if any of them
be broken, I confess my design is broken, and this Treatise is of
no effect. But what remains to be spoken to in these last Chapters,
is more circumstantial or modal; and an error or mistake in such
things, does not wound any vital part of the Argument. You
must now therefore lay aside your severity, and rigorous censures;
we are very happy, if, in this Life, we can attain to the substance
of truth: and make rational conjectures concerning modes and
circumstances; where every one hath right to offer his sence, with
modesty and submission. Revelations made to us from Heaven in
this present state, are often incompleat, and do not tell us all: as if
it was on purpose to set our thoughts a-work to supply the rest;
which we may lawfully do, provided it be according to the analogy
of Scripture and Reason.</p>
                     <p>To proceed therefore; We suppose, as you see, the <hi>new Heavens</hi>
and the <hi>new Earth</hi> to be the seat of the <hi>Millennium:</hi> and that new
Creation to be <hi>Paradisiacal.</hi> Its Inhabitants also to be Righteous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
the Saints of the most High. And seeing the ordinary employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of our present Life, will then be needless and superseded, as
Military affairs, Sea-affairs, most Trades and Manufactures, Law,
Physick, and the laborious part of Agriculture: it may be wonder'd,
how this Happy People will bestow their time: What entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they will find in a state of so much ease, and so little action.
To this one might answer in short, by another question, <hi>How</hi> would
they have entertain'd themselves in Paradise, if Man had continued
in Innocency? This is a revolution of the same state, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:41970:202"/>
they may pass their time as well now as they could have done
then. But to answer more particularly, besides all innocent diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
ingenuous conversations, and entertainments of friendship,
the greatest part of their time will be spent in <hi>Devotion</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.</hi>
O happy employment, and next to that of Heaven it
self. What do the Saints above, but sing Praises unto God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
his Perfections. And how mean and despicable, for the
most part, are the employments of this present Life, if compar'd with
those Intellectual Actions. If Mankind was divided into ten parts,
nine of those ten employ their time to get bread to their belly, and
cloaths to their back; And what impertinences are these to a reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Soul, if she was free from the clog of a Mortal Body; or if that
could be provided for, without trouble or loss of time? Corporeal
Labour is from need and necessity, but intellectual exercises are mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of choice, that please and perfect at the same time.</p>
                     <p>Devotion warms and opens the Soul, and disposes it to receive
Divine Influences. It sometimes raises the mind into an heavenly
ecstasie, and fills it with a joy that is not to be exprest. When it is
pure, it leaves a strong impression upon the heart, of Love to God;
and inspires us with a contempt of this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> World, having tasted the
pleasures of the World to come. In the state which we speak of,
seeing the <hi>Tabernacle of God will be with men,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Apoc. 21. 3.</note> we may reasonably sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that there will be greater effusions and irradiations of the Holy
Spirit, than we have or can expect in this region of darkness: and
consequently, all the strength and comfort that can arise from private
devotion.</p>
                     <p>And as to their publick Devotions, all beauties of Holiness, all
perfection of Divine Worship, will shine in their Assemblies. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
<hi>David</hi> says of <hi>Sion</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 84.</note> are but shadows of this <hi>New
Ierusalem,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 87.</note> and of the glory that will be in those Solemnities. Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
what a Congregation will be there of Patriarchs, Prophets,
Apostles, Christian Martyrs, and Saints of the first rank, throughout
all Ages. And these all known to one another by their Names and
History. This very meeting together of such Persons, must needs
create a joy unspeakable: But when they unite in their praises to
God and to the Lamb, with pure hearts full of divine Love: when
they sing their Hallelujahs to him that sits upon the Throne, that
hath wash'd them in his blood, and redeem'd them out of every
Kingdom, and Tongue and People, and Nation. When, with their
Palms in their hands, they triumph over Sin, and Death, and Hell,
and all the Powers of Darkness: can there be any thing, on this
side Heaven, and a Quire of Angels, more glorious or more joyful?</p>
                     <p>But why did I except Angels? Why may not they be thought to
be present at these Assemblies? In a Society of Saints and purified
Spirits, Why should we think their converse impossible? In the
Golden Age, the Gods were always represented, as having freer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse
with Men; and before the Flood, we may reasonably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it so. I cannot think, <hi>Enoch</hi> was translated into Heaven with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any converse with its Inhabitants before he went thither. And
seeing the Angels vouchsaf'd often, in former Ages, to visit the
Patriarchs upon Earth, we may with reason judge, that they will
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:41970:203"/>
much more converse with the same Patriarchs and holy Prophets,
now they are risen from the Dead, and cleans'd from their sins, and
seated in the <hi>New Ierusalem.</hi> I cannot but call to mind upon this
occasion, That representation which S. <hi>Paul</hi> makes to us, of a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
state and a glorious Assembly, too high for this present Earth:
'Tis <hi>Hebr. 12. 22, &amp;c.</hi> in these words: <hi>But you are come unto Mount
Sion, and unto the City of the living God, the heavenly Ierusalem, and
to an innumerable company of Angels; to the general Assembly and Church
of the First-born, which are written in Heaven; and to God the Iudge
of all, and to the Spirits of just men made perfect.</hi> This, I know, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
apply to the Times and state of the Gospel, in opposition to
that of the Law; and it is introduc'd in that manner; But here are
several expressions too high for any present state of things; They
must respect a future state, either of Heaven, or of the Millennial
Kingdom of Christ. And to the later of these the expressions agree,
and have a peculiar fitness and applicability to it. And what follows
in the context, <hi>ver. 26, 27, 28. About shaking the Heavens and the Earth
once more:</hi> Removing the former Scenes, and bringing on a New
Kingdom that cannot be shaken: All this, I say, answers to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Christ, which is to be establish'd in the New Heavens and
New Earth.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed in their Publick Devotions; Suppose this August
Assembly, inflam'd with all Divine Passions, met together to celebrate
the Name of God; with Angels intermixt, to bear a part in this
Holy Exercise. And let this concourse be, not in any Temple made
with hands, but under the great roof of Heaven, (the True Temple
of the most High,) so as all the Air may be fill'd with the chearful
harmony of their Hymns and Hallelujahs. Then, in the heighth of
their Devotion, as they sing Praises to the Lamb, and to Him that
sits upon the Throne, suppose the Heavens to open, and the Son
of God to appear in his glory,<note place="margin">Apoc. 5. 11.</note> with Thousands and Ten Thousands
of Angels round about him; That their eyes may see him, who,
for their sakes, was crucified upon Earth, now encircled with Light
and Majesty. This will raise them into as great transports as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature can bear: They will wish to be dissolv'd, they will strive
to fly up to him in the clouds, or to breath out their Souls in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
doxologles of <hi>Blessing,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">ch. 5. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>and honour, and glory, and power, to him
that sits upon the Throne, and to the Lamb, for ever and ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But we cannot live always in the flames of Devotion. The weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our Nature will not suffer us to continue long under such
strong Passions, and such intenseness of Mind. The question is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
What will be the ordinary employment of that Life? How
will they entertain their thoughts, or spend their time? For we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
they will not have that multiplicity of frivolous business that we
have now: About our Bodies, about our Children: in Trades
and Mechanicks: in Traffick and Navigation: or Wars by Sea or
Land. These things being swept away, wholly or in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
what will come in their place? how will they find work or
entertainment for a long life? If, we consider, who they are that
will have a part in this first Resurrection, and be Inhabitants of that
World that is to come, we may easily believe that the most constant
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:41970:203"/>
employment of their life will be CONTEMPLATION. Not that I
exclude any innocent diversions, as I said before: The entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of friendship, or ingenuous conversation, but the great busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and design of that life is Contemplation: as preparatory to
Heaven and eternal Glory.<note place="margin">L. 5. c. 32.</note> 
                        <hi>Ui paulatim assuescant capere Deum,</hi> as
<hi>Irenaeus</hi> says: That they may, by degrees, enlarge their capacities,
fit and <hi>accustom themselves to receive God.</hi> Or, as he says in another
place, <hi>That they may become capable of the glory of the Father,</hi> that is,
capable of bearing the glory and presence of God: capable of the
highest enjoyment of him, which is usually call'd the <hi>Beatifical Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;</hi>
and is the condition of the Blessed in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>It cannot be deny'd, that in such a Millennial state, where we
shall be freed from all the incumbrances of this life, and provided
of better Bodies and greater light of Mind: It cannot be doubted, I
say, but that we shall then be in a disposition to make great profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
in the knowledge of all things, Divine and Intellectual: and
consequently of making happy preparations for our entring upon a
further state of glory. For there is nothing certainly does more
prepare the mind of man for the highest perfections, than Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation:
with that Devotion which naturally flows from it, as heat
follows light. And this Contemplation hath always a greater or less
effect upon the mind according to the perfection of its object. So as
the Contemplation of the Divine Nature, is, of all others, the most
perfective in it self, and to us, according to our capacities and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of abstraction. An <hi>Immense Being</hi> does strangely fill the Soul:
and Omnipotency, Omnisciency, and Infinite Goodness, do enlarge
and dilate the Spirit, while it fixtly looks upon them. They raise
strong passions of Love and Admiration, which melt our Nature,
and transform it into the mould and image of that which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template.
What the Scripture says of our <hi>Transformation</hi> into the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
likeness: what S. <hi>Iohn</hi> and the <hi>Platonists</hi> say of our <hi>Union</hi> with
God. And whatever is not Cant in the <hi>Mystical Theology,</hi> when they
tell us of being Deified; all this must spring from these sources of
Devotion and Contemplation. They will change and raise us from
perfection to perfection, as from glory to glory: into a greater simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
and nearer station to the Divine Nature.</p>
                     <p>The Contemplation of God and his Works, comprehends all
things. For, the one makes the uncreated World, and the other
the Created. And as the Divine Essence and Attributes are the
greatest object that the mind of man can set before it self; so next
to that are the effects and emanations of the Divinity, or the Works
of the Divine Goodness, Wisdom, and Power, in the Created World.
This hath a vast extent and variety, and would be sufficient to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their time, in that happy state, much longer than a thousand
years. As you will easily grant, if you allow me but to point at the
several heads of those Speculations.</p>
                     <p>The Contemplation of the <hi>Created World</hi> divides it self into three
parts, that of the <hi>Intellectual</hi> World: that of the <hi>Corporal:</hi> And the
Government and Administration of both, which is usually call'd
<hi>Providence.</hi> These three, drawn into one thought, with the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and proportions that result from them, compose that <hi>GRAND
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:41970:204"/>
IDEA,</hi> which is the treasury and comprehension of all Knowledge.
Whereof we have spoken more largely in the last Chapter of the
Second Book of this <hi>Theory,</hi> under the name of the <hi>Mundane Idea.</hi>
But at present we shall only mention such particulars, as may be
thought proper subjects for the meditations and enquiries of those
who shall enjoy that happy state which we now treat of.</p>
                     <p>As to the Intellectual World, excepting our own Souls, we know
little, in this region of darkness where we are at present, more than
bare names. We hear of Angels and Archangels, of Cherubins and
Seraphins, of Principalities and Powers and Thrones and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
We hear the sound of these words with admiration, but we
know little of their natures; wherein their general notion, and
wherein their distinction, consists: what peculiar excellencies they
have, what offices and employments: of all this we are ignorant.
Only in general, we cannot but suppose that there are more orders
and degrees of Intellectual Beings, betwixt us and the Almighty,
than there are kinds or species of living Creatures upon the face of
the Earth: betwixt Man, their Lord and Master, and the least worm
that creeps upon the ground. Nay, than there are Stars in Heaven,
or Sands upon the Sea-shore. For there is an infinite distance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval
betwixt us and God Almighty: and all that, is fill'd with
created Beings of different degrees of perfection, still approaching
nearer and nearer to their Maker. And when this invisible World
shall be open'd to us: when the Curtain is drawn, and the Celestial
Hierarchy set in order before our eyes, we shall despise our selves,
and all the petty glories of a mortal life, as the dirt under our
feet.</p>
                     <p>As to the Corporeal Universe, we have some share already in the
Contemplation and knowledge of that: tho' little in comparison of
what will be then discover'd. The doctrine of the Heavens, fix'd
Stars, Planets and Comets, both as to their matter, motion and
form, will be then clearly demonstrated: and what are mysteries to
us now, will become matter of ordinary conversation. We shall
be better acquainted with our neighbouring Worlds, and make
new discoveries as to the state of their affairs. The Sun especially,
the Great Monarch of the Planetary Worlds: whose Dominion
reaches from Pole to Pole, and the greatness of his Kingdom is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the whole Heaven. Who sends his bright Messengers every day
through all the regions of his vast Empire; throwing his beams of
light round about him, swifter and further than a thought can fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
This noble Creature, I say, will make a good part of their
study in the succeeding World. <hi>Eudoxus</hi> the Philosopher, wish'd
he might die like <hi>Phaeton,</hi> in approaching too near to the Sun; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
he could fly so near it, and endure it so long, till he had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
its beauty and perfection. VVho can blame his curiosity:
who would not venture far to see the Court of so great a Prince:
who hath more VVorlds under his command than the Emperors of
the Earth have Provinces or Principalities. Neither does he make
his Subjects slaves to his pleasure, or tributaries to serve and supply
his wants; on the contrary, They live upon him, he nourishes and
preserves them: gives them fruits every year, corn, and wine, and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:41970:204"/>
all the comforts of life. This glorious Body, which now we can
only gaze upon and admire, will be then better understood. A mass
of Light and Flame, and Ethereal matter, ten thousand times big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than this Earth: Enlightning and enlivening an Orb that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
the bulk of our Globe, as much as that does the least sand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Sea-shore, may reasonably be presum'd to have some great
Being at the Centre of it. But what that is, we must leave to the
enquiries of another life.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Theory of the Earth</hi> will be a common lession there: carried
through all its vicissitudes and periods from first to last, till its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
revolution be accomplish'd. I told you in the Preface, The <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution
of World</hi> was one of the greatest Speculations that we are
capable of in this life: and this little World where we are, will be
the first and easiest instance of it; seeing we have Records, Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
or Prophetical, that reach from the Chaos to the end of the new
Heavens and new Earth: which course of time makes up the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part of the Circle or Revolution. And as what was before the
Chaos, was but, in my opinion, the first remove from a Fixt Star,
so what is after the thousand years Renovation, is but the last step
to it again.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Theory of humane Nature</hi> is also an useful and necessary spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
and will be carried on to perfection in that state. Having
fixt the true distinction betwixt Matter and Spirit, betwixt the
Soul and the Body, and the true nature and laws of their union:
The original contract, and the terms ratified by Providence at their
first conjunction: It will not be hard to discover the springs of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and passion: how the thoughts of our mind, and the motions of
our body act in dependance one upon another. What are the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
differences of Genius's and complexions, and how our Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuals
or Morals depend upon them. What is the Root of Fatality,
and how far it extends. By these lights, they will see into their
own and every Man's breast, and trace the foot-steps of the Divine
wisdom in that strange composition of Soul and Body.</p>
                     <p>This indeed is a mixt speculation, as most others are: and takes
in something of both Worlds, Intellectual and Corporeal: and may
also belong in part to the Third Head we mention'd, <hi>Providence.</hi>
But there is no need of distinguishing these Heads so nicely, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
we take in, under some or other of them, what may be thought
best to deserve our knowledge, now, or in another World. As to
<hi>Providence,</hi> what we intend chiefly by it here, is the general oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy
of our Religion, and what is reveal'd to us in Scripture, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
God, Angels, and Mankind. These Revelations, as most
in Sacred Writ, are short and incompleat: as being design'd for pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
more than for speculation, or to awaken and excite our
thoughts, rather than to satisfie them. Accordingly we read in
Scripture of a Triune Deity: of God made flesh, in the Womb of a
Virgin: Barbarously crucified by the <hi>Iews:</hi> Descending into Hell:
rising again from the Dead: visibly ascending into Heaven: And sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
at the right hand of God the Father, above Angels and Arch-Angels.
These great things are imperfectly reveal'd to us in this life;
which we are to believe so far as they are reveal'd: In hopes these
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:41970:205"/>
mysteries will be made more intelligible, in that happy state to
come, where Prophets, Apostles, and Angels, will meet in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
together.</p>
                     <p>In like manner,<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 16.</note> how little is it we understand concerning the
<hi>Holy Ghost.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 2.</note> That he descended like a <hi>Dove</hi> upon our Saviour: Like
cloven Tongues of fire upon the Apostles;<note place="margin">Matt. 1. 18.</note> The Place being fill'd
with a rushing mighty Wind:<note place="margin">Luk. 1. 35.</note> That he over-shadowed the Blessed
Virgin, and begot the Holy Infant. That He made the Apostles
speak all sort of Tongues and Languages <hi>ex tempore,</hi> and pour'd out
strange Vertues and Miraculous Gifts upon the Primitive Christians.
These things we know as bare matter of fact, but the method of
these operations we do not at all understand. Who can tell us now,
what that is which we call <hi>INSPIRATION?</hi> VVhat change is
wrought in the Brain, and what in the Soul: and how the effect
follows? VVho will give us the just definition of a <hi>Miracle?</hi> VVhat
the proximate Agent is above Man, and whether they are all from
the same power? How the manner and process of those miraculous
changes in matter, may be conceiv'd? These things we see darkly,
and hope they will be set in a clearer light, and the Doctrines of our
Religion more fully expounded to us, in that Future VVorld. For
as several things obscurely exprest in the Old Testament, are more
clearly reveal'd in the New; So the same mysteries, in a succeeding
state, may still receive a further explication.</p>
                     <p>The History of the Angels, Good or bad, makes another part of
this Providential Systeme. Christian Religion gives us some notices,
of both kinds, but very imperfect; VVhat interest the Good Angels
have in the Government of the VVorld, and in ordering the affairs
of this Earth and Mankind: What subjection they have to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
and what part in his Ministry: Whether they are Guardians
to particular Persons, to Kingdoms, to Empires; All that we know
at present, concerning these things, is but conectural. And as to
the bad Angels, who will give us an account of their Fall, and of
their former condition? I had rather know the History of <hi>Lucifer,</hi>
than of all the <hi>Babylonian</hi> and <hi>Persian</hi> Kings; Nay, than of all the
Kings of the Earth. What the Birth-right was of that mighty Prince:
what his Dominions: where his Imperial Court and Residence?
How he was depos'd: for what Crime, and by what Power? How
he still wages War against Heaven, in his exile: What Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
he hath: What is his Power over Mankind, and how limited?
What change or damage he suffer'd by the coming of Christ, and
how it alter'd the posture of his affairs. Where he will be impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd
in the <hi>Millennium:</hi> and what will be his last fate and final
doom: whether he may ever hope for a Revolution or Restaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
These things lie hid in the secret Records of Providence, which
then, I hope, will be open'd to us.</p>
                     <p>With the Revolution of <hi>Worlds,</hi> we mention'd before the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Souls;</hi> which is another great Circle of Providence, to be
studied hereafter. We know little here, either of the pre-existence
or post-existence of our Souls. VVe know not what they will be,
till the loud Trump awakes us, and calls us again into the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
VVorld. VVho knows how many turns he shall take upon this
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41970:205"/>
stage of the Earth, and how many trials he shall have, before his
doom will be finally concluded. Who knows where, or what, is
the state of Hell: where the Souls of the wicked are said to be for
ever. What is the true state of Heaven: What our Celestial Bodies:
and What that Sovereign Happiness that is call'd the <hi>Beatifical Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion?</hi>
Our knowledge and conceptions of these things, are, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
very general and superficial; but in the future Kingdom of
Christ, which is introductory to Heaven it self, these imperfections,
in a great measure, will be done away; and such preparations wrought,
both in the Will and Understanding, as may fit us for the Life of
Angels, and the enjoyment of God in Eternal Glory.</p>
                     <p>Thus you see in general, what will be the employment of the
Saints in the blessed <hi>Millennium.</hi> And tho' they have few of the
trifling businesses of this life, they will not want the best and noblest
of diversions. 'Tis an happy thing when a Man's pleasure is also his
perfection: for most Men's pleasures are such as debase their nature.
We commonly gratifie our lower faculties, our Passions, and our
Appetites: and these do not improve, but depress the Mind. And
besides, they are so gross, that the finest tempers are surfeited in a
little time. There is no lasting pleasure, but <hi>Contemplation.</hi> All
others grow flat and insipid upon frequent use; and when a Man
hath run thorow a Sett of Vanities, in the declension of his Age, he
knows not what to do with himself, if he cannot Think. He saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
about, from one dull business to another, to wear out time: And
hath no reason to value Life, but because he's afraid of Death. But
Contemplation is a continual spring of fresh pleasures. Truth is
inexhausted, and when you are once in the right way, the further
you go, the greater discoveries you make, and with the greater joy.
We are sometimes highly pleas'd, and even transported, with little
inventions in Mathematicks, or Mechanicks, or Natural Philosophy;
All these things will make part of their diversion and entertainment
in that state; All the doctrine of Sounds and Harmony: Of Light,
Colours, and Perspective, will be known in perfection. But these
I call Diversions, in comparison of their higher and more serious Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations,
which will be the business and happiness of that Life.</p>
                     <p>Do but imagine, that they will have the Scheme of all humane
affairs lying before them: from the Chaos to the last period. The
universal history and order of Times. The whole oeconomy of the
Christian Religion, and of all Religions in the World. The Plan
of the undertaking of the Messiah: with all other parts and ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients
of the Providence of this Earth. Do but imagine this, I say,
and you will easily allow, that when they contemplate the Beauty,
Wisdom, and Goodness, of the whole design, it must needs raise
great and noble Passions, and a far richer joy than either the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
or speculations of this Life can excite in us. And this being
the last Act and close of all humane affairs, it ought to be the more
exquisite and elaborate: that it may crown the work, satisfie the
Spectators, and end in a general applause. The whole Theatre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sounding
with the praises of the great Dramatist, and the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Art and Order of the composition.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. X. Objections against the Millennium, answer'd. With some
Conjectures concerning the state of things after the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennium:
and what will be the final Consummation of
this World.</head>
                     <p>YOU see how Nature and Providence have conspir'd, to make
the <hi>Millennium</hi> as happy a state, as any Terrestrial state can
be. For, besides Health and Plenty: Peace, Truth, and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
will flourish there, and all the evils of this Life stand excluded.
There will be no Ambitious Princes, studying mischief one against
another; or contriving methods to bring their own Subjects into sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.
No mercenary Statesmen, to assist and intrigue with them. No
oppression from the Powerful, no snares or traps laid for the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.
No treacherous Friends, no malicious Enemies. No Knaves,
Cheats, Hypocrites; the Vermin of this Earth, that swarm every
where. There will be nothing but Truth, Candor, Sincerity, and
Ingenuity: as in a Society or Commonwealth of Saints and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.
In a word, 'twill be <hi>Paradise restor'd:</hi> both as to Innocency
of Temper, and the Beauties of Nature.</p>
                     <p>I believe you will be apt to say, If this be not True, 'tis pity but
that it should be True. For 'tis a very desirable state, where all good
People would find themselves mightily at ease. What is it that
hinders it then? It must be some ill <hi>Genius.</hi> For Nature tends to
such a Renovation, as we suppose: and Scripture speaks loudly of
an happy state to be, some time or other, on this side Heaven.
And what is there, pray, in this present World, Natural or Moral,
if I may ask with reverence, that could make it worth the while
for God to create it, if it never was better, nor ever will be better?
Is there not more Misery than Happiness: Is there not more Vice
than Virtue, in this World? as if it had been made by a <hi>Manichean</hi>
God. The Earth barren, the Heavens inconstant: Men wicked and
God offended. This is the posture of our Affairs: such hath our
World been hitherto: with W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rs and Bloudshed, Sickness and
Diseases, Poverty, servitude and perpetual Drudgery for the necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of a Mortal Life. We may therefore reasonably hope, from a
God infinitely good and powerful, for better Times and a better State,
before the last period and consummation of all things.</p>
                     <p>But it will be objected, it may be, that, according to Scripture,
the vices and wickedness of Men will continue to the end of the
World; and so there will be no room for such an happy state, as
we hope for.<note place="margin">Luk. 18. 8.</note> Our Saviour says, <hi>When the son of man cometh, shall he
find faith upon the Earth?</hi> They shall <hi>eat and drink and play,</hi> as before
the destruction of the <hi>old World,</hi> or of <hi>Sodom, (Luk. 17. 26, &amp;c.)</hi> and
the wickedness of those Men, you know, continued to the last.
This objection may pinch those that suppose the Millennium to be
in the present Earth, and a thousand years before the coming of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:41970:206"/>
our Saviour: for his words seem to imply that the World will be in
a state of wickedness even till his coming. Accordingty Antichrist
or the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> is not said to be destroy'd till the coming of our
Saviour, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 8. and till he be destroy'd, we cannot hope for a
Millennium. Lastly, The coming of our Saviour is always represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in Scripture as sudden, surprising and unexpected. As <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
breaking suddenly out of the clouds, <hi>(Luk.</hi> 17. 24. and <hi>ch. 21.
34, 35)</hi> or as a <hi>thief in the night, 1 Thess. 5. 2, 3, 4. 2 Pet. 3. 10. Apoc.</hi>
16. 15. But if there be such a forerunner of it as the Millennial
state, whose bounds we know, according as that expires and draws
to an end, Men will be certainly advertis'd of the approaching of
our Saviour. But this objection, as I told you, does not affect our
Hypothesis, for we suppose the Millennium will not be till after the
coming of our Saviour, and the Conflagration. And also that his
coming will be sudden and surprising: and that Antichrist will
continue in being, tho' not in the same degree of power, till that
time. So that they that place the Millennium in the present Earth,
are chiefly concern'd to answer this first objection.</p>
                     <p>But you will object, it may be, in the second place, That this
Millennium, wheresoever it is, would degenerate at length, into sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality,
and a Mahometan Paradise. For where there are earthly
pleasures and earthly appetites, they will not be kept always in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
without any excess or luxuriancy: especially as to the senses of
Touch and Taste. I am apt to think this is true, if the Soul have no
more power over the Body than she hath at present: and our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Passions, and Appetites be as strong as they are now. But ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our explication of the Millennium, we have great reason
to hope, that the Soul will have a greater dominion over the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection-body,
than she hath over this. And you know we suppose
that none will truly inherit the Millennium, but those that rise
from the Dead. Nor do we admit any propagation there, nor the
trouble or weakness of Infants. But that all rise in a perfect age,
and never die: being translated, at the final judgment, to meet our
Saviour in the clouds, and to be with him for ever. Thus we easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
avoid the force of this objection. But those that place the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennium
in this Life, and to be enjoy'd in these Bodies, must find
out some new preservatives against vice: otherwise they will be
continually subject to degeneracy.</p>
                     <p>Another objection may be taken from the personal Reign of Christ
upon Earth: which is a thing incongruous, and yet asserted by
many modern Millenaries. That Christ should leave that right
hand of his Father, to come and pass a thousand years here below:
living upon Earth in an heavenly Body: This, I confess, is a thing
I never could digest, and therefore I am not concern'd in this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection;
not thinking it necessary that Christ should be personally
present and resident upon Earth in the Millennium. I am apt to
believe that there will be then a Celestial Presence or Christ, or a <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinah,</hi>
as we noted before: As the Sun is present to the Earth, yet
never leaves its place in the Firmament; so Christ may be visibly
conspicuous in his Heavenly Throne,<note place="margin">Act. 7. 55, 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> as he was to S. <hi>Stephen:</hi> and
yet never leave the right hand of his Father. And this would be a
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:41970:207"/>
more glorious and illustrious presence, than if he should descend,
and converse amongst Men in a personal shape. But these things not
being distinctly reveal'd to us, we ought not to determine any thing
concerning them, but with modesty and submission.</p>
                     <p>We have thus far pretty well escap'd, and kept our selves out of
the reach of the ordinary objections against the Millennium. But
there remains one, concerning a <hi>double Resurrection,</hi> which must fall
upon every Hypothesis: and 'tis this. The Scripture, they say,
speaks but of one Resurrection: whereas the doctrine of the Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium
supposes two; one at the beginning of the Millennium, for the
Martyrs, and those that enjoy that happy state, and the other at the
end of it; which is universal and final, in the last day of judgment.
'Tis true, Scripture generally speaks of the Resurrection in gross:
without distinguishing first and second; and so it speaks of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of our Saviour, without distinction of first or second; yet it
does not follow from that, that there is but one Coming of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour:
so neither that there is but one Resurrection. And seeing
there is one place of Scripture that speaks distinctly of two Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
namely, the <hi>20th chap.</hi> of the <hi>Apocalypse:</hi> that is to us a
sufficient warrant for asserting two. As there are some things in
one Evangelist that are not in another, yet we think them Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
if they be but in one. There are also some things in <hi>Daniel,</hi>
concerning the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and concerning the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> that are
not in the rest of the Prophets: yet we look upon his single testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
as good authority. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> writ the last of all the Apostles:
and as the whole series of his Prophecies is new, reaching through
the later times to the Consummation of all things; so we cannot
wonder if he had something more particular reveal'd to him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Resurrection; That which was spoken of before in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
being distinguish'd now into <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Second,</hi> or particular and
universal,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Mede.</hi>
                        </note> in this last Prophet. Some think S. <hi>Paul</hi> means no less,
when he makes an <hi>order</hi> in the Resurrection: some rising sooner,
some later: <hi>1 Cor. 15. 23, 24. 1 Thess. 4. 14, 15, &amp;c.</hi> but whether that
be so or no, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> might have a more distinct revelation concerning
it, than S. <hi>Paul</hi> had, or any one before him.</p>
                     <p>After these Objections, a great many Queries and difficulties
might be propos'd relating to the Millennium. But that's no more
than what is found in all other matters, remote from our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
Who can answer all the Queries that may be made concerning
<hi>Heaven,</hi> or <hi>Hell,</hi> or <hi>Paradise?</hi> When we know a thing as to the
substance, we are not to let go our hold, tho' there remain some
difficulties unresolv'd: otherwise we should be eternally Sceptical in
most matters of Knowledge. Therefore, tho' we cannot, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
give a full account of the distinction of habitations and inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
in the <hi>Future Earth:</hi> or, of the order of the <hi>First Resurrection;</hi>
whether it be performed by degrees and successively, or all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the New Jerusalem rise at once, and continue through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole Millennium. I say, tho' we cannot give a distinct ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of these, or such like particulars, we ought not therefore to
deny or doubt whether there will be a <hi>New Earth,</hi> or a <hi>First Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi>
For the Revelation goes clearly so far: and the obscurity is
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:41970:207"/>
only in the consequences and dependances of it. Which Providence
thought fit, without further light, to leave to our search and disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
                     <p>Scripture mentions one thing, at the end of the Millennium,
which is a common difficulty to all; and every one must contribute
their best thoughts and conjectures towards the solution of it. 'Tis
the strange doctrine of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Apoc. 20. 8, 9.</note> which are to rise up in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
against the Saints, and besiege the holy City, and the holy
Camp. And this is to be upon the expiration of the thousand years,
when Satan is loosen'd. For no sooner will his Chains be knock'd
off, but he will put himself in the head of this Army of Gyants, or
Sons of the Earth, and attack Heaven, and the Saints of the most
High. But with ill success, for there will come down fire and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
from Heaven, and consume them. This, methinks, hath a great
affinity with the History of the Gyants, rebelling and assaulting
Heaven and struck down by thunder-bolts. But that of setting moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
upon mountains, or tossing them into the Skie, that's the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etical
part, and we must not expect to find it in the Prophecy. The
Poets told their Fable, as of a thing past, and so it was a Fable;
But the Prophets speak of it, as of a thing to come, and so it will
be a reality. But how and in what sence it is to be understood and
explain'd, every one has the liberty to make the best judgment he
can.</p>

exemplified, no more than his Temple. And seeing this People is
to be at the end of the <hi>Millennium,</hi> and in the same Earth with it,
We must, according to our Hypothesis, plant them in the Future
Earth; and therefore all former conjectures about the <hi>Turks,</hi> or <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
or other <hi>Barbarians,</hi> are out of doors with us, seeing the
Scene of this action does not lie in the present Earth. They are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
represented by the Prophet, as a People distinct and separate from
the Saints, not in their manners only, but also in their seats and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations;<note place="margin">Apoc. 20. 8, 9</note>
For they are said to come up from the four corners of
the Earth, upon the breadth of the Earth: and there to besiege the
<hi>Camp of the Saints and the beloved City:</hi> This makes it seem probable
to me, that there will be a double race of Mankind in that <hi>Future
Earth:</hi> very different one from another, both as to their temper and
disposition, and as to their origine. The one born from Heaven,
Sons of God, and of the Resurrection: who are the true Saints and
heirs of the <hi>Millennium.</hi> The others born of the Earth, Sons of the
Earth, generated from the slime of the ground, and the heat of the
Sun, as brute Creatures were at first. This second Progeny or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of Men in the Future Earth, I understand to be signified by
the Prophet under these borrowed or feigned names of <hi>Gog</hi> and
<hi>Magog.</hi> And this Earth-born race, encreasing and multiplying after
the manner of Men, by carnal propagation, after a thousand years,
grew numerous, as the Sand by the Sea; and thereupon made an
irruption or inundation upon the face of the Earth, and upon the
habitations of the Saints; As the barbarous Nations did formerly
upon Christendom: Or as the Gyants are said to have made War
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41970:208"/>
against the Gods. But they were soon confounded in their impious
and sacrilegious design, being struck and consum'd by fire from
Heaven.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Some will think, it may be, that there was such a double race of
Mankind in the first VVorld also.</hi> The Sons of Adam, and the Sons of
God: <hi>because it is said,</hi> Gen. 6. When men began to multiply upon the
face of the Earth, <hi>that</hi> the SONS OF GOD SAW THE DAUGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERS
OF MEN, that they were fair, and they took them Wives of all
that they lik'd. <hi>And it is added presently,</hi> ver. 4. There were Gyants in
the Earth in those days; and also after that, when the Sons of God came
in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them: the same
became mighty men, which were of old men of renown. <hi>Here seem to be
two or three orders or races in this Ante-diluvian VVorld.</hi> The
Sons of God: The Sons and Daughters of Adam: <hi>and a third sort ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
from the mixture and copulation of these, which are call'd</hi>
Mighty men of old, <hi>or Hero's. Besides, here are Gyants mention'd,
and to which they are to be reduc'd, it does not certainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This mixture of these two Races, whatsoever they were, gave,
it seems, so great offence to God, that he destroy'd that World
upon it, in a Deluge of Water. It hath been matter of great
difficulty to determine, who these <hi>Sons of God</hi> were, that fell in
love with and married the daughters of men. There are two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures
that prevail most: One, that they were Angels: and another,
that they were of the Posterity of <hi>Seth,</hi> and distinguish'd from the
rest, by their Piety, and the worship of the true God: so that it
was a great crime for them to mingle with the rest of mankind, who
are suppos'd to have been Idolaters. Neither of these opinions is to
me satisfactory. For as to Angels; Good Angels neither <hi>marry, nor
are given in marriage; Matt.</hi> 22. 30. and bad Angels are not call'd
the <hi>Sons of God.</hi> Besides, if Angels were capable of those mean plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
we ought in reason to suppose, that there are female Angels,
as well as male; for surely those capacities are not in vain through
a whole <hi>Species</hi> of Beings. And if there be female Angels, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
imagine, but that they must be of a far more charming beauty
than the dowdy daughters of men. Then as to the line of <hi>Seth,</hi> It
does not appear that there was any such distinction of Idolaters and
true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Worshippers before the Flood, or that there was any such
thing, as Idolatry, at that time: nor for some Ages after. Besides,
it is not said, that the Sons of God fell in love with the Daughters of
<hi>Cain,</hi> or of any degenerate race, but with the Daughters of <hi>Adam:</hi>
which may be the Daughters of <hi>Seth,</hi> as well as of any other. These
conjectures therefore seem to be shallow and ill-grounded. But what
the distinction was of those two orders, remains yet very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Galatians, (Chap. 4. 21, 22, &amp;c.)</hi> makes a distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
also of a double Progeny: that of <hi>Sarah,</hi> and that of <hi>Hagar.</hi> One
was born according to the flesh, after a natural manner: and the
other by the divine power, or in vertue of the divine promise. This
distinction of a natural and supernatural origine, and of a double
progeny: the one born to servitude, the other to liberty: represents
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:41970:208"/>
very well either the manner of our present birth, and of our future,
at the Resurrection: Or that double progeny and double manner of
birth, which we suppose in the <hi>Future Earth.</hi> 'Tis true, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
this to the Law and the Gospel; but Typical things, you know,
have different aspects and completions: which are not exclusive of
one another: and so it may be here. But however this double race
of Mankind in the Future Earth, to explain the Doctrine of <hi>Gog</hi>
and <hi>Magog,</hi> is but a conjecture: and does not pretend to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
consider'd.</p>
                     <p>The last thing that remains to be consider'd and accounted for, is
the upshot and conclusion of all: namely, what will become of the
Earth after the thousand years expir'd? Or after the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
past, and the Saints translated into Heaven, what will be the
face of things here below? There being nothing expresly reveal'd
concerning this, we must not expect a positive resolution of it. And
the difficulty is not peculiar to our hypothesis: for though the <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennium,</hi>
and the final Judgment were concluded in the present
Earth, the Quaere would still remain, <hi>What</hi> would become of this
Earth after the Last Day. So that all parties are equally concern'd,
and equally free, to give their opinion, <hi>What</hi> will be the <hi>last state
and Consummation</hi> of this Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Scripture, I told you, hath not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
this point: and the Philosophers say very little concerning it.
The Stoicks indeed speak of the final resolution of all things into
<hi>Fire,</hi> or into <hi>Aether:</hi> which is the purest and subtlest sort of fire.
So that the whole Globe or Mass of the Earth, and all particular
bodies, will, according to them, be at last dissolv'd into a liquid
flame. Neither was this Doctrine first invented by the Stoicks: <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclitus</hi>
taught it long before them: and I take it to be as ancient as
<hi>Orpheus</hi> himself: who was the first Philosopher amongst the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
And he deriving his notions from the <hi>Barbarick</hi> Philosophers, or the
Sages of the East, that School of Wisdom may be look'd upon as
the true seminary of this Doctrine: as it was of most other natural
knowledge.</p>
                     <p>But this dissolution of the Earth into Fire, may be understood two
ways; either that it will be dissolv'd into a loose name, and so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipated
and lost as Lightning in the Air, and vanish into nothing;
or that it will be dissolv'd into a fixt flame, such as the Sun is, or
a fixt Star. And I am of opinion, that the Earth after the last Day
of Judgment, will be chang'd into the nature of a Sun, or of a fixt
Star; and shine like them in the Firmament. Being all melted down
into a mass of Aethereal matter, and enlightning a Sphere or Orb
round about it. I have no direct and demonstrative proof of this, I
confess; But if Planets were once fixt Stars, as I believe they were;
their revolution to the same state again, in a great Circle of Time,
seems to be according to the methods of Providence; which loves
to recover what was lost or decay'd, after certain periods: and
what was originally good and happy, to make it so again; All Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

at last, being transform'd into a like glory with the Sons of
God.</p>
                     <p>I will not tell you what foundation there is in Nature, for this
change or transformation; from the interiour constitution of the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:41970:209"/>
Earth, and the instances we have seen of new Stars appearing in the
Heavens. I should lead the <hi>English</hi> Reader too far out of his way,
to discourse of these things. But if there be any passages or expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in Scripture, that countenance such a state of things after the
day of Judgment, it will not be improper to take notice of them.
That radiant and illustrious <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> describ'd by St. <hi>Iohn, Apoc.
21. ver. 10, 11, 12, &amp;c.</hi> compos'd all of Gemms and bright materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
clear and sparkling, as a Star in the Firmament: Who can give
an account what that is? Its foundations, walls, gates, streets, all
the Body of it, resplendent as light or fire. What is there in Nature,
or in this Universe, that bears any resemblance with such a Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon
as this, unless it be a Sun or a fixt Star? Especially if we
add and consider what follows,<note place="margin">Ver. 23.</note> That <hi>the City had no need of the Sun,
non of the Moon,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ver. 25.</note> 
                        <hi>to shine in it.</hi> And that <hi>there was no night there.</hi> This
can be no Terrestrial Body; it must be a substance luminous in it
self, and a fountain of light, as a fixt Star. And upon such a change
of the Earth, or transformation, as this, would <hi>be brought to pass
the saying that is written, DEATH IS SWALLOWED UP IN
VICTORY.</hi> Which indeed S. <hi>Paul</hi> seems to apply to our Bodies
in particular, <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 15. 54. But in the Eighth Chapter to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
He extends it to all Nature.<note place="margin">Ver. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>The Creation it self also shall be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
from the bondage of Corruption, into the glorious liberty of the Sons
of God.</hi> And accordingly S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> speaking of the same time with St.
<hi>Paul</hi> in that place to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> namely of the general Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
and day of Judgment, says, <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Hades,</hi> which we
render Hell,<note place="margin">Apoc. 20. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>were cast into the lake of fire.</hi> This is their being <hi>swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up in victory,</hi> which S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of; when Death and Hades,
that is, all the Region of mortality: The Earth and all its depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances:
are absorpt into a mass of Fire; and converted, by a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Victory over the powers of darkness, into a Luminous Body
and a region of Light.</p>
                     <p>This great Issue and Period of the Earth, and of all humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
tho' it seem to be founded in nature, and supported by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
expressions of Scripture; yet we cannot, for want of full instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
propose it otherwise than as a fair Conjecture. The Heavens
and the Earth shall flie away at the day of Judgment, says the Text:
<hi>Apoc. 20. 11. And their place shall not be found.</hi> This must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of our Heavens and our Earth. And their <hi>flying away</hi> must be
their removing to some other part of the Universe; so as their
place or residence shall not be found any more here below. This is
the easie and natural sence of the Words; and this translation of
the Earth will not be without some change preceding, that makes it
leave its place, and, with a lofty flight, take its seat amongst the
Stars.—There we leave it; Having conducted it for the space of
Seven Thousand Years, through various changes, from a <hi>dark Chaos
to a bright Star.</hi>

                  <head>A
REVIEW
OF THE
THEORY
OF THE
EARTH.</head>
                  <p>TO take a review of this Theory of the Earth, which we have
now finish'd, We must consider, first, the extent of it:
and then the principal parts whereof it consists. It reaches,
as you see, from one end of the World to the other: From
the first Chaos to the last day, and the Consummation of all things.
This, probably, will run the length of Seven Thousand Years:
which is a good competent space of time to exercise our Thoughts
upon, and to observe the several Scenes which Nature and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
bring into View within the compass of so many Ages.</p>
                  <p>The matter and principal parts of this Theory, are such things as
are recorded in Scripture. We do not feign a Subject, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scant
upon it, for diversion; but endeavour to give an intelligible
and rational account of such matters of Fact, past or future, as are
there specifi'd and declar'd. What it hath seem'd good to the Holy
Ghost to communicate to us, by History or Prophecy, concerning
the several States and general Changes of this Earth, makes the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of our Discourse. Therefore the things themselves must
be taken for granted, in one sence or other: seeing besides all other
proofs, they have the Authority of a Revelation; and our business
is only to give such an explication of them, as shall approve it self
to the faculties of Man, and be conformable to Scripture.</p>
                  <p>We will therefore first set down the things themselves, that make
the subject matter of this Theory: and remind you of our explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them. Then recollect the general proofs of that explication,
from Reason and Nature: but more fully and particularly shew how
it is grounded upon Scripture. The primary <hi>Phaenomena</hi> whereof we
are to give an account, are these Five or Six.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>I. The Original of the Earth from a Chaos.</item>
                     <item>II. The state of Paradise, and the Ante-diluvian World.</item>
                     <item>III. The Universal Deluge.</item>
                     <item>IV. The Universal Conflagration.</item>
                     <item>V. The Renovation of the World, or the New Heavens and New Earth.</item>
                     <item>VI. The Consummation of all things.</item>

                  <p>There are also in Scripture some other things, relating to the
same Subjects, that may be call'd the Secondary Ingredients of this
Theory, and are to be referr'd to their respective primary heads.
Such are, for instance.</p>

                     </gap>cord: as directions
and indications how to understand the Ante-diluvian state, and the
Deluge it self. Whosoever therefore shall undertake to write the
Theory of the Earth, must think himself bound to give us a just ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of these secondary Phaenomena, as well as of the primary;
and that in such a dependance and connexion, as to make them give
and receive light from one another.</p>
                  <p>The former part of the Task is concerning the World behind us,
Times and Things past, that are already come to light. The later
is concerning the World before us, Times and Things to come:
That lie yet in the bosom of Providence, and in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eeds of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And these are chiefly the <hi>Conflagration</hi> of the World, and the
<hi>Renovation</hi> of it. When these are over and expir'd, then <hi>comes the
end,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> says. Then <hi>the Heavens and the Earth fly away,</hi> as

                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 20.</note> Then is the <hi>Consummation</hi> of all things, and the last
period of this sublunary World, whatsoever it is. Thus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ar the
Theorist must go, and pursue the motions of Nature, till all things
are brought to rest and silence. And in this latter part of the Theory,
there is also a collateral Phaenomenon, the <hi>Millennium,</hi> or Thousand
Years Reign of Christ and his Saints, upon Earth, to be consider'd.
For this according as it is represented in Scripture, does imply a
change in the Natural World, as well as in the Moral<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must be accounted for, in the Theory of the Earth. At least it
must be there determin'd, whether that state of the World, which is
singular and extraordinary, will be before or after the Conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>These are the Principals and Incidents of this Theory of the Earth,
as to the Matter and Subject of it: which, you see, is both imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and wholly taken out of Scripture. As to our explication of
these points, that is sufficiently known, being set down at large in
four Books of this Theory. Therefore it remains only, having seen
the Matter of the Theory, to examine the Form of it, and the proofs
of it: for from these two things it must receive its censure. As to
the form, the characters of a Regular Theory seem to be these three;
<hi>Few and easie Postulatums: Union of Parts:</hi> and <hi>a Fitness to answer,
fully and clearly, all the Phaenomend to which it is to be apply'd.</hi>
                  </p>

We think our Hypothesis does not want any of these Characters. As
to the First, we take but one single <hi>Postulatum</hi> for the whole Theory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> an easie one, warranted both by Scripture and Antiquity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Namely, <hi>That this Earth rise, at first, from a Chaos.</hi> As to the second,
<hi>Union of Parts,</hi> The whole Theory is but one Series of Causes and
Effects from that first Chaos. Besides, you can scarce admit any one
part of it, first, last, or intermediate, but you must, in consequence
of that, admit all the rest. Grant me but that the Deluge is truly
explain'd, and I'le desire no more for proof of all the Theory. Or,
if you begin at the other end, and grant the <hi>New Heavens and New
Earth</hi> after the Conflagration,<note place="margin">

                     </note> you will be led back again to the first
Heavens and first Earth that were before the Flood. For St. <hi>Iohn</hi>
says, that <hi>New Earth</hi> was without a <hi>Sea: Apoc.</hi> 21. 1. And it was a
<hi>Renovation;</hi> or <hi>Restitution</hi> to some former state of things: there was
therefore some former Earth without a Sea; which not being the
present Earth, it must be the Ante diluvian. Besides, both St. <hi>Iohn,</hi>
and the Prophet <hi>Isaias,</hi> have represented the New Heavens and New
Earth, as <hi>Paradisi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cal,</hi> According as is prov'd, <hi>Book the 4th. chap.</hi> 2.
And having told us the form of the New future Earth, that it will
have <hi>no Sea,</hi> it is a reasonable inference that there was no Sea in the
<hi>Paradisi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cal Earth.</hi> However from the form of this Future Earth,
which St. <hi>Iohn</hi> represents to us, we may at least conclude, That an
<hi>Earth without a Sea</hi> is no Chimaera, or impossibility: but rather a fit
seat and habitation for the Just and the Innocent.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see the parts of the Theory link and hold fast one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:

aptly together, and yet have no truth in them. This is enough in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to give the title of a just Composition to any work, but not of
a true one: till it appear that the conclusions and exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tations are
grounded upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> good natural evidence, or upon good Divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
We must therefore proceed now to the third thing to be
consider'd in a Theory, <hi>What</hi> its Proofs are: or the grounds upon
which it stands, whether Sacred or Natural.</p>
                  <p>According to Natural evidence, things are proved from their
Causes or their Effects. And we think we have this double order of
proofs for the truth of our Hypothesis. As to the method of Causes,
we proceed from what is more simple, to what is more compound:
and build all upon one foundation. Go but to the Head of the
Theory, and you will see the Causes lying in a train before you,
from first to last. And tho' you did not know the Natural History of
the World, past or future, you might, by intuition, foretell it, as
to the grand revolutions and successive faces of Nature, through a long
series of Ages. If we have given a true account of the motions of
the Chaos, we have also truly form'd the first habitable Earth. And
if that be truly form'd, we have thereby given a true account of
the state of Paradise, and of all that depends upon it. And not of
that only, but also of the universal Deluge. Both these we have
shewn in their causes: The one from the Form of that Earth, and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:41970:212"/>
the other from the Fall of it into the Abyss. And tho' we had not
been made acquainted with these things by Antiquity, we might,
in contemplation of the Causes, have truly conceiv'd them, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
or incidents to the First Earth. But as to the Deluge, I do not
say, that we might have calculated the Time, manner, and other
circumstances of it: These things were regulated by Providence, in
subordination to the Moral World. But that there would be, at one
time or o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>her, a disruption of that Earth, or of the Great Abyss:
and in consequence of it, an universal Deluge: So far, I think, the
light of a Theory might carry us.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, In consequence of this disruption of the Primeval
Earth,<note place="margin">Theor. Book 3. ch. 7, &amp; 8.</note> at the Deluge, the present Earth was made hollow and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernous:
and by that means, (due preparations being used) capable
of <hi>Combustion,</hi> or of perishing by an universal Fire: Yet, to speak in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously,
This is as hard a step to be made, in vertue of Natural
causes, as any in the whole Theory. But in recompence of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
the Conflagration is so plainly and literally taught us in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and avow'd by Antiquity, that it can fall under no dispute, as
to the thing it self. And as to a capacity or disposition to it in the
present Earth, that I think is sufficiently made out.</p>
                  <p>Then, the Conflagration admitted, in that way it is explain'd in
the Third Book: The Earth, you see, is, by that fire, reduc'd to a
second Chaos. A Chaos truly so call'd. And from that, as from the
First, arises another Creation, or <hi>New Heavens</hi> and a <hi>New Earth;</hi>
By the same causes, and in the same form, with the Paradisiacal. This
is the <hi>Renovation</hi> of the World: The <hi>Restitution</hi> of all things: men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
both by Scripture and Antiquity: And by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi>
St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> call'd the <hi>New Heaven</hi> and <hi>New Earth.</hi> With
this, as the last period, and most glorious Scene of all humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
our Theory concludes; as to this method of Causes, whereof
we are now speaking.</p>
                  <p>I say, here it ends as to the <hi>method of Causes.</hi> For tho' we pursue
the Earth still further, even to its last Dissolution: which is call'd
the Consummation of all things: yet all, that we have superadded
upon that occasion, is but Problematical: and may, without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
to the Theory, be argued and disputed on either hand. I do
not know, but that our conjectures there may be well grounded:
but however, not springing so directly from the same root, or, at
least, not by ways, so clear and visible, I leave that part undecided.
Especially seeing we pretend to write no more than the Theory <hi>of
the Earth,</hi> and therefore as we begin no higher than the <hi>Chaos,</hi> so
we are not obliged to go any further than to the last state of a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial
consistency: which is that of the New Heavens and the New
Earth.</p>
                  <p>This is the first natural proof, From the order of Causes. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>om the consideration of Effects. Namely of such effects as
are already in being. And therefore this proof can extend only to
that part of the Theory, that explains the present and past form
and Phaenomena of the Earth. What is Future, must be left to a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
trial, when the things come to pass, and present themselves to
be examin'd and compar'd with the Hypothesis. As to the present
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:41970:212"/>
Form of the Earth, we call all Nature to witness for us: The Rocks
and the Mountains, the Hills and the Valleys, the deep and wide Sea,
and the Caverns of the Ground: Let these speak, and tell their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine:
How the Body of the Earth came to be thus torn and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled:
If this strange and irregular structure was not the effect of a
ruine: and of such a ruine as was universal over the face of the
whole Globe. But we have given such a full explication of this, in
the first part of the Theory, from <hi>Chapt. the 9th.</hi> to the end of that
Treatise, that we dare stand to the judgment of any that reads those
four Chapters, to determine if the Hypothesis does not answer all
those Phaenomena, easily and adequately.</p>
                  <p>The next Phaenomenon to be consider'd, is the <hi>Deluge,</hi> with its
adjuncts. This also is fully explain'd by our Hypothesis, in the <hi>2d.
3d.</hi> and <hi>6th.</hi> Chapters of the first Book. Where it is shewn, that the
<hi>Mosaical Deluge,</hi> that is, an universal Inundation of the whole
Earth, above the tops of the highest Mountains, made by a break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
open of the Great Abyss, (for thus far <hi>Moses</hi> leads us) is fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
by this Hypothesis, and cannot be conceiv'd in any other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
hitherto propos'd? There are no sources or stores of Water
sufficient for such an effect, that may be drawn upon the Earth, and
drawn off again, but by supposing such an Abyss, and such a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of it, as the Theory represents.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, As to the Phaenomena of Paradise and the Ante-diluvian
World, we have set them down in order in the <hi>2d.</hi> Book: and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
to each of them its proper explication, from the same Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis.
We have also given an account of that Character which An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
always assign'd to the first age of the World, or the Golden
Age, as they call'd it: namely, <hi>Equality of Seasons</hi> throughout the
Year, or a perpetual Equinox. We have also taken in all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts
or concomitants of these States, as they are mention'd in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<hi>The Longevity</hi> of the Ante-diluvians, and the declension of their
age by degrees, after the Flood. As also that wonderful Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
the <hi>Rainbow:</hi> which appear'd to <hi>Noah</hi> for a Sign, that the Earth
should never undergo a second Deluge.<note place="margin">Theor. Book 2. chap. 5.</note> And we have shewn,
wherein the force and propriety of that Sign consisted, for confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Noah</hi>'s faith in the promise and in the divine veracity.</p>
                  <p>Thus far we have explain'd the past Phaenomena of the Natural
World. The rest are Futurities, which still lie hid in their Causes;
and we cannot properly prove a Theory from effects that are not
yet in being. But so far as they are foretold in Scripture, both as to
substance and circumstance, in prosecution of the same Principles
we have ante dated their birth, and shew'd how they will come to
pass. We may therefore, I think, reasonably conclude, That this
Theory has performed its task, and answer'd its title: having given
an account of all the general changes of the Natural World, as far
as either Sacred History looks backwards, or Sacred Prophecy looks
forwards. So far as the one tells us what is past in Nature, and the
other what is to come. And if all this be nothing but an appearance
of truth, 'tis a kind of fatality upon us to be deceiv'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:41970:213"/>
SO much for Natural Evidence, from the Causes or Effects. We
now proceed to Scripture, which will make the greatest part
of this Review. The Sacred Basis upon which the whole Theory
stands, is the doctrine of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> deliver'd in his <hi>Second Epistle</hi> and
<hi>Third Chapter,</hi> concerning the <hi>Triple Order</hi> and Succession of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
and the Earth. That comprehends the whole extent of our
Theory: which indeed is but a large Commentary upon S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s
Text. The Apostle sets out a threefold state of the Heavens and
Earth: with some general properties of each: taken from their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Constitution and different Fate. The Theory takes the same
threefold state of the Heavens and the Earth: and explains more
part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cularly, wherein their different Constitution consists: and
how, under the conduct of Providence, their different fate depends
upon it. Let us set down the Apostle's words, with the occasion of
them: and their plain sence, according to the most easie and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
explication.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 3. Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.</note>
walking after their own lusts.</p>
                  <p>4. And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the
creation.</p>
                  <p>5. For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God, the
heavens were of old, and the earth consisting of water and by water.</p>
                  <p>6. Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water,
perished.</p>
                  <p>7. But the heavens and the earth that are now, by the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>me word, are
kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment, and perdition
of ungodly men.—</p>
                  <p>10. The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in the which
the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt
with fervent heat; the earth also and the works that are therein shall be
burnt up.</p>
                  <p>13. Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens
and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.</p>
                  <p>This is the whole Discourse so far as relates to our Subject. S <hi>Peter,</hi>
you see, had met with some that scoff'd at the future destruction
of the World, and the coming of our Saviour; and they were men,
it seems, that pretended to Philosophy and Argument; and they
use this argument for their opinion, <hi>Seeing there hath been no change
in Nature, or in the World, from the beginning to this time, why should
we think there will be any change for the future?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apostle answers to this, That they willingly forget or are
ignorant that there were Heavens of old, and an Earth, so and so
constituted; consisting of Water and by Water; by reason where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
that World, or those Heavens and that Earth, perish'd in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
of Water. But, saith he, the Heavens and the Earth that are
now, are of another constitution, fitted and reserved to another
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:41970:213"/>
fate, namely, to perish by Fire. And after these are perish'd, there
will be New Heavens and a New Earth, according to God's promise.</p>
                  <p>This is an easie Paraphrase, and the plain and genuine sence
of the Apostle's discourse; and no body, I think, would ever look
after any other sence, if this did not carry them out of their usual
road and point to conclusions which they did not fancy. This sence,
you see<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hits the objections directly, or the Cavil which these scoffers
made; and tells them, that they vainly pretend that there hath been
no change in the World since the beginning, for there was one sort
of Heavens and Earth before the Flood, and another sort now;
the first having been destroy'd at the Deluge. So that the Apostle's
argument stands upon this Foundation, That there is a diversity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the present Heavens and Earth, and the Ante-diluvian Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
and Earth; take away that, and you take away all the force
of his Answer.</p>
                  <p>Then as to his <hi>New Heavens</hi> and <hi>New Earth</hi> after the Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they must be material and natural, in the same sence and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
with the former Heavens and Earth; unless you will offer open
violence to the Text. So that this Triplicity of the Heavens and the
Earth, is the first, obvious, plain sence of the Apostle's discourse:
which every one would readily accept, if it did not draw after it a
long train of Consequences, and lead them into other Worlds than
they ever thought of before, or are willing to enter upon now.</p>
                  <p>But we shall have occasion by and by, to examine this Text more
fully in all its circumstances. Give me leave in the mean time to
observe, That S. <hi>Paul</hi> also implyes that <hi>triple Creation</hi> which S. <hi>Peter</hi>
expresses, S. <hi>Paul,</hi> I say, in the <hi>8th Chap.</hi> to the <hi>Rom. ver.</hi> 20, 21. tells
us of a <hi>Creation</hi> that will be <hi>redeem'd from Vanity:</hi> which are the
New Heavens and New Earth to come. <hi>A Creation in subjection to
Vanity:</hi> which is the present state of the World, And a <hi>Creation</hi> that
was subjected to Vanity, in hopes of being restor'd: which was the
first Paradisiacal Creation. And these are the Three States of the
Natural World, which make the subject of our Theory.</p>
                  <p>To these two places of S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> I might add that third
in S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> concerning the New Heavens and New Earth; with that
distinguishing Character, that the Earth was <hi>without a Sea.</hi> As
this distinguisheth it from the present Earth, so, being a <hi>Restitution</hi>
or <hi>Restauration,</hi> as we noted before, it must be the same with some
former Earth: and consequently, it implies that there was another
precedent state of the Natural World, to which this is a Restitution.
These three places I alledge, as comprehending and confirming the
Theory in its full extent. But we do not suppose them all of the same
force and clearness. S. <hi>Peter</hi> leads the way, and gives light and
strength to the other two. When a Point is prov'd by one clear
Text, we allow others, as auxiliaries, that are not of the same clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
But being open'd, receive light from the primary Text, and
reflect it upon the Argument.</p>
                  <p>So much for the Theory in general. We will now take one or
two principal heads of it, which vertually contain all the rest, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
them more strictly and particularly, in reference to their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with Scripture. The two Heads we pitch upon, shall be, our
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:41970:214"/>
Explication of the Deluge, and our Explication of the New Heavens
and New Earth. We told you before, these Two were as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he
Hinges, upon which all the Theory moves, and which hok<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the parts
of it in firm union one with another. As to the Deluge, if I have
explain'd that aright, by the Disruption of the Great Abyss, and
the Dissolution of the Earth that cover'd it, all the rest follows in
such a chain of Consequences, as cannot be broken. Wherefore in
order to the proof of that Explication, and of all that depends upon it,
I will make bold to lay down this Proposition, <hi>That our Hypothesis
concerning the Universal Deluge, is not only more agreeable to Reason and
Philosophy tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> any other yet propos'd to the World, but is also more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to Scripture.</hi> Namely to such places of Scripture, as reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Deluge,</hi> the <hi>Abyss,</hi> and the form of the <hi>first Earth.</hi> And par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
to the <hi>History of Noah's Flood, as recorded by Moses.</hi> If I
can make this good, it will, doubtless, give satisfaction to all that are
free and intelligent. And I desire their patience, if I proceed slowly
and by several steps. We will divide our task into parts, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
them separately. First, by Scripture in general, and then by
<hi>Moses</hi> his History and description of the Flood.</p>
                  <p>Our Hypothesis of the Deluge consists of Three Principal Heads, or
differs remarkably in Three things from the common Explication.
First, In that we suppose the Ante diluvian Earth to have been of
another Form and Constitution from the present Earth: with the
Abyss placed under it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In that we suppose the Deluge to have been made, not
by any inun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ation of the Sea, or overflowing of Fountains and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers:
nor (principally) by any excess of Rains: but by a real disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of the Exteriour Earth, and disruption of the Abyss which
it cover'd. These are the two principal points, to which may be
added, as a Corollary,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That the Deluge was not in the nature of a standing Pool:
The Waters lying every where level, of an equal depth and with an
uniform Surface: But was made by a fluctuation and commotion of
the Abyss upon the disruption: Which commotion being over, the
Waters retired into their Chanels, and let the dry Land appear.</p>
                  <p>These are the most material and fundamental parts of our Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis:
and these being prov'd consonant to Scripture, there can be
no doubt of the rest.</p>
                  <p>We begin with the first: That the Ante-diluvian Earth was of
another form and constitution from the present Earth, with the Abyss
placed under it. This is confirm'd in Scripture, both by such places
as assert a diversity in general: and by other places that intimate
to us, wherein that diversity consisted, and what was the form of the
first Earth. That discourse of S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, which we have set before
you concerning the past, present, and future, Heavens and Earth,
is so full a proof of this diversity in general, that you must either al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it, or make the Apostle's argumentation of no effect. He speaks
plainly of the Natural World, <hi>The Heavens and the Earth:</hi> And he
makes a plain distinction, or rather opposition, betwixt those before
and after the Flood: so that the least we can conclude from his
words, is a diversity betwixt them; in answer to that Identity or
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:41970:214"/>
Immutability of Nature, which the Scoffers pretended to have been
ever since the beginning.</p>
                  <p>But tho' the Apostle, to me, speaks plainly of the <hi>Natural World,</hi>
and distinguishes that which was before the Flood, from the present<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Yet there are some that will allow neither of these to be contain'd in
S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s words; and by that means would make this whole Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of little or no effect, as to our purpose. And seeing we, on the
contrary, have made it the chief Scripture-basis of the whole Theory
of the Earth, we are oblig'd to free it from those false glosses or
mis-interpretations, that lessen the force of its testimony, or make it
wholly ineffectual.</p>
                  <p>These Interpreters say, That S. <hi>Peter</hi> meant no more than to mind
these Scoffers, that the World was once destroy'd by a Deluge of
Water: meaning the <hi>Animate World,</hi> Mankind and living Creatures.
And that it shall be destroy'd again by another Element, namely by
Fire. So as there is no opposition or diversity betwixt the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Worlds, taught or intended by the Apostle; but only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to their different fate or manner of perishing, and not of
their different nature or constitution.</p>
                  <p>Here are two main points, you see, wherein our interpretations
of this discourse of the Apostles, differ. First, In that they make the
Apostle (in that <hi>sixth verse)</hi> to understand only the World <hi>Animate,</hi>
or Men and brute Creatures. That these were indeed destroy'd, but
not the Natural World, or the form and constitution of the then
Earth and Heavens. Secondly, That there is no diversity or opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made by S. <hi>Peter</hi> betwixt the ancient Heavens and Earth, and
the present, as to their form and constitution. We pretend that these
are mis-apprehensions, or mis-representations of the sence of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
in both respects, and offer these reasons to prove them to be so.</p>
                  <p>For the first point; That the Apostle speaks here of the Natural
World, particularly in the <hi>6th</hi> Verse; and that it perish'd, as well as
the animate, These Considerations seem to prove.</p>
                  <p>First, Because the Argument or ground these Scoffers went up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
was taken from the Natural World, its constancy and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
in the same state from the beginning; Therefore if the Apostle
answers <hi>ad idem,</hi> and takes away their Argument, he must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the same Natural World, and show that it hath been chang'd,
or hath perish'd.</p>
                  <p>You will say, it may be, the Apostle doth not deny, nor take away
the ground they went upon, but denies the consequence they made
from it; That <hi>Therefore there would be no change, because there had been
none.</hi> No, neither doth he do this, if by the <hi>World</hi> in the <hi>6th. ver.</hi>
he understands Mankind only; for their ground was this, <hi>there hath
been no change in the Natural World;</hi> Their consequence, this, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there will be none,</hi> nor any Conflagration. Now the Apostle's
answer, according to you, is this, <hi>You forget that Mankind hath been
destroyed in a Deluge.</hi> And what then? what's this to the Natural
World, whereof they were speaking? This takes away neither an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent
nor consequent, neither ground nor inference; nor any way
toucheth their Argument, which proceeded from the Natural World
to the Natural World. Therefore you must either suppose that the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:41970:215"/>
Apostle takes away their ground, or he takes away nothing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, What is it that the Apostle tells these Scoffers they were
ignorant of? That there was a Deluge, that destroyed Mankind?
They could not be ignorant of that, nor pretend to be so; It was
therefore the constitution of those Old Heavens and Earth, and the
change or destruction of them at the Deluge, that they were ignorant
of, or did not attend to; and of this the Apostle minds them.
These Scoffers appear to have been <hi>Iews</hi> by the phrase they use,
<hi>since the Fathers fell asleep,</hi> which in both parts of it is a Judaical
expression; and does S. <hi>Peter</hi> tell the <hi>Iews</hi> that had <hi>Moses</hi> read to
them every Sabbath, That <hi>they were ignorant that Mankind was once
destroyed with a Deluge in the Days of Noah?</hi> or could they pretend
to be ignorant of that without making themselves ridiculous both to
<hi>Iews</hi> and Christians? Besides, these do not seem to have been of
the vulgar amongst them, for they bring a Philosophical Argument
for their opinion;<note place="margin">There was a Sect amongst the <hi>Iews</hi> that held this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity and immutability of Nature; and <hi>Maimonides</hi> himself was of this principle, and gives the same reason for it with the Scoffers here in the Text, <hi>Quod mundus reti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>et &amp; sequitur consuetudinem suam.</hi> And as to those of the <hi>Iews</hi> that were <hi>Aristoteleans,</hi> it was very suitable to their principles to hold the incortuptibility of the World, as their Master did. <hi>Vid. Med. in loc.</hi>
                     </note> and also in their very argument they refer to the
History of the Old Testament, in saying, <hi>Since the Fathers fell asleep,</hi>
amongst which Fathers, <hi>Noah</hi> was one of the most remarkable.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The design of the Apostle is to prove to them, or to
dispose them to the belief of the Conflagration, or future destruction
of the World; which I suppose you will not deny to be a destruction
of the Natural World; therefore to prove or perswade this, he must
use an argument taken from a precedent destruction of the Natural
World; for to give an instance of the perishing of Mankind only,
would not reach home to his purpose. And you are to observe
here that the Apostle does not proceed against them barely by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
for what would that have booted? If these Scoffers would
have submitted to Authority, they had already the Authority of
the Prophets and Apostles in this point: but he deals with them
at their own weapon, and opposes reasons to reasons; What hath
been done may be done, and if the Natural World hath been once
destroyed, 'tis not hard, nor unreasonable, to suppose those Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
to be true, that say it shall be destroyed again.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Unless we understand here the Natural World, we make
the Apostle both redundant in his discourse, and also very obscure
in an easie Argument. If his design was only to tell them that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
was once destroy'd in a Deluge, what's that to the Heavens
and the Earth? The <hi>5th</hi> Verse would be superfluous; which yet he
seems to make the foundation of his discourse. He might have told
them how Mankind had perish'd before with a Deluge, and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
that destruction as much as he pleas'd, without telling them
how the Heavens and the Earth were constituted then; what was
that to the purpose, if it had no dependance or connection with
the other? In the precedent Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. when he speaks only of
the Floods destroying Mankind, he mentions nothing of the Heavens
or the Earth: and if you make him to intend no more here, what
he says more is superfluous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:41970:215"/>
I also add, that you make the Apostle very obscure and operose
in a very easie argument. How easie had it been for him, without
this <hi>Apparatus,</hi> to have told them, as he did before, that God
brought a Flood upon the World of the ungodly; and not given
us so much difficulty to understand his sence, or such a suspicion
and appearance, that he intended something more; for that there is
at least a great appearance and tendency to a further sence, I think
none can deny; And St. <hi>Austin, Didymus Alex. Bede,</hi> as we shall see
hereafter, understood it plainly of the natural World: Also mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Expositors and Criticks; as <hi>Cajetan, Estius, Drusius, Heinfius,</hi>
have extended it to the natural World, more or less; tho' they
had no Theory to mislead them, nor so much as an hypothesis to
support them; but attended only to the tenor of the Apostle's dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
which constrain'd them to that sence, in whole or in
part.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the opposition carries it upon the natural World. The
opposition lies betwixt the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
the Heavens that were of old, and the Earth, and the present
Heavens and Earth, or the two natural Worlds. And if they will
not allow them to be oppos'd in their natures (which yet we shall
prove by and by) at least they must be oppos'd in their fate; and as
This is to perish by fire, so That perish'd by water; And if it pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd
by water, it perish'd; which is all we contend for at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, if we would be as easily govern'd in the exposition of this
place, as we are of other places of Scripture, it would be enough
to suggest, that in reason and fairness of interpretation, the same
World is destroy'd in the <hi>6th. verse,</hi> that was describ'd in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
<hi>verse;</hi> but it is the Natural World that is describ'd there, the
Heavens and the Earth, so and so constituted; and therefore in
fairness of interpretation they ought to be understood here; that
World being the subject that went immediately before, and there
being nothing in the words that restrains them to the animate
World or to Mankind. In the <hi>2d ch. ver.</hi> 5. the Apostle does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> by adding <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the World of the ungodly;</hi>
but here 'tis not only illimited, but according to the context, both
preceding and following, to be extended to the Natural World. I
say by the following context too, for so it answers to the World
that is to perish by Fire; which will reach the frame of Nature as
well as Mankind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For a conclusion of this first point, I will set down S.</hi> Austin'<hi>s
judgment in this case; who in several parts of his works hath inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
this place of S.</hi> Peter, of the natural world. <hi>As to the heavens,
he hath these words in his Exposition upon</hi> Genesis, Hos etiam aerios
coelos quondam periisse Diluvio, in quâdam earum quae Canonica appellan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
Epistolâ legimus. We read in one of the Epistles called Canonical,
<hi>meaning this of S.</hi> Peter'<hi>s,</hi> that the aerila heavens perish'd in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge.
<hi>And he concerns himself there to let you know that it was not
the starry heavens that were destroy'd; the waters could not reach
so high; but the regions of our air. Then afterwards he hath these
words,</hi> Faciliùs eos <hi>(coelos)</hi> secundum illius Epistolae authoritatem credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:41970:216"/>
periisse, &amp; alios, sicut ibi scribitur, repositos. We do more easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
according to the authority of <hi>that</hi> Epistle, those heavens to have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd;
and others, as it is there written, substituted in their pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e. <hi>In
like manner, and to the same sence, he hath these words upon</hi> Psal.
101. Aerii utique coeli perierunt ut propinqus Terris, secundum quod dicun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
volucres coeli; sunt autem &amp; coeli coelorum, superiores in Firmamento,
sed utrùm &amp; ipsi perituri sint igni, an hi soli, qui etiam diluvio perierunt,
disceptatio est aliquanto scrupulosior inter doctos. <hi>And in his Book</hi> de Civ.
Dei, <hi>he hath several passages to the same purpose,</hi> Quemadmodum in
Apostolicâ illâ Epistolâ à toto pars a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cipitur, quod diluvio periisse dictus est
mundus, quamvis sola ejus cum suis coelis pars ima perierit. <hi>These being
to the same effect with the first c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tation, I need not make them En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish;
and this last place refers to the Earth as well as the Heavens,
as several other places in S.</hi> Austin <hi>do, whereof we shall give you an
account, when we come to shew his judgment concerning the second
point,</hi> the diversity of the ante-diluvian and post-diluvian World. <hi>This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but a foretaste of his good will and inclinations towards this
Doctrine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These considerations alledg'd, so far as I can judge, are full and
unanswerable proofs, that this discourse of the Apostle's compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
and refers to the Natural World; and consequently they war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
our interpretation in this particular, and destroy the contrary.
We have but one step more to make good, <hi>That there was a change
made in this natural world at the Deluge,</hi> according to the Apostle;
and this is to confute the second part of their interpretation, which
supposeth that S. <hi>Peter</hi> makes no distinction or opposition betwixt
the antediluvian Heavens and Earth, and the present Heavens and
Earth, in that respect.</p>
                  <p>This second difference betwixt us, methinks, is still harsher than
the first; and contrary to the very form, as well as to the matter of
the Apostle's discourse. For there is a plain antithesis, or opposition
made betwixt the Heavens and the Earth of old <hi>(ver. the 5th.)</hi> and
the Heavens and the Earth that are now <hi>(ver. the 7th.)</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
and the adversative particle,
<hi>but,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> you see marks the opposition; so that it is full and plain accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Grammar and Logick. And that the parts or members of
this opposition differ in nature from one another, is certain from
this, because otherwise the Apostle's argument or discourse is of no
effect, concludes nothing to the purpose; he makes no answer to
the objection, nor proves any thing against the Scoffers, unless you
admit that diversity. For they said, <hi>All things had been the same from
the beginning in the Natural World,</hi> and unless he say, as he manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
does, that there hath been a change in Nature, and that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
and Earth that are now, are different from the ancient Heavens
and Earth, which perish'd at the Flood, he says nothing to destroy
their argument, nor to confirm the Prophetical doctrine of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
destruction of the Natural World.</p>
                  <p>This, I think, would be enough to satisfie any clear and free
mind concerning the meaning of the Apostle; but because I desire
to give as full a light to this place as I can, and to put the sence of
it out of controversie, if possible, for the future, I will make some
further remarks to confirm this exposition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:41970:216"/>
And we may observe that several of those reasons which we have
given to prove, That the <hi>Natural World</hi> is understood by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> are
double reasons; and do also prove the other point in question, a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
betwixt the two Natural Worlds,</hi> the Ante diluvian and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
As for instance, unless you admit this diversity betwixt the
two natural Worlds, you make the <hi>5th. verse</hi> in this <hi>Chapter</hi> super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
and useless: and you must suppose the Apostle to make an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:41970:217"/>
way for a second observation to prove our sence of the Text; for
if you admit no diversity betwixt those Heavens and Earth, and the
present, shew us pray, how the present Heavens and Earth consist
of water, and by water. What watery constitution have they? The
Apostle implies rather, that <hi>The now Heavens and Earth</hi> have a fiery
constitution. We have now Meteors of all sorts in the air, winds,
hail, snow, lightning, thunder, and all things engender'd of fiery
exhalations,<note place="margin">Book 2. c. 5. p. 233.</note> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>as well as we have rain; but according to our Theory,
the antediluvian Heavens, of all these Meteors had none but dews
and vapors, or watery Meteors only; and therefore might very
aptly be said by the Apostle to be <hi>constituted of water,</hi> or to have a
watery <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Then the Earth was said to <hi>consist by water,</hi> because
it was built upon it, and at first was sustain'd by it. And when such
a Key as this is put into our hands, that does so easily unlock this
hard passage, and makes it intelligible, according to the just force
of the words, why should we pertinaciously adhere to an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
that neither agrees with the words,<note place="margin">Whether you refer the words <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. separately, to the Heavens and the Earth, or both to the Earth, or both to both, it will make no great difference as to our interpretation.</note> nor makes any sence
that is considerable?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If the Apostle had made the ante-diluvian Heavens and
Earth the same with the present, his apodosis in the <hi>7th.</hi> Verse, should
not have been <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
&amp;c. I say, it should not have been by way of antithesis,
but of identity or continuation; <hi>And the same Heavens and Earth are
kept in store reserv'd unto fire, &amp;c.</hi> Accordingly we see the Apostle
speaks thus, as to the Logos, or the <hi>Word of God,</hi> Verse 7. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<hi>by the same Word of God;</hi> where the thing is the same, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
it as the same; And if it had been the same Heavens and
Earth, as well as the same Word of God, Why should he use a
mark of opposition for the one, and of identity for the other? to
this I do not see what can be fairly answer'd.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the ante-diluvian Heavens and Earth were different
from the present, because, as the Apostle intimates, they were such,
and so constituted, as made them obnoxious to a Deluge; whereas
ours are of such a form,<note place="margin">The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r. 1. Book. c. 2.</note> as makes them incapable of a Deluge, and
obnoxious to a Conflagration; the just contrary fate.</p>
                  <p>If you say there was nothing of natural tendency or disposition
in either World to their respective fate, but the first might as well
have perish'd by fire, as water, and this by water as by fire, you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinge
all Nature and natural providence in that method, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
one main scope of the Apostle in this discourse. His first scope
is to assert, and mind them of that diversity there was betwixt the
ancient Heavens and Earth, and the present; and from that, to
prove against those Scoffers, that there had been a change and revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
in Nature; And his second scope seems to be this, to show
that diversity to be such, as, under the Divine conduct, leads to a
different fate, and expos'd that World to a Deluge; for when he
had describ'd the constitution of the first Heavens and Earth, he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>Quià talis
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:41970:217"/>
erat,</hi> saith <hi>Grotius, qualem diximus, constitutio &amp; Terrae &amp; Coeli.
WHERE BY the then World perish'd in a Flood of Water.</hi> This
<hi>whereby</hi> notes some kind of causal dependance, and must relate to
some means or conditions precedent. It cannot relate to Logos, or
<hi>the Word of God,</hi> Grammar will not permit that; therefore it must
relate to the state of the Ante-diluvian Heavens and Earth immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
premis'd. And to what purpose indeed should he premise the
description of those Heavens and Earth, if it was not to lay a ground
for this Inference?</p>
                  <p>Having given these Reasons for the necessity of this Interpretation;
in the last place, let's consider S. <hi>Austin</hi>'s judgment, and his sence
upon this place, as to the point in question. As also the reflections
that some other of the Ancients have made upon this doctrine of
S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s. <hi>Didymus Alexandrinus,</hi> who was for some time S. <hi>Ierome</hi>'s
Master, made such a seve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e reflection upon it, that he said this Epistle
was corrupted, and should not be admitted into the Canon, because
it taught the doctrine of a <hi>Triple</hi> or <hi>Triform World</hi> in this third
Chapter. As you may see in his <hi>Enarr. in Epist. Canonicas.</hi> Now
this threefold World is first that in the <hi>6th ver. The World that then
was.</hi> In the <hi>7th ver. The Heavens and the Earth that are now.</hi> And
in the <hi>13th ver. We expect new Heavens and a new Earth, according to
his promise.</hi> This seems to be a fair account that S. <hi>Peter</hi> taught the
doctrine of a Triple World; And I quote this testimony, to show
what S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s words do naturally import, even in the judgment of
one that was not of his mind. And a Man is not prone to make an
exposition against his own Opinion, unless he think the words very
pregnant and express.</p>
                  <p>But S. <hi>Austin</hi> owns the authority of this Epistle, and of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
as deriv'd from it, taking notice of this Text of S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s in
several parts of his Works. We have noted three or four places al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
to this purpose, and we may further take notice of several
passages in his Treatise, <hi>de Civ. Dei,</hi> which confirm our exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In his <hi>20th.</hi> Book, <hi>ch.</hi> 24. he disputes against <hi>Porphyry,</hi> who
had the same Principles with these Eternalists in the Text; or, if I
may so call them, Incorruptarians; and thought the World never
had, nor ever would undergo any change, especially as to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.
S. <hi>Austin</hi> could not urge <hi>Porphyry</hi> with the authority of S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
for he had no veneration for the Christian Oracles; but it seems he
had some for the <hi>Iewish,</hi> and arguing against him, upon that Text
in the Psalms, <hi>Coeli peribunt,</hi> he shows upon occasion how he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s destruction of the Old World. <hi>Legitur Coelum &amp;
Terra transibunt, Mundus transit, sed puto quod praeterit, transit, transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunt
aliquantò mitiùs dicta sunt quàm peribunt. In Epistolâ quoque Petri
Apostoli, ubi aquâ inundatus, qui tum erat, periisse dictus est Mundus;
satis clarum est quae pars mundi à toto significata est, &amp; quatenùs peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isse
dicta sit, &amp; qui coeli repositi igni reservandi.</hi> This he explains
more fully afterwards by subjoyning a caution (which we cited
before) that we must not understand this passion of S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the destruction of the Ante diluvian World, to take in the
whole Universe, and the highest Heavens, but only the aerial Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
and the sublunary World. <hi>In Apostolicâ illâ Epistolâ à toto par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>These places shew us that S. <hi>Austin</hi> understood S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s discourse
to aim at the Natural World and his <hi>periit</hi> or <hi>periisse (ver. 6.)</hi> to
be of the same force as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Earth, in this Father's opinion, were as really chang'd and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
at the time of the Flood, as they will be at the Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But we must not expect from S. <hi>Austin,</hi> or any of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents

Here you see S. <hi>Austin</hi>'s sence upon the whole matter; which
is this, That the Natural World, the Earth with the Heavens about
it, was destroyed and chang'd at the Deluge into the present Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
and Earth; which shall again in like manner be destroyed and
chang'd by the last Fire. Accordingly in another place, to add no
more,<note place="margin">cap. 16.</note> he saith the figure of the (sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

the same World <hi>(namely, as to the matter and substance of it)</hi> which
mankind lives in now, and did live in before the Flood, but yet that is
truly call'd the ORIGINAL WORLD, being as it were ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the present. For 'tis said in the sequel of this Epistle that the
World that was then, perish'd in the Deluge; namely, The regions of
the air were consumed by the height and excess of the waters, and by the
same waters the Earth was chang'd into another form or face. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
some Mountains and Valleys are thought to have been made from
the beginning, yet not such great ones as now we see throughout the whole
Earth.</p>
                  <p>You see this Author does not only own a change made at the
Deluge, but offers at a further explication wherein that change con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted,
<hi>viz.</hi> That the Mountains and inequalities of the Earth were
made greater than they were before the Flood; and so he makes
the change or the difference betwixt the two Worlds gradual, rather
than specifical, if I may so term it. But we cannot wonder at that,
if he had no principles to carry it further, or to make any other
sort of change intelligible to him.<note place="margin">De 6. dier. creat.</note>

But if they believe neither past nor to come, in a natural sence,

the Vicissitudes of Nature and a Triple World; The Apostle
in this discourse does formally distinguish Three Worlds (for 'tis
well known that the <hi>Hebrows</hi> have no word to signifie the Natural
World, but use that Periphrass, <hi>The Heavens</hi> and <hi>the Earth)</hi> and
upon each of them engraves a Name and Title that bears a note of
distinction in it; He calls them the <hi>Old Heavens and Earth,</hi> the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seut

these Three are one, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o Matter and Substance; but they must dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
as to Form and Properties; otherwise what is the ground of this
distinction and of these three different appe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lations? Suppose the <hi>Iews</hi>
had expected <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Temple for the Third, and Last, and most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
and that in the time of the Second Temple they had spoke of
them with this distinction, or under these different names, The <hi>Old
Temple,</hi> the <hi>Present Temple,</hi> and the <hi>New Temple</hi> we expect: Would
any have understood those Three of one and the same Temple; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
demolish'd, never chang'd, never rebuilt; always the same both
as to Materials and Form? no, doubtless, but of Three several Temples
succeeding one another. And have we not the same reason to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
this Temple of the World, whereof S. <hi>Peter</hi> speaks, to be
threefold in succession; seeing he does as plainly distinguish it into
the <hi>Old</hi> heavens and earth, the <hi>Present</hi> heavens and earth, and the
<hi>New</hi> heavens and earth. And I do the more willingly use this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of the Temple, because it hath been thought an Emblem of
the outward World.</p>
                  <p>I know we are naturally averse to entertain any thing that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with the general frame and texture of our own thoughts;
That's to begin the World again; and we often reject such things
without examination. Neither do I wonder that the generality of
Interpreters beat down the Apostle's words and sence to their own
notions; They had no other grounds to go upon, and Men are not
willing, especially in natural and comprehensible things, to put such
a meaning upon Scripture, as is unintelligible to themselves; They
rather venture to offer a little violence to the words, that they may
pitch the sence at such a convenient height, as their Principles will
reach to. And therefore though some of our modern Interpreters,
whom I mention'd before, have been sensible of the natural tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of this discourse of S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, and have much ado to bear of the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:41970:219"/>
force of the words, so as not to acknowledge that they import a
real diversity betwixt the two Worlds spoken of; yet having no
Principles to guide or support them in following that Tract, they
are forc'd to stop or divert another way. 'Tis like entering into the
mouth of a Cave, we are not willing to venture further than the
light goes. Nor are they much to blame for this; the fault is only
in those Persons that continue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wilfully in their darkness, and when
they cannot otherwise resist the light, shut their eyes against it, or
turn their head another way.—but I am afraid I have staid too
long upon this argument: not for my own sake, but to satisfie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>You may please to remember that all that I have said hitherto, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
only to the first Head: To prove a <hi>Diversity in general</hi> betwixt
the Ante-diluvian Heavens and Earth, and the present: not expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
what their particular form was. And this general diversity may
be argued also by observations taken from <hi>Moses</hi> his History of the
World, before and after the Flood. From the Longevity of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tediluvians:
The Rain-bowu appearing after the Deluge: and the
breaking open an Abyss capable to overflow the Earth. The Heavens
that had no Rain-bow,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>See</hi> Theor. Book 2. ch. 5.</note> and under whose benign and steddy influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
Men liv'd seven, eight, nine hundred years and upwards,
must have been of a different aspect and constitution from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Heavens. And that Earth that had such an Abyss, that the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of it made an universal Deluge, must have been of another
form than the present Earth. And those that will not admit a diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
in the two worlds, are bound to give us an intelligible account
of these Phaenomena: How they could possibly be in Heavens and
Earth, like the present. Or if they were there once, why they do
not continue so still, if Nature be the same.</p>
                  <p>We need say no more, as to the Ante-diluvian Heavens: but as
to the Earth, we must now, according to the second Part of the
first Head; enquire, If that <hi>Particular Form,</hi> which we have assign'd
it before the Flood, be agreeable to Scripture. You know how we
have describ'd the Form and situation of that Earth: namely, that
it was built over the Abyss, as a regular Orb, covering and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
the waters round about: and founded, as it were, upon them.
There are many passages of Scripture that favour this description:
Some more expresly, others upon a due explication. To this purpose
there are two express Texts in the Psalms: as <hi>Psal. 24. 1, 2. The Earth
is the Lords, and the fulness thereof: The habitable World, and they that
dwell therein. FOR he has founded it upon</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">I know some would make this place of no effect by rendering the <hi>Hebrew</hi> particle <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> 
                        <hi>juxta, by</hi> or <hi>near</hi> to; so they would read it thus, <hi>He hath founded the Earth by the Sea-side,</hi> and establish'd it by the Floods. What is there wonderful in this, that the shores should lie by the Sea-side; Where could they lie else? What reason or argument is this, why the Earth should be the Lord's? The Earth is the Lord's, <hi>for</hi> he hath founded it <hi>near</hi> the Seas, Where is the consequence of this? But if he founded it upon the Seas which could not be done by any other hand but his, it shows both the Workman and the Master. And accordingly in that other place, <hi>Psal.</hi> 136. 6. if you render it, he <hi>stretched</hi> out the Earth <hi>near</hi> the Waters. How is that one of God's great wonders? as it is there represented to be. Because in some few places this particle is render'd otherwise, where the sense will bear it, must we therefore render it so when we please, and where the sence will not bear it?

the Waters, is not this the Earth we have describ'd? the first
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:41970:220"/>
Earth, as it came from the hands of its Maker. Where can we now
find in Nature, such an Earth as has the Seas and the Water for its
foundation? Neither is this Text without a second, as a fellow-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to confirm the same truth: For in the 136. <hi>Psal. ver.</hi> 4, 5, 6.
we read to the same effect, in these words: <hi>To him, who alone does
great wonders: To him that by wisdom made the Heavens's To him that
stretchèd out the Earth above the Waters.</hi> We can hardly express that
form of the Ante-diluvian Earth, in words more determinate than
these are; Let us then in the same simplicity of heart, follow the
words of Scripture; seeing this literal sence is not repugnant to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but, on the contrary, agreeable to it upon the strictest exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
And we cannot, without some violence, turn the words to
any other sence. What tolerable interpretation can these admit of,
if we do not allow the Earth ones to have encompass'd and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread
the face of the Waters? To be <hi>founded</hi> upon the waters, to be
<hi>establish'd</hi> upon the waters, to be <hi>extended</hi> upon the waters, what
rational or satisfactory account can be given of these phrases and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
from any thing we find in the present situation of the Earth:
or how can they be verified concerning it? Consult Interpreters, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
or modern, upon these two places: see if they answer your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
or answer the natural importance of the words, unless
they acknowledge another form of the Earth, than the present. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
a Rock hangs its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ose over the Sea, must the body of the Earth
be said to be <hi>stretched over the wàters?</hi> Or because there are waters
in some subterraneous cavities, is the Earth therefore <hi>founded upon
the Seas?</hi> Yet such lame explications as these you will meet with;
and while we have no better light, we must content our selves with
them; but when an explication is offer'd, that answers the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
force, and extent of the words, to reject it, onely because it is
not fitted to our former opinions, or because we did not first think
of it, is to take an ill method in expounding Scripture. This <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi>
or <hi>Establishment</hi> of the Earth upon the Seas, this <hi>Extension</hi> of
it above the waters, relates plainly to the body, or whole circuit of
the Earth, not to parcels and particles of it; as appears from the
occasion, and its being joyn'd with the Heavens, the other part of
the World. Besides, <hi>David</hi> is speaking of the Origin of the World,
and of the Divine power and wisdom in the construction and situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Earth, and these attributes do not appear from the holes
of the Earth, and broken Rocks; which have rather the face of a
ruin, than of wisdom; but in that wonderful libration and expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the first Earth over the face of the waters, sustained by its
own proportions, and the hand of his Providence.</p>
                  <p>These two places in the Psalms being duly consider'd, we shall
more easily understand a third place, to the same effect, in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs;</hi>
delivered by <hi>WISDOM,</hi> concerning the Origin of the World,
and the form of the first Earth, in these words, <hi>Chap. 8. 27. When
he prepared the Heavens I was there, when HE SET an Orb or Sphere
upon the face of the Abyss.</hi> We render it, when we set a <hi>Compass</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the face of the Abyss; but if we have rightly interpreted the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>David,</hi> 'tis plain enough what compass is here to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood;
not an imaginary circle, (for why should that be thought one
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:41970:220"/>
of the wonderful works of God) but that exterior Orb of the Earth
that was set upon the waters. That was the Master-piece of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
art in framing of the first Earth, and therefore very fit to be
taken notice of by <hi>Wisdom.</hi> And upon this occasion, I desire you to
reflect upon St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s expression, concerning the first Earth, and to
compare it with <hi>Solomon</hi>'s, to see if they do not answer one another.
St. <hi>Peter calls it, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, An Earth consisting, standing,</hi>
or <hi>sustained by the waters.</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi> calls it <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>An

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> by the <hi>wisdom of God:</hi> which is the same <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> or
<hi>wisdom,</hi> that here declares her self, to have been present at this work.
Add now to these two places, the two foremention'd out of the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist;
<hi>An Earth founded upon the Seas,</hi> (Psal. 24. 2.) and an <hi>Earth
stretched out above the waters: (Psal. 136. 6.)</hi> Can any body doubt or
question, but all these four Texts refer to the same thing? And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s description refers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>rtainly to the Ante-diluvian Earth,
they must all refer to it; and do all as certainly and evidently agree
with our Theory concerning the form and situation of it.</p>
                  <p>The pendulous form and posture of that first Earth being prov'd
from these four places, 'tis more easie and emphatical to interpret
in this sence that passage in <hi>Iob ch. 26. 7. He stretcheth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ut the North
over the Tohu,</hi> (for so it is in the original) <hi>and hangeth the Earth upon
nothing.</hi> And this strange foundation or no foundation of the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Earth seems to be the ground of those noble questions propos'd
to <hi>Iob</hi> by God Almighty, <hi>Ch. 38. Where wast thou when I laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of the Earth? Declare if thou hast understanding. Whereupon are
the foundations thereof fastned, and who laid the corner-stone?</hi> There was
neither foundation, nor corner-stone, in that piece of Architecture;
and that was it which made the art and wonder of it. But I have
spoken more largely to these places in the Theory it self.<note place="margin">Book 1. p. 88.</note> And if the
four Texts before-mentioned be consider'd without prejudice, I think
there are few matters of natural Speculation that can be so well
prov'd out of Scripture, as the Form which we have given to the
Ante-diluvian Earth.</p>
                  <p>But yet it may be thought a just, if not a necessary appendix to
this discourse, concerning the form of the Ante-diluvian Earth, to
give an account also of the <hi>Ante-diluvian Abyss,</hi> and the situation of
it according to Scripture; for the relation which these two have
to one another, will be a further means to discover if we have right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
determin'd the form of that Earth. The <hi>Abyss</hi> or <hi>Tehom-Rabbah</hi> is
a Scripture notion, and the word is not us'd, that I know of, in that
distinct and peculiar sence in Heathen Authors. 'Tis plain that in
Scripture it is not always taken for the Sea (as <hi>Gen. 1. 2. &amp; 7. 11. &amp;
49. 25. Deut. 33. 13. Iob 28. 14. &amp; 38. 16. Psal. 33. 7. &amp; 71. 20 &amp; 78. 15.
&amp; 135. 6. Apoc. 20. 1. 3.)</hi> but for some other mass of waters, or subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous
store-house. And this being observ'd, we may easily disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the nature, and set down the History of the Scripture-Abyss.</p>
                  <p>The Mother-Abyss is no doubt that in the beginning of <hi>Genesis, v.</hi> 2.
which had nothing but darkness upon the face of it, or a thick caligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
air. The next news we hear of this Abyss is at the Deluge, <hi>(Gen. 7.
11.)</hi> where 'tis said to be broke open, and the waters of it to have
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:41970:221"/>
drowned the World. It seems then this Abyss was clos'd up some
time betwixt the Creation and the Deluge, and had got another
cover than that of darkness. And if we will believe <hi>Wisdom, (Prov.
8. 27.)</hi> who was there present at the formation of the Earth, an <hi>Orb
was set upon the face of the Abyss</hi> at the beginning of the World.</p>
                  <p>That these three places refer to the same Abyss, I think, cannot
be questioned by any that will compare them and consider them.
That of the Deluge, <hi>Moses</hi> calls there <hi>Tehom-Rabbah,</hi> the <hi>Great Abyss;</hi>
and can there be any greater than the forementioned Mother-Abyss?
And <hi>WISDOME,</hi> in that place in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> useth the same
phrase and words with <hi>Moses, Gen. 1. 2. <gap reason="foreign">

vault it lay, and under this cover, when the Psalmist speaks of it
in these words <hi>(Psal. 33. 7. He gathereth the waters of the Sea, as in a</hi>

                     <hi>bag; he layeth up the Abyss in store-houses.</hi> Lastly, we may observe
that 'twas this Mother-Abyss whose womb was burst at the Deluge,
when the Sea was born, and broke forth as if it had issued out of a
womb; as God expresseth it to <hi>Iob, ch.</hi> 38. 8. in which place the
<hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrase reads it, when it broke forth, <hi>coming out of the
Abyss.</hi> Which disruption at the Deluge seems also to be alluded to
<hi>Iob</hi> 12. 14, 15. and more plainly, <hi>Prov. 3. 20. by his knowledge the
Abysses are broken up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you have already a threefold state of the Abyss, which
makes a short History of it; first, <hi>Open,</hi> at the beginning; then <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,</hi>
till the Deluge. Then <hi>broke open</hi> again, as it is at present. And
we pursue the History of it no further; but we are told, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20. 3.
That it shall be shut up again, and the great Dragon in it, for a
Thousand years. In the mean time we may observe from this form
and posture of the Ante diluvian Abyss, how suitable it is and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
with that form of the Ante-diluvian Earth which St. <hi>Peter</hi> and
the <hi>Psalmist</hi> had describ'd, <hi>sustain'd by the waters; founded upon the
waters; stretcht above the waters;</hi> for if it was the cover of this Abyss
(and it had some cover that was broke at the Deluge) it was spread
as a Crust or Ice upon the face of those waters, and so made an
<hi>Orbis Terrarum,</hi> an habitable sphere of Earth about the Abyss.</p>
                  <p>SO much for the form of the Ante-diluvian Earth and Abyss;
which as they aptly correspond to one another, so, you see, our
Theory answers and is adjusted to both; and, I think, so fitly, that
we have no reason hitherto to be displeas'd with the success we have
had in the examination of it, according to Scripture. We have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd
the two main points in question, first, to prove a diversity
in general betwixt the two natural Worlds, or betwixt the Heavens
and the Earth before and after the Flood. Secondly, to prove where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this diversity consisted; or that the particular form of the Ante-diluvian
Heavens and Earth was such according to Scripture, as we
have describ'd it in the Theory. You'l say, then the work is done,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:41970:221"/>
what needs more, all the rest follows of course; for if the Antedilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian
Earth had such a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>orm as we have propos'd and prov'd it to
have had, there could be no Deluge in it but by a dissolution of its
parts and exteriour frame: And a Deluge so made, would not be
in the nature of a standing Pool, but of a violent agitation and
commotion of the Waters. This is true; These parts of the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
are so cemented, that you must grant all, if you grant any. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we will try if even these two particulars also may be prov'd
out of Scripture; That is, if there be any marks or memorandums
left there by the Spirit of God, of such a fraction or dissolution of
the Earth at the Deluge. And also such characters of the Deluge
it self, as show it to have been by a fluctuation and impetuous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
of the Waters.</p>
                  <p>To proceed then; That there was a Fraction or Dissolution of the
Earth at the Deluge, the history of it by <hi>Moses</hi> gives us the first
account, seeing he tells us, as the principol cause of the Flood, That
the Fountains of the <hi>Great Abyss</hi> were <hi>cloven</hi> or <hi>burst asunder;</hi> and
upon this disruption the waters gush'd out from the bowels of the
Earth, as from the widen'd mouths of so many Fountains. I do not
take <hi>Fountains</hi> there to signifie any more than Sources or Stores of
Water; noting also this manner of their eruption from below, or
out of the ground, as Fountains do. Accordingly in the <hi>Proverbs,
(chap. 3. 20.)</hi> 'tis only said, the <hi>Abysses were broken open.</hi> I do not doubt
but this refers to the Deluge, as <hi>Bede,</hi> and others understand it; the
very word being us'd here,<note place="margin">

was first brought to light; when after many pangs and throes and
dilacerations of her body, Nature was delivered of a burthen which
she had born in her Womb Sixteen Hundred Years.</p>
                  <p>These three places I take to be memorials and proofs of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of the Earth, or of the Abyss, at the universal Deluge. And
to these we may add more out of the Prophets, <hi>Iob,</hi> and the <hi>Psalms,</hi>
by way of allusion (commonly) to the state of Nature at that time.
The Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> in describing the future destruction of the World,
<hi>chap.</hi> 24. 18, 19. seems plainly to allude and have respect to the past
destruction of it at the Deluge; as appears by that leading expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>the windows from an high are open, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi>
taken manifestly from <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 11. Then
see how the description goes on, <hi>the windows from an high are open,
and the foundations of the Earth do shake. The Earth is utterly broken
down, the Earth is quite dissolv'd, the Earth is exceedingly moved.</hi> Here
are Concussions, and Fractions, and dissolutions, as there were in
the Mundane Earth-quake and Deluge; which we had exprest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
only by <hi>breaking open the Abyss.</hi> By the Foundations of the Earth
here and elsewhere, I perceive many understand the Centre; so by
<hi>moving</hi> or <hi>shaking</hi> the foundations, or putting them out of course,
must be understood a displacing of the Centre; which was really
done at the Deluge,<note place="margin">Theor. book 2. p. 194, 195.</note> as we have shewn in its proper place. If we
therefore remember that there was both a dislocation, as I may so
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:41970:222"/>
say; and a fraction in the body of the Earth, by that great fall;
a dislocation as to the Centre, and a fraction as to the Surface and
Exterior Region, it will truly answer to all those expressions in the
Prophet, that seem so strange and extraordinary. Tis true, this
place of the Prophet respects also and foretels the future destruction
of the World; but that being by Fire, when the <hi>Elements shall melt
with fervent heat, and the Earth with the works therein shall be burnt up,</hi>
these expressions of <hi>fractions and concussions,</hi> seem to be taken origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
from the manner of the World's first destruction, and to be
transferr'd, by way of application, to represent and signifie the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
destruction of it, though, it may be, not with the same exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and propriety.</p>
                  <p>There are several other places that refer to the dissolution and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of the Earth at the Deluge: <hi>Amos 9. 5, 6. The Lord of Hosts
is he that toucheth the Earth, and it shall melt, or be dissolv'd—and
it shall rise up wholly like a Flood, and shall be drowned as by the
Flood of Egypt.</hi> By <hi>this</hi> and by <hi>the next verse</hi> the Prophet seems to
allude to the Deluge, and to the dissolution of the Earth that was
then. This in <hi>Iob</hi> seems to be call'd <hi>breaking down the Earth, and
overturning the Earth,</hi> Chap. 12. 14, 15. Behold he breaketh down and
it cannot be built again, He sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

opening. Behold, he witholdeth the waters, and they dry up; also he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>endeth them out, and they overturn the <hi>Earth:</hi> Which place you may
see paraphras'd, <hi>Theor. Book 1. p.</hi> 91, 92. We have already cited, and
shall hereafter cite, other places out of <hi>Iob;</hi> And as that Ancient
Author (who is thought to have liv'd before the Judaical Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray,
and nearer to <hi>Noah</hi> than <hi>Moses)</hi> seems to have had the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
a Noachidarum,</hi> so also he seems to have had the <hi>Dogmata Noachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darum;</hi>
which were deliver'd by <hi>Noah</hi> to his Children and Posterity,
concerning the mysteries of Natural Providence, the origine and
fate of the World, the Deluge and Ante-diluvian state, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
we find many strictures of these doctrines in the Book of <hi>Iob.</hi>
Lastly, In the Psalms there are Texts that mention the <hi>shaking of
the Earth,</hi> and the <hi>foundations</hi> of the World, in reference to the
Flood, if we judge aright; whereof we will speak under the next
Head, <hi>concerning</hi> the raging of the Waters in the Deluge.</p>
                  <p>These places of Scripture may be noted, as left us to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancers
of that general ruine and disruption of the Earth at the time
of the Deluge. But I know it will be said of them, That they are
not strict proofs, but allusions only. Be it so; yet what is the ground
of those allusions? something must be alluded to, and something
that hath past in Nature, and that is recorded in Sacred History; and
what is that, unless it be the Universal Deluge, and that change
and disturbance that was then in all Nature. If others say, that
these and such like places are to be understood morally and allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically,
I do not envy them their interpretations; but when Nature
and Reason will bear a literal sence, the rule is, that we should not
recede from the Letter. But I leave these things to every one's
thoughts; which the more calm they are, and the more impartial,
the more easily they will feel the impressions of Truth. In the mean
time, I proceed to the last particular mention'd, <hi>The form of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
it self.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:41970:222"/>
This we suppose to have been not in the way of a standing Pool,
the Waters making an equal Surface, and an equal heighth every
where; but that the extreme heighth of the Waters was made by
the extreme agitation of them; caus'd by the weight and force of
great Masses or Regions of Earth falling at once into the Abyss; by
which means, as the Waters in some places were prest out, and
thrown at an excessive height into the Air, so they would also in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
places gape, and lay bare even the bottom of the Abyss; which
would look as an open Grave ready to swallow up the Earth, and
all it bore. Whilst the Ark, in the mean time, falling and rising by these
gulphs and precipices, sometimes above water, and sometimes under,
was a true Type of the state of the Church in this World; And to
this time and state <hi>David</hi> alludes in the name of the Church, <hi>Psal. 42. 7.
Abyss calls unto Abyss at the noise of thy Cataracts or Water-spouts; All
thy waves and billows have gone over me.</hi> And again, <hi>Psal.</hi> 46. 2, 3. In
the name of the Church, <hi>Therefore will not we fear, tho' the Earth be
removed, and tho' the mountains be carried into the midst of the Seas.
The waters thereof roar and are troubled, the mountains shake with the
swelling thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But there is no description more remarkable or more eloquent,
than of that Scene of things represented, <hi>Psal. 18. 7, 8, 9, &amp;c.</hi> which
still alludes, in my opinion, to the Deluge-scene, and in the name
of the Church. We will set down the words at large.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 6. In my distress I called upon the Lord, and cryed unto my God;
He heard my voice out of his Temple, and my cry came before him into
his ears.</p>
                  <p>7. Then the Earth shook and trembled, the foundations also of the hills
moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.</p>
                  <p>8. There went up a smoke from his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth
devoured; Coals were kindled by it.</p>
                  <p>9. He bowed the Heavens also and came down, and darkness was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his feet.</p>
                  <p>10. And he rode upon a Cherub and did flie, he did flie upon the wings
of the wind.</p>
                  <p>11. He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him
was dark waters and thick clouds of the skie.</p>
                  <p>12. At the brightness before him the thick clouds passed, hail and coals
of fire.</p>
                  <p>13. The Lord also thunder'd in the Heavens, and the Highest gave his
voice, hail and coals of fire.</p>
                  <p>14. Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scatter'd them: and he shot out
lightnings and discoinfited them.</p>
                  <p>15. Then the Chanels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the
World were discovered; at thy rebuke, O Lord, at the blast of the breath
of thy nostrils.</p>

                     </note> he took me; he drew me out of great waters.</p>
                  <p>This I think is a rough* draught of the face of the Heavens and
the Earth at the Deluge, as the last Verses do intimate; and 'tis ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:41970:223"/>
to express the dangers and deliverances of the Church: The
Expressions are far too high to be applyed to <hi>David</hi> in his Person, and
to his deliverance from <hi>Saul;</hi> no such agonies or disorders of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as are here instanc'd in, were made in <hi>David<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>s time, or upon his
account; but 'tis a Scheme of the Church, and of her fate, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
as represented by the Ark, in that dismal distress, when all
nature was in confusion. And though there may be some things here
intermixt to make up the Scene, that are not so close to the subject
as the rest, or that may be referr'd to the future destruction of the
World: yet that is not unusual, nor amiss, in such descriptions,
if the great strokes be fit and rightly plac'd. That there was Smoke,
and Fire, and Water, and Thunder, and Darkness, and Winds,
and Earth-quakes at the Deluge, we cannot doubt, if we consider the
circumstances of it; Waters dash'd and broken make a smoke and
darkness,<note place="margin">See <hi>Philo Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeus</hi> his descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Deluge, both as to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions of the Heavens, and the fractions of the Earth. In his first Treatise de <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahamo,</hi> mihi, <hi>p.</hi> 279.</note> and no Hurricano could be so violent as the motions of
the Air at that time; Then the Earth was torn in pieces, and its Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
shaken; And as to Thunder and Lightning, the encounters
and collisions of the mighty Waves, and the cracks of a falling
World, would make flashes and noises, far greater and more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,
than any that can come from vapours and clouds. There was
an Universal Tempest, a conflict and clashing of all the Elements;
and <hi>David</hi> seems to have represented it so; with God Almighty in
the midst of it, ruling them all.</p>
                  <p>But I am apt to think some will say, all this is Poetical in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
and these are Hyperbolical and figurate expressions, from
which we cannot make any inference, as to the Deluge and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
World. 'Tis true, those that have no Idea of the Deluge, that
will answer to such a Scene of things, as is here represented, must
give such a slight account of this Psalm. But on the other hand, if
we have already an Idea of the Deluge that is rational, and also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
to Scripture upon other proofs, and the description here
made by the Prophet answer to that Idea, whether then is it not
more reasonable to think that it stands upon that ground, than to
think it a meer fancy and Poetical Scene of things: This is the true
state of the case, and that which we must judge of. Methinks 'tis
very harsh to suppose all this a bare fiction, grounded upon no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of fact, upon no Sacred Story, upon no appearance of God in
Nature. If you say it hath a moral signification, so let it have, we
do not destroy that; it hath reference no doubt, to the dangers and
deliverances of the Church; but the question is, whether the words
and natural sence be a fancy only, a bundle of randome hyperboles:
or whether they relate to the history of the Deluge, and the state
of the Ark there representing the Church. This makes the Sence
doubly rich, Historically and Morally; and grounds it upon Scripture
and Reason, as well as upon Fancy.</p>
                  <p>That violent eruption of the Sea out of the Womb of the Earth,
which <hi>Iob</hi> speaks of, is, in my judgment, another description of the
Deluge; 'Tis <hi>Chap. 38. 8, 9, 10, 11. Who shut up the Sea with doors,
when it broke forth, as if it had issued out of a Womb; When I made the
eloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swadling band for it.
And broke up for it my decreed place—hitherto shalt thou come, &amp;c.</hi>
                     <pb n="181" facs="tcp:41970:223"/>
Here you see the birth and nativity of the Sea, or
of <hi>Oceanus,</hi> describ'd<note n="*" place="margin">Uti comparatio praecedens, <hi>Ver.</hi> 4, 5, 6. de ortu Telluris, simitur ab aedificio, ita haec altera de ortu maris, sumitur à par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Womb, and what his first garment and swadling
cloaths were; namely clouds and thick darkness.
This cannot refer to any thing, that I know of, but
to the face of Nature at the Deluge; when the Sea
was born, and wrapt up in clouds and broken waves,
and a dark impenetrable mist round the body of
the Earth. And this seems to be the very same that
<hi>David</hi> had exprest in his description of the Deluge, <hi>Psal. 18. 11. He made
darkness his secret place his pavilion round about him were d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rk waters and
thick clouds of the skies.</hi> For this was truly the face of the World in
the time of the Flood, tho' we little reflect upon it. And this dark con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
every where, above and below, arose from the violent and
confus'd motion of the Abyss;<note place="margin">See <hi>Theor.</hi> Book 1. p. 99.</note> which was dasht in pieces by the
falling Earth, and flew into the air in misty drops, as dust flies up
in a great ruin.</p>
                  <p>But I am afraid, we have stayed too long upon this particular, <hi>the
form of the Deluge;</hi> seeing 'tis but a Corollary from the precedent
article about the dissolution of the Earth. However time is not ill
spent about any thing that relates to natural Providence, whereof
the two most signal instances in our Sacred Writings, are, the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge</hi>
and the <hi>Conflagration.</hi> And seeing <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>David</hi> do often reflect
upon the works of God in the external creation, and upon the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations
of Providence, it cannot be imagin'd that they should
never reflect upon the Deluge; the most remarkable change of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that ever hath been, and the most remarkable judgment upon
mankind. And if they have reflected upon it any where, 'tis, I think,
in those places and those instances which I have noted; and if those
places do relate to the Deluge, they are not capable, in my judgment,
of any fairer or more natural interpretation than that which we
have given them; which, you see, how much it favours and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
our Theory.</p>
                  <p>I have now finisht the heads I undertook to prove, that I might
shew our Theory to agree with Scripture in these three principal
points; first, in that it supposeth a diversity and difference betwixt
the Ante-diluvian Heavens and Earth, and the present Heavens and
Earth. Secondly, in assigning the particular form of the Ante-dilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian
Earth and Abyss. Thirdly, in explaining the Deluge by a disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of that Earth, and an eruption of the Abyss. How far I have
succeeded in this attempt, as to others, I cannot tell; but I am sure
I have convinc'd my self, and am satisfied that my thoughts, in that
Theory, have run in the same tract with the holy Writings: with
the true intent and spirit of them. There are some persons that are
wilfully ignorant in certain things, and others that are willing to be
ignorant as the Apostle phraseth it; speaking of those Eternalists
that denied the doctrine of the change and revolutions of the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
World: And 'tis not to be expected but there are many still of
the same humour; and therefore may be called <hi>willingly ignorant,</hi>
that is, they will not use that pains and attention that is necessary
for the examination of such a doctrine, nor impartiality in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:41970:224"/>
after examination; they greedily lay hold on all evidence on
one side, and willingly forget, or slightly pass over, all evidence for
the other; this I think is the character of those that are <hi>willingly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant;</hi>
for I do not take it to be so deep as a down-right wilful ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
where they are plainly conscious to themselves of that
wilfulness; but where an insensible mixture of humane passions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
them one way, and makes them averse to the other; and in
that method draws on all the consequences of a willing <hi>ignorance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There remains still, as I remember, one Proposition that I am
bound to make good; I said at first, that our Hypothesis concerning
the Deluge was more agreeable not only to Scripture in general, but
also to the particular History of the Flood left us by <hi>Moses;</hi> I say,
more agreeable to it than any other Hypothesis that hath yet been
propos'd. This may be made good in a few words. For in <hi>Moses'</hi>s
History of the Deluge there are two principal points, The extent
of the Deluge, and the Causes of it; and in both these we do fully
agree with that sacred Author. <hi>As to the extent of it,</hi> He makes the
Deluge universal; <hi>All the high hills under the whole heaven were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
fifteen cubits upwards;</hi> We also make it universal, over the
face of the whole Earth; and in such a manner as must needs raise
the waters above the top of the highest Hills every where. As <hi>to the
canses of it, Moses</hi> makes them to be the disruption of the <hi>Abyss,</hi> and
the <hi>Rains;</hi> and no more; and in this also we exactly agree with
him; we know no other causes, nor pretend to any other but those
two. Distinguishing therefore <hi>Moses</hi> his narration as to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and circumstances of it, it must be allowed that these two
points make the substance of it, and that an Hypothesis that differs
from it in either of these two, differs from it more than Ours;
which, at the worst, can but differ in matter of circumstance. Now
seeing the great difficulty about the Deluge is the quantity of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
required for it, there have been two explications proposed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
ours, to remove or satisfie this difficulty; One whereof makes
the Deluge not to have been universal, or to have reacht only <hi>Iudea</hi>
and some neighbouring Countries; and therefore less water would
suffice; The other owning the Deluge to be universal, supplies it
self with Water from the Divine Omnipotenty, and says <hi>new</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were created then for the nonce, and again annihilated when
the Deluge was to cease. Both these explications you see, (and I
know no more of note that are not obnoxious to the same excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
differ from <hi>Moses</hi> in the substance, or in one of the two sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
points, and consequently more than ours doth. The first
changeth the Flood into a kind of national inundation, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
assigns other causes of it than <hi>Moses</hi> had assigned. And as
they both differ apparently from the Mosaical History, so you may see
them refuted upon other grounds also, in the third Chapter of the
First Book of the Theory.</p>
                  <p>This may be sufficient as to the History of the Flood by <hi>Moses.</hi> But
possibly it may be said the principal objection will arise from <hi>Moses</hi>
his Six-days Creation in the first Chapter of <hi>Genesis:</hi> where another
sort of Earth, than what we have form'd from the Chaos, is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to us; namely, a Terraqueous Globe, such as our Earth is at
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:41970:224"/>
present. 'Tis indeed very apparent, that <hi>Moses</hi> hath accommodated
his Six days Creation to the present form of the Earth, or to that
which was before the eyes of the people when he writ. But it is a
great question whether that was ever intended for a true Physical
account of the origine of the Earth: or whether <hi>Moses</hi> did either
Philosophize or Astronomize in that description. The ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
when they answer the Heathens, and the adversaries of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
do generally deny it; as I am ready to make good upon
another occasion. And the thing it self bears in it evident marks of
an accommodation and condescention to the vulgar notions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the form of the World. Those that think otherwise, and would
make it literally and physically true in all the parts of it, I desire
them, without entring upon the strict merits of the cause, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
these Preliminaries. First, whether the whole universe rise
from a Terrestrial Chaos. Secondly, what Systeme of the World
this Six-days Creation proceeds upon: whether it supposes the
Earth, or the Sun, for the Center. Thirdly, Whether the Sun and
Fixt Stars are of a later date, and a later birth, than this Globe of
Earth. And lastly, Where is the Region of the Super-celestial Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
When they have determin'd these Fundamentals, we will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to other observations upon the Six-days work, which will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
assure us, that 'tis a narration suited to the capacity of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and not to the strict and physical nature of things. Besides, we
are to remember, that <hi>Moses</hi> must be so interpreted in the first Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Genesis,</hi> as not to interfere with himself in other parts of his
History; nor to interfere with S. <hi>Peter,</hi> or the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> or
any other Sacred Authors, when they treat of the same matter. Nor
lastly, so, as to be repugnant to clear and uncontested Science. For,
in things that concern the natural World, that must always be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted.</p>
                  <p>With these precautions, let them try if they can reduce that nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
of the Origine of the World, to physical truth; so as to be
consistent, both with Nature, and with Divine Revelation every
where. It is easily reconcileable to both, if we suppose it writ in a
Vulgar style, and to the conceptions of the People: And we cannot
deny that a Vulgar style is often made use of in the holy Writings.
How freely and unconcernedly does Scripture speak of God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
according to the opinions of the vulgar? of his <hi>passions, local mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
parts and members of his body.</hi> Which all are things that do not
belong, or are not compatible with the Divine Nature, according to
truth and Science. And if this liberty be taken, as to God himself,
much more may it be taken as to his works. And accordingly we see,
what motion the Scripture gives to the Sun: what figure to the
Earth: what figure to the Heavens: All according to the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of sence and popular credulity; without any remorse for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
transgressed the rules of intellectual truth.</p>
                  <p>This vulgar style of Scripture in describing the natures of things,
hath been often mistaken for the real sence, and so become a stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-block
in the way of truth. Thus the <hi>Anthropomorphites</hi> of old
contended for the humane shape of God, from the Letter of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and brought many express Texts for their purpose: but sound
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:41970:225"/>
reason at length, got the upper hand of Literal authority. Then,
several of the Christian Fathers contended, that there were no
<hi>Antipodes:</hi> and made that doctrine irreconcileable to Scripture. But
this also, after a while, went off, and yielded to reason and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Then, the Motion of the Earth must by no means be allow'd,
as being contrary to Scripture: for so it is indeed, according to the
Letter and Vulgar style. But all intelligent Persons see thorough
this Argument, and depend upon it no more in this case, than in
the former. Lastly, The original of the Earth from a Chaos, drawn
according to the rules of Physiology, will not be admitted: because
it does not agree with the Scheme of the Six-days Creation. But
why may not this be writ in a Vulgar style, as well as the rest?
Certainly there can be nothing more like a Vulgar style, than to set
God to <hi>work by the day,</hi> and in Six-days to finish his task: as he is
there represented. We may therefore probably hope that all these
disguises of truth will at length fall off, and that we shall see God
and his Works in a pure and naked Light.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have finish'd what I had to say in confirmation of this
Theory from Scripture. I mean of the former part of it, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
chiefly upon the Deluge, and the Ante-diluvian Earth. When
you have collated the places of Scripture, on either side, and laid
them in the balance, to be weigh'd one against another; If you do
but find them equal, or near to an equal poise, you know in whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Scale the Natural Reasons are to be laid: and of what weight
they ought to be in an argument of this kind. There is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt Scripture with Philosophy on its side, and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with Philosophy against it: when the question is concerning
the Natural World. And this is our Case: which I leave now to
the consideration of the unprejudic'd Reader: and proceed to the
Proof of the Second Part of the Theory.</p>
                  <p>THE later Part consists of the <hi>Conflagration of the World,</hi> and
the <hi>New Heavens</hi> and <hi>New Earth.</hi> And seeing there is no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
concerning the former of these two, our task will now lie in
a little compass. Being only this, To prove that there will be New
Heavens, and a New Earth, after the Conflagration. This, to my
mind, is sufficiently done already, in the first, second and third
Chapters of the <hi>4th.</hi> Book, both from Scripture and Antiquity,
whether Sacred or Prophane: and therefore, at present, we will
only make a short and easie review of Scripture-Testimonies, with
design chiefly to obviate and disappoint the Evasions of such,
as would beat down solid Texts into thin Metaphors and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories.</p>

of our Theory. For the Theory stands upon two Pillars, or two
Pedestals, The Ante-diluvian Earth and the Future Earth: or, in S.
<hi>Peter</hi>'s phrase, The Old Heavens and Earth, and the New Heavens
and Earth: And it cannot be shaken, so long as these two continue
firm and immoveable. We might now put an end to this Review,
but it may be expected possibly that we should say something con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Millennium:</hi> which we have, contrary to the general
Sentiment of the Modern <hi>Millenaries,</hi> plac'd in the <hi>Future</hi> Earth.
Our Opinion hath this advantage above others, that, all fanatical
pretensions to power and empire in this World, are, by these means,
blown away, as chaff before the wind. Princes need not fear to be
dethron'd, to make way to the Saints: nor Governments unhing'd,
that They may rule the World with a rod of Iron. These are the
effects of a wild Enthusiasm; seeing the very state which they aim
at, is not to be upon this Earth.</p>
                  <p>But that our sence may not be mistaken or misapprehended in
this particular, as if we thought the Christian Church would never,
upon this Earth, be in a better and happier posture than it is in at
present: We must distinguish betwixt a <hi>melioration</hi> of the World, if
you will allow that word: and a <hi>Millennium.</hi> We do not deny a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
and improvement of the Church, both as to Peace, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and Piety. That knowledge may increase, mens minds be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larg'd,
and Christian Religion better understood: That the power
of Antichrist shall be diminish'd, Persecution cease, Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
allow'd, amongst the Reformed: and a greater union and
harmony establish'd. That Princes will mind the publick good, more
than they do now; and be themselves better examples of Vertue
and true Piety. All this may be, and I hope will be, e're long. But
the <hi>Apocalyptical Millennium,</hi> or the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> is still another
matter. It differs not in degree only from the present state, but is a
new order of things: both in the Moral World and in the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;
and that cannot be till we come into the <hi>New Heavens</hi> and <hi>New
Earth.</hi> Suppose what Reformation you can in this World, there
will still remain many things inconsistent with the true Millennial
state. Antichrist, tho' weakned, will not be finally destroy'd till the
coming of our Saviour, nor Satan bound. And there will be always
Poverty, Wars, Diseases, Knaves and Hypocrites, in this World:
which are not consistent with the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> describes
it. <hi>Apoc. 21. 2, 3, 4, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You see now what our notion is of the Millennium, as we deny
this Earth to be the Seat of it. 'Tis the state that succeeds the first
Resurrection, when Satan is lockt up in the bottomless pit. The state
when the Martyrs are to return into Life, and wherein they are to
have the first lot and chief share. A state which is to last a thousand
years. <hi>And Blessed and Holy is he, that hath a part in it: on such the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
death hath no power, but they shall be Priests of God and Christ, and
shall reign with him a thousand years.</hi> If you would see more particular
reasons of our judgment in this case, why such a Millennium is not
to be expected in this World: they are set down in the <hi>8th.</hi> Chapt.
of the <hi>4th.</hi> Book, and we do not think it necessary that they should
be here repeated.</p>

                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:41970:227"/>
As to that dissertation that follows the Millennium, and reaches
to the Consummation of all things, seeing it is but problematical,
we leave it to stand or fall by the evidence already given. And should
be very glad to see the conjectures of others, more learned, in Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations
so abstruse and remote from common knowledge. They
cannot surely be thought unworthy or unfit for our Meditations,
seeing they are suggested to us by Scripture it self. And to what end
were they propos'd to us there, if it was not intended that they
should be understood, sooner or later?</p>
                  <p>I have done with this Review: and shall only add one or two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
upon the whole discourse, and so conclude. You have seen
the state of the Theory of the Earth, as to the <hi>Matter, Form,</hi> and
<hi>Proofs</hi> of it: both Natural and Sacred. If any one will substitute a
better in its place, I shall think my self more obliged to him, than
if he had shew'd me the Quadrature of the Circle. But it is not
enough to pick quarrels here and there: that may be done by any
writing, especially when it is of so great extent and comprehension.
They must build up, as well as pull down; and give us another
Theory instead of this, fitted to the same Natural History of the
Earth, according as it is set down in Scripture: and then let the
World take their choice. He that cuts down a Tree, is bound in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to plant two, because there is an hazard in their growth and
thriving.</p>
                  <p>Then as to those that are such rigorous Scripturists, as to require
plainly demonstrative and irresistible Texts for every thing they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
or believe; They would do well to reflect and consider,
whether, for every article in the three Creeds (which have no sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
from natural reason) they can bring such Texts of Scripture as
they require of others: or a fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>er and juster evidence, all things
consider'd, than we have done for the substance of this Theory. We
have not indeed said all that might be said, as to Antiquity: that
making no part in this Review, and being capable still of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.
But as to Scripture and Reason I have no more to add.
Those that are not satisfied with the proofs already produc'd upon
these two heads, are under a fate, good or bad, which is not in my
power to overcome.</p>
