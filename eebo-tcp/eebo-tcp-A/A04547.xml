            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle and Curteous Reader; hauing for many yeares paſt ſpent my time both in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, practiſing, and confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with others in, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſtudie of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicall Sciences, and through great paines and trauell, at the requeſt of diuers Worſhipfull Gentlemen. Merchants, and others of my very louing friends, haue at laſt collected and gathered together many excellent Rules and eaſie Abreuiations in the Science of Arithmatick, which at the entreaty, and by the meanes of the helpe of ſome of them, I haue at laſt made bold heere to preſent abroad vnto the worlds view, the firſt fruites of ſome idle houres ſtudie, the moſt part whereof I doe acknowledge to haue gotten by the practice and vſe of the moſt excellent Inſtrument, inuented by Maſter <hi>William Pratt,</hi> called, The Iewell of
<pb facs="tcp:8266:4"/>
Arithmatick in which I haue done the beſt of my Indeauours, not to hide that Tallent in the earth, which God hath beſtowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me for the benefit of others, but rather to his great glory and prayſe, and for the benefit of my Country, and for the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of all that are ſtudious in the Art of Numbers, I haue laboured to ſet it forth in the moſt briefe, plaine, and eaſie manner that I could fit for the vnderſtanding of the weakeſt and meaneſt capacitie. In which if any thing ſhall ſeeme obſcure or doubtful to any man, I could wiſh my ſelfe were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to reſolue his doubts, for I haue indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured to make the Rules as briefe, ſhort and eaſie, as I could deuiſe.</p>
            <p>In my firſt Book I haue intreated concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vulgar Arithmatick, with new inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of my owne, in all the firſt foure parts of Arithmatick, <hi>viz</hi> in <hi>Addition</hi> and <hi>Subtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> with two ſeuerall kinds of <hi>Multiplication,</hi> not charging of the memory, neuer extant before in any Author that I haue read, with foure ſeuerall kinds of <hi>Diuiſion,</hi> the latter of them bringing the proofe by <hi>Addition</hi> of the figures vnder the diuidend, without any multiplication, or caſting away of nines, according to the accuſtomed manner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8266:5"/>Againe, in the worke of Fractions, I haue ſet them forth in plaine and perfit figures after another manner of my owne inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe the fractionall figures in moſt bookes of Arithmatick were ſo vnperfit, that they were ſcarce to be deſcerned, and in this manner they will performe all facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall operations, as well as if they were ſet out according to the vſuall manner. In the end of which Rules I haue ſhewed the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and proofes of fractions by the known parts of Coyne.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in the ſecond part of the former booke, I haue ſet forth Reduction, both in Coyne ſterling `waights, meaſures, time and motion; the Tables whereof are in the firſt part of the book, with diuers Rules how to bring pence, or farthings at the firſt worke into pounds, ſhillings and pence; with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers queſtions wrought by Reduction, with Progreſsion Arithmaticall and Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricall, with examples.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, I haue ſhewed how to worke the Rule of 3 Direct and Conuerſt, both in whole numbers and fractions, after diuers ſeuerall manners of workings, and how to find the diuiſor in any queſtion, as alſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers wayes to worke Fellowſhip, Barter,
<pb facs="tcp:8266:5"/>
Exchange, Allegation, Intereſt, Poſition, and all other operations Arithmeticall, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples and briefe Rules of euery part.</p>
            <p>In my ſecond booke of Decimall Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, I haue firſt deſcribed out the parts and vſe of the decimall Table, and how to ſet forth any number giuen in Decimalls.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I haue ſhewed how to worke all the ſeuerall parts of Arithmatick, <hi>viz. Numeration, Addition, Subtraction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Multiplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>Diuiſion</hi> in Decimalls; with examples and proofes of euery worke in the knowne parts of Coyne.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I haue handled in as briefe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as I could, the Rule of 3 Fellowſhip, Barter, Exchange and Intereſt in Decimall Arithmatick, as before in vulgar, in which you may perceiue the great labour that is auoided, in vulgar Arithmatick, with diuers examples and proofes of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I haue added a ſmall Treatice of <hi>Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Annuities;</hi> with the manner how to calculate Tables or Breuiats at any rate, or yeares purchaſe giuen; all which I haue drawne into a pocket vollume. If therefore any Gentleman, Merchant, or other, be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to haue further inſtruction, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire to my lodging in <hi>Coleman-ſtreet,</hi> I ſhall

                        <p>If a number be giuen, whoſe value is to be expreſſed, you ſhall vnderſtand, that the figure next the right hand is the leaſt in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lew, and ſignifieth ſimply his owne valew, as the figure of 1 doth ſignifie but one, and the figure of 2 doth ſignifie but two, and the figure of 8 ſignifies but eight, and ſo of any other. And in the ſecond place towards the left hand, euery figure is in valew tenne, ſo that the figure of one there doth ſignifie tenne, the figure of 2 twenty, the figure of 8 eightie, and ſo of all other: in the third place towards the left hand, euery figure is in valew one hundred, ſo that the figure 1 in that place ſignifies one hundred, the 2, two hundred, &amp;c. In the fourth place, euery fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure is in valew one thouſand, ſo there the figure of one ſignifies one thouſand, the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure 2, two thouſand, &amp;c. In the fifth place, euery figure is in value ten thouſand: in the ſixth place, one hundred thouſand; and in the ſeuenth place, one thouſand thouſands, or one million: in the eight place, ten mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions: in the ninth place, one hundred mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions:
<pb facs="tcp:8266:11"/>
in the tenth place, one thouſand mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, or one milliot; and ſo infinitely names may be giuen to the valew of euery pricke, as is vſuall in the ſecond part of Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, of Number, Square, Cube, ſurſolid, &amp;c. or in Aſtronomicall Arithmetick, Primes, Seconds, Thirds, Fourths and Fifths, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Now to expreſſe the valew of any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber giuen, ſet a prick with the pen ouer the fourth figure towards the left hand, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the ſeuenth, and tenth; and ſo ouer eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry third figure towards the left hand, to the end of your figures, as in this Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</p>

                        <p>The ſureſt proofe of Subtraction is made by Addition: for if you doe adde the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers remaining, vnto the numbers deduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they will returne your former Summe, if the worke be truly wrought, as wil appeare in the proofe of all the ſeueral examples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore going, and therefore here againe in this place needleſſe to be rehearſed.
