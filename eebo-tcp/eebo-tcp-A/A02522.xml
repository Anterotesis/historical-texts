         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

counted thee blessed; euen the Queene, and the
Concubines, and they haue praised thee: thou art

from the Gentiles, not of Israel from it selfe: yours

your owne profession: But therefore Israel must be
holy: If any man denie holinesse to be required of

Nehem. 9. 2. The Israelites separated themselues
from the strangers, which were Infidels: whether in
their marriage, or deuotion: Neither Gods seruice,
nor an Israelites bedde was for Heathens. This was
not the constituting of a new Church, but reforming
of the olde: If therefore you can parallell vs with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,

if <hi>Peter</hi> charged his auditors to saue themselues from

acknowledge (especially during the time of Queene

forwardnesse of Reformation: for both the Popes
Supremacy was abrogated, the true doctrine of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification

godly Ministers required, their absences and mis-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaners

and priuately inioyned to be read, and receiued,
the word of God commaunded to be sincerely and
carefully preached:<note place="margin">Act &amp; Monum Edit. 5. p. 1002.</note> and to all this, holy Master <hi>Foxe</hi>
addeth for my conclusion, such a vigilant care was
then in the King and his Councell, how by all wayes
and meanes to redresse Religion, to reforme errours,
to correct corrupt customes, to helpe ignorance,
and to reduce the mis-leadings of Christs Flocke,
drowned in blinde Popery, superstitious customes,
and Idolatry to some better forme of Reformation,
whereunto he prouided not onely these Articles,
Precepts, Iniunctions aboue specified, to inform the
rude people, but also procured the Bishops to helpe
forward the same cause of decayed doctrine,<note place="margin">Bar. ag. Gyff. Conference. with Sperin. &amp; M. Egerton.</note> with
their diligent preaching, and teaching of the people.
Goe now &amp; say, that suddenly in one day, by Queen
<hi>Elizabeths</hi> trumpet,<note place="margin">Greenw. &amp; Bar. Arg. to M. Car. twr. M. Trauers, M. Chark.</note> or by the sound of a Bell, in the

Goe, say with your Patriarch that wee erect Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by Proclamations,<note place="margin">Browne Reform. without. tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> and Parliaments.</p>
            <p>Vpon these premises I dare conclude, and doubt
not to maintaine against all Separatists in the world
that England (to goe no higher) had in the daies of
King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, a true visible Church of God,
and so by consequent their succeeding seede was by
true Baptisme iustly admitted into the bosome ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and therefore that euen of them without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
profession, Gods Church was truly constituted:
If you shall say that the following Idolatrie of some
of them in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> daies excluded them:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3818:19"/>
Consider how hard it will be to prooue that Gods
couenant with any people, is presently disanulled
by the sinnes of the most, whether of ignorance, or
weakenesse; and if they had herein renounced
GOD, yet that GOD also mutually renounced
them. To shut vppe your Constitution then:
There is no remedy: Eyther you must goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

The outward parte of the true visible Church is a

in Baptisme, or noe? If it be, then we haue (by your
Confession (for so much as is outwardly required)

If it be not, then you must rebaptise: for the first

Our Church is deepe drencht in Apostacie; and wee

Name me but one that euer taught as you doe; and

from you: Euery Apostacie of a Church must needs

               </note> and yet the enemies of our
enemies: First we disclaime, and defie your Pedigree
and theirs. The Church of Rome was neuer our
Mothers Mother: Our Christian faith came not from
the seuen-hilles: Neither was deriued either from
<hi>Augustine</hi> the Monke, or Pope <hi>Gregory. Britanny</hi> had
a worthy Church before either of them look't into
the world: It is true that the ancient Roman Church
was Sister to ours: here was neare kindred, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance:
And not more consanguinitie, then
(while she continued faithfull) Christian loue: Now
she is gone a whoring, her chast Sister iustly spitteth
at her: yet euen still (if you distinguish, as your lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Antagonist</hi> hath taught you, betwixt the Church
and Papacy) Shee acknowledges her Sisterhood,
though she refraines her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersation: as she hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
slauish and factious abettors of her knowne and
grosse errors (to whom we deny this title) affirming
them the body whereof Antichrist is the head, the
great whore, and mother of abhominations; so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
how many thousands hath shee, which retay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the foundation according to their knowledge,
(as our learned <hi>Whitakers</hi> had wont to say of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard)</hi>
follow <hi>Absolom</hi> with a simple heart: all which
to reiect from Gods Church, were no better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
cruelty. It were well for you before God
&amp; the world, if you could as easiely wash your hands
of vn-naturall impiety, and trecherousnesse, as we of
bastardy &amp; vniust sequestration. There can be no ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stardy,
where was neuer any motherhood, wee were
nephews to that Church, neuer sons: vnlesse as Rome
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:3818:33"/>
was the Mother citie of the world, so by humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
we suffered our selues to bee ranged vnder
her Patriarchall authority, as being the most famous
Church of the West: a matter of courtesie, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Order; no necessity, no spirituall obligation.
As for our sequestration, your mouth and theirs may
be stopt with this answer: As all corrupted Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
so some things the Church of Rome still holds
aright; a true God in three persons, true Scriptures,
though with addition, a true Christ, though man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
with foule and erroneous consequences; true
Baptisme though shamefully deformed with rotten
traditions; &amp; many other vndenyable truths of God:
some other things (and too many) her wicked Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie
hath deuised and maintained abhominably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse;
the body of her Antichristianisme, grosse er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
and (by iust sequel) heresies; their Popes su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
infallibility, illimitation, transubstantiation,
idolatrous and superstitious worshippe, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
other of this branne: In regard of all these lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
we professe to the world a iust and auncient sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from this false faith and deuotion of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
Church; which neither you will say, nor they
shall euer proue, faulty: yea rather they haue in all
these separated from vs, who stil irrefragably professe
to hold with the auncient, from whom they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.
In regard of the other we are stil with them,
holding and embracing with them what they holde
with Christ: neither will you (I thinke) euer prooue
that in these we should differ: As for our commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
they haue separated vs by their proude and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
excommunications: if they had not, wee would
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:3818:34"/>
iustly haue begunne: from their Tyranny and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christianisme,
from their miserable Idolatrie: but as
for the bodie of their poore seduced Christians,
which remaine amongst them vpon the true foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
(as doubtlesse there are thousands of them
which laugh at their Pardons, Miracles, Superstitions
and their trust in merites, reposing only vpon Christ)
we adhere to them in loue and pitty, and haue testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
our affection by our blood, ready vpon any iust
call to doe it more; neither would feare to ioyne
with them in any true seruice of our common God:

their corruptions be incomparably more, wee haue

And what though manie of the highest Towers of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, and of the strongest Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers also be demolished, &amp; pulled down, yet may the building stand still, though tottering to and fro (as it doth) and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderprop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held with the shoulder and arme of flesh, without which in a very moment it would fall flat vpon, and lie leuell with the earth.</note> that as Christ came not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly
into the world, but with many presages and
prefigurations (The day was long dawning ere this
Sunne arose). so his aduersary (that Antichrist) breaks
not suddenly vpon the Church, but comes with
much preparation, and long expectance: and as his
rise, so his fall must be graduall, and leisurely: Why
say you then, that the whole Church euery where
must at once vtterly fall off from that Church where
that man of sinne sitteth? His fall depends on the
fall of others, or rather their rising from vnder him:
If neither of these must be sudden, why is your hast?
But this must not be, yet ought: as there must be he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies,

shall neuer be the more probable. That our ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
was not giuen and set in the Church by Christ, but
Antichristian, what is it else to be from men, to bee
strange, to be a false spirituall calling, not to bee deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
from Christ, to worship the Image of the beast?
So this great Challenger that hath abridged his nine
Arguments to seuen, might aswell haue abridged his
seuen to one and a halfe. Here would haue beene
as much substance, but lesse glory: As for his maine
defence: First, wee may not either haue, or expect
now in the Church that ministery which Christ set:
Where are our Apostles, prophets, Euangelists? If we
must alwayes looke for the very same administration
of the Church which our Sauiour left, why doe wee
not challenge these extraordinary functions? Doe
we not rather thinke, since it pleased him to beginne
with those Offices which should not continue, that
herein he purposely intended to teach vs, that if wee
haue the same heauenly busines done we should not
be curious in the circumstances of the persons: But
for those ordinary callings of Pastors and Doctors
(intended to perpetuity) with what forehead can hee
denie them to bee in our Church? How many haue
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:3818:38"/>
we that conscionably teach and feede, or rather feede
by teaching? Call them what you please, Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
(that is) Bishoppes, Prelates, Priests, Lecturers,
Parsons, Vicars, &amp;c. If they preach Christ truly, vpon
true inward abilities, vpon a sufficient (if not perfect)
outward vocation: such a one (let all Histories wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse)
for the substance, as hath bin euer in the Church
since the Apostles times: they are Pastors and Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors
allowed by Christ:<note place="margin">Vbires conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit quis non verba contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat,? August. de Ordin. 2.</note> We stand not vpon circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
and appendances of the fashions of ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
manner of choyce, attire, titles, maintenance: but
if for substance these be not true Pastors and Doctors
Christ had neuer any in his Church, since the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
left the earth. All the difficulty is in our outward
calling: Let the Reader graunt our graue and learned
Bishoppes to be but Christians, and this will easily be
euinced lawfull, euen by their rules: For, if with them
euery plebeian artificer hath power to elect and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
by vertue of his Christian profession (the act of
the worthiest standing for all) how can they deny this
right to persons qualified (besides common graces)
with wisedome,<note place="margin">Brow. state of Christians.</note> learning, experience, authority)? Ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their Bishoppricke makes them no Christians (a
position which of all the world, besides this Secte,
would be hissed at) or else their handes imposed are
thus farr (by their rules of Separatists) effectual. Now
your best course is (like to an Hare that runnes backe
from whence she was started) to flye to your first
hold: No Church, therefore no Ministery: So now,
not the Church hath deuised the Ministery, but the
Ministery hath deuised the Church: I follow you not
in that idle Circle: Thence you haue beene hunted
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:3818:39"/>
already: But now, since I haue giuen account of ours:
I pray you tell me seriously, Who deuised your Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Ministery? I dare say, not Christ, not his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
not their Successors: What Church euer in
the world can be produced (vnlesse in case of extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
for one turn) whose conspiring multitude made
themselues ministers at pleasure? what rule of Christ
prescribes it? What Reformed Church euer did, or
doth practise it? VVhat example warrants it? where
haue the inferiors laid hands vpon their Superiors?
VVhat Congregation of Christendome in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
affoorded you the necessary patterne of an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teaching
Pastor, or an vnfeeding Teacher?</p>
            <p>It is an old policy of the faulty to complaine first:
Certainely there was neuer Popish Legend a more
errand deuise of man then some parts of this ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of yours, so much gloried in for sincere corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence

But to wade no further in vniuersalities; wee will take a little time to examine such particulars, as you your selfe haue picked out for your most aduantage, to see whether you bee so cleare of Babels Towers in your owne euidence, as you beare the world in hand. <hi>Inquir. into M. white p. 35.

was vrged to instance, could find none but our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

hee had ouer-reached, not that. Call you our
Doctrines some generall truthes? Looke into our
Confessions, Apologies, Articles, and compare them
with any, with all other Churches, and if you finde a
more particular, found, Christian, absolute profession
of all fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall truths in any Church since Christ
asce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded into heauen, renounce vs, as you do, &amp; we wil
seperate vnto you: But these truths are not soundly
practised: Let your Pastor teach you, that if errours
of practise should be stood vpon, there could bee no
true Church vpon earth: Pull out your owne beame
first: we willingly yeeld this to be one of your truths,
that no truth can sanctifie errour: That one heresie
makes an Hereticke: but learne withall, that euery
error doth not pollute all truthes: That there is hay
and stubble which may burne, yet both the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
stand, and the builder be saued: Such is ours at
the worst, why doe you condemne where God will
saue? No Scripture is more worne with your tongus
and pennes, then that of the leauen. 1. Cor. 5. 6. If you
would compare Christs leauen with <hi>Pauls,</hi> you
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:3818:40"/>
should satisfie your selfe. Christ sayes the kingdome
of heauen is as leauen; <hi>Paule</hi> saies grosse sin is lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:
Both leauens the whole lumpe: neither may be
taken precisely, but in resemblance: not of equalitie,
(as he said well) but of qualitie: For notwithstanding
the leauen of the kingdome,<note place="margin">M. Bredwell.</note> some part you grant
is vnsanctified; So notwithstanding the leauen of
sinne, some (which haue striuen against it to their vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most)
are not sowred: The leauening in both places
must extend onely to whom it is intended: the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
of regeneration in the one; the partners of sinne
in the other: So our Sauiour saith, Yee are the salt of
the earth; Yet too much of the earth is vnseasoned:
The trueth of the effect must bee regarded in these
speeches not the quantity: It was enough for Saint
<hi>Paule</hi> to shew them by this similitude,<note place="margin">Hierom. In hoc Ignoratis, quia malo exemplo possunt plurimi interire? Sed &amp; per vnius de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lictum in omne populum Indae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum iram dei legimus adue nisse.</note> that grosse sins
where they are tollerated haue a power to infect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
whether it be (as <hi>Hierome</hi> interprets it) by ill
example, or by procurement of iudgements: and
thereupon the incestuous must be cast out: All this
tends to the exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating of the euill, not to the
seperating of the good: Did euer <hi>Paule</hi> say, if the
incestuous be not cast out, seperate from the Church.
Show vs this, and wee are yours: Else it is a shame
for you that you are not ours: If Antichrist holde
many truths, and we but many, we must needes bee
proud of your prayses: We holde all his truths, and

It is no part of prayer, or preaching, and with a sacrament it hath the greatest consimilitude, but an Idoll I am sure it is in the celebration of it, being made a Ministeriall duty and part of Gods worshippe, without warrant, call it by what name you will.</note> I feare,
not your charity: some things seeme, and are not:
such is this your number of our Sacraments: you wil
needes haue vs take in marriage into this ranke: why
so? wee doe not (you confesse) call it a Sacrament as
the vulgar, mis-interpreting <hi>Pauls Mysterium,</hi> Ep. 5.
why should we not if we so esteemed it? wherefore
serue names, but to denotate the nature of things? If
we were not ashamed of the opinion, wee could not
be ashamed of the worde: No more (say you) did
Christ and his Apostles call Baptisme and the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
Sacraments; but we doe, and you with vs: See
now whether this clause doe not confute your last:
where hath Christ euer said, There are two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
Yet you dare say so: what is this but in your
sense an addition to the word: yea, we say flatly, there
are but two: yet we doe (you say) in truth create it a

Sacrament: how oft, and how resolutely hath our
Church maintained against Rome, that none but
Christ immediatly can create Sacraments? If they
had this aduantage against vs, how could wee stand?
How wrongfull is this force, to fasten an opinion vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Church which shee hath condemned? But
wherein stands this our creation? It is true, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes
to bee married, and their marriage represent
Christ, and his Church, and their spirituall vnion: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
least you strike God through our sides: what
hath Gods spirit said, either lesse, or other then this?
<hi>Ephe. 5. 25. 26. 27. &amp;.</hi> 32. Doth he not make Christ the
husband, the Church his spouse? Doth he not from
that sweet coniunction, and the effects of it: argue
the deere respects that should bee in marriage? Or
what doth the Apostle allude elesewhere vnto, when
he saies (as <hi>Moses</hi> of <hi>Eue)</hi> we are flesh of Christs flesh,
and bone of his bone? And how famous amongst
the ancient is that resemblance of <hi>Eue</hi> taken out of
<hi>Adams</hi> side sleeping, to the Church taken out of
Christs side sleeping on the Crosse? Since marriage
therefore so clearely represents this mistery: and this
vse is holy and sacred: what error is it, to say that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
is consecrated to this mistery? But what is the
Element: the Ring; These things agree not; you had
before made the two parties to be the matter of this
Sacrament? What is the matter of the Sacrament,
but the Element? If they be the matter, they are the
Element; and so not the Ring; both cannot be; if you
will make the two parties to bee but the receiuers;
how doth all the mistery lie in their representation?
Or if the Ring bee the Element, then all the mistery
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:3818:53"/>
must be in the Ring, not in the parties: Labour to
bee more perfect, ere you make any more newe
Sacraments: but this Ring is laide vpon the seruice-booke:

Nay, but it is hallowed (you say) by the booke: If it
be a Sacramentall Element, it rather hallowes the
booke, then the booke it: you are not mindful enough
for this trade: But what exorcismes are vsed in this
hallowing? Or who euer held it any other then a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill

consecration: I pray you, what difference is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
hallowing, and consecration? The Ring was
hallowed before by the booke; now it must be conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated:
How idlely? by what wordes? In the name
of the Father, &amp;c. These words you know are spoken
after the Ring is put on: was it euer heard of, that
a Sacramentall Element was consecrated after it
was applyed? see how ill your slaunders are digested
by you: The place is the Church, the time the Lords
day, the minister is the actor, and is it not thus in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

in dislike of these ceremonies obtruded, and an hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnes
of future libertie, you and your fellowes had
made a secession, rather then a separation from our

not falshood: I hoped you, as not ours, so not

and iustly thinkes the meanest corner too good for
so mutinous a generation: when it is weary of peace
it will recall you: you that neither in prison, nor on

sinnes of the Citie, and the Church: How oft
hath our gratious Soueraigne, and how importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
beene solicited for a tolleration of Religions?
It is pittie that the Papists hyred not your aduocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:

            <p>But howsoeuer now, least we should thinke your
Land-lords haue too iust cause to pack you away for
wranglers, you turne ouer all the blame from the
Church to the City; yet your Pastor and Church
haue so found the Citie in the Church, and branded
it with so blacke markes, as that all your smooth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuations
cannot make it a lesse Babylon then the
Church of England: Beholde now by your owne

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and Dutch Churches.</note> First, That the assembles are so contriued
that the whole Church comes not together in one:
So that the Ministers cannot together with the flock
sanctifie the Lords day; The presence of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Church cannot be knowne, and finally no
publique action, whether excommunication, or any
other can rightly be performed. Could you say
worse of vs? Where neither Sabboth can be rightly
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:3818:69"/>
sanctified; nor presence or absence knowne, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
holy action rightly performed, what can there be
but mere confusion?</p>
            <p>Secondly, That they baptise the seede of them
who are no members of any visible Church; of
whom moreouer they haue not care as of members,
neither admit their parents to the Lordes Supper:
Mere Babylonisme, and sinne in constitution, yea the
same that makes vs no Church: for what separation
can there be in such admittance? what other but a
sinfull commixture? How is the Church of Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
now gathered from the world?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That in the publique worshippe of God
they haue deuised, and vsed another forme of prayer,
besides that which Christ our Lord hath prescribed,
Mat. 6. reading out of a booke certain prayers inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and imposed by man. Beholde here our fellow
Idolaters: and (as followes) a daily Sacrifice of a set
Seruice-booke, which in stead of the sweete incense
of spirituall prayers is offered to God, very Swines-flesh,
<note place="margin">Bar. ag. Gyss.</note> a new Por<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uise, and an equal participation with
vs of the curse of addition to the word.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That rule and commandement of Christ,
Matth. 18. 15. they neither obserue, nor suffer rightly
to be obserued among them. How oft haue you said
that there can bee no sound Church without this
course, because no separation? Beholde the maine
blemish of England in the face of Amsterdam!</p>
            <p>Fiftly, That they worship God in the Idoll Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Antichrist: so the Wine is mar'd with the
vessell, their seruice abhomination with ours: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doe these Antichristian stones want all glorious
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:3818:70"/>
ornaments of the Romish harlot, yet more.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, That their Ministers haue their set main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
after another manner then Christ hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,
1. Chr. 14. and that also such, as by which any
Ministery at all, whether Popish or other might bee
maintained: Either tithes, or as ill: Beholde one of
the maine Arguments wherby our Ministery is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
as false and Antichristian, falling heauie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
our neighbours.</p>
            <p>Seuenthly, That their Elders change yearely, and
do not continue in their office, according to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Apostles and practise of the Primitiue
Church: What can our Church haue worse then
false Gouernours? Both annuall and perpetual they
cannot be: VVhat is (if not this) a wrong in Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution?</p>
            <p>Eightly, that they celebrate mariage in the Church,
as if it were a part of the Ecclesiasticall administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
a foule shame and sinne: and what better then
our third Sacrament?</p>
            <p>Ninthly, That they vse a new censure of suspensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which Christ hath not appointed: no lesse then
English presumption.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, That they obserue daies and times, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrating
certaine daies in the yeare to the Natiuity,
Resurrection, Ascension of Christ: Beholde their
Calender as truely possessed: Two Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
solemnely broken at once; and we not Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
alone.</p>
            <p>Eleuenth, which is last and worst, that they receiue
vnrepentant excommunicates to bee members of
their Church, which by this meanes becomes one
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:3818:70"/>
one body with such as be deliuered vnto Sathan;
therefore none of Christs bodie:<note place="margin">Counrtepoys.</note> England can
be but a miscelline rabble of prophane men; The
Dutch and French Churches are belike no better,
who can be worse then an vnrepentant excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate?
Goe now and say, It is the Apostasie of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist
to haue communion with the world in the
holy things of God, which are the peculiars of the
Church, and cannot without great Sacriledge be so
prostituted and prophaned; Goe say, that the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guy-spirituall-leprosie
of sinne rising vp in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads
of many in that Church, vnshut vp, vncouered
(yea wilfully let loose) infects all both persons and
things amongst them: Goe now and flie out of this
Babylon also, as the Hee-goates before the flocke,
or returne to ours: But howeuer these errours bee
grosse, perhappes they are tractable; Not the sinne
vndoes the Church, but obstinacy; here is no euasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
For behold, you do no more accuse those Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

In Gods iudgement it shall not, wee care little, if

eminent in the Prelacie, which in the fresh memories
of many was shed for God, against that Harlot: and
by the excellent labours of others, both Bishops and
