            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="4">4. It cannot be supposed by the principles of Natural Religion, that GOD has authorised any one <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> any other way than as the general Rules of Order and of Justice oblige all Men not to subvert Constitutions, nor disturb the peace of Mankind, nor invade those Rights with which the Law may have vested some Persons; For it is certain that as private Contracts lodge or translate private Rights; so the publick Laws can likewise lodge such Rights, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rerogatives and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, in those under whose protection they put themselves; and in such a manner that they may come to have as good a title to these, as any private person can have to his property; so that it becomes an Act of high injustice and violence to invade these, which is so far a greater sin than any such Actions would be against a private person; As the <hi>publick Peace</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> is preferable to all <hi>private considerations</hi> whatsoever. So that in truth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>the principles of <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> give those that are in Authority no power at all<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:43331:3"/>have no immediate warrants from Heaven, either for their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Titles, or for the extent of them, yet they are secured in the possession of them by the Principles and Rules of <hi>Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>

this bond is dissolved by <hi>Adultery,</hi> tho it is not named; for odious things ought not to be suspected, and therefore not named upon such occasions: But when they fall out, they carrie still their own force with them. 2. When there seems to be a Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between two Articles in the constitution, we ought to examine which of the two is the most evident, and the most Important and so we ought to fix upon it, and then we must give such an accomodating sense to that which seems to contradict it, that so we may reconcile those together. Here then are two seeming contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in our constitution: The oneis the <hi>Publick Libert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> of the <hi>Nation</hi>; the other is the renouncing of all resi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tance, in case that were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded. It is plain, that our <hi>Liberty</hi> is only a thing that we enjoy at the <hi>Kings</hi> discretion, and during his pleasure; if the other against all Resistance is to be understood according to the outmost Extent of the words. Therefore since the chief Design of Our whole Law, and all the several Rules of our Constitution, is to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and mantain Our Liberty, we ought to lay that down for a conclusion, that it is both the most plain and the most important of the two: And therefore the other Article against Resistance ought to be so softned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as that it doe not destroy this. 3. Since it is by a Law that Resistance is condemned, we ought to understand it in such a sense, as that it does not destroy all other Laws: And therefore the intent of this Law must only relate to the <hi>Executive Power,</hi> which is in the King, and not to the <hi>Legislative,</hi> in which we cannot suppose that our <hi>Legislators,</hi> who made that Law, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to give up that, which we plainly see they resolved still to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve intire, according to the Ancient Constitution. So then the not resi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ting the King, can only be applyed to the <hi>Executive Power,</hi> that so upon no pretence of ill Administrations in the Execution of the Law, it should be lawful to resist him; but this cannot with any r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ason be extended to an Invasion of the <hi>Legislative Power,</hi> or to a total <hi>subversion</hi> of the <hi>Government.</hi> For it being plain, that the Law did not Design to lodge that power in the King; it is also plain, that it did not intend to secure him in it, in case he should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. 4. The Law mentioning the King, or those Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate by him, shews plainly, that it only Designed to secure t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e King in the <hi>Executive Power</hi>: For the word <hi>Commission</hi> necessarly imports this, since if it is not according to Law, it is no <hi>Commission</hi>;
<pb facs="tcp:43331:6"/>
And by con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>equence, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ose who Act in Vertue of it, are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missionate by the King in the sense of the Law. The King like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise imports a Prince clothed by Law with the <hi>Regal Prerogative,</hi> but if he goes to <hi>Subvert</hi> the whole Foundation of the Governmen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, he <hi>subverts</hi> that by which he himself has his power, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence he annulls his own power; and then he ceases to be <hi>King,</hi> having endeavoured to destroy that, upon which his own Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is founded.</p>
            <p>It is acknowledged by the greatest asserters of Monarchical power, that in some cases a <hi>King</hi> may fall from his power, and in other cases that he may fall from the exercise of it. His deserting his people, his going about to enslave or sell them to any other, or a furious going about to destroy them, are in the opinion of the most <hi>Monarchical Lawyers,</hi> such abuses, that they naturally divest those that are guilty of them, of their whole Authority. <hi>Infamy</hi> or <hi>Phrenzie</hi> do also put them under the Guardian-ship of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. All the crowned heads of <hi>Europe</hi> have, at least secretly, approv'd of the putting the late <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Portugal</hi> under a Guardian-ship, &amp; the keeping him still Prisoner for a few Acts of Rage, that had been fatal to a very few persons: And even our <hi>Court</hi> gave the first countenance to it, tho of all ot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ers the late King hade the most reason to have done it at least last of all, since it justified a Youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger brother's supplanting the Elder; yet the evidence of the thing carryed it even against Interest. Therefore if a <hi>King</hi> goes about to subvert the <hi>Government,</hi> and to overturn the whole Constitution, he by this must be supposed either to fall from his power, or at least from the exercise of it, so far as that he ought to be put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Guardians; and according to the case of <hi>Portugal,</hi> the next <hi>Heir</hi> falls naturally to be the Guardian.</p>
            <p>The next thing to be considered, is, to see in Fact whether the Foundations of this <hi>Government</hi> have been struck at, and whether those E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rors, that have been perhaps committed, are only such Malversations, as ought to be Imputed only to <hi>humane Frailty,</hi> and to the Ignorance, Inadvertencies, or passions to which all Princes may be Subject, as well as other men, but this will best appear if we consider, what are the Fundamental points of our <hi>Government,</hi> and the chief securities that we have for our Liberties.</p>
            <p>The Authorit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the Law is indeed all in one word, so that if the <hi>King</hi> pretends to a power to <hi>Dispense</hi> with <hi>Laws,</hi> there is
<pb facs="tcp:43331:7"/>
nothing left, upon which the <hi>Subject</hi> can depend; And yet as if <hi>Dispensing power</hi> were not enough, if Laws are wholly suspended for all time coming, this is plainly a repealing of them, when likewise the Men, in whose han<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
