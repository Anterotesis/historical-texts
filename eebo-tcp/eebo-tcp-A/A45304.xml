            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Modeſt Offer of ſome Meet Conſiderations, tendred to the <hi>ENGLISH</hi> about Their <hi>Coyne</hi> and <hi>Trade,</hi> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to <hi>Eaſt India.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Ordinary Means of Encreaſing our Wealth being Foreign Trade, Managed ſo that the Ballance be for Us, not againſt Us; And the Seat of our now War being diſtant from us, (which is our Happineſs) where we muſt pay our Armies and Fleet, we ought to provide that Forreigners (be they Friends or Foes) do not get our Trade nor our Wealth from us.</p>
            <p>It doth behove us therefore to ſecure our Foreign Trade in the firſt place, by ſafe guarding and wiſely Conducting our Merchants Ships at Sea: Which may be done if our Naval Affairs and Strength (our chief and commanding Point) be put into the Hands of Men of Integrity, Skill and Courage, of Sobriety and Diligence, and of deſire to ſhorten the War. Such Men as theſe we may hope will effect the like Qualities in them they do Command; and then from the Nature of the Thing, and by Divine Ordination too, we may expect all good Succeſs. Our Armies and Fleet may then be paid abroad, becauſe the Goods we Import being Exported again will create Bills for us, (which are not now to be had) and make the Exchange in our favour. The Kings Cuſtoms and our Wealth will encreaſe, and the <hi>French</hi> being without Trade and Captures at Sea, will the ſooner be reduced to Extremity.</p>
            <p>The next Thing is our Money: Not to alter its Fineneſs, Weight, nor Denomination, but to permit none that is (lip'd or Falſe to paſs in Payment, and the Good at no higher Value than formerly. Our Mill'd Money, as now it is, is not only the Common and True Meaſure of our Lands, and of all our Means in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but alſo of our Foreign Commerce with Strangers; therefore to alter it would bring us into Confuſion and Loſs too: For Gold and Silver being their Product, not Ours, when we add to its Value, They have the Advance of us. This encreaſes the Ballance againſt us, and we muſt pay it in Gold or Silver, not at our Valuation, but as the Exchange will allow; which whilſt we pay our Armies and Fleet abroad, will not exceed <hi>Five Shillings</hi> our Mill'd Crown, and <hi>Twenty Shillings</hi> the Guinea. And if, as ſome propoſe, we advance the one to <hi>Thirty Shillings,</hi> and the other to <hi>Six Shillings Three Pence,</hi> in Payment, we thereby Add to <hi>Spain,</hi> &amp;c. 50 <hi>per Cent.</hi> in their Gold, and 25 <hi>per Cent.</hi> in their Silver, and Subſtract as much from our ſelves in all our Rents, in all our Now made Contracts, and Loans, in all the Cuſtoms and Charges that Forreigners pay for Goods they Import here, and in all we buy here and ſend abroad to Foreign Markets, (in caſe that Strangers do buy the like with us) and in all that we do remit to diſcharge the Ballance upon us.</p>
            <p>When Gold or Silver from Abroad comes to pay their Debt to us, it is Good; but when to encreaſe our Debt to them, it's an Evil to us: For it muſt go from us at leſs Value than it came to us We ſhould therefore haſten to Extinguiſh this Ballance, or leſſen it all we can, by ſafe guarding at Sea our Ships in Trade, and by ſending our own Product and Manufacture to Markets abroad upon equal Terms with Foreigners who buy them of us; which cannot be done if we add to the Value of our Money: What we add they have our Manufacture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cheaper than our Merchants, and then we loſe our Trade too. The Courſe of all Exchanges in Time of Peace, or when we are free and ſafe in Foreign Trade, doth ſhew that generally our Mint at <hi>Twenty Shillings</hi> a Guinea, and at <hi>Five Shillings</hi> the Mil'd Crown, is the beſt Market in <hi>Europe</hi> for Gold and Silver, it will then come to us, and what we now part with for Payment of our Armies and Fleet abroad (which by the way will be done with one Third leſs if we do not advance our Money than if we do) will Return to us in Time of Peace, and I hope it is not far off, if it be, I am ſure, when it comes it will be the better and more laſting with us for this War Upon the whole, to advance our Crown to <hi>Six Shillings Three Pence</hi> can ſerve no Purpoſe of ours, is needleſs, and pernicious, therefore not to be done.</p>
            <p>But if we do not reduce Guineas to 21 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d,</hi> or 22 <hi>s.</hi> and make our Money good to 5 <hi>s.</hi> the Mill'd Crown, and no more, (as formerly it did paſs in Payment,) and ſtop the Currancy of Clip'd and Falſe Money, and if we do not make Forreign Trade free, and ſafe to all the Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> and put it ſo that they may ſet forth in it upon equal Terms with Foreigners; I ſay if this be not done, there can be no Paying our Armies and Fleet abroad; conſequently, no Army or Fleet of ours there: Then the <hi>French</hi> will ſoon ſubdue our Allies, and next us, then Slavery and Popery will be the Lot of our Inheritance for ever, and we with our Allies thus ruined, ſhall ſoon end this War,</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But is not our Coin rather to be Ordered hereafter than now, and by Degrees (the Guineas at least) than all at once.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If we will go on with the War, it muſt be done preſently. Laſt Years Delay giving them opportunity for it, ſome (I wiſh them branded) to diſtreſs our King by making the Payment of his Army in <hi>Flanders,</hi> if not impoſſible yet very difficult and coſtly, ſet upon the Project of raiſing Guineas, others for their particular Gain did the like, and theſe together advancing Guineas to 30 <hi>s.</hi> it left neither Silver nor Bills for Payment of the Army in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and by that Means made it next to a Miracle that our King did ſubſiſt there the laſt Campaigne.</p>
            <p>Every Moment we delay, our Clippers and falſe Coiners are at work, and which is worſe, Guineas at 30 <hi>s.</hi> and Clipt and falſe Money from abroad is poured in upon us, and ſo we encreaſe our Ballance and Loſs by th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe degrees, and this Delay. Now is a fit Time to do it, when ſome, confident that our 5 <hi>s.</hi> would be made 6 s. 3 <hi>d.</hi> have laid up in Silver Bullion about 200000 <hi>l.</hi> value, that muſt be brought to our Mint, or applied (which is as well) to pay our Armies abroad. The Bulk of the Guineas are now with (or of Right belong unto) Bankers, Goldſmiths, the <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> Companies, <hi>Jews,</hi> Stock-jobbers, and the Victualers, Agents, or Under-payers of the Navy or Armies, Perſons well provided by the Gains they have had, and who do now oppoſe the Fall of Guineas only becauſe they ſhall loſe by it. And the doing it by degrees can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help us, nor will it eaſe us in the leaſt.</p>
            <p>The next Thing is the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade: Which, though the moſt miſchievous of any to us, yet ſince we muſt have it, and it is become in Value near one half of the Foreign Trade of the Kingdom, it ought to be made National, and ſecured that it be not loſt to the <hi>Dutch</hi> (who by the continuance of our Now Company are much encreaſed in that Trade,) nor gotten from us by the <hi>Scotch</hi> Company, who Inveſted as it is in Act of Parliament, and having <hi>Jews, Hamburghers, Hollanders, Engliſh,</hi> and ſome of other Nations, Subſcribers into it, will ſoon (if not timely prevented) get that Trade, and more Beneficial Trades from us, I mean
<pb facs="tcp:35842:2"/>
thoſe to <hi>Guinea</hi> and <hi>Weſt-India,</hi> and perhaps all Trade: For the Grants in that Act ſet together, make that Company as it were Univerſal Monarch of Trade.</p>
            <p>Now for Prevention againſt the One and the Other, I do humbly offer againſt Eſtabliſhing by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade in a Company with a Joint-Stock Excluſive of others the Subjects of <hi>England.</hi> For ſuch Eſtabliſhments of Trade in <hi>England</hi> are <hi>Malum in ſe,</hi> Monopolies at Common Law, for that they Give and Appropriate that to Some onely which is the Common Right of All: And in the Inſtance now before us, do make but <hi>One Buyer</hi> for what is Exported, and but <hi>One Seller</hi> for what is Imported, to the Value of near One Half of the Foreign Trade of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>It is true, New Invention and Diſcovery hath alwayes been incouraged and rewarded with Excluſive Grants; for that in thoſe Caſes no other have any Right Antecedent to the thing Granted. Yet even in theſe Caſes, it hath been uſual with <hi>Parliaments</hi> to allow no more than Fourteen Years, Excluſive to others the Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe they ſhould not be long excluded in any Caſe. And for time out of mind, the Wiſdom of our Nation in <hi>Parliament</hi> hath condemned Excluſive Grants of Trade, as appears in <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and in many other Statures Unrepealed.</p>
            <p>It may, and moſt likely will, endanger the Peace and Being of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchy.</p>
            <p>It is a moſt pernicious Contraction of Trade, for that it cannot be extended to Perſons ſo as to make it National. If the whole Trade of the Nation were Contracted as this to <hi>Eaſt India</hi> is, it would ſoon Nationally periſh; for that the whole then in proportion, would ſcarce enrich One Hundred and Sixty Perſons, and maintain very few Adventurers or Traders.</p>
            <p>If the Trade be thus ſettled for Twenty One Years, it will for many of thoſe Years Exclude from Trade the greater number of Merchants, and many others, as Minors; Thoſe who are not now in Caſh, and thoſe who have their Trades ſwallowed up by this.</p>
            <p>Future Admiſſion into this Trade will be precarious, very coſtly, and may be loſt.</p>
            <p>It will cauſe the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> to ſurmount us in this Trade. Where our Trade is without a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany we out-do the <hi>Dutch;</hi> and where we have a Company and they none, they out-do us. Therefore,</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> above all things deſire the Continuance of the Now Company in <hi>England.</hi> They by their Agents here in 1656, importuned <hi>O.C.</hi> to eſtabliſh the Now Joynt-Stock.</p>
            <p>It will unavoidably give being and ſupport unto Stock-Jobbing. The loſs of Eſtates by Cheats this way, and by the Monopoliſts double Tax upon us of One Buyer and One Seller, in ſo great a Trade as this is, will in leſs than Twenty Years exceed Two Millions.</p>
            <p>The Propoſal in eaſe of our Lands to raiſe Money by ſuch Grants, if accepted, will leſſen the Value of our Lands, and ſoon rid us of them.</p>
            <p>The Benefits to our Nation are many, if the Trade to <hi>India</hi> be Free, or in a Regulated Company, without a Joynt-Stock.</p>
            <p>Ingenuity will be encouraged. New Places of Trade will be applyed to, others Diſcovered. More of the Sons of our Gentry may be ſent Factors. It will increaſe the Exportation of our Manufacture and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. It will enable us to furniſh <hi>Europe</hi> with all the Commodities of thoſe Countries, much Cheaper than the <hi>Dutch.</hi> It will add to our Navigation, and Augment the Kings Cuſtom, Stock-Jobbing will ceaſe. And it will prevent taking up Money at Intereſt upon a Common Seal, which as done by our Now Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, is a thing very unequal and hazardous to the Subject; and make it impoſſible to do the Evil Deeds our Now Company hath done (and if continued may do) here and in <hi>India,</hi> fully proved upon them before the <hi>Commons</hi> in <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>India</hi> Trade hath been carried on better for the Nation without a Company in a Joynt-Stock than with one, and may be ſo again.</p>
            <p>Forts and Caſtles in <hi>India,</hi> if we have them, cannot defend us in caſe the <hi>Dutch,</hi> or <hi>French,</hi> or <hi>Indians,</hi> be our Enemies; but may tempt us (as it did the Now Company) to offend them, or create a Jealouſie in the <hi>India</hi> Princes of us, and by that means tempt them to offend us.</p>
            <p>And however Joynt-Stocks in Trade may have been uſed here in the Infancy of Foreign Trade, and granted by Kings to a number of Subjects named, (the intention whereof was not particular but to them in Truſt for the general good, and in proſpect of a future opening it unto National Benefit) yet now when we of this Kingdom are arrived at the utmoſt degree of Experience in Commerce with all Countries, I cannot ſee any Reaſon why the Subjects ſhould loſe their Right, or ſhould be clogg'd by Joynt-Stocks to the great Dammage of the Nation, as I have before made evident.</p>
            <p>What I have here ſaid with reſpect to the <hi>India</hi> Trade, is applicable to the <hi>Guinea</hi> Trade alſo.</p>
            <p>I am Troubled for the late Loſs of Six Ships coming from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> whereof Two were Interlopers; the whole, I compute, did coſt them in <hi>India</hi> Three Hundred Thouſand Pounds, not more. But I cannot infer thence any Reaſon for an Excluſive Grant of that Trade: For if ſo, then the Interlopers who loſt One Third, muſt have One Third of that Trade, Excluſive of the Now Company. And by a Parity of Reaſon, the Now <hi>Jamaica, Barbadoes,</hi> and <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Merchants, who during this War have ſuſtained greater Loſs, muſt have Grants of thoſe Trades, Excluſive of all others; which if done, would make it cruel pity, and moſt unjuſt. As it had been if when <hi>London</hi> in 1666 was burnt, we to Rebuild it, in com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>paſſion to them, had Taxed the Nation to the value of all our Lands.</p>
            <p>To prevent <hi>Scotland</hi> being the Chief Seat of all Trade, or as it were the Univerſal Monarch in it; I think we ought to make that deſign (if we can) Abortive: And I think it will be ſo in caſe our Parliament ſhall pleaſe.</p>
            <list>
               <item>(1.) To Declare that the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade is and ſhall be Free to all the Subjects of <hi>England.</hi> And that it ſhall be Managed in a Regulated Company (as the <hi>Turkey,</hi> or as near it as may be) without a Joynt-Stock, except a ſmall One to defray the Common and Neceſſary Charges of Embaſſadors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And,</item>
               <item>(2.)

            <p>To induce the former I have ſaid enough before; and to enforce the latter I ſay, That the doing it will not leſſen Our Kings Revenue (comparatively) One Peny: For if it be not done, and the <hi>Scots</hi> do proceed in that Trade, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it is Enacted or Granted to them, we ſhall not Import any thing from <hi>India, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe they will have gotten all that Trade from us.</p>
            <p>A Court of Merchants might be of uſe to us at this Time.</p>
