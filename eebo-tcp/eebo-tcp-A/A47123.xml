         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

not with your own, and that ye were to take all things without
all due Examination and Tryal, by an implicit Faith, <hi>Papiſt</hi>-like,

Month 1692. wherein they clear <hi>Tho. Fitzwater,</hi> and condemn
<hi>G. K.</hi> for ſaying, <hi>The Light is not ſufficient without ſomething elſe,</hi>
which ſomething elſe, <hi>Thomas Lloyd,</hi> as the Mouth of the ſaid
Monthly Meeting, acknowledged, <hi>They knew</hi> G. K. <hi>held to be the
Man Chriſt Jeſus, and what he did and ſuffered for us on Earth, and
what he now doth for us in Heaven:</hi> The 2d Judgment is given forth
by them called Friends of the Miniſtry, concerning <hi>W. Stockdale,</hi>
ſigned by <hi>Sam. Jenings,</hi> as Clark of the ſaid Meeting, the 4 of

things they and we ſhall agree to, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Whether <hi>George Keith</hi> hath been proved guilty by theſe 28
men (his Accuſers) of <hi>Reviling, Vngodly Speeches</hi> and <hi>falſe Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</hi>
Or whether he hath given Names to any of them (as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
in their Paper) that they did not deſerve, &amp; did not belong
to them? And whether it be not falſe that they ſay, <hi>This Meeting
having Tenderly and Orderly dealt with him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Whether they who have ſigned that Paper againſt him, are
not guilty of giving him Names that did not belong to him, but
may be juſtly accounted Names of <hi>Reviling, Vngodly Speeches</hi> and
<hi>falſe Accuſations?</hi> And whether <hi>Samuell Jenings</hi> particularly is not
greatly to be blamed for calling G. K. <hi>Worſe than Prophane,</hi> and
<hi>Apoſtate,</hi> ſeeing we know not wherein G. K. is in any one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
gone from Friends Doctrine or Practice, or what thing or
things he is guilty of, ſo as to be worthy of having his Miniſtry
denyed?</p>
            <p>3. Whether it cannot be proved, that that Faction (which have
ſufficiently ſhown their Oppoſition and Prejudice againſt <hi>G. K.</hi>
and have ſigned to that Paper againſt him) are <hi>guilty of Cloaking
more Damnable Hereſies and Errors, than any Proteſtant Society in
Chriſtendom,</hi> while it can be proved againſt them, that they have
not only cloaked <hi>W. Stockdale</hi> for above 18 Months, in ſaying,
<hi>To preach Faith in Chriſt within, and in Chriſt without, it to preach
Two Chriſts;</hi> and <hi>Tho. Witzwater,</hi> in ſaying, <hi>The Light in ſufficient
without any thing elſe,</hi> and <hi>That he owned no man Christ Jeſus as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator

and ſaying, <hi>That he had not learned that Leſſon, whether the God head
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95825:3"/>
was crucified on the Tree of the Croſs or ſome-what that he took of the
Virgin, &amp;c.</hi> but they have cloaked divers other Perſons in their
vile and groſs Errors, as can be ſufficiently proved, &amp; particularly
<hi>Sam. Jenings,</hi> in ſaying, <hi>To do our own buſineſs, as men, we needed not
a ſuper-natural Power;</hi> and <hi>Tho. Lloyd</hi> in arguing ſome hours, <hi>That
we might be Chriſtians good enough without the Faith of Chriſt as he
dyed for our ſins, and roſe again without us;</hi> and <hi>Arthur Cook</hi> &amp; <hi>John
Simcock</hi> in their charging <hi>G. K.</hi> for impoſing <hi>Novelties</hi> upon them,
when he affirmed, <hi>Chriſt was in Heaven in the ſame Body for being,
in which he ſuffered;</hi> and <hi>J. Simcock</hi> denyed that <hi>Christ roſe in the

Reſurrection of the Dead, but only what every one witneſſed within here:</hi>
Whether theſe, with many more that can be proved, were not
cauſe enough for <hi>G. K.</hi> to ſay, <hi>More Damnable Hereſies &amp; Errors
were cloaked among the</hi> Quakers <hi>here, than in any</hi> Proteſtant Society
<hi>in</hi> Chriſtendom?</p>
            <p>4. Seeing their Paper, ſigned by the 28 mentioneth a <hi>main
matter of Controverſie betwixt</hi> G. K. <hi>and them, which</hi> (they ſay) <hi>they
proffered to refer to one of his own Books, or to the Yearly Meeting here,
or to the Yearly Meeting at</hi> London; Let them ſhow what that <hi>main
Matter of Controverſie</hi> is, and wherein his preſent Doctrine doth
contradict any of his former Books, which he ſaith they can

him only a Titular, but no real Saviour, as one zealous for that

Chriſt. <hi>An empty Barrel,</hi> and another great Zealot ſaid, <hi>He did

            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:95825:4"/>
6. Whether it be neceſſary to our ſalvation, to believe, <hi>That
Chriſt dyed for our ſins without us, &amp; reſt again, and is gone into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
without us and there doth make Interceſſion for us?</hi> And whether
it doth not belong to ſound Chriſtian Doctrine to believe, <hi>That
Chriſt will come without us in his glorified Body to judge the quick and
the dead and that there ſhall be a general Day of Judgment, and that
there is a Reſurrection of the Dead to be, that the deceaſed Saints have
not yet attained generally, but wait for it until Chriſts Coming?</hi> And
whether <hi>there is not to be a Reſurrection of the Body, that is not the
Reſurrection or quickening of the Soul only,</hi> as ſome falſly imagine:
Let them clear themſelves in theſe things, they haviug given us
juſt cauſe to ſuſpect them Unbelievers therein.</p>
            <p>7. Whether every true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is not taught &amp; led to believe
in the Power and Spirit of Chriſt, &amp; his Eight and Life inwardly
revealed, and by the help of the ſaid meaſure to believe in him
who hath the Fullneſs, even the Man Chriſt Jeſus without us,
glorified in Heaven? And whether by <hi>True Faith in the Man Chriſt
Jeſus without us,</hi> as it is wrought by the meaſure of the Spirit and
Light of Chriſt in us, we receive not a daily ſupply and increaſe
of more <hi>Grace, Light</hi> &amp; <hi>Life,</hi> and a further meaſure of the Spirit
from the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus?</hi> And whether they who have not
this Faith in the Man Chriſt Jeſus without them, are worthy
to bear the honourable Name of <hi>Chriſtians?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. Whether it is not a great and neceſſary part of <hi>Chriſtian
Doctrine,</hi> neceſſary to be preached, in order to bring People to
an inward knowledge &amp; enjoyment of God and Chriſt, and the
holy Spirit, to preach <hi>Faith in Chriſt without us even the Man Chriſt
Jeſus,</hi> as he <hi>dyed for our ſins, and roſe again, &amp; is aſcended into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and there maketh Interceſſion for us,</hi> as well as <hi>Faith in Chriſt in
us.</hi> as he doth <hi>inwardly enlighten us?</hi> And whether it can be ſaid
that the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus</hi> is in us, otherwiſe than by a figurative
Speech, of giving the Name of the whole to the meaſure or part,
as when th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

9. Whether the ſaid 28 Perſons had not done much better to
have paſſed Judgment againſt ſom of their Brethren at <hi>Philadelphia</hi>
(ſome of themſelves being guilty) for countenancing &amp; allowing
ſome call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> and owning them in ſo doing, to hire men to
fight (&amp; giving them a Commiſſion ſo to do, ſigned by 3 Juſtices
of the Peace, one whereof being a Preacher among them) as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
they did, and recover'd a Sloop, &amp; took ſome Privateers
by Force of Arms?</p>
            <p>10. Whether hiring men thus to fight, &amp; alſo to provide the
<hi>Indans</hi> with Powder &amp; Lead to fight againſt other <hi>Indians,</hi> be not
a manifeſt Tranſgreſſion of our Principle againſt all uſe of the
carnal Sword, &amp; other carnal Weapons? And whether theſe call'd
<hi>Quakers,</hi> in their ſo doing, have not greatly weakened the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Friends in <hi>England, Barbadoes, &amp;c.</hi> who have ſuffered
much for the is refuſing to contribute to uphold the Militia, or any
Military force? And whether is not their Practice here an evil
Preſident, if any change of Government happen in this place, to
bring Sufferings on faithful Friends, that for Conſcience ſake refuſe
to contribute to the Militia? And how can they juſtly refuſe to
do that under another's Government, which they have done, or
allowed to be done under their own. But in theſe &amp; other things
we ſtand up Witneſſes againſt them, with all faithful Friends
every where.</p>
            <p>11. Whether it be according to the Goſpel, that Miniſters
ſhould paſs <hi>Sentence of Death</hi> on <hi>Malefactors,</hi> as ſome pretended
Miniſters here have done, preaching one day, <hi>Not to take an Eye
for an Eye Mat.</hi> 5. 38 and another day to contradict it, by taking
Life for Life?</p>
            <p>12. Whether there is any Example or Preſident for it Scripture,
or in all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> that Miniſters ſhould engroſs the Worldly
Government, as they do here? which hath proved of a very evil
Tendency.</p>
