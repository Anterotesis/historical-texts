         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Book here tendred to your view, was (for the most part of it) made in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> in the year 1645. I was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in my undertaking by a noble Gentleman of great faithfulnesse and Loyalty; that County hath many such. Before it was quite concluded, the Enemy, like a flood, brake in thither: Whereupon to preserve and finish it, I went to <hi>France,</hi> but by so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I had almost lost it; for my Cloak-bag, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it, (and all I had beside) passed (by accident) in one Ship, and my self went in another, and we landed an hundred miles asunder: that was Plundred, and nothing therein returned unto me, but onely these Papers, &amp; they by meer fortune some six weeks after. Which <hi>speciall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> in their particular preservation, spake them to my heart, Gods will to have them published, &amp; to my hopes, his purpose to grant a blessing: Hereupon I fitted them for the Presse with all speed, and they were ready in <hi>May<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 1646. nor was the fault in my will, that they were not then committed to the same. But perhaps God had a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Providence in this also, peoples hearts were not then so capable to receive a <hi>Vindication</hi> of their Soveraign from a fellow-Subject, as now they are even forced to be, by that illustrious eminency of his <hi>graces</hi> which hath beamed forth in his dark condition, even to the convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and admiration of all reasonable creatures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:29718:4"/>Since the finishing hereof, I had occasion to see and observe the manners and conditions of the <hi>French Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> both those of the <hi>Romish,</hi> and of the <hi>Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi> and my speciall care was, to understand what sense they had of the present differences in our Church and Nation; which truly to remember, is but to renew that griefe I had in observing. In briefe, they both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyntly rejoyced at our follies, and (as appeared to me) desired our ruine: And this did chiefly occasion the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my <hi>Post-script,</hi> which was done the last Spring, at my returne into the hither parts of that Kingdome, where I understood also of His Majesties restrained condition at <hi>Holdenby.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About the time of his deliverance from that place, by Gods direction and merciful protection, I came back safe into <hi>England;</hi> but fancying the season to be then past, for publication of my Book, in regard of those great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations which had happened since its first composall: and withall, some hopefull reasons offering themselves to my thoughts at my first arrivall, made me conceive it would not be so needfull. Therefore I resolved to lay it aside. But after some moneths expectance (those new hopes being likely to prove tympanous) I was solicited by some friends from the farthest part of the Kingdome, to put it to the Presse: now I was in a place where the same might be done; who also informed me that (in their apprehensions) vulgar hearts wanted satisfaction in nothing concerning the Kings integrity, but only in the matter of those Letters, which did still scruple many of them. Wherefore they conjured me, (if I rendred His Majesties Honour indeed) that I should give the world a speedy view, of what I had writ to that particular.</p>
                  <p>These Arguments easily prevailed with a willing mind, which was encouraged farther by that free liberty which
<pb facs="tcp:29718:4"/>
I saw daily used by others, in writing &amp; speaking against those sins and sinners, which this Book reproveth; though to my griefe withall I saw in many Papers wickednesse rather scoffed at, then pursued with such grave and home rebukes as the case requireth: and sin thereby I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved was rather made a matter of <hi>laughter,</hi> then of <hi>sorrow,</hi> even to the most guilty, (through that impudence which is in them: and yet I doubt not too but ingenious lashes are sufficiently distastfull to galled spirits, because there is truth as well as wit in them; they haply may be as <hi>rods</hi> to rotten hearts, but Gods Word if closely apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (as I hope in some measure tis in this Book done) will prove unto them as a very <hi>Scorpion;</hi> if those make them <hi>hisse</hi> and <hi>spit,</hi> this will make them even <hi>rage</hi> and <hi>roare;</hi> for the more Divinity a proofe carryes with it or in it, the more tormentfull it is alwayes unto the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. <hi>Sic scriptum est</hi> may haply silence Satan, but tis not alwayes so powerfull upon the spirits of proud men. The Pharisees were so far from being quieted by Christs do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that they grew more <hi>inraged,</hi> and were incensed thereby to seek his ruine, and had no rest till they had procured it, though they got none by it. And let any one practice Christ, or follow him in his way as close as he can, he shall (doubtlesse) meet with those that will pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice the Pharisees, and follow them a great deale closer.</p>
                  <p>It was in my thoughts (I confesse) to have concealed my name, as you may see in the following Preface, and for what reasons: but I have altered my resolution con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that particular, from these considerations.</p>
                  <p>First, if I had not owned my work, I had done that which I dislike, and incurr'd the blame which I object to others; I had hazarded my Book to be entitled a <hi>Libel,</hi> and exposed my selfe to be reckoned in the number of
<pb facs="tcp:29718:5"/>
                     <hi>night-birds</hi> that love darknesse: yea, I had receded from my former self: for when the King was in a condition vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly Potent, I prefixt my name to all I writ; and if I should forbeare to do so now, I should appeare as faln in my zeal, and abated in my dutifull affections, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases of his Afflictions. I read of <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> who affecting secresie while Jesus was at liberty, came to him by night; but when he was in <hi>restraint,</hi> he thought it his duty to discover himself in his behalf, and so he did more then ever: <hi>All Scripture is written for our learning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, I held my self bound to attest my <hi>Keeping,</hi> as I had done my <hi>Taking the Protestation,</hi> and that was, by writing my name. For this, my Book is nothing else but the discharge of my Conscience and Duty in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect: Herein I have (according to the very Letter of it) <hi>with my power maintained and defended,</hi> 1. <hi>The true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Protestant Religion expressed in the Doctrine of the Church of England against Popish Tenents, and Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> 2. <hi>His Majesties Royal Person, Honour and Estate, according to mine Allegiance:</hi> And 3. <hi>The Power and Priviledges of Parliament, together with the true Rights and Liberties of the Subject:</hi> Yea, I have here endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with all faithfulnesse, to vindicate the Dignitie of that High and Supreme Court, from the scandall of Rebellion, Oppression, Injustice and other evils, which to its great disgrace have been practised under its vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Name, and thereby (so much as in me lieth) I have freed it from the merit of that <hi>Odium</hi> which is wrought in Peoples hearts against it: For indeed the very name of <hi>Parliament</hi> is grown more hatefull to many of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar (through their ignorance,) then ever that of <hi>Starre-Chamber,</hi> or <hi>High-Commission</hi> was: and they wish and pray (through their folly) that the same may be quite abolished as those others are. I have also herein <hi>opposed</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:29718:5"/>
                     <hi>and endeavoured to bring</hi> (by discovering their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) <hi>to condigne punishment those</hi> evill workers, <hi>who by Force, Practice, Councels, Plots, Conspiracies, and every other way have done things contrary to all those things in the said Protestation contained:</hi> All which <hi>I promised and vowed to do, in a lawfull way,</hi> (which is that of my Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) even with the hazard of <hi>my life</hi> as well as of mine <hi>estate</hi> (which is lost already;) and this my Conscience sayes I shall not fully do, unlesse I publickly own my doings by prefixing my name unto them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I considered with my self, that by concealing my name, I should seem (in a sort) to be ashamed of that Truth which I professe to maintain, and of following my Master Christ, in his way of detecting Hypocrites, and wicked men: He saith of himself, that <hi>in secret he had spoke nothing,</hi> that is, He was no back-biter, no whisperer against any in private corners. He spake openly against mens evill doings, and was never ashamed to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his own Doctrines: And he hath said too, that I <hi>cannot be his Disciple,</hi> that is, approved indeed, unlesse I <hi>follow him, viz:</hi> in his very way, doing his work after his very manner; though I meet with his <hi>Crosse</hi> in the doing of it, which also I must <hi>take up</hi> chearfully after his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, be it with the losse of my life it selfe; He lost his before me.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I considered that my Book is likely to prove more serviceable by mine open acknowledgement of it; the writings of that couragious and learned Judge, Master <hi>David Jenkins,</hi> are believed to have done the more good by the setting his name unto them: nor did I think it comely that any man should appeare more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute for the Law of the Land, then the Ministers of Christ are for the Law of their God.</p>
                  <p>For mine own part I am sure I should shew my selfe
<pb facs="tcp:29718:6"/>
most strangely ungratefull to the Almighty, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strustfull of him, (after so large an experience as I have had of his mercy and goodnesse) if any feare of danger, should make me upon this occasion obscure my self. My former Books (though plain) (by his gracious blessing) were not unfruitfull among many of my Countrymen, unto whom my name (as of late I perceive) is not so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statefull, that I should think them unwilling to see it in print again: and from any hurt by those that took offence at them, my God hath hitherto protected me; as he hath often done (praised be his Name) from the mischiefs (of being beaten and pistolled) often threatned by some of the prophaner sort of our Cavalleers, for my free preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against their blasphemy and dissolutenesse, their self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeking, lust-pleasing, and King-neglecting basenesse. Now after <hi>Davids</hi> way of arguing; <hi>He that delivered me from the Lion and the Beare, can also, &amp;c.</hi> He is the same God still, if I can but believe, He can, yea and will preserve in the midst of danger: wherefore though it was once in my mind (<hi>viz.</hi> when I was at a great distance) both to conceale my name, and also to keep out of their reach, (as may appear by that passage page 275.) yet now being returned amongst them, I have for these reasons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered my resolution in that particular.</p>
                  <p>And again, beside these <hi>Reasons,</hi> I had in my heart also these <hi>Reasonings:</hi> What if I do suffer? is it not for a <hi>King, a gracious King,</hi> to whom I have sworn <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and under whose Protection I have laboured in Gods Vineyard? Is it not for a <hi>Church,</hi> a <hi>mother-Church,</hi> that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted me first Christs <hi>Member,</hi> and afterwards Christs <hi>Minister?</hi> is it not for keeping the <hi>Protestation,</hi> that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation</hi> tendred to me by the <hi>Parliament,</hi> when it was a <hi>Parliament?</hi> is it not for discharging my <hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Office?</hi> for <hi>telling people of their sins</hi> (according to Gods
<pb facs="tcp:29718:6"/>
Command?) for detecting <hi>Hypocrites</hi> after Christs own example? and shall I by suffering for the same do any other, then with <hi>Simon of Cyrene</hi> help my Saviour bear his Crosse? Have I yet resisted unto bloud as many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me have done? Ought I not to be willing to lose life it self for my Brethren, to redeem them from the wayes of sinne and errour? May not haply this their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption be effected sooner by suffering, then by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Is not my exclusion and debarment from an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed place to preach in, a kind of a call or setting aside to sufferings? Could Saint <hi>Paul</hi> have wished himself even separate from Christ, if on that condition he might have united his Countrymen unto him, and should not I be willing to go to Christ for the gaining of mine? Am I not Christs own to be disposed of for his service? Did not he <hi>buy</hi> me for that end? Did not he honour me with the dignity of being one of his Ministers of purpose that I should bear witnesse of his Truth? is it any new thing to suffer for the sake of that? Shall I (if thereunto called) be the first that have attested the same unto the world? Beside, what advantage will the Adversaries get to themselves by being cruel to me? Shal they not rather confirm thereby to the world what I have written of their conditions? Nay, shall not those whom I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected onely in the generall, by their being angry at me, expose themselves to be known <hi>particulatim &amp; nominatim,</hi> and shall hey any whit strengthen their Dominion by my ruine? Shall they not rather hasten their own thereby? Was not the reigne of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Bishops here in <hi>Queen Maries</hi> dayes the sooner at its period (in the judgements of all men) for their persecuting those Reverend Bishops and Ministers, who opposed their sinnefull wayes, and sealed wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> their bloud that <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Lyturgie,</hi> which is now a pulling
<pb facs="tcp:29718:7"/>
down in this Kingdome? These and such like also were the reasonings of my spirit, concerning this matter of prefixing my <hi>name,</hi> to this <hi>Vindication.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But perhaps some of you will say, <hi>Ad quid perditio haec,</hi> what needs all this waste of words? Times are not now as they have been. Many of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> faction, in whom the spirit of cruelty is most <hi>naturall,</hi> and who ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Rost when most of these villanies were acted, which your Book reproveth, are either runne away, or turned the other way: for the <hi>Militia</hi> (now most in the others hands) hath proved a stronger Argument with their Consciences, then their <hi>Covenant:</hi> &amp; therefore there is no cause to fear persecution, for a discharge of duty: And besides, these are times wherein every one may speak and practice as himself pleaseth, nor can any be imagined so vile as to permit all that will; to write against that King whom God hath commanded to Honour, and that Church which baptized and taught us all the knowledge of God we have, and be offended onely at those that write in their behalf: Shall we think that men have leave in these Reforming times to be any thing but true <hi>Protestants,</hi> and to do any thing but their duties? away, away with all Panick fears.</p>
                  <p>To this I Answer: 1. There is a <hi>Leaven</hi> of that proud and sower <hi>Faction</hi> yet remaining. 2. There is a Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Apostate Priests,</hi> too much in favour with men of Power: and these are mischievous men, who having themselves betrayed the Truth, cannot abide that any should appear for it; they have hitherto been the chief movers to persecution, for those <hi>Greater persons</hi> would never (doubtlesse) have defiled themselves with such actions, as casting Gods Ministers out of their Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if some of these little <hi>Satans</hi> had not stood at their <hi>right hands</hi> to tempt them, &amp; provoke them. Now these
<pb facs="tcp:29718:7"/>
persons, (specially those of mine old acquaintance) do cry nothing but <hi>hanging, hanging</hi> against me, (for I believe, their sight of me puts them in mind of their own Apostacy, from that way of Christ, wherein for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they walked with me) they have confidently said it, that <hi>the Parliament would hang me:</hi> And why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I was one (among many others) that had proved this unnaturall Warre to be unlawfull by Gods Word, and had <hi>Vindicated sacred Scripture</hi> from those false and perverse glosses, which for ill purposes were put upon it: And these Prophets (that in this particular at least themselves may appear true) will do their best I beleeve with the <hi>Members</hi> of both <hi>Houses,</hi> to make good the word which they have spoken; for those Lords and Gentlemen whom they relate unto (if they can prevaile with them) shall be all conditioned like <hi>Dionisius</hi> the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of <hi>Siracuse</hi> who sent <hi>Philoxenus</hi> to the gallows, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he would not flatter him. But as the Prophet said, so say I; <hi>As for me, behold I am in their hands, let them</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 26. 14, 15.</note> 
                     <hi>do with me as seemeth meet &amp; good unto them,</hi> &amp;c. It hath been mine endeavour this seaven years day, and my usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Prayer, that I may be able to conclude as M. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> the Martyr did concerning those that had power over him: <hi>viz. If they shall imprison me, Ile thanke them; If they shall burn me, Ile thank them; If they shall banish me, Ile thanke them; but if they shall give me leave to preach the Gospell, Ile thank them more:</hi> and I promise them withall by Gods grace, to be a daily Petitioner for their Conversion, and for the pardon of their sins.</p>
                  <p>And for my kind Brethren, I will (in requitall) remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them of their destiny: they may reade it themselves in <hi>Isay</hi> 9. 15. <hi>The Prophet that teacheth lies is the tail:</hi> So in <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 8. 9. The Lord speaking to some of their stamp, saith, <hi>Because ye have departed out of the way, and caused</hi>

                     <hi>my people to stumble, therefore Ile make you the most vile, base &amp; contemptible among them.</hi> Yea, I doubt not e'relong but by most men they'l be so reputed, (however of late they have been honoured:) and justly indeed do they me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to be the <hi>tail of the people, for making themselves to be</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 12. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>the tayl of the Dragon:</hi> which they have manifestly done by their <hi>casting down the Stars from Heaven,</hi> the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Ministers out of Christs Church: But when this their day of contempt is come, and they are assaulted (as that Popish Doctor <hi>Bourn</hi> was in <hi>Queen Maries</hi> dayes) even in the Pulpit, from whence they have vented their lies and blasphemies, (as to this it will come:) I hope (if I live to see it) I shall have grace to approve my selfe to them, as Master <hi>Bradford</hi> did to him; and help to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct them away in safety from vulgar rage, &amp; perswade the people to rest quiet; (for thus it becomes the true Gospel:) No disaffection have I now (as God knows) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their persons, though I professe my selfe a perfect ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to their courses.</p>
                  <p>But now (good Readers) to leave them, there remains onely two requests which I make to you.</p>
                  <p>The first is this, That you would not think amisse of the most High and Honourable Court of Parliament, for those evils that are done in these daies under its name; and if any suggest that such or such passages in this my Book are against the same, believe them not, for I professe unto you, I neither do nor dare think the supreme Court of Justice in this Kingdome to be all one with sinne, or that Oppression, Sacriledge, Rebellion, Popery, and those other Evils, which I inveigh against, are the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>that,</hi> when God shall please to restore unto us a <hi>true Parliament,</hi> you shall see all these things amended; and the Authours of them severely punished: Have still therefore a Reverend esteem of Parliaments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:29718:8"/>Secondly, I desire that you would not conceive any bitternesse in me or in my Book, against the persons of those men that now are called the <hi>Parliament</hi> (as perhaps some may fancy, because my usage hath not been good) for I professe here also unto you, that I do not apprehend my self, (in respect of my self) to have any true cause of hate towards them: I thank God I can say to them as the Apostle to his <hi>Galathians, You have not hurt me at all:</hi> Nay, rather I hope they have been the means to make me (in some sort) a better Christian.</p>
                  <p>The Causes of my sufferings (as I learned at first from some of themselves) were these foure: I hinted them indeed to the world before in <hi>my</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">A Book so called, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, 1643.</note> 
                     <hi>Loyall Subjects Belief,</hi> and referre them now to your judgements, whether they may not occasion comfort and rejoycing in me, yea and love too towards them, rather then hatred or ill affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                  <p>The first was (as I was then told) <hi>because I was an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest man; and thereby did more hurt to their Cause</hi> (being opposite to it) <hi>in the Country where I was known, then an hundred knaves:</hi> what greater <hi>Honour</hi> could they do me, then by affording this Testimony of me? This rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son I confesse from their mouths was apprehended by me as a timely intimation and call from God, to doe their cause from thence forth what hurt I could, which (by his power) I have since endeavoured, and (by his grace) shall continue so to doe unto my lives end.)</p>
                  <p>The second was, <hi>Because I had preached the Truth, which (the Member said) was not to be spoken at all times; no not by those intrusted with it of God, though al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a Divine Truth, and in danger to be lost.</hi> What an high Dignitie also was this to me, to be ranked thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Christs Disciples, and thought worthy to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer (as the Apostles did) for the Truth of God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:29718:9"/>The third was, <hi>Because I was for the King:</hi> And what are my sufferings for this Reason, but a publick Proclamation in my behalf, that I am a <hi>good Subject,</hi> and one of those few, among many, that have <hi>obtained mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God to be faithfull.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth was, <hi>Because I would not preach to promote the warre.</hi> Now what fuller manifestation could they make of my being <hi>Philopatris,</hi> a lover of my Country; and a true Minister of Christ the Prince of Peaee; then by their taking from me what I had; because I would not be tempted to doe a thing destructive to my Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and mis-becoming the Gospel? yea, and more then this, themselves of late have punished diverse <note n="*" place="margin">The stirrers up to a new Warre.</note> persons for not being (like me) of such conditions.</p>
                  <p>And thus (Christian Readers) having seen the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of my sufferings, I beleeve you will judge (as I do) that I have no particular cause of hatred against these men, who have been (as I take it) but Gods Instruments to give a good testimony of me unto the <hi>World:</hi> wheresore (I beseech you all) mistake me not in your reading my Book: fancy not <hi>that,</hi> under a notion of <hi>bitternesse,</hi> which may be called <hi>Gratitude</hi> rather: my endeavours are, to bring them back <hi>out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse into Light,</hi> from <hi>under the power of Satan unto God:</hi> My expressions to this end (perhaps) sometimes are sharp and home: But I have been a practitioner in the high Art of Soul-faving this twentie years, and by Gods blessing have attained to so much skill therein, that I know all sinners are not alike, nor must be dealt with in the same way; our Saviour spoke to the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> after another manner, then he was wont to do to the Common people: Some must <hi>by violence</hi> be plucked out of the fire.</p>
                  <p>Last of all, I desire this of you that fear the Lord to
<pb facs="tcp:29718:9"/>
afford me the Protection of your Prayers: I might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire you by the Protestation you have taken, to <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> and <hi>defend</hi> me also <hi>other wayes,</hi> (as thereby you are bound) in whatsoever I have here said or done, it being onely <hi>in pursuance of the said Protestation,</hi> (which I have perfixt to the beginning of the Book, that with the more case you may observe and compare mine aims and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours with the words and scope therein.) But indeed your supplications to God, is that onely which I desire, for next to faith in God, I count the Prayers of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the best <hi>Militia</hi> under Heaven, for protection and preservation; and so the Lord of Life and Spirit rest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, and dwell in you for ever.</p>

                  <p>ABout <hi>July, 1645.</hi> a certaine scandalous Pamphlet, entituled, <hi>The Kings Cabinet opened, &amp;c.</hi> was published by certaine unnaturall Englishmen, and dispersed through His Majesties Dominions of <hi>Great Britaine</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> on purpose to make Him distastfull to His owne people: Yea many of the Copies were transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to forraigne parts, to render<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Him a spectacle of offence to the whole world: one of them (some moneths after the divulging) fortuned into my hands, which when I had read, and with amazement considered, the reproachful style, and mischievous scope of the Authors therein, finding it every way, (in regard of the persons from and of whom it was) more vile then <hi>Senacherib's</hi> Letter or <hi>Rabshekah's</hi> Tongue: I thought it my duty first to <hi>spread it before the Lord,</hi> and then before the world, in opening the true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, which I have here done for these ends:</p>
                  <p>First, to <hi>vindicate my Soveraigns Name and Honour,</hi> to which as a Subject I am bound by <hi>common Allegeance, Oath,</hi> and <hi>Protestation.</hi> 2. To <hi>warne you</hi> (my fellow-Subjects) <hi>of the snare laid to catch you;</hi> (for your subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion as well as the Kings defamation is aimed at) and to this I am engaged, as a <hi>Brother,</hi> as a <hi>Christian.</hi> 3. To <hi>detect the virulent natures, and cursed dispositions of wicked men,</hi> which I am obliged to performe, in respect of mine <hi>office</hi> and <hi>calling,</hi> being one of those, whom God hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured to be a <hi>Seer,</hi> or Watchman in his <hi>Israel,</hi> a Minister of his Church, whose imployment is to lay open Satans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, to discover Wolves, to uncase Hypocrites, according to Christs owne example in the dayes of his flesh.) And to
<pb facs="tcp:29718:10"/>
these I may adde a fourth, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>justifie the Church of England,</hi> and true Protestant Religion, (whereof I am a member and a Professor) <hi>from all allowment and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, of any such unreverend, blasphemous, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull language, against Soveraine Majesty,</hi> as that malicious Pamphlet is stuffed withall.</p>
                  <p>Peradventure this work hath been already done by others, of like relation with my selfe, who have both confuted the Libell, and defended the King: but their Piety is no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge to my Duty. I must therefore answer my part unto it, I must also declare my opinion of it; for indeed (as <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu</hi> in <hi>Job</hi> said) <hi>I am full of matter, and the spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in<note place="margin">Job 32. 18.</note> me doth constraine me:</hi> I took the <hi>Protestation</hi> as well as any, to <hi>defend my Soveraignes Name and Honour;</hi> yea and to oppose in my way, all such, as by any means should endeavour to darken, and impeach the same.</p>
                  <p>And let not those persons who first authorized that <hi>Protestation,</hi> and afterward this <hi>Libel,</hi> fancie to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that all men will be induced by this to break that, (though too many are:) or that God will so far neglect his <hi>Anointed,</hi> as not to stir up some (though of the meanest quality,) who by laying their actions to the rule of Gods Word, shall freely (notwithstanding their stupendious great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) discover to the world, the irregularity of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in their countenancing so <hi>vile a thing</hi> (as this is) against Him, whom by all Lawes of God and man they are bound to reverence and defend: whereas <hi>disdaine</hi> (at least) and <hi>vexation</hi> shall be increased in them; as was in those Pharisees, whom <hi>Hosanna to the Son of David</hi> was ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choed<note place="margin">Mat. 21. 15.</note> from the mouthes of children: nay as our Saviour upon that occasion said, <hi>should such hold their peace, the<note place="margin">Luk. 19. 40.</note> very stones would cry out</hi> in a case of this nature.

and most <hi>Sacred</hi> Person under Heaven that I defend: And is there not a cause to be zealous against them, who have defamed and reviled him? <hi>Wherefore should such dead<note place="margin">1 Sam. 16. 9.</note> dogs</hi> (dead in trespasses and sins) <hi>curse my Lord the King, and I, even contemptible I, not be moved with the same?</hi> A Polititian may haply speak from his braine, about the Honour and Duty belonging to a King, without any touch, or sense of heart: but I am a plaine man, and cannot write coldly, or without affection, about things I hold deare and precious.</p>
                  <p>Againe, I desire such before they judge to consider also the condition of that <hi>faction</hi> against whom I write: they are a generation of people that have done more disgrace and wrong to Christs <hi>Gospel,</hi> then ever was offered since Christs time: Never did any in so short a space ascend to that <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith</hi> of villany, as they have done, or <hi>pretend</hi> more godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, with the <hi>practice</hi> of so much wickednesse. The Papists in 3. or 400. yeeres were never able to reach that superla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive pitch of dissimulation, hypocrisie, pride, and cruelty, as these have done in 3. or 4. These are the men that were wont to brag, that <hi>Never any Puritan was knowne to be in any Treason, but Bishops alwayes:</hi> so <hi>Layton</hi> affirms (if we will beleeve him) in his <hi>Sions Plea.</hi> But were it so, the Scene (we are sure) is now quite altered by themselves; for the grandest Treason and Rebellion that ever was, is now in action upon the Stage of the world, wherein are act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Puritans, and no Bishops. He then, and the <hi>Smectymnists</hi> since, and <hi>Prin</hi> after them, took great pains with much spleen to reckon up many severall actions in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Ages, wherein Prelates had been molestfull to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our Land: and the world (supposing they did the same, in dislike and hatred of Rebellion) did commend their zeale in so doing; but now it appeares (from what hath fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed upon the same) that they did it rather to another end;
<pb facs="tcp:29718:12"/>
namely, to set forth the better their owne dexterity, in a thing of like nature, to shew that their owne faction (when they set to it) could doe more in one Act and Age, then all those others had done in many. Wherefore if their <hi>Gall</hi> then against Bishops was accounted <hi>Godlinesse,</hi> I desire that my <hi>tartnesse</hi> now against themselves, for going deeper in the same condemned paths, may not be accounted <hi>bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> God knows my soule is grieved at those very thoughts which arise in me sometime against many of these men, (once my deare and intimate acquaintance) and were I not forced in this manner, to disclose their unchristian wares, from meere necessity, in defence of impugned truth; and to warne the world, to avoid the contagion of seducement; I should not take that course in describing them, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse is rather more excusable where it cannot, then common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where it can be spared.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, if any shall conceive that my expressions are not so respective (as they think is meet) towards those now above-board called the <hi>Parliament,</hi> (who are the Heads of this disloyall Faction:) I desire such to observe me well, that I speak not against any, as they are <hi>Parliament</hi> men, or as Honourable in this world, but onely as they are <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi> to the King, and <hi>Enemies</hi> to Christs Gospel: Nor doe I apprehend (as appeares upon grounds in my discourse) that they who are guilty of these grand enormities, are any true <hi>Members</hi> (however they reckon themselves) of that high Court, which I honour with my truest affections, as the very <hi>Palladium</hi> of the Kingdome. But those whom I vent my zeale against, I beleeve to be persons designed of God, for the publique abhorment, and scorn of all men, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have (by this wicked Libel) exposed the Lords Anointed to be (as Christ was) <hi>Ludibrium hominum &amp;<note place="margin">Psal. 22. 6.</note> opprobrium populi:</hi> for whoever will doe the Jews <hi>work,</hi> must look to be paid with the Jews wages; and therefore I
<pb facs="tcp:29718:12"/>
hold that without offence to God, I may, yea and I ought, to speak and think of them as I doe; nor must I be a respecter of any, in my opposing sin, but if I look to dwell on Gods holy Hill, I must despise the vile how great soever. Besides, the example of Christ is my warrant in this case; for he (as a Preacher) did speak against such like conditioned men, with as much severity of expression, as I have done. He call'd them <hi>vipers,</hi> and <hi>children of the Devil,</hi> though they were<note place="margin">Joh. 8. 44.</note> of great esteeme, both with themselves and others. And tis well knowne what manner of language <hi>Elias</hi> used to the worshippers of <hi>Baal;</hi> and in what method and words, among other godly men, <hi>Lurther</hi> in <hi>Germany, Savanarola</hi> in <hi>Italy, Philip Morney</hi> in <hi>France, Cyprian Valera</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and <hi>John Fox</hi> in <hi>England</hi> did tax and discover the corruptions of the <hi>Papacie:</hi> Yea (as in the Preface to the Book of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs is shewne) God in all Ages hath stirred up some to lay open freely, to the abused world, the hypocrisie and villany of those wolvish people that bore sway in their severall gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. Nor will God suffer them in these dayes, to goe long unmasked under false shewes; He will stir up spirits, who in love to his holy truth, and hatred of sin, shal describe them at large, in their proper colours, yea and transmit their very <hi>names,</hi> as well as their <hi>acts,</hi> unto Posterity, (as <hi>Fox</hi> hath done the Persecutors in Q. <hi>Maries</hi> time) to their eternall infamie. For my selfe, I doe not name any person (unlesse those that have named themselves in Print already) nor doe I speak so expresly of any particular, as they in their Libel doe of the King: although there is never a villany, cruell act, or blasphemous expression, quoted in this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, but the persons by whom spake or done, and the places where, might have been set down punctually: But my opposition is not against Men, but Sinne, which I hate in all, and in the best most. I pray for the persons of the worst, and I desire all men to joyne with me in so doing, for these Reasons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:29718:13"/>First, <hi>Christ commands</hi> us to pray for them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spightfully<note place="margin">Luke 6. 28.</note> use us. 2. We are <hi>Christians,</hi> in whom as the sight of an enemies misery must awaken pity, so of his sinne must kindle Prayer. 3. They are our <hi>Countrymen,</hi> as those Israelites were to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that thirsted for his blood; therefore like him we must endeavour their salvation. 4. They have deserved this duty at our hands, (though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares unto themselves) for by their ill usage of us, they have thrust us farther under Gods wing, then we were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and made us more sensibly to feele the heat of his love, and to taste the comfort of his Providence, to be better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with God, and Christ, then ever perhaps we should have been, had we alwayes lived at Peace in our possessions. Many of us had learned to <hi>abound</hi> before, though not to <hi>want,</hi> but these have taught us that too: and to see the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and ficklenesse of earthly prosperity: they have loosned our hearts much from the world, and made us think of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven more seriously; and doth not all this deserve our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? Nay and farther, God expects we should (as by this course we may) discover a better spirit to be in us, then is in them, and that we serve a better Master. And againe, his Gospel being now under foot, he looks that we should raise up its honour from the dust againe, in praying for these ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry men, according to the tenour of it: we have cause to suspect, they have sinned <hi>the sin against the holy Ghost,</hi> (at least many of them:) but we are not certaine thereof, and therefore we are bound to pray for them: this is mine exhortation to all men, and the grounds of it, upon which I build mine owne practice; and let not any think (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing my zeale against mens <hi>sins</hi>) that I dare be otherwise affected then thus, unto their <hi>persons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Last of all, if any shall think me worthy of blame, for not plainly expressing mine own name, seeing that I find fault with the Authors of the Libel for concealing theirs: Let
<pb facs="tcp:29718:13"/>
such know, that tis not because I am ashamed of it, or of my worke; but my reason is this: I am an obscure and meane person, and my name can no whit advance the credit of my labours; but perhaps, even debase it rather, yea, amongst too many of our owne side, (as they are accounted) who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fleshed themselves with the monies of the King, or the spoiles of his people, can wallow in luxury, while he is in misery; and deride at meane persons for being affected for him. Besides, the subscribing my name, in regard of my low condition, is likely to be more vexatious to the <hi>great men,</hi> whom I seeme to oppose, then perhaps my <hi>Book</hi> it self may be: for this (by Gods grace) may be conceived (as it truly is) but a defiance against their ungodly courses: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as that may be taken as a contemptuous affront against their very persons, nor would I willingly increase sin or rage in any.</p>
                  <p>If any desire to know what I am, let this satisfie: I am one of those <hi>weak and despised things,</hi> which God some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 27, 28.</note> makes use of, <hi>to confound the Mighty.</hi> A <hi>Member</hi> I am, and a <hi>Minister</hi> of the Ancient and <hi>true Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of England:</hi> One that equally hates <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in Gods Worship and Service, as I doe <hi>Indecency</hi> and <hi>Profanenesse.</hi> I am one that can live under another Church-Government, (in a State where 'tis established by the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Magistrate) with more quietnesse (I believe) then they can or will doe, that fight for an alteration in this Kingdome; although in my judgement I doe, and shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>Episcopal Government</hi> above any other in the world, as being in my conscience most Scripturall, and Orthodoxall. I am one that loves not to hear <hi>Calvin</hi> railed upon, by them that never read him, for I judge him to have been a great instrument of Gods glory, though (I think him) not infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I entitle not my self unto him, nor to any man else: I am a Christian, and that's my glory. I have bid defiance (by
<pb facs="tcp:29718:14"/>
Gods grace) to the worlds malice, and to the Devils works: and have manifested the same against one of them, in this my <hi>Vindication,</hi> which I here commend to the candid accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of all you, my fellow-subjects of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> for whom I pray, that you may be all such (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting in sins and miseries) as my selfe am,</p>

conceale their names; but their modesty herein is not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired; for Satan himself would have done as much in the same case: He acting the Calumniators part against his Soveraigne, appeared to our first Parents in a strange shape, and concealed himself after these mens fashion; and surely had this Book come immediately from him, as it doth from them, he would have blushed to own it.</p>
                     <p>S. <hi>Paul,</hi> S. <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>Jude,</hi> sending abroad into the world <hi>Epistles</hi> Generall to reclaim the seduced, prefixed their names at full length, (for nothing fell from their pens, either for form, or matter, but what became the Gospel of <hi>Jesus,</hi> and workmen that needed not to be ashamed.) But this <hi>Hidden Crew</hi> putting forth a certain thing to a like purpose, (as they pretend) have not set down so much as the first letters of their names, <hi>S. M. E. C.</hi> or the like, that the seduced might, at least, have guessed, to whow they are beholding.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sed ex ungue Leonem,</hi> the devill is discerned by his Paw, and the Pulpit (<hi>alas</hi>) helps us too far in our search after these men: thence we learn, who beares the Bell in these daies, for lying, slandering, and evill speaking. 'Tis commonly observed that few can act Satan now so well, as some of those, who formerly did best preach Christ: <hi>Corruptio optimi est pessima;</hi> Time was, when none might, or durst compare with them of Rome, for defaming Dignities, or Soveraigne Princes; witnesse those books of <hi>Parsons</hi> and <hi>Sanders,</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Queen Elizabeth:</hi> but were those two now alive, they might go to Schoole to our men, in each of whom <hi>Parsons</hi> spirit is both doubled and trebled. And is there not a reason? They say, <hi>These are times of more light and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:</hi> indeed they are, in the art, and science of evill speaking.</p>
                     <p>In those former dayes (<hi>of darknesse,</hi> as they are now accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) when peace, mercy, gentlenesse, and obedience, faith in Christ, and conformity to his example, was the sole subject of these mens discourses to the people; themselves were then but poore fellows, of an underly condition, called and known by the contemptible name of <hi>Christs Ministers:</hi> but since this <hi>new light</hi> (so much talked on) hath appeared, and discovered a more gainful and advantagious way, they have altered their scene, turned <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,</hi> and venting slanders and reproaches, have provoked to rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29718:15"/>
warre and bloud; whereby they have purchased a new name unto themselves, (more sutable indeed to their present, then to their former way) and are called, <hi>The ministers of the Parliament.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And these men, or some of them, (from the method, stile and matter of that book) are conceived by many to be the Authors of it: which, if they be, I require them by that name of <hi>Christian</hi> (which as yet they own) that they shew out of Christs Gospell, some one precept, or allowed example (at least) warranting any to deal thus, with their naturall Liege-Lord, or with any ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, that's but a brother, as they do with their Soveraigne.</p>
                     <p>Suppose the faults here charged upon him, were reall and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and not by perversion onely, and imputation: yet where is there any Scripture authorizing this their publication? themselves (while they were Christs ministers) were not to alledge that saying of <hi>Esay,</hi> against the intruders of groundles inovations. <hi>To the Law,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Esay 8. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>to the Testimony, if they speak not according to this word, 'tis because there is no light in them:</hi> they must give us leave to conclude so too, and to say, <hi>there is no light</hi> in their very selves now, if they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge neither <hi>Law</hi> nor <hi>Testimony</hi> for this their undertaking.</p>
                     <p>But if these Ministers were not themselves the Authors of it, yet I wonder there should not be one sparke of ancient love still alive in some of their breasts, towards Jesus Christ their old Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, moving them in his behalf, to vindicate the Doctrine of his Gospell, and publikely to declare, how far the same is, from al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing any to speak evilly, or defamingly of the <hi>Ruler of a people.</hi> When they were on Christs side, I have heard some of them tax <hi>Luther</hi> very sharply for unrevernd speeches, (in a certain Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet) against our <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. because he was a king, though not his own; <hi>for</hi> (said they) <hi>such Language did not become the Gospell.</hi> Is not the Gospell still the same? yes surely; and had these men but been the same still too, they could not have seen such a Libell prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and often re-printed at <hi>London,</hi> in the midst of them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expressing much of their zeal against it.</p>
                     <p>Beside, did not these <hi>Parliament Ministers</hi> (for that now is their beloved title) take the <hi>Protestation to defend the Kings Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?</hi> Nay, were not they the men that tendred it unto others? did not they preach diverse Sermons at the beginning of this <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> to perswade to the taking of it? (I knew one of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29718:16"/>
them that preached a whole week together to that very purpose) and did they then only urge to vow, &amp; not to pay? Did they then intend (by their example) onely to draw people into Perjurie? if not, it lies upon them, as they will answer unto God, (before whom they did protest,) for those mens souls whom they did perswade, to cry down this accursed Pamphlet, so contrary to the tenour of that Protestation: and never to leave begging of them whose servants they now be, till 'tis burnt by the hand of the common hangman.</p>
                     <p>But 'tis observable in the third place, that this book is said to<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> be published, by the Authority of those, who first set out the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation, yea, and by their speciall Order too, <hi>Published by spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Order of the Parliament:</hi> therefore some may think, there is no likelyhood, that they who are too big to deny themselves, should be perswaded by their <hi>Beadsmen,</hi> to do any thing against their own <hi>Order.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To which I answer, Were they well informed (by those whom they think well of) that it would be as much for their credit (among Christians) to deny themselves, as to contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to recall their speciall <hi>Order,</hi> as to suffer it to continue in affront to their generall <hi>Ordinance,</hi> perhaps they might be wrought upon; and then withall, if a <hi>President</hi> were alleadged, for (as they say) they worke by Presidents, (though not by Rule,) peradventure they might be prevailed with.</p>
                     <p>And for the things sake, I will remember them of one, and it shall be of one that is extraordinary, (for I conceive an ordinary <hi>President</hi> will not serve the men that bear sway in this <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>) it shall be a <hi>President</hi> of their own making, (which speaks it excellent) such a <hi>President</hi> as the like was never heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and so the more fit for their further observance.</p>
                     <p>Let themselves call to minde, whether there was not an <hi>Act,</hi> (which is more then a bare <hi>Order</hi>) both made and nulled, in the same <hi>Session,</hi> since the Beginning of this <hi>Parliament,</hi> though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not dashed by that full Authority which did establish it; yet was it not set aside as needlesse and vain, or (at least) as not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently advised upon beforehand? The Act which I mean, was that which concerned the Fleet, or <hi>Navy</hi> against the <hi>Turkish Pirats,</hi> to redeem our Christian Country-men from Bondage.

                     <p>Our good King in his piety and pity to those poor Captives, had formerly, (with that <hi>Ship-money</hi> so grudgingly paid) built and sent out diverse Ships to the same purpose; and (God assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a work so Religious, and becoming a Christian Prince) he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed therewith against the Pyrats of <hi>Sally,</hi> and freed many of his Subjects, from barbarous slavery in that place: whereupon he made preparation also against those of <hi>Argyer,</hi> intending the like mercy for the Christians there, but was prevented in his designe by the <hi>Scottish</hi> insurrection, which forced him Northward: And before his intentions could return to motion, for that Southern Expedition, this unhappy <hi>Parliament</hi> (by his authority) met at <hi>Westminster,</hi> where (that it might be conceived some others had Bowels as well as He) a Bill was preferred, and disputed upon, concerning a <hi>Fleet</hi> to the fore-mentioned end; for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of which, though it might easily have been concluded, by settling of <hi>Ship-money</hi> in a <hi>Parliamentary</hi> way, with an <hi>Order</hi> for the manner of levying the same, to the Subjects liking, (which had been a more safe and sensible kinde of payment, then many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bursments extorted since, and might have been a mean to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue Gods nationall blessing upon the whole Kingdome, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressing (in that sort) all mens hearts and hands, in so charitable and Christian a work:) yet because it was a path wherein the King had trod, and they had no purpose to deal either with or for him, in any such friendly or Loyall way, as might shadow his apprehended haltings from his peoples eyes, by making that cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Legall,</hi> which had formerly appeared somewhat <hi>warping.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, there wanted matter or stuff, to fill up the belly of that <hi>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strum horrendrum,</hi> or ungospel-like <hi>Remonstrance,</hi> which was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be made against his Government, by which the people were to be taught to beleeve, that the King did never doe any thing well; therefore by all meanes <hi>Ship-money</hi> must be damned, and cryed down for ever, <hi>in perpetuam Regis ignominiam,</hi> if mouth can doe it: And for the intended <hi>Navy,</hi> another course was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded upon, to advance monies to maintaine that, <hi>viz.</hi> from
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29718:17"/>
the importation, and transportation of commodities.</p>
                     <p>But (by the way) while these things were in agitation amongst the wise; the King (having had more sincere, and serious thoughts about that businesse then other men, desiring and hoping to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and speed the designe, with his advice and Councell) sent them his judgement concerning some particulars about the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, only to consider upon, and to follow if they so pleased; or otherwise to proceed according to their own discretions: which advise of his, had they taken in good part from their Prince and Master, they had shewn no more respect unto him, then <hi>Job</hi> was wont to shew to his meanest servant: but they (lest they might seem to need his help by a civill acceptance of his Councel) were so far from relishing of it, that they presently voted the same to be an <hi>obstruction</hi> cast in on purpose to stop the businesse, nay a plain <hi>refusall</hi> of the King, to confirme the Bill: Whereupon his Sacred Majesty (being armed with meeknesse against affronts) leaving them wholy to their own devises, did presently signe their Bill, and in that fashion as they would have him: so discovering to all his people, (if they would see) that a <hi>Vote of Parliament may be fallible.</hi> And now behold (to return to the matter) when this <hi>Act</hi> was thus finished, according to their desires, and all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious hearts raised to an high expectation, of seeing their poor brethren quickly redeemed from <hi>Turkish</hi> thraldome, whether from their dislike of the Kings readinesse unto so Christian a work, or because they had some other imployment intended for the Merchants money here at home, I cannot tell: but that <hi>Act</hi> was never (as I heard) put in execution to this day, but even quite set aside; and as we may say (so much as in them lay) quite nullified, cancelled, and repealed: and free leave given to the <hi>Turks</hi> thereby, not onely to take our Country-men at sea, but also to come into the very havens of our Kingdome, and to carry away our Children, to the ruine of Christian souls for ever: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that whereas there was but the number of some 2000. English in slavery, when this so adored <hi>Parliament</hi> did begin, there is now, <hi>November,</hi> 1645. above 5000. in most lamentable bondage, our King being robbed and despoyled by his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Subjects, (<hi>Who consult,</hi> (as they say) <hi>to advance Christs Kingdome</hi>) of his <hi>Shippes,</hi> and <hi>Navy:</hi> wherewith he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29718:17"/>
was wont to defend his Realme from such Pyracies.</p>
                     <p>This is that <hi>Act</hi> which I spake of, and the reason of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring it at this time, is, to helpe the Authorizers of this vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Pamphlet with a president for the recalling their <hi>speciall Order,</hi> whereby 'tis published. And now before I return to my work in hand, let me assume the boldnesse to expostulate a little with these men: I am one of Gods Ambassadours; <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> who shall be <hi>their Judge,</hi> is <hi>my Master;</hi> and in his Name, let me reason with them about this matter: for I hope I may presume to speak unto them, (at a distance) as they are like my self, but <hi>Dust</hi> and <hi>Ashes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let me ask you a question in the first place, (<hi>O you superlative</hi>
                        <note place="margin">§. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>men,</hi>) Suppose some of your Novices and under-hand workers, (as alas you have too many such, I feare even about the King,) should by this Pamphlet, which you (whom they think <hi>infallible</hi>) have by <hi>speciall Order</hi> authorized, or by any other of like nature, published under your Protection, be moved to act <hi>Jaques Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> part, or <hi>Raviliacks</hi> part upon the Sacred person of their Soveraigne, can you imagine that the same will not be set on your score, as well as that of those <hi>Regicides</hi> was laid to the charge of the <hi>Jesuites,</hi> whose custome it was, (as your selves well know,) while the doctrine of King-killing was appropriate to their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to inspire men to the perpretation of that supream villany, by sending forth such conditioned books (as this is which you have authorized;) wherein with most reproachfull language they would paint out the Prince designed for slaughter, as if he were the greatest Tyrant, promise-breaker, and oppressor of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the world, and a person in no sort fit to live: that so it might be apprehended a <hi>most Heavenly work</hi> to rid the earth of him, and a service most acceptable unto the Lord? when <hi>Ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liack</hi> was demanded by his examiners, to declare the reason mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him to his attempt, he answered, <hi>That the reasons why it was requisite to kill the King, they might understand by the Sermons, and Pamphlets of the Preachers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wel (Sirs) we all know the meaning both of you and of your Prophets, and therefore as <hi>Elias</hi> from the Lord, did charge <hi>Ahab</hi> with the death of <hi>Naboth,</hi> because the letters provoking to it were signed with his seal: so do I from the same Lord, charge
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29718:18"/>
you with all those evil opinions and hard conceits, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready kindled in the mindes of any against the King, by the meanes of this Pamphlet; because 'tis <hi>published by your Authority:</hi> Yea, if any further mischief shall befall his Sacred Majesty upon the same; at your hands will the Judge of Heaven and Earth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it: and know you further, that the guilt of all the blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, reproaches, scornes, slanders, which are spit out against the King, either in this book, or any other published by your <hi>leave</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> (without your deep repentance and humiliation,) shal be heaped upon your Souls at <hi>the day of Reckoning,</hi> even as if your own selves had been the Authors of them: for <hi>nil interest sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leri, an faveas aut facias:</hi> to favour and to doe (in this case) is all one: nay the Apostle speaks, as if those who appove of other<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 32.</note> folks ill doings, were in a degree worse then the Actors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and given up in a further measure to a Reprobate sense: <hi>Qui non vetat peccare cum potest, jubet:</hi> (saies the wise Heathen) not to prevent a mischief when one may, is directly to command it to be done.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> (for as your souls friend, I would fain have you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover again that Title) <hi>I charge you before the living God, and Jesus Christ,</hi> who shall one day sit in judgement upon you, to ask your Consciences in secret, whether it be not a sin, and a wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to speake evil of <hi>the Ruler of the people?</hi> to act <hi>Shimei's</hi> part against <hi>Gods Anointed?</hi> whether to write, or publish such Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets as this, be the way to <hi>Honour the King in the eyes of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?</hi> Whether you have thus learned Christ from the <hi>Church of England?</hi> Whether you ever met in Gods word, with any say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or example to warrant you in this way of proceeding? And I require you also, as you will answer it before the Lord, to ask your own hearts, whether to Authorize such a work as this (to the Kings defamation,) be a Christian work, Honourable and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the dignity of a <hi>Parliament,</hi> whose actions ought al to be glorious and presidentiall? Nay is it an Act prudentiall in you, thus publikely to own and countenance this <hi>prolem populi,</hi> this abominable thing, which the very Parents, and Authors of, are ashamed to father? What will you say, 'tis one of the <hi>Priviledges of Parliament</hi> you fight for, to Authorize things against the King, against your own Allegeance end Protestation? surely <hi>ab initio</hi>
                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:29718:18"/>
                        <hi>non fuit sic:</hi> former Parliaments disdained to own such a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to tread in such pathes: Or will you say, you are more <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> then those your Predecessours were, who never had those <hi>brave advantages</hi> that you have? true, nor never did desire them. But can your <hi>new Omnipotency</hi> make that which is evil in it self, turn good by your Authorization? I pray where had you this large Commission? Who gave you this Authority? Christ, in whose hand is all power, never did: let your Chaplains prove it, if they can, or your Consciences affirm it, if they dare. Nor will that <hi>Writ</hi> which called you together, and fixt you in your <hi>Spheare</hi> at <hi>Westminster,</hi> tell you, that the King (the fountain of power un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God) did place you there in this sort to exercise your Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity against him: your <hi>Patent</hi> therefore, by which you have Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized this work of darknesse, must needs come <hi>ab Inferno:</hi> And can you expect that the Judge of quick and dead, will at the great day pronounce <hi>well done good and faithfull Servant</hi> unto you, for doing Satans work, for executing his Commission? O how much better will you finde then it had been, if you had wrapt up your <hi>Talents in a Napkin?</hi> and in the meane time, how much more had it been to the dignity of that <hi>High Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> (which you pretend so much to stand for) if you had but left out the name <hi>Parliament,</hi> and said, <hi>Published by speciall Order of the Rebellious faction in the two Houses at Westminster?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now I have begun to take upon me to speak unto you, (O you lofty men,) let me ask you a question more to a like purpose: What reward or commendation can you expect at Gods hand, for maintaining your Beadsman <hi>Britanicus,</hi> to libell against his Soveraigne, to teach and excite by his weekly books, the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and seduced vulgar, throughout the Kingdome, to joyn with him in reviling and laughing to scorn their publike Father, (now your selves have most unjustly thrust him into affliction:) Dare you say, his expressions are not vile? O let me beg pardon of my Soveraigne, and of all modest men, if (to the shame of these mens faces, and to the increase of indignation in all godly spirits against their courses) I doe with detestation repeate over here one of his passages, published to the world on Monday the 4. of <hi>August.</hi> 1645.</p>

                        <hi>Where is King</hi> Charles? <hi>What is become of him? Some say, when he saw the storme comming after him, as far as Bridgewater, he came away to his dearly beloved in Ireland: Yes, they say, he ran away out of the Kingdome very Majestically: Others will have him erecting a new Monarchy in the Isle of Anglesey: A third sort say, that he hath hid himselfe, it were best send Hue and Cry after him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If any man can bring any tale or tidings of a wilfull King, which hath gone astray these four yeares from his Parliament, with a guilty Conscience, bloudy hands, and a heart full of broken vowes and protestations; if these marks be not sufficient, there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his mouth, for bid him speak, and you will soon know him; then give notice to Britanicus, and you will be payd for your paines:</hi> GOD SAVE THE PARLIAMENT.</p>
                     <p>O you <hi>Men of Westminster,</hi> is this your <hi>Beadsman</hi> that prayes for you, that works for you? that is maintained and cherished by you? then these are the scornes of your hearts, the flouts of your Spirits, that are vomited up by his mouth and pen; if not, why have you not hang'd the villain, or rather torn him in pieces with wild horses? Are not you they, that call your selves, <hi>the Kings most Humble, most dutifull, and most Loyall Subjects?</hi> Are not you they that would be accounted the <hi>Holy, just, most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi> and <hi>unerring Parliament?</hi> have you not talked much <hi>of reforming our Church and Government?</hi> and will you countenance and favour such persons?

Doth your <hi>Discipline,</hi> purchased with the effusion of so much Christian bloud, allow of such expressions, and persons, without correction? Indeed this is the way to work an Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from what was before: the Devil had formerly but his <hi>Chappell,</hi> where God had his <hi>Church,</hi> but from henceforth if you prevail, he is likely to have his <hi>Church,</hi> where God shal scarce have a <hi>Chapell:</hi> Wel, as an Holy Martyr said to others, so say I to you; <hi>I thank God I am none of you:</hi> and my prayer is, <q>
                           <hi>Never let my soul (O Lord) partake in their Counsells, nor my feet tread in their paths:</hi> but give me (I beseech thee) thy grace to pray daily against their wickednesse; And let it not, O let it not

                     <p>I Now come to the Book it selfe, whose publication they have<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> Authorized: and I observe that the persons for whose sake 'tis pretended to be put forth, are some, whom the Authors call their <hi>Seduced Brethren,</hi> to <hi>reclaime them:</hi> I conceive they are so accounted, because they will not concur, in breaking their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation, and opposing their Soveraigne: I apprehend my selfe to be reckoned in the number: and therefore in the behalfe of my self and the rest, I desire these men, who are so careful to <hi>Reclaim</hi> us, that they would deal plainly with us; and tell us in downe right English, whether it be any thing else, but our Loyalty, our love, and obedience to our Soveraigne, which they would <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim</hi> us from: let them in the first place declare unto us our transgression, and prove out of Gods Word, that we are such

as they call us, and account of us: let them shew who hath <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced</hi> us: we are of the Prophet <hi>Jeremies</hi> minde; <hi>If we be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</hi>

                        <hi>it is the Lord that hath deceived us:</hi> 'tis his Word that hath taught us to Honour the King, and to adhere unto our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne; that is the foundation we stand upon, and so strong and stable it is, that we beleeve and hope these new Teachers, shall never be able either to shake it, or us from it.</p>
                     <p>Nay we have an apprehension that these men are in a <hi>Seduced</hi> condition themselves, <hi>because they are gone out from us:</hi> whereas<note place="margin">1 John 2. 16.</note> they were once of us, they took the <hi>Oath of Allegeance,</hi> and afterward the <hi>Protestation</hi> as well as we, <hi>to defend the Kings Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Honour and Estate,</hi> against all opposers: And now being them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves out of the right way, we fear they would draw us into the same danger: they tell us we are <hi>Seduced,</hi> onely that we might yeeld so to be. We remember that Satan <hi>Seduced</hi> our first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents from their duty towards God, by proceeding in the direct way and mothod of these men: he pretended pity and respect unto them as to his <hi>Seduced Brethren:</hi> and to the same purpose as these do, He standred, defamed, and reproached his Soveraigne: wherefore these men must pardon us, if but for this reason, we are somewhat suspicious of them. Beside, the Scripture tells us of some men, who <hi>call Light, Darknesse,</hi> and <hi>Darknesse Light; Good, Evill,</hi> and <hi>Evill, Good:</hi> and what know we to the contrary, but these men may be of that number? Our Saviour informes us, that in the last dayes, <hi>many wolves should come in sheeps cloathing,</hi> who<note place="margin">Mat. 24. 24.</note> (by fair pretences) <hi>should deceive many:</hi> and should carry their designes so cunningly, <hi>that (if possible) they should deceive the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Elect themselves:</hi> Now as these are the last dayes, so these men have fair pretences, are crafty in their carriages, do deceive many; and therefore may peradventure be those very wolves, forespoken of. Saint <hi>John</hi> adviseth us, not to beleeve every one, but bids us <hi>try their spirits, whether they be of God or no:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">1 John 4. 1.</note> having this warning, if we trust these men before we have tryed them, we shall shew our selves as they entitle us, <hi>Seduced</hi> indeed: they must give us leave therefore to examine of what spirit they are, who thus take upon them <hi>to reclaim us:</hi> whether their doctrine be of God or no; we will go by Christs own rule, let them except against it if they can or dare, <hi>By their fruits</hi> (saith<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 20.</note>

                     <p>It is evident, that the ends why these papers were divulged, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> their surprisal, together with that bitter Preface, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Notes upon them; was to weaken the Kings reputation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his people, to take from him the affections of those that still remaine constant and Loyal, and to stir up some already poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned to act <hi>Raviliacks</hi> part upon him; and yet these men would have us beleeve, that it would have been a <hi>sin in them</hi> (forsooth) yea, <hi>a great sin, a sin against the mercies of God,</hi> if they had concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them: Nay further, they would have us think, that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <hi>did graciously, and even miraculously put them into their hands</hi>

Indeed his private directions for his Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners at <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> do alone speake sufficiently his fatherly and <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Affection</hi> to his people: His words (as his very Enemies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord them) are these, <hi>Paper</hi> 25.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I cannot yeeld to the change of the Government by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops: not onely as I fully concur, with the most Generall opinion of Christians in all Ages (as being the best) But likewise I hold my self particularly bound by the Oath I took at my Coronation, not to alter the Government of this Church, from what I found it: And as for the Churches Patirmony; I cannot suffer any diminution, or alienation of it, being (without peradventure) Sacriledge, and likewise contrary to my Coronation Oath: But whatever shall be offered for rectifying of abuses (if any have crept in,) or for the ease of tender Consciences, (so as it endamage not the foundation) I am content to heare, and will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to give a gratious answer thereunto.</hi>

                     <p>Had any of the Kings Predecessours, but offered thus much, half thus much, to the strictest <hi>non-Conformists</hi> in former times, they would have cryed it up, for a token of the greatest affection that ever King did shew unto his people: But the men of our times, unlesse their Soveraigne will commit perjury, and break
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:29718:26"/>
his Oath to God (as they have done theirs both to God and him,) to please their Humours, unless he will commit Sacriledge (as they do;) destroy his own Conscience, and damne his own soul, to satisfie their lusts, they are resolved to raile upon him <hi>for one that beares no Affections to his people.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But in these his Instructions to the same Commissioners, we may and do observe more of his Affection yet, (to his own dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and wrong) unto his people; his words are these, (by the testimony also of his own deadly enemies.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Militia is certainly the fittest subject for a Kings quarrell, for without it, the Kingly power is but a shadow,</hi> (who can deny this?) <hi>and therefore upon no meanes to be acquitted, but maintained, according to the Ancient known lawes of the Land,</hi> (no otherwise doth the King desire to have it defended and upheld:) <hi>Yet because to attain to this so much wished peace by all good men, it is in a manner necessary,</hi> (Scil. in regard of the guilty Consciences of the Rebells,) <hi>that a sufficient, and reall security be given</hi> (even to them to take away (if possible) their suspition,) <hi>for the performance of what shall be agreed upon: I permit you either by leaving strong Towns, or other Military for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Rebells possession, (untill Articles be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,) to give such assurance for performance of conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as you shall judge necessary to conclude a firm Peace.

                     </p>
                     <p>Now behold and wonder, (O all ye Nations of the word,) and judge (I beseech you) betwixt this King and his Accusers: Could any <hi>Christian</hi> deny himself more? Did ever <hi>Prince</hi> deny himselfe so much? Can the desires of any man be more equal and just then these are? Doe you perceive in these his secret instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that he covets any more power, or Prerogative then is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed or approved by the Ancient and <hi>known Lawes</hi> of the

Land? Can any innocent disposition upon the earth, possibly give more satisfaction to a perverse, froward and guilty Enemy, then is here offered to these men, by a most Gracious, and Honest King; onely to procure life and tranquility to his poore people, who are most mercilesly butchered, and abused by their fellow-subjects? I am confident you will all yeeld, that these expressions of the King, in these his <hi>private letters,</hi> do discover sufficient <hi>affections to his people:</hi> and doubtlesse you will judge too, that those who are not of the same opinion, are onely they who desire to denude him of that Kingly right, and dignity, which God alone hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested him withall; Yea, and of his life it self i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> possibly they can, <hi>Sed providebit Deus:</hi> God we trust will still protect him.</p>
                     <p>And then further yet, in his directions to his said Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners concerning <hi>Ireland:</hi> the King infers, that he is willing to consent to any thing, that shall be desired or devised, <hi>may but a cleare way be shewed him, how his poore Protestant Subjects there, may probably (at least) defend themselves, and that himselfe shall have no more need to defend his Conscience, and Crown, from the injuries of this English Rebellion.</hi> I do not doubt but all men of Religion and Reason, will acknowledge in the Kings behalf, that these be ample Testimonies of his true <hi>Affections;</hi> and yet these men speak, as if the King wanted <hi>affections to his people.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I confesse there be a Company got above-board in these times, who call themselves <hi>His people,</hi> and <hi>Gods people,</hi> yea his onely good Subjects, and Gods onely good Children; but in very deed their works speak them neither to belong to God, nor Him: <hi>Loammi</hi> may their name &amp; title properly be. The King may happily shew his dislike of them, and their wayes, but this speaks no disaffection in him to his own people, any more then our Saviours dislike of the <hi>Pharises,</hi> &amp; their conditions did speak disaffection to his disciples; those onely are the <hi>Kings people,</hi> that yeeld him their obedience.</p>
                     <p>But they tell us also, that in his <hi>Letters,</hi> we shall see <hi>what Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage</hi>

                        <hi>and Titles the King bestowes upon his great Councell:</hi> they meane the prevailing faction at <hi>Westminster,</hi> whom they cal <hi>Great,</hi> because they are so strong at this present, and so powerfull, for <hi>Rabsakeh</hi> upon this ground called his master the <hi>Great King,</hi> and<note place="margin">2 King. 18. 28.</note>

all his neighbours: 'tis the nature of some to affect <hi>greatnesse,</hi> and to manifest the same, whereas Gods delights are to shew his <hi>goodnesse</hi> rather: Had that <hi>Great Councell,</hi> (which they speak of) been of Gods minde, and endeavoured in Gods way, to have proved themselves the Kings <hi>good Councell,</hi> there would have been no exceptions about Language or Titles.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Great</hi> we yeeld them, and wish with our soules, they were as <hi>good:</hi> But we conceive not, how that <hi>Great Councell,</hi> can be the <hi>Kings great Councell,</hi> (as these call it) unlesse onely in that sence, as those Husbandmen in the Gospel were their Lords servants,<note place="margin">Mat. 21. 38.</note> when having already killed, and beaten many of their fellows, they had entred into a Consultation to murder the Heire himself; and to seize on his inheritance for themselves: when their Lord did first commit his vineyard to their care to dresse, and keep, while they laboured for his benefit and advantage, he might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them for his servants: but when once they failed in their trust, sought their own ends only, and his damage, there was no reason, he should esteem of them any longer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lucifer</hi> and his Companions were at their first Creation, <hi>Sons of the Morning,</hi> all bright Angels, glorious Creatures, beloved of God; but when they entertained aspiring thoughts, disdained their equalls, separated from them, and thought much that He who made them, should be above them; they fall from their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and no longer abode in their Primitive Condition; so when mutable men, alter from what they were, they leave their former Names and Titles.</p>
                     <p>We (for our parts) cannot conceive, how the meere place, or bare walls in a Councell Chamber, can make or continue men to be of the <hi>Kings Councell;</hi> nor can we be perswaded, that the outward taking of an Oath or Protestation, to <hi>defend the Kings life, Honour, and Estate,</hi> without a faithfull discharge thereof, and fulfilling the trust imposed, doth speak men to be the Kings <hi>good Councellours.</hi> Good Councellours (as we apprehend) are such as study sincerely, and are most specially carefull to maintain their Prince his Crown and Dignity, to prefer his <hi>Honour</hi> fair and splendent, (as being the very life of His Majesty:) when there is any miscarriage in Government, they will rather take the fault upon themselves then suffer it in the least degree to have
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:29718:28"/>
reflection upon their Soveraigne; they will (though to their own losse) endeavour to acquit him of all blame, and to uphold his reputation in the hearts of his people: did ever any Honest <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litician</hi> propound such rules to be observed by a Kings <hi>Great Councell,</hi> or ever any <hi>States-men</hi> or <hi>Councellours,</hi> who were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian and Religious, order their practice according to such Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts as these that follow?</p>
                     <p>1. Promise at your first meeting to make your King, <hi>the most Glorious prince in Christendome,</hi> and take a Protestation to <hi>defend his life, Honour, and Estate,</hi> that so he may give the more credence to you, and the Common people may have the better opinion of your Love and Loyaltie; and so be more apt to do any thing that you will have them.</p>
                     <p>2. When you have done this, labour by all meanes to make a <hi>strong faction</hi> amongst your selves against the King: and if any of your fellows be so scrupulous in Conscience, that they will not joyn with you, be sure that by all-meanes, you force them from the Councel-house: and if you cannot otherwise effect it, set the Common people to threaten and assault them, as Enemies to the State and Kingdome.</p>
                     <p>3.

                     <p>4. Seize upon all the Kings <hi>Rents,</hi> and <hi>Revenews,</hi> and starve Him if you can; suffer Him not to have the common comforts of an ordinary man, to enjoy the Society of the wife of His bosome, or any house of His own to Lodge in: if he be a Christian, put Him into his Lords Condition; that he may say, <hi>the foxes have holes, and the birds of the Aire have nests, but I have not where to hide my Head.</hi>

                     <p>6. Study to <hi>Vex</hi> and <hi>Grieve</hi> his Spirit upon all occasions, by all meanes; pervert and misconstrue on purpose, all His sayings, letters, and doings, and yeeld not to His desires in any thing, be it

                     <p>7. Authorize all base <hi>Libells,</hi> all scandalous and lying Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets that any one hath a minde to publish against Him; though they be such as not onely the Authours themselves, but the very Devill himself would blush to own.</p>

                     <p>9.

In a word, if <hi>Absalom,</hi> and <hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophel;</hi> if <hi>Sheba</hi> the son of <hi>Bichri;</hi> if <hi>Korah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> were <hi>Rebells</hi> in their Generations, then so are these in this; for these have done over all the same things, which every of them did do, though with greater impudence and violence: Nay if <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> himself in his seduction of our first Parents, did act the <hi>Rebell</hi> against the Almighty, then also have these against their Soveraign; for they have directly proceeded in his method and way; as might be shewed in all the particulars: But these Examples are all so Evident in Scripture to peoples eyes, that I shall leave the matter wholly to their own observance, and listen to what these men say further; having told us of <hi>Language</hi> and <hi>Titles</hi> which the King bestowes upon his <hi>Great Councell,</hi> they adde,</p>

                        <hi>from a Prince Seduced out of his proper spheare.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What the King <hi>bestowes</hi> we have heard already; what they <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi>
                        <note place="margin">§. 4.</note> we shall see anon: only in the first place we cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve their <hi>Sorrowfull Consideration,</hi> because 'tis a phrase in great fashion, even with them also whom they call his <hi>Great Councell;</hi> who have many a time and oft, told the King in their letters to him, of their own <hi>great griefs and sorrowes:</hi> But let their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences speak, what is the true ground of their sorrow, is it not this? Because they that are able to doe so much to the Kings da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, to raise so many Armies against him of his own people, to corrupt so many of his Officers and Commanders, for to betray the places committed to their trust, should not yet by all their injurious and contumelious dealings, (which have been more then was ever offered to a Christian Prince by Protestant people.) be able to break his heart, and sink him to his grave; still they see he is strengthened by the help of God to beare his burden: and they have heard (haply) of that his pious expression, viz. <hi>Though God hath pleased to lay on me a greater Burden of Affliction, then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other Princes my Predecessours: yet withall he hath in his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, inlarged unto me an answerable measure of patience.</hi> Let their own Consciences speak whether (in very deed) their grief doth not spring from this Consideration: For if they should not Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to vex him to death, or some way or other to bring him to his grave, all their labour would be in vain, and to little purpose;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:29718:30"/>
and how can they consider of this, <hi>without great grief, and sorrow of heart?</hi> But these good men (our <hi>subtile Brethren</hi>) doe here pretend that their sorrow is, because their <hi>Prince is Seduced out of his proper spheare:</hi> yet verily we on the other side do consider of this with more true Sorrow (I dare say) then they do: for we confess never was Prince so far <hi>seduced out of his proper sphear,</hi> as he was; when He took them who now call themselves his <hi>great Counsell,</hi> to be Honest men: when He gave so much credit to their promises and protestations, as to be perswaded by them, to signe the Bill for the Continuation of that unhappy Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: then, O then be was <hi>seduced</hi> indeed, <hi>from his proper spheare,</hi> wherein his Father set and left him with this caution, <hi>Alwaies to be suspicious of the Puritanicall faction, and never to</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Basilic. Doron. Lib. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>trust them above all people in the world, as being for ingratitude, lyes, and perjuries, surpassing the High-land theeves and Borderers.</hi> His Seduction from this Paternal advise, was the root and cause of all our Miseries, and therefore with sorrow of heart, we his Loyall Subjects cannot but thinke upon it.</p>
                     <p>But to do these men right: they mention their sorrow here, for the Kings Seduction, to another purpose, namely as a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> to that which follows. <hi>M. Dike</hi> in his book <hi>of the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of mans heart,</hi> sets down, not for imitation, (as these take it) but for discovery, the method of a cunning Hypocrite in his venting a slander: <hi>First</hi> (saies he) <hi>to gain Credit with the hearers, he pretends great affection to the party against whom he is minded to speak, professing that with great grief and sorrow of heart, he doth think of him, (hoping yet that he is onely missed and seduced,) and so makes a long Preamble to this purpose, as if the fault he intends to mention, were as grievous to him, as a blow with a Cudgell; and then at last, out comes the slander, which his viperous tongue layes on with as much spight as malice is able,</hi> these (I remember) are M. <hi>Dikes</hi> words.</p>
                     <p>Now after this very manner, and in the same Method, do these our <hi>subtile Brethren</hi> speake to us concerning their Soveraigne, whom they are about to slander and defame: First they tell us in some obscure and generall terms, <hi>of strange Titles, which the King bestowes upon his great Councell, which</hi> (say they) <hi>we return not again; but consider with sorrow that it comes from a Prince,</hi> (not
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:29718:30"/>
so Naturally inclined, as we hope, for we would fain think better of him, but) <hi>Seduced from his proper spheare, misled by ill Councell:</hi> And so much for the Preface. Now to the main businesse, and let all Christian people observe it well, how these good Sorrowfull men, that promised even now, to give no opprobrious Language, will describe their Soveraigne. He is, say they,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>One that hath left that seat in which he ought, and hath bound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Libell.</note> 
                        <hi>to fit, to sit (as the</hi> Psalmist <hi>saies) in the Chaire of the scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and to the ruine almost of three Kingdomes, hath walked in the Councells of the ungodly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now 'tis out: and it conteines in our apprehensions these 6 Articles against the King.</p>
                     <p>1. That the King hath not only neglected to perform his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but voluntarily, and upon no occasion moving, hath <hi>left</hi> and <hi>forsaken</hi> his proper place and duty.</p>
                     <p>2. That in the roome thereof, he hath made choice of the <hi>Scorners Chaire,</hi> which is the highest seat or throne of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                     <p>3. That he hath even <hi>bound</hi> himself Prentice, as it were by oath and Covenant, to that trade of scorning.</p>
                     <p>4. That he hath resolved to follow that profession so long as he lives; for he hath <hi>bound</hi> himself <hi>to sit,</hi> yea, <hi>to sit,</hi> scil. for ever, <hi>in the Chaire of the scornfull.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. That his aymes and endeavours only are, and have been to ruine <hi>three whole Kingdomes,</hi> which even <hi>almost</hi> he had effected.</p>
                     <p>6. That to this very end, and for no other reason (as must be supposed) he hath abandoned the Society of most Holy and good men, and linked himself by a indissolvable tye, to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of the wicked, whose <hi>ungodly counsell</hi> he alwaies <hi>walketh</hi> in.</p>
                     <p>These are the particulars in this their first charge against the King: but my purpose being to uncase these Hypocritical and blasphemous men, I shall first lay open to the world, the full meaning of their hearts, in a true Paraphrase upon their words; and then I shall shew how false and scandalous they be in every respect against his Majesty, unto whom they naturally owe, and solemnely have sworne obedience. But first let me beg pardon of my Lord and Soveraigne, and crave of all Loyall hearts that it be not imputed for an <hi>indecorum</hi> or want of Reverence in me
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:29718:31"/>
to Kingly Honour, if some of my words concerning His Sacred person, do sound unseemly, and unbecomming; Let it be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that I speak not my self, but other men, whose Hellish in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions toward their Prince, are so black, that 'tis impossible to expresse them in a language meetly Reverend: He that openeth rotten sepulchers may (though unwillingly) be offensive.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I desire of all men, that I may not be thought by my manner of speaking, to intend the working of any contempt in peoples hearts against the High Court of <hi>Parliament,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called in the Kings name, by his Writ, and acting under the obedience of just and regall power, are with all Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to be thought upon, and spoken of: Yea, and God knowes my heart abhors to be an instrument of working dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esteem against any persons of this present <hi>Assembly,</hi> who have pious and loyall affections in them, (as I beleeve there be divers, even in this very Body, that do truly detest the present pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of some of their fellow-members.) I do here profess to all the world, though I use the name of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and <hi>Great Councell,</hi> in answer to these Libellers, yet I meane one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the present swaying and prevailing faction in the two Houses, who are and have been the Countenancers of all these abuses against their Soveraigne, and the causers of all our sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes: and who they in particular are, I doubt not but in due time, God the Supreame Judge, will Evidence to this whole Kingdome. This with all Humility premised and implored, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed as followeth.</p>

people, by these His most dutifull and loving Subjects, (who take upon them to be His Accusers) according to their own full and clear meaning may be rendred more at large, thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>That the King, (or rather he who was once in that office) hath voluntarily, and freely, without being urged by any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in the world, forsaken his place, wherein he ought to have remained, and which to His great content, He might still have enjoyed, (had he so pleased) being not only obliged thereunto by His Duty; but also importuned by the most Humble suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and prostrate intreaties of His Great Councel: But He meerly out of his own ill disposition, is departed thence, and hath taken up, not onely a standing, but a <hi>Seat,</hi> yea, hath <hi>bound Himselfe</hi> by obligation, entred into a covenant with Hell, <hi>to sit, to sit</hi> (we say) <hi>as the Psalmist speake,</hi> (for we would have all the Common people know, that we have Scripture for what we say) <hi>in the Seat of the Scornfull:</hi> that is, (as our Prophets interpret) to remain for ever in the Highest Throne and degree of wickednesse, that man or Devill can reach unto: whereby it appeares that (<hi>Ahab</hi>-like) he hath <hi>sold himselfe</hi> to work all evill, even with greedinesse; and is past all hope of recovery: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he hath intentionally and on set purpose, been already the ruine almost of three whole Kingdomes, and had been so alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ere this, had not His <hi>Great Councell,</hi> (a company of most Holy, Chast, Innocent, Wise and infallible good men) sitting now at <hi>Westminster,</hi> in their great pitty, and commiseration of spirit, and out of their abounding piety, and meere natural goodnesse interposed themselves, whereby (thanks only to them) the three Kingdomes are yet kept in being; which (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they put to their helping hands) were at the very brim of destruction. And yet notwithstanding, this wilful King hath left their most Sacred, sweet, and peaceable society, out of a pure hatred to them, and to their v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rtues: and hath not onely stepped unawares, but hath even <hi>eat and drunk with Publicans and Sinners:</hi> yea, and walked deliberately in the Councels of the wicked, and ungodly: Insomuch that it is to be thought, the total ruine of the three Kingdomes, will shortly be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, do what the Great Councel can to the contray, unless some Noble <hi>Brutus,</hi> some Valiant <hi>Cassius,</hi> out of love to their

Countries Liberty, will take the paines to stab this <hi>Cesar:</hi> some devout <hi>Raviliack</hi> in his zeal unto Religion, wil do God the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, (or the kindnesse rather) to free the world, and Church of this destructive Tyrant, <hi>for 'tis better</hi> (as Scripture saies) <hi>that one man should die, then that all the People perish;</hi> then that three whole Kingdomes should be destroyed.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>We refer the matter to their own Consciences, whether this be not the true sense of their spirits, and whether they would not have the people thus to understand their words, against the King: And to prevent scruples, which may arise in the hearts of any about the Businesse, which they would have done, they adde to the former the words following, saying,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And though in our Tenents we annex no infallibility to the seat of</hi>

                        <hi>a King in Parliament, (as the Romanists do to the Papall Chaire, since all men are subject to Errour,) yet we dare boldly say, that no English King did ever from that place, speak destruction to His peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but safety and Honour, nor any that abhorred that seat and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, but did the contrary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These words (I say) are added to their foregoing description of the King, not only to further the Businesse aymed at; but also in way of prevention: for some might make a scruple of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, (as <hi>David</hi> did) to kill the King, notwithstanding these suggestions, because He is the Lords Anointed: Wherefore these circumspect m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n, being <hi>ad omnia parati,</hi> do signifie further in these words, that no man need be precise in that respect, for say they, in effect thus,</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>We <hi>in our Tenents</hi> (which are all the truth, and the very truth, and the truth indeed, and so to be apprehended by all men living) doe make no more of a King, then we do of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, the <hi>seat of a King in Parliament</hi> it self, is no more then the <hi>seat</hi> of <hi>Cesar</hi> in the Senate-house, it may as well be empty as not, were there but no King at all, (for 'tis not so much his Presence there, which we desire and quarrell about, as his Nullity, that He might be no where:) we hold there is no more virtue <hi>in the Seat of a King</hi> in Parliament, then in the seat of an ordinary Burgesle, (no nor half so much neither:) we neither do nor wil in our <hi>Tenents annex infallibility</hi> to the Kings <hi>Seat;</hi> for should we make a Pope of the King? No, no: He is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:29718:32"/>
but a man, subject to Errours, as others be, and therefore liable to be punished for his faults, as well as others: specially since the Soveraignty is transmitted into the hands of the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which was done (as the Parliaments own self judgeth) when the Bil of perpetu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is granted indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time, the Supream power was in Him, and we were all his Subjects: and then perhaps some might Scruple to out his throat, for there were lawes then in force against Regicides, but now since his Resignation, (for so in our <hi>Tenents</hi> we hold this Act to be,) there is no scruple to be made, those lawes against King-killers are suspended, and he is now become as <hi>Samson</hi> was without his strength, even like another man, any of the wel affected <hi>Philistines</hi> may fall upon him, mock him, kil him, or use him as they please; if their new Lords (that is to say) the worthy members of the Parliament do but give leave<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for he is now but their subject, their slave; they are able (by the <hi>infallibility</hi> of their Votes) to make him a malefactor, and then to order him, (if they can catch him) as such a one; for <hi>infallibly</hi> we grant is an Attendant on the Supreame power; we do not indeed <hi>annex</hi> it to the <hi>Kings seat,</hi> because the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame power is now removed from thence; while this was in the King, the Parliament it self (as appeares in some of their Expresses,) did use to speak as the Law did, modestly of the King, and to say <hi>he could not erre;</hi> but now, the case is altered with him, the Supreame power being transferred unto other persons, <hi>infallibility</hi> stil attends the same, and not the Kings per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: And hence it was, that after the aforesaid Act, there was a large <hi>Remonstrance</hi> made, which the Authours of, durst never make before, whilst the power was in the Kings hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (it may be called the Parliaments <hi>Act of Gratitude,</hi> for the Kings <hi>Act</hi> fore-named) in which they declare sufficiently, their judgement to be, that the King may now be imputed fallible, and unfit to manage the Supreame power from thenceforth any longer: And hence also it is, that a new <hi>Oath of Allegeance and Obedience to the Parliament</hi> is tendred to the People of this Land, which plainly shewes, that the Supreame power is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to dwel in them; and that the old Oath is quite void and out of date together with the King. And for the <hi>Protestation</hi>
                           <pb n="38" facs="tcp:29718:33"/>
                           <hi>generall,</hi> (which was took at the beginning of the Parliament to <hi>defend the Kings life and Honour</hi>) that is to be understood only so long as the Kingly and Supreame power remained in him, but that being once removed, the <hi>Pretestation</hi> bindes us no longer to regard His <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Honour;</hi> but the Persons and Honours of them only, in whom the said Supremacy is now seated: And therefore all the world knows, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or <hi>great Councell,</hi> never raised War against the King, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver suffered any to take away His Name &amp; Honour, or to seize upon His revenews, so long as the Supream power was in Him; for that had been rank Rebellion in them indeed; but now since themselves were invested in the same; they set to their businesse, (as lawfully they may) to establish the Kingdom upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their successours: First by putting forth their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance</hi> against the King, to loosen all the bands of ancient Loyalty, and then by seizing upon the <hi>Militia</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the Forts, Castles, Ships and Townes, as their proper Rights, and all the Kings Goods and Houses, as being now (in regard of their Supremacy) solely at their disposing; and then too, after all this, they thought fit in wisdome, to Vote the King to be one that <hi>intends the ruine of three Kingdomes,</hi> that <hi>abhors His Great Councell,</hi> which speakes nothing but Safety and Honour to Him. Yea, (and in very deed) He doth Envy those worthies, that Honour, strength, rule and dignity, which now by Gods Providence, is so happily cast upon them; even as <hi>Richard</hi> the Third did grutch at those two innocent Princes, whose by right the Kingdome was, and thereupon did murder them, to get the Scepter into His own Hands, and the Crown upon His own Head: So this man aymes at the destruction of the most <hi>blessed Parliament,</hi> whose the Kingdome now by right is, and in whose Hand all Power and Authority is lodged and fastned, and there like to remain, so long as a drop of bloud is left in the veines of English-men, who shall fight for them to maintain it: therefore let all men remember <hi>Richard</hi> the Third what peace the Land had after long Wars, when he was once killed, and let them expect the same now, if this Man (who is worse then He) could be taken away. And no man need scruple to do it, for the Supreame Authority now above-board doth
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:29718:33"/>
allow it; and that is able to make sin no sin, when it listeth; that hath declared him to <hi>speake destruction</hi> to the Kingdomes, to <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre the Parliament,</hi> and never any English King did so, but he spake <hi>Destruction</hi> to himself thereby; therefore let him have it; we dare boldly say and assure, that <hi>safety</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> is not his portion, but destruction from the Lord is appointed to him, the Parliament so judgeth, and blessed shall he be, that shal divide it out unto him. And thus all scruples of Consciences are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have been the larger in opening the meanings of these men, that I might withall express the ground of their uncouth opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and let no good people, who have a Charitable conceit of them, think that I stretch their words beyond their intentions, I would not force any mans faith beyond his judgement, much lesse against the same: wherefore let these few following particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars be considered upon, and I beleeve it will be evident, to every reasonable man, that I have spoken nothing, but the reall desires of their hearts and spirits.</p>
                     <p>1. Consider the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Crimes</hi> which most maliciously and falsly they lay to the Kings Charge; that He hath <hi>neglected</hi> His office, <hi>Forsaken</hi> His place, that He <hi>Abhorreth</hi> the Parliament, <hi>Walks onely in the Councell of the ungodly,</hi> that he seeks the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction</hi> of three Kingdomes, and is ascended to the highest pitch and throne of wickedness, <hi>The seat of the scornfull,</hi> and there hath <hi>Bound himselfe to sit</hi> and continue; what is all this in effect, but <hi>Away with him from the Earth, 'tis not fitting he should live?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Consider of some of their <hi>Tenents,</hi> which to this purpose they have been a buzzing a long while, and whispering into the mindes of people, viz. <hi>That the King is but onely for the peoples good,</hi> He <hi>is but their Bayliff, their Servant,</hi> and <hi>that the Parliament without him is above him, may wage war against him, may depose him, and turn him out of his Office,</hi> if he be not for their turn; that <hi>they can give Commission to any to apprehend, yea, to kill him,</hi> if He doth oppose them; that <hi>evill may be done to further the Publik good,</hi> and in respect of the end aymed at it is not to be accounted evill; and many such like <hi>Tenents</hi> they have, which let any man consider of, together with their accusations of him, as also what they have done against him, and then say, whether all this doth
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:29718:34"/>
not signifie, that they would gladly be rid of him, if any would take upon them but to kill him.</p>
                     <p>3. Consider what high <hi>Holinesse, Wisdome, Justice,</hi> care of the Kingdome is affirmed abroad, and taught to be in them, who take upon them the name of the <hi>great Councell,</hi> or <hi>Parliament at Westminster:</hi> How <hi>infallible</hi> they are preached to be in their judgements, how <hi>unerring</hi> in their Votes and Censures, when in Consultation together; though perhaps, (as particular men) they may chance to Erre sometimes, for 'tis confessed, <hi>all men are subject to Errour;</hi> yet when they are <hi>in Cathedris,</hi> in their seats as Parliament men, they are all as <hi>infallible</hi> as the Pope; and have a power as well as he, to do what they please, to make Evil, Good; and Good Evil: to make Rebellion and Treason, to be Duty and Loyalty; and Duty and Loyalty, to be Rebellion and Treason; to Vote Sacriledge, Murder, and Theft to be no sins; <hi>Killing, Slaying,</hi> and <hi>Destroying</hi> to be acts of zeale and Christian Duty; Yea, what ever they shall authorize with approbation, (as they have done this Libel) must be received without scruple and haesitation, as pious and godly, though as full of Blasphemy as this same is: Nay, what man living will not conceive, but they who have Authorized this book against the King, will also war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant any man to kill him: to prevent his Capacity of punishing them hereafter for it? and whosoever beleeves it was no sin in them, to Authorize the one, will not think it a sin in them to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the other.</p>
                     <p>4. Consider how since that <hi>Act of Continuation</hi> of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament they have plainly <hi>denyed</hi> the Supreame power to be in the King, and affirme the same to be in themselves; how they have <hi>suppressed</hi> the ancient <hi>Oath of Allegeance and Supremacy,</hi> and disclaimed them both, and have in the place of them framed a <hi>new Oath</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> which they have put upon the Subjects of this Kingdome; to sweare adherence and allegiance to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: how they have made a <hi>New great Seal,</hi> (as if the old one with the King were of no longer use:) How they have seized upon all the <hi>Royalties of the Crown,</hi> and upon all the Kings <hi>Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Estate,</hi> to be disposed of as their own; How they have exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted all <hi>Regall Prerogatives;</hi> How they call all those that do adhere to the King, <hi>Rebells</hi> and <hi>Traitours,</hi> and pursue them as
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:29718:34"/>
such, with fire and sword? How they <hi>Hunt the King</hi> up and down the Kingdome, (as if he were become an <hi>out-law,</hi>) seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to murder and destroy him? How they (now of late) do all in the name of the Parliament <hi>Onely,</hi> though at first til the people were fully seduced by them, and ingaged with them, they did use the Kings Name together with it; doth not at all this speak plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they thirst to drink the Kings bloud, and desire to have it shed or spilt?</p>
                     <p>5. Consider how in their <hi>Notes,</hi> (in this their accursed Libel <hi>pag.</hi> 44.) they tax the King as faulty, for his Soliciting the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and other <hi>Protestant Princes,</hi> (as they speak) to assist for the supporting of <hi>Monarchy;</hi> doth not this plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that they have concluded against the Government here in England, and so by Consequence against the <hi>Monarch</hi> himself? Doth it not evidently declare, that they account him King no longer? and that all the Supremacy is now in themselves? Which being supposed, and withal, that he (according to their Votes,) <hi>seekes the ruine of his people,</hi> whose safety above all things must be regarded: It follows of necessity, that they desire the Kings <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,</hi> and would have it apprehended, that they do but their duty to the Kingdome in desiring it.</p>
                     <p>6. Consider how they do, (as in their Pamphlets and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons) compare the King to <hi>Saul, Ahab, Nero,</hi> and the like; so in their malicious Notes upon his Letters here (<hi>pag.</hi> 48.) they compare him to <hi>Richard</hi> the third, (the most bloudy and unjust man that ever swayed the English Scepter,) which plainly speaks, that they would have people take him to be such a one, and to have no more true right to the Crown, then that <hi>Richard</hi> had; and that themselves would be as glad of his death, as <hi>Hen.</hi> the 7. was of the death of that Tyrant.</p>
                     <p>If these particulars (amongst many others that might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded) be considered on; I doubt not but all reasonable men wil yeeld, that I have done the Authours of this <hi>Libell</hi> right, in my interpretation of their intentions expressed in those their words against the King.</p>
                     <p>But that I might not leave the least scruple in the hearts of any wel-meaning people, that yet remain drunk with a good opinion of their Honesties; and do in Charity think it impossible, that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:29718:35"/>
men pretending so fair, and having so great a name in the world for Religion, should be so Diabolical, and have such Hellish de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes: I wil further yet indeavour their satisfaction, (for I doe publikely profess, mine aymes are, to do the work of Christ, in laying open mens Hypocrisie,) that mine abused Country-men, for whom Christ died, might not longer be deceived: which work, (by Gods grace) I shal faithfully pursue, though I meet in the end, with Christs reward, at their bloudy hands, for my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Wherefore,</p>
                     <p>I wil shew, First, that there is no impossibility at all in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, notwithstanding their specious pretences which they make: and then it wil further Evidence the verity of what I have said, from their own Tenents.</p>
                     <p>My Argument for the first is this: Whatever hath been already, may possibly be again: (for, (sayes Solomon) <hi>The thing which</hi>

                        <hi>hath been, is that which shall be, and that which is done, is that which shall be done:</hi>) But such men there have been, who <hi>had a name to</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>be alive, when they were dead,</hi> in trespasses and sins; <hi>who said they were Jewes,</hi> (called themselves Gods people,) and were so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted by others; <hi>when</hi> (in very deed) <hi>they were of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rev. 2. 9. 3. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>of Satan:</hi> therefore 'tis not impossible, but such men may be also in these dayes, which are the <hi>last dayes,</hi> and therefore the worst, the very dregs of time.</p>
                     <p>For proof of the <hi>Assumption,</hi> let us remember the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> in the Gospel, they had as great a name in the world then, as these persecutors of the King have now, and were as wel thought on by the vulgar, in whose opinions, they were farre enough from those villanies, which notwithstanding Christ did sufficiently discover to be in them; Nay, the people (though themselves were imployed as under-instruments in the very busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness) were so bewitched with a good conceit of their Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical rulers, (whom they counted the <hi>Worthies of their Nation,</hi>) that they would not at first beleeve, that they had any purpose to kill Christ; for when he said, <hi>why goe ye about to kill me?</hi> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple replied, <hi>Thou hast a Devill, Who goeth about to kill thee?</hi> they<note place="margin">John 7. 20.</note> (good folkes) conceived that their Holy and wise Rulers, did onely provide for the safety of Church and Common-wealth, and endeavoured Christs <hi>Reformation,</hi> whom they apprehended to be
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:29718:35"/>
an irregular man, one that would not submit His Judgement to the <hi>Great Councell</hi> at Jerusalem; nor be ruled by their <hi>Votes</hi> and <hi>Orders.</hi> Nay the very <hi>Pharisees</hi> themselves, (like these our men) would not owne their own malice against Christ; for when <hi>Pilate</hi> would have delivered him into their hands, to have done with him as they pleased. <q>O no, cry they, <hi>'tis not lawfull for us to put any man to death:</hi> (they had rather some body else should doe it for them;) we are too holy to defile our selves with His bloud; out of pure love to piety, and to the peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, we have proceeded thus far against Him, and have been at great Charges with the Souldiers to apprehend Him: and though you can finde no fault in Him, yet you may be sure on it, <hi>if he had not been a Malefactor, we would not have brought him before you:</hi> No, no, if we could otherwise have reformed Him, we would not have troubled your Lordship with Him. But will you please to heare His Conditions: Why? He would be a <hi>King,</hi> and Rule over us, and if He be let alone, He wil ruine the whole Kingdome, and bring destruction upon the <hi>Temple</hi> too, and to spoyl our Religion: He bestowes <hi>strange Language and Titles</hi> upon us the <hi>Great Councell,</hi> the <hi>Worthies</hi> of the Nation, (who are a company of Holy and unblameable men, witnesse all the people) He calls us <hi>Hypocrites, Vipers, and Painted Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchers,</hi> and the like, <hi>which we return not again, but consider with sorrow, that these expressions come from a Jew Seduced out of his proper spheare:</hi> One that hath <hi>left the Society</hi> He ought to be withall, and keeps Company onely <hi>with publicans and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> ungodly persons, whose counsells he followes, and hath set himself in <hi>the seat of the scornfull:</hi> For we take all his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons against our Ordinances, and doings to be but onely inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives and scornes against us, whereby He exposeth us to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned of the people, as if (according to His saying) <hi>we made the Law of God of none Effect by our Traditions.</hi> When indeed none can be more zealous for it, then we are; and thus you see what a Person He is, and what His Merits are. Beleeve it (Sir) unlesse some speedy course be taken with Him, <hi>Caesar</hi> (in whom the Supreame power is now seated, and whose servants the people now are) will be wronged; and the whole Church; and Kingdome wasted and destroyed, and this we will boldly
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:29718:36"/>
say: who ever doth not joyn with us against bim, is neither a friend to <hi>Caesar,</hi> nor to the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> we are all for the Publick good, and to preserve that, we desire that this our King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or rather this man that says he is our King, may be crucified.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this purpose was the <hi>Pharisees</hi> accusation against our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: of this disposition were their Spirits against the Son of God: (as Scripture teacheth) notwithstanding their Religious pretences, and that opinion of holinesse which the world had of them: it need not therefore be thought an impossible thing, that there should be men of a like spirit, and of a like esteem in these days; and that they should endeavour a like mischief against their Soveraigne. Nothing but the <hi>Heart bloud</hi> of Christ, would satisfie those his Enemies; and can it be any thing but the very heart bloud of the King which these men thirst after? indeed they do not lay any worse things to the Kings charge, (for I will do them no wrong) then those others did to the charge of Christ: And this for the first: <hi>There is no impossibility in the matter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. The truth of my interpretation of their meaning, is Evident from the Tenents which they mention as proper to themselves, at least as differing from ours: <hi>Wee</hi> (say they) <hi>in our Tenents do annex no Infallibility to the seat of a King in Parliament, as the Romanists doe to the Papall Chaire, since all men are subject to errours.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These men desire, (as we learned by their Pulpit Doctrines of<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> us,) that people should beleeve, that those who are for the King, do think of him as the <hi>Romanists</hi> do of the Pope, <hi>that he cannot Erre,</hi> which opinion by these their words they would have the world know, that they disclaim, and truly so do we as much as they; for we never did, nor yet ever dare we, give the King so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due an Attribute; nor would His Majesty suffer the same, were any of us so sinfully disposed: For we boldly affirm, that never King was more Christian then He, in yeelding himselfe culpable, (even in some matters wherein others could see no errour,) that so if possible he might give his Enemies satisfaction, and purchase peace unto his people. But whether it be so or no, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and report <hi>that</hi> to be our <hi>Tenent:</hi> and we on the other side apprehended theirs to be, that <hi>infallibility is rather in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:29718:36"/>
                        <hi>without a King, then in the Seat of a King in Parliament.</hi> And our Reason is, there hath been more Infallibility professed in <hi>Parliament,</hi> since the Kings absence from <hi>Westminster;</hi> then ever was before, when either himself, or any of His Predecessours have been there. And though the <hi>Parliament</hi> hath been erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and faulty herefore, by reason of the Kings <hi>faction</hi> mixt therein, (for by that name are modest and Loyal Gentlemen now called) yet that being now purged away, and driven from thence, <hi>Errour</hi> also is vanished with it, and <hi>Infallibility</hi> hath taken up its dwelling there, <hi>ita praedicant, ita clamitant.</hi> And yet by the way, we must tell the world, we beleeve the King hath some friends still within the wals at <hi>Westminster,</hi> even as Christ had at the Jews Councell Table, although (like <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> and <hi>Joseph of Arima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi>) they are over-powred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and reviled, when they speak truth and Conscience.</p>
                     <p>But to the matter: We must tell these men, that Scripture af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords <hi>us</hi> better Testimony for the Kings not Erring, then it doth <hi>them</hi> for theirs; <hi>Solomon</hi> saies, <hi>The Kings Heart is in Gods Hand,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 22. 1.</note> and <hi>a Divine sentence is in His Lips; His mouth transgresseth not in</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 16. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>judgment.</hi> We finde not the like expressions in behalf of an <hi>head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Parliament:</hi> but because <hi>Solomon</hi> was a King himselfe, <hi>He spake</hi> (they say) <hi>in his own case, and therefore not much to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:</hi> but we will not contest with them at this time about his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, we rather yeeld (because <hi>all men are subject to Errour) that a King may Erre:</hi> and we adde further that a <hi>Parliament,</hi> consisting of men, <hi>may erre</hi> too; and this Combination of Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators, (which to the high disgrace of the Supreamest Court, some call the <hi>Parliament</hi>) doth <hi>Erre</hi> most abominably, both from Gods Law, and the Law of the Land: and this in very deed is our <hi>Tenent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And let them deal ingenuously with us, &amp; say, whether <hi>they</hi> do not so <hi>hold of the Parliament,</hi> (though not of the King) as the <hi>Romanists doe of the Pope?</hi> whether by their <hi>Tenents,</hi> the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath not the same power over Kings, and Kingdomes, as the <hi>Pope</hi> hath by the <hi>Tenent</hi> of the <hi>Jesuits?</hi> The <hi>Jesuites</hi> hold that <hi>the Pope may dispose of Princes and Crownes for the service of God, the good of the Church, and salvation of Souls:</hi> And do not these hold that the <hi>Parliament,</hi> may both order the King, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:29718:37"/>
of His Kingdome, as they shall think meet, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of their <hi>Cause</hi> (which they call Gods) <hi>&amp; pro salute populi?</hi>

And do not these men beleeve the Authority of Parliament, to be as irresistable, as that of the Pope, and their <hi>Votes</hi> to be as ful of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue as his <hi>Canons,</hi> and altogether as Authentick, even to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of Kings, and disposing of their Kingdomes? <hi>Eudaemon Johannes</hi> in his Apologie for <hi>Henry Garnet,</hi> teacheth, that <hi>Subjects may be loosed from their Oath of Allegeance, and then they cannot,</hi> (as <hi>Emanuel Sa</hi> affirmeth) <hi>be held guilty of Treason, though they conspire the Kings death, because He against whom they conspire, is not their Master or Lord, they being formerly absolved from his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> And hath not the same Doctrine been both taught and practised by these our opposers? Have not they loosened people from their <hi>Oath of Allegeance</hi> to the King, and then put them in Armes, perswading them that 'tis no Rebellion to fight against Him?</p>
                     <p>The Jesuits in their Chamber of Meditation taught, (as <hi>John Chastell</hi> who gave <hi>Hen.</hi> the 4. of <hi>France,</hi> a stab in the mouth, confessed upon examination) that <hi>it was lawfull to kill that King,</hi> and that <hi>He was now member of the Church, nor ought to be obeyed, or held for King, untill he had received approbation from the Pope.</hi> And one of them in his <hi>Apology</hi> for the said <hi>Chastell</hi> hath these words: <hi>vulnerando Henricum Burbonium, non voluerit laedere ant occidere Regem, etiamsi se talem dicebat, &amp; in quo praeter imaginem nihil Regis quam quod genere Regio ortus erat. In striking Henry of Burbon his intention was not to kill the King, howbeit he called him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe King, sithence he had nothing left, but the appearance of a King being of the bloud Royall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our Anabaptisticall Crew have their <hi>Chambers of Meditation</hi> too, or their <hi>Conventicles,</hi> where they meet with their disciples, to whom they suggest (as also they do in their Pamphlets and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:29718:37"/>
Sermons) that <hi>the King is no true member of the Church,</hi> (because he dissents from them) <hi>but a persecutor of it,</hi> and is no longer to be obeyed or held for King, then the Parliament or represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Body of the Kingdome, in whom the Supreame power is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent shall allow him so to be: and therefore being now decia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by them, to be an enemy to the Kingdome, and one that seeks the peoples ruine; he is to be accounted but as another man, and hath but the bare <hi>Name</hi> or <hi>Title</hi> of a King, as being borne of that family and stocke, which formerly swayed the Scepter.</p>
                     <p>Now my Argument from all this stands thus; who ever main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, that the <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Parliament,</hi> may at pleasure alter King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, exempt people from their Oath of Allegeance, and arm them against their Prince, do maintain, that people in such a case may kill their King: But this (as appeares by their doctrine and practice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) is the <hi>Tenent</hi> of these men, as well as of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites, <hi>Ergo,</hi> these men also by their <hi>Tenents,</hi> hold it lawfull to kill the King.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>minor</hi> is proved already, and the <hi>major</hi> is evident to sense and reason: for no man wil doubt, but a King (from whom offer is made to take away his Kingdome,) will take Armes to maintaine his right, and will labour to reduce them to Loyalty that stand armed against him; and in so doing, 'tis impossible but he must run the hazard of his life, since in defending himself, he is resolute (as in Conscience he is bound to be,) not to lose his Kingdome, (which God hath committed to his care,) without the loss of his life it self.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps some wil say, that in some of their books and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,<note place="margin">Object.</note> they disclaim killing the King, yea though he were an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick or a Tyrant.</p>
                     <p>I answer, the Romish <hi>Jesuites</hi> (their Brethren) in some of<note place="margin">Answer.</note> their books also, have condemned not onely the murdering of Princes, but also Rebellion against them, though Hereticks, and Tyrants; but they meane <hi>sine permissu superiorum,</hi> it is not lawful for a private man to do it (say they) of his own head, untill he be permitted by his superiours; but having leave and countenance from them, <hi>if sentence and judgement be once passed, that the King is a Tyrant or an Heretick, or not capable to govern; then obedience</hi>
                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:29718:38"/>
                        <hi>to the said judgement is to be given, as to the voice of Christ:</hi> So these, when they speak against King-killing, and Rebellion, are to be understood, until the King be declared by Parliament, to be an Enemy to the Kingdome, and to seek the ruine of it; but when this is done, then men may not onely arm themselves against him, but kill him, if possibly they can, and by so doing, they do but the Command of God, and <hi>helpe the Lord against the mighty.</hi> These be the nicetyes of <hi>Romish Jesuites,</hi> and <hi>English Pharisees,</hi> by which they inchant men; they protest Solemnly, that they allow not the murdering of Kings; No, not they: but herein lies the craft, they acknowledge none for Kings, but whom themselves please to allow; and maintain that <hi>to kill a King whose Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they cannot brook, is not to kill a King, but a man</hi> (as they say) <hi>masked under a Regall Title.</hi>
                     </p>

But seeing there is no more truth at all in the matter, then can be infused thereinto by vertue of a Vote: We are most confident that at the <hi>Generall Audit,</hi> (when all things and men shall be judged, as they are and have been,) it will be found a most malicious and transcendent wickednesse, in these men thus
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:29718:39"/>
to have slandred and belyed the Lords Anointed, their own dread Soveraigne. Themselves know well, that the King <hi>did not leave his place or seat at Westminster,</hi> but was most violently forced and driven away from thence, full sore against his will, (for the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of his life,) by the rude multitudes, who were set on work (to be so irreverend towards him,) by them that took the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation to defend him. And they know too, that if the King could by his requests and messages, have obtained to have had a restraint of those so high affronts offered to him, he had not withdrawn himself from thence: But because we have not (to this very day,) heard of any person punished, or so much as checked, (for that contemptuous, and rebellious behaviour) by them, whom they call the <hi>Parliament, and the Kings Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell;</hi> we do beleeve that (when all Secrets shall be opened) it wil be found, that even they, who have now authorized this <hi>Libell,</hi> and in it this impious Charge against the King, did then counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance those very contempts against him, on purpose to force him from them: Wherefore though the King must not be suffered to enjoy the Priviledge of a <hi>King,</hi> or of a <hi>Man;</hi> yet they might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him, without blame or grudging, to have the Liberty of the meanest <hi>Creature,</hi> in endeavouring to preserve his own life and being.</p>
                     <p>And (say they) He hath not onely <hi>left his place,</hi> but also (as they would have it beleeved,) hath rejected it for ever, hath <hi>bound himselfe</hi> to come no more there: Yea, And do all his proffers of pardon, all his endeavours for Treaties, all his desires of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, speak onely so much, and no more? Do his <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate instructions</hi> to his <hi>Commissioners</hi> at <hi>Uxbridge</hi> (before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) evidence this, and nothing else? Do his intentions <hi>to make his Queene the Happy instrument of renewing the meeting, (if he could have had but any demonstration, that the Rebells would yeeld to Reason, Paper</hi> 2.) discover nothing but this? Truely we doe apprehend rather all these particulars to be Arguments of the contrary: when God the <hi>wronged</hi> Party, doth <hi>beseech</hi> the wicked world <hi>to be reconciled to himselfe,</hi> we apprehend he is willing to<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 20.</note> pardon all offences, and to be friends with his enemies, if they would beleeve him: So when an <hi>abused</hi> Christian King, doth imitate God in this particular, we conceive it rather a signe,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:29718:39"/>
that He would be again at unity with His Rebellious Subjects, then that His purpose is, still to keep himself at a distance.</p>
                     <p>We do finde that such an Accusation or Slander as this is, was once laid to the Charge of God himself by a most disloyall and Hypocriticall people, who having forced the Lord from them by their wickednesse, and driven Him away by their ill usage, and thereby made themselves most miserable, did notwithstanding (as these do) very mannerly, lay all the fault upon Him, as if themselves had been the most innocent, and wel-deserving people in the world: and his departure had been altogether causless and on set purpose to bring upon the Heads of his people, all those sorrows, which their own ungodly doings alone had effected and procured. <hi>Sion said, the Lord hath forsaken me, my God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten</hi>

                     <p>But as those Accusers of God, failing in their Evidence, had the blame retorted upon themselves, <hi>Behold, for your iniquities have you sold your selves:</hi> So may these Accusers of the King, thus Charging their own faults upon Him, (without any injury) have the same returned upon their own Heads, the miseries which are upon the Kingdome by reason of the Kings absence, they may

thank their own selves for: And as the Lord in that place doth further convince them of the wrong they did him, by declaring his continuall readinesse to help them out of those miseries, whereinto they had brought themselves, if they would but heare him, beleeve in him, and trust unto him; which he proves, by minding them of what he had done formerly, what <hi>Acts of grace</hi> he had passed already for their good, inferring thereby, that he was both able and willing to do as much again, if they would but give him leave by taking his word. So may the King, and so hath the King, by the very same wayes and meanes evidenced his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and freedome from those their unjust accusations: what readinesse hath he alwayes shewed in denying himselfe to satisfie them? What <hi>Acts of grace</hi> hath He already passed? never any King hath done the like. Let the bitterest of His Enemies deny it if they can; what could be desired by reasonable men, which he hath not offered and promised unto them, if they would but beleeve him, and trust unto him? But this they wil not be brought unto, for it is one of the most difficult things in the world, for a Person that hath been so highly wronged, as He hath been, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends well, to gain credit from them, that have abused him: their owne guiltiness makes them incredulous, and without <hi>Faith</hi> 'tis impossible that either God or the King, should be able to do any people good; as it was said by our Saviour, that himself <hi>could doe</hi>

Had the King I say, beene one of these men, and done thus, He might deservedly have been said to have sate <hi>in the Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Chaire,</hi> and to have laughed to scorne a <hi>whole Nation.</hi>

                     <p>First their <hi>Reason</hi> (I apprehead) is this; <hi>they know themselves worthy to be both abhorred and scorned of all men;</hi> and doe beleeve they are so in the Hearts of all the wise, for their most abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and grosse hypocrisie; yea, they know in their Consciences, that God scornes at them, (they being exercised as those are whom Scripture affirmeth <hi>God holdeth in derision:</hi>) and therefore<note place="margin">Psal. 2. 2, 3, 4.</note> they speake of the Kings scorne at them, from the guilt of their<note place="margin">Psal. 73. 11, 12</note> own merits and deservings.<note place="margin">Prov. 3. 34.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then their <hi>Ends</hi> (I conceive) are these, first, <hi>to make His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty appeare abhominable unto the world,</hi> (which is the main scope of all their endeavours) for tis said, <hi>the Scorner is an abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

                        <hi>unto men.</hi> And secondly, that the blinde and seduced vulgar, might not think them to be guilty of that sinne, which, with so much boldnesse, and bitternesse they doe first of all charge upon the King. It is the knowne policy of a wicked harlot, to call her honest neighbour <hi>whore</hi> first, and of a pick-purse pursued, to cry <hi>stop the Theef,</hi> that himself might not be suspected to be the man: <hi>You take too much upon you Moses and Aaron,</hi> cryed<note place="margin">Numb. 16.</note> those Grand <hi>Rebells,</hi> when themselves onely did so: And one who had sold himselfe to work wickednesse, layed it to the charge of good <hi>Elias, that he troubled Israel,</hi> because his guilty<note place="margin">1 Kings 18. 17.</note> Conscience told him, that the Prophet, and all other honest men beside, had cause to accuse him for so doing; and this is the very case of these men, who (as we see) have done nothing in this particular, without <hi>President</hi> and example; though we confesse in respect of the Circumstances, these men are more bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>scornfull,</hi> then ever any were, that we read of in Scripture or elsewhere.</p>
                     <p>It was bitterly done of the <hi>Philistimes,</hi> when they had weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Sampson,</hi> and brought him into an afflicted condition, to<note place="margin">Jud. 16.</note> mock and <hi>scorne</hi> at him in his misery, yet they did not, in those their mocks charge him with <hi>scorning</hi> them; And the Persecutors

of our Saviour did deal bitterly with him, when in derision they <hi>Crown'd</hi> him with <hi>Thornes,</hi> put a <hi>Reed</hi> into his hand, in stead of a <hi>Scepter,</hi> called him <hi>King,</hi> bowed the knee to Him; and then advanced him upon a <hi>Crosse</hi> instead of a <hi>Throne;</hi> yet they did not at that time in their scoffing and flouting expressions say, that <hi>His Crosse was the Chair of the Scornfull:</hi> and that he being fastened to that, did <hi>sit in the Scorners seat,</hi> and scorne at them: But these men are pleased even thus to deale with their King and Soveraigne, as all the world may see by their Language; so that the King hath cause to complain in the words of the <hi>Psalme, Our soule is exceedingly filled with the scornings of them that be at</hi>

                     <p>Because dead folkes cannot speak for themselves, and because<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> it is so Voted, therefore <hi>Strafford and Canterbury were the chief fire-brands of this war,</hi> and so for truth it must be taken; though one of them was quite extinct, a year before this war begun, and the other kept, by his Accusers in so close obscurity, that his sparkes, (if he had any in him to this purpose) could not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly flie abroad.

                     <p>But these men tell us further, that <hi>the King hath since perfected that subversion of Law, which those his ill Councellours had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly attempted.</hi> 'Tis too well known, that the customary way of these mens Honouring the King, is by casting on him, the scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall of their owne doings: The <hi>Law</hi> we confesse is subverted, and overthrown, but the King can no more be said, to have done the same, then <hi>David</hi> could be said to have killedd <hi>Abner,</hi> and <hi>Amasa,</hi> because he was the <hi>Soveraigne</hi> to those sons of <hi>Zeruiah,</hi> who did the deed, and were so subtile, and strong, that he could neither restrain them from it, nor bring them to condigne punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for it.</p>
                     <p>And let all modest and ingenuous men observe, how despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and bold these men are, in their aspersions against the King: they affirme, <hi>He hath subverted Law, and walked in the Councell of the ungodly, to the ruine almost of</hi> 3. <hi>whole Kingdomes.</hi> They could have said no more, if when the <hi>Militia</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> were in his sole hands; things, had been, as now they are: But we, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves too, can all witnesse, that when the <hi>Parliament</hi> met, no drop of bloud was yet spilt in <hi>Ireland;</hi> no Commotions were stirring in <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the King by his <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Goodnesse,</hi> had

allayed all; nor was there any complaining of Souldiers, nor plundering in the streets of <hi>England:</hi> all the three Kingdomes were in peace; and to continue them therein, the King calls a Parliament, and gives power to the Members thereof, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement withall, to settle all things both in Church and Common-wealth, for the Subjects benefit, even as firmly as themselves (who were intrusted and chosen by their fellow Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for that purpose) could possibly devise. He denyes them nothing in pursuance thereof, suffers them to call all suspected officers and persons to account, not excepting <hi>Strafford</hi> or <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury;</hi> and further to assure His people of His strong desires to continue their happinesse, He settles a <hi>Trienniall Parliament,</hi> as the most speciall mean to prevent <hi>ill Councellours</hi> in after-times: yet these Accusers tax the King <hi>of perverting the Law;</hi> and speak as if the three Kingdomes had been at the very brim of destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and quite ruined ere this, if the power had not been taken out of His Hands, by those, who (by their meeknesse, wisdome, and frugality) have put all the said Kingdomes into a more hopefull condition of preservation, (as it must be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, though against all sense and experience) then they were in before.</p>
                     <p>Indeed had those <hi>undertakers</hi> done that work for which they were summoned, and called together, the Kings good Subjects, in all His Kingdomes, might have had cause of mentioning their names with perpetuall Honour: but they (as it seemeth) envying that happiness which their fellow Subjects were likely to enjoy, by those new enacted Lawes, and especially by the <hi>Trienniall Parliament;</hi> fairly pretending other matters, did get the same <hi>Act</hi> presently made uselesse, by another, for the continuation of <hi>this:</hi> which hath created themselves, (as they suppose and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend) <hi>perpetuall dictators,</hi> and all their fellow Subjects <hi>perpetuall slaves.</hi> For let these <hi>perpetuall great Councellours,</hi> approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves never so evill, and detrimentall to-Church and State, yet the poore Subject must be forced by the <hi>Militia</hi> (which they have got into their hands) to beleeve them unerring; for He shall have no benefit by the <hi>Trienniall Parliament,</hi> to examine their doings.</p>
                     <p>And hence also it is, that they have balked the triall of men

by <hi>established Law,</hi> and (conceiving themselves above it) have shunned to punish for those faults which the <hi>Law</hi> condemneth: and to shew the Omnipotency of their power, have passed sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death, where the <hi>Law</hi> condemneth not, though Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth, that <hi>where is no Law, there is no Transgression:</hi> the giving way to which very thing, was, and is a trouble to the Kings Conscience, and the cause of His first dislike of their Courses, witnesse their owne words which are to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>That the <hi>King adjudged Strafford worthy of death,</hi> for any thing,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> is more then we heard before, nor have we any reason to beleeve the same now, upon the bare report of these men; yet to doe them a courtesie, we may suppose it to be as they say, for the present; and then it followes, (as all may see) that they doe not Charge the King for desiring to save <hi>Straffords</hi> life absolutely, (for they say <hi>the King himself judged him worthy of death:</hi>) but for being against his <hi>suffering for Treason:</hi> So that (in brief) the Kings sinne only was, according to the Testimony of His most deadly Enemies) <hi>He would that Strafford should have suffered death, only for his faults, and not for that, whereof he was not guilty.</hi> As became a righteous Judge, the King would have had His <hi>Great Councell,</hi> to have done <hi>Justa, Juste,</hi> Righteous things in a Righteous manner; as conceiving that way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to be most acceptable unto God, and most likely to continuate his blessings upon the Kingdome: but being not able by faire meanes to perswade them to that; and considering that to use <hi>force</hi> might be a remedy worse then the disease, the bloud of many innocent persons, might be spilt to save one; and yet perhaps (the power and the malice of the Adversary being so High, that one not saved neither) He was constrained <hi>against His Conscience to leave him to the block;</hi> and for His being so tender Conscienced in this case, He is thought worthy of <hi>Scorne</hi> by these men, (His most Religious, Obedient, and loving Subjects.) <hi>He left him to the Block against Conscience</hi> (say they) <hi>as is now alleadged.</hi>

                     <p>By those their words they have also well hinted to our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, how farre, and in what sort the King <hi>hath walked in the Councells of the ungodly, to the ruine</hi> (as they say) <hi>almost of three Kingdomes:</hi> To which purpose they proceed further, (in the same place) and say.</p>

that <hi>Ordinance</hi> to the dammage of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> nor is there any other <hi>Law</hi> capable of alteration, (as we conceive,) whereby <hi>Straffords President</hi> might hurt him: But when that Ordinance was made, the Authors of it had respect only unto themselves, for intending then to go in those wayes, for which they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>Strafford,</hi> they did wisely provide that his <hi>President</hi> should not be in force in after-times against themselves: Nor (indeed) did they then know, they should need to make any use of <hi>Straffords President</hi> against <hi>Canterb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

thence, to be, <hi>that he might not speake destruction to his people, but safety and Honour still if possible,</hi> that he might not imbrew his hands in the bloud of innocent and Loyall Subjects, against <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Conscience:</hi> yea surely, lest the rest of that guilt of bloud which he saw was likely to be spilt, should be charged upon the Head of him, and his posterity: He withdrew himselfe from their society, and did for the present, even <hi>abhorre</hi> to be amongst them: When God pleaseth (we see) he can make men speak truth, whether they will or no.</p>
                     <p>And truly let any man who hath <hi>Conscience</hi> judge in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whether the King did not do prudently, and conscientiously in his forsaking them, when he perceived their purpose and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was, to have him sit there amongst them, onely with a <hi>Reed</hi> or <hi>Pen</hi> in his Hand, to signe and own, as his <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Deed,</hi> whatever they alone should vouchsafe to do; that so they might cast the blame and <hi>Odium</hi> of all their Injustice, afterwards upon him; which is most apparent they would have done, if he had stayed; for being by his departure, frustrate of such their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they seem to cast it all upon the <hi>people,</hi> by those words, <hi>if no resistance be used,</hi> Straffords <hi>President, will cast</hi> Canterbury, <hi>and</hi> Canterburies <hi>all the rest of the Conspiratours, and so the people will make good their ancient freedome still:</hi> As if the <hi>people</hi> of their own accords, without being requested thereunto, or sollicited by others; for the upholding and making good some <hi>Ancient Priviledge,</hi> which they formerly had enjoyed, and now (if the King were able to make resistance) were in danger to be deprived of: Had desired that those men, <hi>(Strafford and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury)</hi> should be put to death, onely by their <hi>Votes</hi> and not by <hi>Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed I read that in Heathen <hi>Rome,</hi> the People had such a <hi>Custome,</hi> to voice men to death; (and such men they should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly be, as had done the Common-wealth best service,) and from the Custome perhaps it was, that <hi>Pilat</hi> a <hi>Romane</hi> Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, did permit the people of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> (against all <hi>Law</hi> and right) to voice Christ to be crucified: But I never heard that the people of <hi>England</hi> were wont to do so in any age, till this new <hi>Arbritrary Government</hi> was set up: And we beleeve it will be easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for these Libellers, to make the people, (as the world now
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:29718:47"/>
goes with many of them) <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Jewes</hi> in such desires, then to prove that any such <hi>Custome</hi> did ever yet hitherto belong unto them; nor will it availe much to the peoples comforts at the great day, or to their own securities in the mean while, if now they should purchase any such <hi>Priviledge.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I leave the <hi>People</hi> to consider of this matter themselves, and returne to these <hi>King-accusers;</hi> who have themselves well answered their own accusation against their Soveraigne, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the true Reason of his <hi>leaving his Seat at Westminster;</hi> to which they might have added another, <hi>viz. Gods calling him from thence,</hi> both by his Word and Providence.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>By his Word,</hi> which a King, as well as another man, is bound<note place="margin">Prov. 1. 10.</note> to observe, and give heed unto: <hi>My Sonne, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not: if they say, let us lay wait for bloud, let us lurke privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the innocent without cause, &amp;c. My sonne, walke not thou in the way with them, refraine thy foot from their path, for their feet run to evill, and make haste to shed bloud.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. <hi>By his Providence,</hi> in his permitting the tumultuous people to rise against him, and to force him from thence, <hi>Consule provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiam Dei, cum verbo Dei,</hi> (sayes one) and when with the <hi>Word,</hi> Providence concurs, there is doubtless a speciall call from heaven.</p>
                     <p>But the King having these grounds of withdrawing himselfe, some may wonder why in that former place, they so heavily charge him, <hi>to have walked to the ruine of his three Kingdomes, by abhorring his Seat and Councell:</hi> as if his leaving that were the sole cause of all our woe.</p>
                     <p>I answer, in a word, Their reason, I conceive, is, because the King being of a soft and tender conscience, is unwilling <hi>to beare the guilt,</hi> therefore he shall (whether he will or no, if they can help him to it) <hi>beare all the blame;</hi> being unchargeable of <hi>reall</hi> evils, he shall be burdened with <hi>imaginary;</hi> the Devill and his Members desire no greater advantage against those they hate, then to see them meekly scrupulous; nor doe they please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves better in any thing, then in loading with slanders, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the righteous, when they see them to be in an afflicted condition. <hi>Shimei</hi> cursed his Soveraigne, and falsly called him <hi>A bloudy man,</hi> and the <hi>destroyer of Sauls house,</hi> because <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e saw him in a low condition: So these men fancie they may say any evill
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:29718:47"/>
against their King, because he is in an <hi>afflicted condition;</hi> they may speak to his <hi>farther griefe,</hi> because he is <hi>already grieved.</hi> But as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in that place sayes, so say we, <hi>It may be the Lord will look upon the affliction of his Anointed, and will requite good the sooner to him, even for these their accursed and false scandals of him.</hi> And O our God, our eyes are towards thee, we will waite for thy sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                     <p>And thus I hope, I have now made it apparent, that there is as little of <hi>Verity,</hi> as there is of <hi>Piety,</hi> in that reproachfull Charge, which these ill disposed Libellers, these <hi>Martin Mar-kings</hi> have cast upon their Soveraigne; now we shall observe how they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. They address their speech to the Reader in generall, whom they suppose to be either a <hi>Friend</hi> or an <hi>Enemy</hi> to their cause, and say,</p>

eyes, or as himselfe lusteth, provided that He will take part with the Parliament, (as they call it) against those whom they please to judge their Enemies; we doe not say, that all particulars that be on that side, doe act all and every of these things, but they may, if they have power, and a will thereto, for they have <hi>Liberty</hi> as well as the rest of their faction, (who are already <hi>the Servants of Corruption</hi>) this is that <hi>cause of Liberty</hi> which they maintaine.</p>
                     <p>Now (in the second place) for their <hi>Religion,</hi> what is that?<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> Truly we cannot tell, unlesse we say of it, as was wont to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of that of the Papists in the Prayer, on the fift of <hi>November, Their Religion is Rebellion, their Faith Faction, and their Practice Murdering of Soules and Bodies.</hi> For since they have pulled downe, and discountenanced the <hi>Religion</hi> of Jesus Christ esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished amongst us, (which was a <hi>Religion</hi> of Peace, Patience, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, Love) they have not given us a plat-forme of any, that we might know what Faith they fight for; what <hi>Religion</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular it is which they maintaine; we confesse we are yet to seek what tis they aime at: sometime we see occasion to think tis the <hi>Popish Religion</hi> which they are setting up; sometime, that tis the <hi>Turkish;</hi> we cannot imagine that it can be the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> for that is it which they only labour to destroy.</p>
                     <p>When we observe how they deny the <hi>Kings Supremacy,</hi> not only in Spiritualls, but also in Temporalls; How they take upon them to absolve from the <hi>Oath of Allegeance;</hi> to loosen Subjects from their Loyalty, to raise Rebellions; How they allow of King-slandring, King-hunting, King-killing; How <hi>they make Gods Commandements of none effect by their traditions</hi> and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, preferring these before the precepts of Christ, in their inflicting greater penalties for the not observing them: How they challenge infallibility unto themselves, requiring Faith and Obedience to their dictates and judgements; the people must beleeve <hi>as the Parliament Judgeth,</hi> they must hold the opinion of not Erring, and of the necessary assistance of Gods Spirit in the Parliament <hi>Committees,</hi> as the <hi>Romanists</hi> conceive to be in their <hi>Papall Consistories:</hi> They must fancy in them a like unlimited Authority, to dispense with Gods Lawes against theft, murder,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:29718:49"/>
oppression, and the like, as some <hi>Papists</hi> doe, to be in the <hi>Pope;</hi> and as what is done by his Command, so what is done by theirs, must be beleeved to be done by Gods. As he will be accounted <hi>Gods Lieutenant,</hi> so will they, by a Commission of their owne making; as what is done, for the advantage of his See, so what is for the furthering of their designes, must be apprehended to be done for the upholding of Christ; and as tis taught by some of the <hi>Popish</hi> Clergy, that whoever is out of <hi>Papall Obedience</hi> must undoubtedly perish; so hath it been Preached by some of the Parliament Ministers, that <hi>whoever is not under the Obedience of Parliament, is a Malignant, and in state of Damnation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When I consider of these and such like particulars, &amp; withall how bold they are with the Scriptures of God, in corrupting with their false glosses and interpretations <hi>à la mode de Rome,</hi> the pure text and Word of God, forcing it to speake against it selfe, in furtherance of their cause. How Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe is in danger of an <hi>Index Expurgatorius</hi> from them also: how he hath been censured already, for his speaking so broadly against the sinne of Rebellion; to speak in those points or places, <hi>rather as a Politician, in respect of the times wherein he lived, then as a Divine:</hi> Considering also, how they shun disputes with us, whom they account their adversaries, (as the Papists were wont to doe:) How they inhibit the reading of our Bookes: How they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the simple people, (who are their Disciples) not to joyne with us in our Prayers to God, or in our praises of God, yea, taking an Oath of some of them to that purpose: no, the <hi>Wife</hi> must not pray with her <hi>Husband,</hi> nor the <hi>Childe</hi> with his <hi>Parent;</hi> if the Husband or Parent doe professe themselves for the King, and for the ancient established <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> (as we are able to prove by particular Examples.) In a word, considering how they pursue us with lies and slanders; how they imprison us, and force upon our Consciences, ungodly Covenants; How they persecute with fire and sword, all that be not of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, (as the <hi>Papists</hi> of old were wont to doe.) How like to the proceedings of the <hi>Popish Inquisition,</hi> these of their <hi>holy House</hi> are, in diverse particulars, which might be instanced in; when we doe consider of these, and many such like matters, wherein they imitate those of <hi>Rome,</hi> we thinke it to be the <hi>Romane Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
                        <pb n="71" facs="tcp:29718:49"/>
which they mean to maintaine, and set up amongst us. Not that we thinke they will admit of the <hi>Popes Authority,</hi> for they intend to be <hi>Popes</hi> themselves: as <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. disclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the <hi>Popes Supreamacy,</hi> but retained many Points of his Religion, so perhaps will they doe: these be our thoughts some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</p>
                     <p>But then againe, we fear it may be the <hi>Turkish Religion</hi> which they mean to advance, when we consider what correspondency they have with the <hi>Turkes</hi> in diverse things, <hi>viz.</hi> How they have sold and made money of Christian men, which none in <hi>Europe</hi> save onely <hi>Turkes</hi> are wont to doe: How it hath been propounded among some of them, to send to <hi>Argier,</hi> and to sell for slaves the <hi>Messengers</hi> of JESUS CHRIST, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with others of their Country-men (of better Condition then themselves) whom for their Religion and Conscience sake they have imprisoned. How themselves are turned to be robbers and Pirats like those of <hi>Argier,</hi> making all their own, which by rapine and violence they can get from Christians: How they have suffered those theeves (their Brethren) to steale away Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Children, from these our Coasts, while themselves (posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing our means of defence) have stood still looking on, or else were busie in the <hi>interim,</hi> in taking away our goods: when we consider of these things; and also how they have chosen for the Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and maintenance of their <hi>new Religion,</hi> to walke rather in the way of <hi>Mahomet</hi> then of Christ, we conceive that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend rather to be his Servants. For <hi>Mahomet</hi> did set up his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by fraud and force of Armes, by the sword and shedding of Bloud, and so doe these endeavour to set up theirs. <hi>Mahomet</hi> layed to perpetuate and continue his Religion, by introducing of ignorance, by deposition of Schooles and Universities, by ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing of Learning; which is the very method of these men: whereas the way of Jesus Christ, (whom the Christians worship and obey) was clean contrary: And the <hi>Turkes</hi> have judged of their cause and Religion by their military success, they thinke and plead it to be the best, because the most prosperous: so these men conclude by the same rule, that their cause is the better, because at the present, tis the most successefull. These be our thoughts, and the grounds of our fears at other times, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:29718:50"/>
the Religion which these <hi>new Religion makers</hi> doe intend to set up and maintain.</p>
                     <p>But what ever <hi>Religion</hi> it be, which they shall chance upon,<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> we conceive tis resolved amongst them, it shall not be the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> what ever their outward pretences be, for this is that, which they labour only to destroy, as appeares by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particulars.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>By their persecuting and abusing the King,</hi> who is the chiefest Prince in the World, that publikely professeth himselfe the <hi>Defender of the Protestant Faith:</hi> and who hath maintained it in the greatest tranquility and glory that ever it enjoyed since Christs time; to whose Bosome all Christian Protestants in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> have had recourse for relief &amp; comfort, in dayes of darkness and Affliction: This Prince, this Man of Gods right Hand, this Sun and Shield of distressed Christians; have these men laboured to obscure and darken, by lyes, slanders, and reproaches; to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and disable, by taking away his Authority, Wealth, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer; to depose and murder, by hunting of him, shooting at him, and Rebelling against him; to the end he might never more be a nurcing Father to the persecuted Flock of Jesus: That the Sheep of the Lord, when worryed by Wolves in other Nations, might flye no more unto him for refuge; that the Lambes of Christ, which this Church under his Command hath brought forth may no longer enjoy pasture under so safe and so indulgent a Keeper.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>By their discountenancing, Banishing, Imprisoning,</hi> and <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Fathers</hi> and <hi>Doctors of the Protestant Christian Church,</hi> those in speciall, who have been the chiefest pillers and uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of its glory; and strongest Champions against Antichristia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in their Generations; whose Workes and labours are Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous through the Christian world; and whose Names after-Ages will not mention without Admiration: of which number are the these most Reverend, Grave and Learned Prelates and Doctors; Doctor <hi>Laud,</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and Primate of <hi>England.</hi> Doctor <hi>Usher,</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Doctor <hi>Davenaunt,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Salisbury.</hi> Doctor <hi>Morton,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Durham.</hi> Doctor <hi>Westfeeld,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoll.</hi> Doctor <hi>Hall,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Norwich.</hi> Doctor <hi>Ward,</hi> Professour

                     <p>3. <hi>By their exposing to contempt and beggery all that were in the Office of the Ministry,</hi> (those onely excepted who to satisfie their lusts, were willing to make shipwrack of a good Conscience, and to Apostatize from the Faith received; to renounce the meek and peaceable Doctrine of the Gospell, which they had formerly taught; and to preach in the stead thereof, Sedition, Rebellion, War and Bloud; stirring up the members of Christ, to <hi>Kill, Slay,</hi> and <hi>Destroy</hi> each other, according to the tenour of certain bloudy and Antichristian Ordinances:) but all that held fast to the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of Jesus,</hi> they have disgraced, defamed, silenced, banished, and beggered; Yea, one of the first things they set about, at the beginning of their meeting, was to make Gods Prophets, <hi>the scorn of the World,</hi> vile and contemptible in peoples eyes, that what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they should preach, might not be beleeved; which they indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, and in part effected, by giving publike liberty, to all that would, to bring in what accusations they pleased against them; which were received and beleeved, without proof, though the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former were the most stinking drunkard, and vilest blasphemer, in the Countrey; and the Ministers, some of the most painfull and consciencious, yea, were it never so evident, that malice alone, set the <hi>Accuser</hi> on work, to revenge himself, upon the <hi>Minister,</hi> for his indeavouring to reclaime him from some sin; yet should the said <hi>Accuser</hi> be openly countenanced and encouraged, by some of the shamelesse members; and the <hi>Messenger of God</hi> scorned, set at nought, his living sequestred, his person imprisoned, his wife and children turned out of doores, and all that he had taken from him; and the Honester the man, the worse used alwayes, for by his known honesty, he would doe Christ the more service (if let alone,) and their cause the more dammage: and

It appeares further by <hi>the endeavours of some of them, to take away all certaine and settled maintenance from the Ministers of Christ</hi> for time to come, that they might not have hereafter, any outward encouragement to set up his Religion againe: <hi>Judge Cooke</hi> in the Bishop of <hi>Winchesters</hi> case out of <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> story observeth well, (and these men it seemes have also noted the same) that this was the course which <hi>Julian the Apostate</hi> took in his dayes: He having a purpose (as these have) to ruine the profession of Christianity: <hi>Used not the sword as Dioclesian did,</hi> (though these indeed, to make the work more speedy, doe act <hi>Dioclesian</hi> too) <hi>but he took away the means of the Clergies subsistance, knowing full well, that if maintenance once failed, the number of Preachers would not long continue:</hi> The said <hi>Julian</hi> also, would tell the Bishops and Pastors, when he stripped them of all they had, that in so doing, <hi>He had a speciall care of their soules health, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Gospell commended Poverty unto them.</hi> Such like flowts at the Doctrine of Christ, doth often fall from lips of the <hi>Apostates</hi> of these days.</p>
                     <p>5. <hi>By their pulling downe all Christian order and formes of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Worship and Service,</hi> tending to decency and edification; by casting down, defiling, and defaming the Houses of God, turning many of them into Stables, Slaughter-houses, Prisons and Jakes; they have made close-stooles of <hi>Fonts</hi> and <hi>Pulpits,</hi> and done as bad to <hi>Communion Tables;</hi> they have rent the holy <hi>Bible</hi> in pieces, scorned at the Sacraments, Baptized Horses, robbed Churches of Sacramentall Utensils, as Plate, Linnen; calling it Idolatrous and Superstitious, because it had been only used in Christs service: nay, the poore innocent <hi>Bells,</hi> because they have been the meanes of calling people together to Worship God, and to adore the Saviour of the World; must be pulled down and turned into <hi>Guns,</hi> that they may be another while Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of destruction to the Members of Jesus; (this indeed (as I read) was the manner of the <hi>Turkes</hi> when they tooke <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> they melted the <hi>Bells</hi> into <hi>Ordnances:</hi>) In a word, what ever evill or impiety the Enemies were wont to slander our Church withall; these men have acted, or suffered to be done, by those

                        <hi>That in England, they abolish Church Sacraments, the meanes of Salvation, they either raze or rob Churches wheresoever they come, and make Stables of them; that they will neither have Temples nor forme of Religion, nor doe they serve God any way; yea, the English Nation is growne so barbarous, that they are very Canniballs, and devoure one another.</hi> God knowes, my Soul abhorres to thinke, much more to name those things that are acted &amp; done amongst as, nor should my pen be fouled with the mention of them, were they not visible to so many eyes, and did not necessity of defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding impugned Truth, and an abused Church restraine me. But I would have all the <hi>Papists</hi> understand, (for to that end, do I thus speak) that we, who are of the true <hi>Protestant Christian Religion,</hi> do abhor and loath these practices as much as any, and are perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted to death by them, that do them, for our dislike of them.</p>
                     <p>6. <hi>By their suppression and demolition of all Monuments of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, that there might be seen no more tokens of it in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi> as if they intended, that no man should be able hereafter to say, <hi>this Land was once Christian:</hi> The very <hi>festivall times,</hi> when the Birth, Death, Resurrection &amp; Ascension of our Saviour is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorated, &amp; which (next to the Preaching of Gods Word, and Administration of the Sacraments) have been the most speciall means to confirme mens faith in the History of Christ; these they have inhibited and forbidden, as if they hated his very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance; Gods wisdome appointed the <hi>Feast of Passeover,</hi> to be kept as an Ordinance for ever among the Jewes, to minde them of their deliverance from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and to be a mean to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure their Children in after-Ages, of the truth of that great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: And the Church conceiving that our deliverance from sinne and Satan, by the Birth, Death, Resurrection, and Ascension of<note place="margin">Exod. 12. 24. 25, 26.</note> Christ, to be as a great a deliverance as that other, and to deserve as well to be remembred, did also apprehend that way or mean to be the best, to convey the notice of it to Posterity, which Gods owne Wisdome devised; and that was by celebrating <hi>Annuall Festivalls</hi> in memoriall thereof: but these men (it seemes) have resolved to the contrary, for they will not have the same kept any longer in remembrance.</p>

                     <p>But what doe I speake of dayes, and times, and teaching Trees? the very <hi>Doctrine</hi> it selfe, which Christ himselfe taught and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Doctrine of Peace,</hi> Patience, and passive obedience unto Princes, is reckoned obsolete and uselesse by these men: it was publickly maintained by a certaine worthlesse Member at a great Committee in the <hi>Checquer Chamber,</hi> that <hi>such Doctrines were out of date in these dayes, and had been onely proper to former times, when the Church was in a low Condition, and under the Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Heathen Emperours.</hi>

                     <p>Nay, these men would not, that any true Christian <hi>Protestant</hi> should have leave to live, to relate unto posterity the Doctrine of his Saviour, as seemeth by their doings; their thirst for <hi>Protestant</hi> Bloud, appeareth to be such, as if they desired that all of that Profession in the world, had but one Head, that so they might cut it off at one blow, for they have shed already more of it, within these foure yeares, then ever was shed in <hi>Great Brittaine</hi> since the world began; and that for no other cause, that we yet know (for they never durst come to dispute it with us) then for holding to the Doctrine of Christs Gospell: because we will not contrary to that, lift up our hands with them against our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne.

                     <argument>
                        <p>1. Of the feigned Combination against the Parliament. 2. Our judgement of the Papists, and of their assisting the King. 3. Our abhorment of the Cruelties of the <hi>Irish,</hi> and how they are out-gone by the <hi>English</hi> Rebells. 4. Our Opinion of the Court Faction, of what flock we are. 5. How the <hi>Libellers</hi> call themselves the more beleeving sort of people.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BUt the Reason insinuated (by our <hi>Subtile Brethren</hi>) why<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> men should be affected to that their cause, is taken from the Consideration of the <hi>Persons</hi> against whom (as they say) tis main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, <hi>viz. against a combination of all the Papists of</hi> Europe (<hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most) especially the bloudy Tigres of</hi> Ireland, <hi>and some of the Prelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and Court Faction in</hi> England.</p>
                     <p>That there is any such <hi>Combination,</hi> (opposed by the two <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, of England and Scotland</hi>) as these men mention, is more (perhaps) then the Readers have heard of before, or then they do yet beleeve upon the bare affirmation of these Relaters, who are but men, (<hi>&amp; all men are Subject to Error.</hi>) Indeed we have heard of a most ungodly and unlawfull <hi>Association,</hi> betwixt those whom they call the two <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and certaine other people in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Scotland:</hi> The tenour of which is, (if I rightly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend) <hi>never to lay downe Armes, nor to admit of Peace, till they have accomplished their owne ends upon the King and his Friends, and satisfied their Lusts upon them. And to defend and assist with their lives and fortunes, all those</hi> (whoever they be without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) <hi>that shall joyne with them against the King &amp; his Party.</hi> So that, be they Papists, Turkes, Jewes, Heathens, Atheists, Arrians, <hi>Irish Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gres,</hi> Devills of Hell, if they do but joyne with them against their King, and those that Honour him as Gods Annointed; for this very cause and reason, they have bound themselves by Oath, they have vowed and protested to defend and maintaine them, <hi>with their lives and fortunes,</hi> even till death, and never to forsake them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="78" facs="tcp:29718:53"/>If there be a more generall illegall, and irreligious <hi>Combination</hi> then that is, (which any others have entred into) these relaters should have done well, to have given the Reader a Copy of the same; who otherwise must apprehend them in these their words, to be only at their old vomit againe: Because they cannot possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly devise more evill, and mischiefe to Charge upon others, then themselves do practice against others, therefore they still impute unto others, their own iniquities, or else their guilty Consciences makes them fancy, that they see their own pictures in other mens faces.</p>
                     <p>But we will not omit to observe the <hi>ingenuity</hi> of these men, (though it be but a little) intimated in those their two words <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most</hi> and <hi>Some;</hi> they do not say <hi>all the Papists in Europe</hi> absolutely, &amp; <hi>all the prelaticall Court faction</hi> without any limitation, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into this fancyed Combination; But <hi>all the Papists in Europe almost,</hi> and <hi>some of the Prelaticall and Court faction;</hi> the word <hi>almost,</hi> doth exclude all the <hi>Papists</hi> that either are, or may be under the Parliament Pay and Service; and the word <hi>Some,</hi> may excuse those of the Prelaticall or <hi>Court Faction</hi> that hold intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with <hi>those at Westminster;</hi> and are men of like complexion with them, dissemblers, disobedient, unthankfull, treacherous, heady, and high-minded, however they carry themselves to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance: And truly we beleeve that if these tale-tellers, would but speak out, when the fit of ingenuity is upon them, they would confesse and acknowledge, that if any <hi>Papists</hi> in the world, any of the <hi>Bloudy Tigers of Ireland,</hi> will but joyne with those, whom they call the two Parliaments against the King; and that little flock, which for Conscience sake remain Loyall to him; they shall be accepted and absolved presently, from what is past, they shall be reckoned <hi>Papists</hi> no more, <hi>Bloudy Tigers of Ireland</hi> no more, but all good men, and true in a moment; and have free leave, yea, and money too, to act over againe their bloudy Tragedies here in <hi>England.</hi> Or if any of the <hi>Court Faction,</hi> of what Religion or conversation soever, will but vouchsafe to be more vile and wicked then ever they have been, and be hired (as <hi>Judas</hi> was) to betray their Master, or to render up to his Enemies, those places of Defence committed to their Trust, and so come off from the King to their Parliament side; they shall be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:29718:53"/>
and Voted good, all upon the suddaine: Truly we never heard of any yet, that had the Conscience to act the part of a <hi>Traitour,</hi> or of a villaine against God, his Prince, and Country, but hath been accepted by them: and (as was said) we beleeve if our <hi>subtile and suspected Brethren</hi> would but speake out, when the moode of ingenuity is upon them, they would confesse as much.</p>
                     <p>But the Reason (as we conceive) why they yoke <hi>Papists, Irish Tigers,</hi> and the <hi>Court Faction</hi> thus together, and affirme them to be entred into a Combination, is this: Because they would, that the common people should have an equall odious esteem, of each of these three sorts; whom they would also should be apprehended, to be the onely persons that maintaine and uphold the King, and whom the King doth only respect and adhere unto; &amp; therefore they would that we (unto whom they direct their speech) should decline him and his Cause, and joyne with themselves and their faction, against <hi>Him, that,</hi> and <hi>them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In Answer to which I shall only declare in a word, what<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> our judgements and opinions are, of each of these three sorts of people.</p>
                     <p>1. Concerning <hi>Papists,</hi> we (the Persecuted and Loyall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants of this Kingdome) doe more abjure their Religion then these men do, that speak so bitterly against them; though we do not think it lawfull to enter into a <hi>Combination,</hi> to root them out of the Earth by shedding of their Bloud; (no though they should enter into such a one to destroy us) for we have no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the Gospell so to doe. Tis the <hi>Word of God</hi> that is ordained to suppresse false Religions, and not the <hi>Sword of Man;</hi> Fire, Sword, and Pistolls are the Weapons of Antichrist, and not of Christ.</p>
                     <p>And (because of their Religion) we are heartily sorry, that there are any <hi>Papists</hi> in the Kings Armies, for that scandall which ignorant people take by them, (through the perverse suggestions of the crafty Adversary) who from hence, take occasion to keep their affections enstranged from their Soveraigne. Not that hereby any scandall is justly given by His Majesty, for we hold it not only <hi>Lawful</hi> for him to make use of those of that Religion, but also <hi>necessary,</hi> yea, it would be a sinne against God, if being assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

by Theeves and Rebells, he should not use the meanes for his own Preservation, and imploy for his own defence, all those whom God hath submitted under his Government for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; there is no man, if he should be assaulted by Robbers and Murderers, but would make use of the aide of a <hi>Turke</hi> to save his life. Yea, these very men themselves (we see) can hire <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> from other Countryes, to help them to destroy their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne; and is it not meet and reasonable that the King should permit <hi>Papists,</hi> his owne Subjects, to help to preserve him from such their violence? Indeed we are ashamed and blush, that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> should out-goe any that beare the name of <hi>Protestants</hi> in duty and obedience to their King; that any whom this Church hath bred, should so desert their Soveraign in his danger (who hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected them in theirs) as that he should need the help of <hi>Papists:</hi> Sorry we are at the heart, that this occasion is given, to have any of another Religion to defend <hi>the Defender of our Faith,</hi> against the basenesse and violence of those persons, whom he hath defended in the profession thereof: but more of this here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                     <p>2. Concerning the <hi>Bloudy Tigres of Ireland,</hi> we doe abhorre<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> their Cruelties, and beleeve that <hi>their damnation sleepeth not,</hi> but shall in Gods due time over-take and over-whelme them: But we must adde farther, that the <hi>Tigres of England</hi> (even many of those whom they call the Parliament side) have been full as <hi>Bloudy;</hi> nay, more <hi>Bloudy</hi> and base then those of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who have persecuted with fire and sword, from among them, those only that were of a differing Religion and Nation, unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; but these here, have handled them of their own Country and Religion, after the same manner; never any <hi>Tygres</hi> so thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted after the Bloud of their nearest kindred and best friends as these in <hi>England</hi> have done; nor can any villany be named, that was acted by them in that Kingdome, which hath not been done and out-done by those in this; these also have raised a Rebellion against their Soveraigne, and in pursuance thereof, have <hi>killed, slaine,</hi> and <hi>destroyed,</hi> men, women, and children in some places where they have come; these also have stripped people of both Sexes naked, and then shut them up in Churches together, or other places, and afterward have come, and in a barbarous and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:29718:54"/>
beastly maner, have whipped and scourged them; these also have rosted Christians at the fire, and burnt them by piece-meales, their toes from their feet, and their fingers from their hands, striking up halfe a dozen Drums in the meane time, that the shreeks and cryes of the tormented, might not be heard, to move pitty in any towards them; (which was the custome of them in old time that Sacrificed Children unto <hi>Moloske</hi>) was it ever heard, that the <hi>Tigres of Ireland,</hi> or the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the <hi>Indies</hi> did ever act any such Cruelties, upon them of their owne Faith and Nation? Indeed modesty restraines from expressing all their doings: and did I delight to make men odious, as well as sinne; I could name the Persons, by whose Command and Authority, some of these things have been Acted, and the places where they have been done. And confident I am, if Master <hi>Fox</hi> were now alive, to search into all the places where these <hi>Parliament Tigres</hi> have come, and to write their doings; the volume would be three times as big as his former, and repleat with as Savage Actions, as ever yet were recorded by the Pen of Man: Onely this I must say further, I have not heard that the <hi>Tigres of Ireland,</hi> have shewn so much immediate spight against God and Christ, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molishing all markes of Christianity, in destroying, polluting, and defiling the Temples of Gods Worship, as these of <hi>England</hi> have done: tis true, we hear that since they have got our Churches into their possessions, they have in their superstitious way, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated them anew: And truely, had our <hi>Tigres of England</hi> been there, and used the Churches of that Kingdome, as they have done them in this; there had been great need of a <hi>new Consecration.</hi> Wherefore (concluding this particular) I will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly speak to these men, (who have thus mentioned the <hi>Tigres of Ireland</hi>) as our Saviour in the Gospell did to some of like Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. <hi>You Hypocrites, can you see Tigrely doings in your Brethren of Ireland?</hi> And can you not discern these more Tigrely and blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Actions which are committed by your selves? Amend first for shame your own doings, and then you may speak with more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit against the Evills of others.</p>

another, which shall do <hi>Parliamentary</hi> actions. Now the <hi>Works</hi> or actions of a Christian <hi>Parliament,</hi> are to <hi>Heal</hi> and not to make breaches in a Church or State; to <hi>settle</hi> Religion and peace, not to destroy either; to <hi>make</hi> and <hi>confirm</hi> good Laws, not to null them; to <hi>suppresse</hi> all sects and false opinions, not to give free liberty unto them; to <hi>consult</hi> for the Kings Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and dignitie, not to countenance and Authorize base Libells to his defamation; to <hi>advise</hi> for the wealth and flourishing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Subjects, not to impoverish, or to ruine them: these, and such like have been, and properly still are, the works of <hi>Parliaments;</hi> and to such conditioned <hi>Parliaments</hi> we are no enemies: we account a true <hi>Parliament</hi> our <hi>Palladium,</hi> the strength of the Kingdome; we have the same opinion of it, as the <hi>Trojans</hi> had of their <hi>Palladium,</hi> they held their City invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, so long as they kept their <hi>Palladium</hi> inviolate; so might our Nation have been reckoned, (under Gods protection) invincible, if these unhappy men, had not perverted the power and priviledges of that most <hi>High and Honourable Court:</hi> But (alas!) never was Noble Nation so abused, and destroyed as this is, and hath been, <hi>per Catulos istos Catilinarios,</hi> (I may truly call them,) who have been the instruments of infection to this so much desired meeting; who if the God of Heaven do not oppose and subdue, we are never like to have any more <hi>Parliaments,</hi> which is one of our greatest feares; if these men prevail, they will assuredly never have any above them, that shall call them to a reckoning, be they never so lascivious in evill, never so mischievous or destructive of good: Now must every one that disrelisheth the courses of this <hi>Parliament,</hi> be judged an Enemy to all <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments?</hi> Truly 'tis too unreasonable, too harsh a censure, but 'tis our Burden and we must bear it.</p>
                     <p>And yet this is not all, for we are sentenced to be <hi>Enemies of Reformation</hi> too, <hi>an Enemy to Parliaments and Reformation:</hi> But do these two go always together? May not a man possibly be a friend to the one, and no wel-wisher to the other? We have heard of some that have been well affcted to <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and yet not to <hi>Reformation:</hi> But this we apprehend is only added, to exasperate the peoples rage against us, that with the more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and speed they may dispatch us, as being Enemies to all

that good is.

His ful sense I suppose in those his expressions is, as if he had spoken more fully out thus: <q>My beloved Brethren, Gods word was indeed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, the rule and square to order your course by, and because therein you find no warrant to rebel against your King, to kil, slay, and destroy your Brethren, to go in such ways as the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament hath voted you shal go in, therefore some of you I see, are scrupulously fearful to lift up your hand against the King, or to cut the throats of all your Brethren that be not of your Opinion, &amp; to work a new-found Reformation by the Sword: but hereupon it is, that we have such a stoppage made in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> mercies, the Elect of God are stil kept out of their posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and the Land is yet ful of wicked men, and herein you shew your selves most weak and simple, that you do not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that God is weary of his ordinary manner of working, he sees it is impossible that his Children should have their hearts desires in this life, by going in that old beaten path, himself is not able to satisfie their lusts that way, and therefore he hath now at length better bethought himself, and left his old wont, is resolved to go an extraordinary way to work, which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver went in before, &amp; hath stirred up many extraordinary men, worthy members to that purpose; yea, and now he wil have his people cast his Word behind their backs, as a thing out of date to walk by, and look only unto <hi>extraordinary Lights and Revelations,</hi> that we their Teachers shal tel them of, and go only by them: and believe it, now God hath altered his mind, and course of working, 'tis plainly to tempt him, if you expect

                        <hi>wilful in enmity:</hi> yet whether it be out of our weakness of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or no, we leave it to reasonable men to determine: we the <hi>simple Brethren</hi> do confess that we believe it is possible that a man may suspect whether all these Papers, as they are here pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by his deadly enemies; were written by the <hi>Kings own hand</hi> or no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, and he may also absolutely deny that the <hi>Constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> and <hi>inferences,</hi> which they make out of them are <hi>just</hi> and <hi>right:</hi> and further he may declare and shew, that <hi>nothing in them is so blameable,</hi> as they would have the world believe, seeing they are <hi>against such</hi> unparalleld <hi>Rebels as they are;</hi> and notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, be free from any such <hi>enmity</hi> as they speak of. It seems their guilty consciences expected some such matter, and therfore they endevour so wel as they can (poor men) to answer for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, saying,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As to the first, know, that the Parliament was never yet guilty of</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Libell.</note> 
                        <hi>any such forgery, the King yet in all the Letters of his which have been intercepted, never objected any such thing, and we dare appeal to his own Conscience now, knowing that he cannot disavow either his own hand-writing, or the matters themselves here written, (All the Cyphers, Letters, all circumstances of time and fact, and the very hand by which they are Signed, so generally known, and now exposed to the view of all) wil aver for us, that no such forgery could be possible.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Their Argument, in these words unto the first, stands thus, If these Letters were not written with the Kings own Hand, then the Parliament should be guilty of <hi>forgery,</hi> but the Parliament was never guilty of such <hi>forgery. Ergo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Major in this Argument they take for true, but it is not currant, unless they wil prove that none had to do with these <hi>Letters</hi> but the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and that the publication of them was the Act of the whole Court; which we do not believe, because the end thereof, being (as was shewn before) only to defame and endanger the Kings Person doth speak it a work un-beseeming a <hi>Parliament</hi> consisting of Christian men, unless we take only a part for the whole; perhaps indeed it might be the Act of some amongst them, <hi>viz.</hi> of the prevailing Faction: but <hi>crimen paucorum diffundere in omnes,</hi> is not our custome.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="92" facs="tcp:29718:64"/>But their <hi>Minor</hi> only they prove, and that thus, <hi>If the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were guilty of any such forgery, then the King in some of his Letters, that have been intercepted, would have objected the same. But the King never objected any such thing, Ergo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this I answer: it would be as great a shame, if a whole <hi>Parliament</hi> should be guilty of forgery, as if it should be guilty of the forementioned <hi>Act</hi> of Authorizing this Libell: but yet some of the rotten <hi>Members</hi> thereof, <hi>(as they are men)</hi> may possibly be as guilty of the one, as of the other, <hi>for all men</hi> (say these) <hi>are subject to Errour.</hi> Nor is it an impossible thing to shew, that some of them have not dealt so sincerely, as became honesty: when they were yet in ways of entreaty, with their <hi>Associate</hi> Counties, for free benevolence, before they came to their week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Taxes and Contributions; some of them being sent by the rest into the Country, to pick their neighbours purses; whilest they have been perswading the poor Country-man to new Loanes and Charges, for the maintenance of this unchristian and unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural War; <hi>Providence</hi> (as must be pretended) did usually at the very instant time, send some Letter or other, wherein was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, (with thanks to the people for their former assistance) what a great Victory (by the help of God and them) the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> had lately obtained against the Kings Forces, with little or no loss to themselves: so that now <hi>the work was in a manner quite done, one Contribution more would finish the Business.</hi> These Letters were suspected, (even by the abused people themselves) to be but meer forgeries, devised on purpose to cozen them of their Monies, when afterward they understood there had been no such Victories at that time; verily those that dare belie Gods Providence, and forge Letters from that, may be suspected, wil be as bold with the King, in pursuance of their own designs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> (say they) <hi>if the Parliament were guilty of any such forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the King in his Letters, which have been intercepted, would have objected the same.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The word <hi>intercepted,</hi> might have been omitted, for if in any of the Kings <hi>Letters,</hi> which have by Accident come into their Hands, any such thing were objected, yea, and sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, yet we are confident of their wisdome so far, that we
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:29718:64"/>
dare say for them, they would never have divulged the same, nor suffered the world to know of it, if they themselves could help: But for their whole Argument 'tis only negative, and therefore weak and fallible. The <hi>King hath not accused them of forgery, Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> they are <hi>not guilty</hi> thereof, is no necessary consequent: There is many a <hi>Malefactor</hi> in the Kingdom, that deserves hanging<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet was never brought to his trial, is he therefore innocent? As it doth not follow, that they are most faulty, that are most ill spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of; no more doth it on the contrary, that they are most free from blame that are least taxed.</p>
                     <p>But if the King hath not objected <hi>forgery</hi> unto them, the more is his <hi>goodness</hi> and <hi>wisdome;</hi> he that desires peace with his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, is sparing, even in his just objections, that no obstruction be cast in by him, as a bar to union; whereas they that love strife, though themselves have already offered most wrong, yet are stil most ful of clamours; and when they can find no faults to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, they'l invent some to keep the fire burning: doubtless if the <hi>New great Seal</hi> be remembred, it must be acknowledged by all men, that the King hath had more cause to accuse them of <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery,</hi> then ever they had yet to Accuse him of <hi>Perjury;</hi> but by their own Confession we see, the King hath been more careful of their credit, then they have been of his Honour, or of their own Souls.</p>
                     <p>But being conscious of the weakness of their Argument, they hope to strengthen it with a second, which is <hi>nihil ad nos,</hi> as the other was <hi>nihil ad rem;</hi> 'tis their <hi>appeal to the Kings own Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, who</hi> (say they) <hi>cannot disavow his own handwriting:</hi> this may indeed be <hi>aliquid ad regem,</hi> but what is it to the Reader? Would they have every one in these Kingdoms, and beyond the Seas, (to whom they have dispersed these Copies) make a journy to ask the King, whether these Letters were of His own Hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting?</p>
                     <p>And to this second they adde a third, which is even like the former: they tel the Reader, that <hi>all the Ciphers, Letters, all the Circumstances of time and fact, and the very hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>by which they are Signed, so generally known, and now exposed to the view of all, will aver for them, that no such forgery could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e possible.</hi> And yet the Reader all the while sees nothing, but only that which comes
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:29718:65"/>
from the hand of the Printer, or did he see the very Cyphers or original Letters they speak of, were the hand wherewith they were Signed, exposed generally to the view of all, could all men know it to be the Kings; or swear it were nto forged? I suppose not, unless He had first submitted his faith and judgment to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve only, <hi>as the Parliament Voteth.</hi> In a word, I conceive that (not withstanding all they say to the contrary) they who <hi>forged the Kings Seal,</hi> may possibly <hi>forge Letters under the Kings Name.</hi> I do not Accuse any to have so done, only I speak thus, to shew that their Arguments are not so convincing as themselves think. <hi>Forgery</hi> in this case might be <hi>possible.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But they come to the second objection, which they believe may be made against their Notes upon these Letters, and say,</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>IF any shal dislike these <hi>Comments</hi> and <hi>Annotations</hi> upon the<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> Kings Letters, He is confuted in these words very substantial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for the Authors of them say, <hi>that they are all very good:</hi> and we know men can best judge of their own works, they can give the fairest interpretation of their own doings: the Crow can see beauty in her own bird, though none else can; so these men can see <hi>perspicuity</hi> and <hi>modesty</hi> in their own Notes; yea, so confident they are, that their sight is good, &amp; their judgment true, that they dare boldly conclude, <hi>there is no Common Justice or faith left amongst men, if all mankind be not of their Opinion in this particular.</hi> Was not this stoutly spoken? Are not these valiant men? We see they are resolved to hold their own, though all mankind say to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:29718:65"/>Truly upon this their commendation, their <hi>Notes</hi> have been read over again, and again; and I profess, I can see no <hi>perspicui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> at all in them, unless of spight and malice; which indeed I find set forth with the Highest and most transcendent impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy against Soveraign Majesty, as I believe ever Mankind saw: Nay, I dare affirm it, that never any <hi>Protestant Christian Subjects</hi> did discover the like, under Countenance of such an <hi>Authority</hi> as these pretend. And I require these boasters to shew but one word or expression, savouring of true <hi>modesty,</hi> and Christian <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence</hi> to their King, in all their <hi>Annotations:</hi> and I promise them it shal excuse with me a multitude of their other errours. Nay, let their own Consciences speak, concerning this perspicuity which they talk of; whether they did not on purpose transpose these <hi>Letters</hi> (in this their publication of them) inverting the Order wherein they were written, setting some that were first, last: and some that were last, first: that so their dependance upon each other being broken, they might be lesse perspicuous to the Reader: who might (had they all been placed in their right or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) with facility and clearness, have discerned the reasons of many expressions, which (without regard to their reference) may be apprehended in a worse sense, then they do naturally bear. They took all these <hi>Letters</hi> together by their own Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, why then must they place those writ in <hi>May,</hi> before them that were writ in <hi>March;</hi> and those in <hi>March,</hi> before those in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary?</hi> those of this <hi>Year,</hi> before those of <hi>last,</hi> or of the <hi>Year</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but only for the Reason forementioned? Had they studied to evidence that <hi>perspicuity</hi> they speak of, (if these <hi>Letters</hi> must needs have been printed) they would at least have placed them in that order, as they were sent from the King and Queen to each other. O but then, they would not have appeared so offensive, as now they hope they have made them to do, nor been so liable to sinister interpretations. Truly in this very thing, there doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to our apprehensions the <hi>perspicuity</hi> of their malice.</p>
                     <p>Which also is further manifested by their picking out here a Sentence, and there an Expression, from out these <hi>Letters,</hi> which being disjoynted from that which goeth before, and that which followeth in the same place, (and attended with their spightful gloss upon it) doth seem to be, what in its self 'tis not, (when read entire by a Christian Eye with its ful Coherence) wherein
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:29718:66"/>
they imitate that profane Atheist, who to prove his opinion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged that part of the Psalm, <hi>non est Deus,</hi> but left out the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding words, <hi>Dixit insipiens in corde suo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yea, and the <hi>perspicuity</hi> of their malice is seen more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yet, in their perverting his Majesties words to as bad a sense, as possible man or Devil could wrest them; to the end that none (if they can bring it to passe) might harbour a good thought of him: yea, they endevour so much as in them lies, not only to put all <hi>his Subjects,</hi> but even <hi>his own Child,</hi> into a way of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience against him; by that which they wrest in their <hi>Notes</hi> from the eleventh Paper. Yea, though they hate the <hi>Queen,</hi> with a most mortal, and perfect Hatred, (as appears sufficiently by their dealings with her) yet how doth it irk them that she <hi>loves</hi> her Husband, and how fain (out of their superlative malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him) would they break that bond of Affection between them, is evident by their publication of the 34. <hi>Paper,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth only a private business between them, (as Man and Wife) written of some 20. years ago, about the time of their first Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: were there nothing else to make the superfluity of their malice abundantly <hi>perspicuous,</hi> the divulging<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of that very Paper alone, (to the end for which they do it) were fully sufficient.</p>
                     <p>Thus we see their <hi>perspicuity,</hi> now for their <hi>modesty,</hi> which all but their own dear selves wil go near to suspect to be <hi>shamefull impudency.</hi> For</p>
                     <p>1. He whom they accuse and reproach is the Person, whom above all men in the world, they are bound in duty, and have so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly sworn to defend and honour; and is this <hi>modesty?</hi> then <hi>Ziba</hi> was a <hi>modest</hi> man for accusing his Master; and <hi>Absolom</hi> was a <hi>modest</hi> man for accusing the King his Father; and so was <hi>Shimei</hi> too, in his reproaching and accusing <hi>David</hi> his Lord and Soveraign.</p>
                     <p>2. They seek occasions of accusing, they <hi>search for iniquity,</hi> yea <hi>they have accomplished a diligent search</hi> in their reading his Letters,<note place="margin">Psal. 64. 6.</note> and in their sifting his Actions; and though they find no sufficient matter, yet they accuse; they <hi>pervert his words,</hi> and invent matter, like them that said, <hi>Come let us devise devices against him, and</hi>

                        <pb n="97" facs="tcp:29718:66"/>3. They accuse him for good, (wanting matter of evill to charge him withall) as <hi>for loving his Wife, for tendering her health, for desiring her welfare, for endeavouring his own defence, and the upholding of Monarchy,</hi> which God hath intrusted to him, and many such things of like nature, they heavily tax him withall: and what they want in <hi>weight,</hi> they make up in <hi>number;</hi> hoping that the blinde and seduced world will suspect, (at least) some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what amiss, when they heare him charged with such a multitude of accusations. And is this <hi>Modesty?</hi> then they in the 12. <hi>Psal.</hi> that resolved <hi>With our Tongues we will prevaile,</hi> were <hi>modest</hi> creatures.</p>
                     <p>4. They Accuse him for that which (themselves know) is most contrary to his nature and disposition; as <hi>of dissimulation, breach of Oath and promise,</hi> and <hi>aversnesse to the good and welfare of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi> whereas</p>
                     <p>To the first, they cannot deny that his plain-dealing hath affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to them their best advantage against him; what moved him to Signe <hi>that unhappy Bill</hi> for continuing the Parliament, but the sincerity of his spirit, in his conceiving them to be after his owne Heart, <hi>Honest men?</hi> but (as one of the crafty <hi>Members</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniously acknowledged) I <hi>confesse</hi> (sayes he) <hi>in that, we were too hard for him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To the 2. their owne Consciences can witnesse for him, that his constancy <hi>in keeping his Oath</hi> (made at his Coronation) to defend the Church of God in that estate of weal wherein he found it, (which they would force and compell him to break) hath been a chief cause of this great persecution stirred up against him.</p>
                     <p>And for the 3. their owne hearts will affirm, (if they would let them speak) that never Prince did more hunger and thirst after his peoples good then He, never did any further deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, then he hath done, as appeares <hi>Paper</hi> 25. or offer more of his owne undoubted rights to purchase their peace; never did tender <hi>Father</hi> look with a more dolefull eye, upon the miseries of his Child, then he upon the calamities of his Subjects: Nay, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was any abused Prince so unwilling to shed Rebellious bloud as he; with what sadness did he hear of those expressions of Joy, for his victory gotten at <hi>Stratton</hi> fight, <hi>Alas</hi> (sayes he) <hi>but</hi>

                     <p>5.

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:29718:68"/>
they hope, unlesse people will yeeld themselves, fooles and block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, such as have no understanding to perceive, what they read; they will all (out of hand) be of their opinion, and speak just as they do: for it may be a great shame to any body, not to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that, which these say is so <hi>perspicuous:</hi> Nor indeed will it be safe, for any that resolve to sleep in a whole skin, not to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of this matter, for it is concluded, by those of that side, <hi>to kill, slay, and destroy,</hi> at least to banish, and turn out naked, as men <hi>wilfull in Enmity, beyond the help of Miracles and Revelations,</hi> all such as are contrary minded unto themselves.</p>
                     <p>But suppose any body should be so impertinent, as to desire a further Testimony, of what they would have beleeved of the King, then these <hi>Papers</hi> doe afford?

                     <p>The reasons why they do not produce their full store, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive are two,</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>2.

                        <pb n="101" facs="tcp:29718:68"/>The way to maintain their own <hi>Reputation,</hi> is to <hi>Defame</hi> the King; to keep themselves up, is to keep Him down. In a troubled State all discontented persons, (whereof the land is ful) do natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally draw to the grieved party, even as humours in the Body to a sore place; wherefore if all the people of this Nation, (who have been wronged, peeled, and oppressed, by these mens meanes, since power hath been in their hands) were but well certified of the Kings Candour, they would all with one accord, (in conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of those unexpressible abuses offered unto Him) unite themselves in His behalf, &amp; joyn with Him against them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is great wisdome in these men, and their Masters, to do as they doe; and to conceal that which might hurt themselves if known. It may easily be gathered, from what they have said and shewn, that if they had any thing else, which could have been wrested possibly against the King, the world should have been made acquainted with that too: But because what remaines in their hands is <hi>intermixt with other matter of no pertinence for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication at this time,</hi> therefore it is thought fit to conceale the same, lest otherwise they should have played the fools, and done a prejudice unto themselves.</p>

                     <p>OUr Saviour in the <hi>Gospell</hi> forbids us to <hi>Judge</hi> our equals, we<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 1.</note> are confident: therefore he will never approve of us, if we take upon us to sentence our superiours; yea the Highest of all, our Soveraigne, who is Gods immediate servant, and with whom none but He, whose Title is, <hi>The onely Ruler of Princes</hi> hath to do: <hi>What hast thou to do, to censure another mans servant?</hi> (saies the<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 4.</note> Apostle.) And Saint <hi>James</hi> assures us, if we be <hi>masterly</hi> in that<note place="margin">Jam. 3. 1.</note> kind, we shall thereby <hi>increase onely our own damnation.</hi> But these men we see, teach us another lesson, for they tell us plainly in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; that if we be so nice, and scrupulous, as to give respect to Gods Word, in things of this nature, if we will not censure our King, as themselves doe, and condemne Him too, (upon their bare Testimony) of doing unbeseemingly, we are <hi>perfect Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants</hi> (that is to say) as compleat Devills, as any be in Hell: But truly we had rather they should call us <hi>Malignants</hi> for obeying our Lord Christ, then that Christ should call us <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,</hi> for our conforming to their example; as he doth some in the <hi>Gospell,</hi> who were of their Conditions; those that can see a <hi>Mote</hi> at a distance, can worst of all see a <hi>Beame</hi> neer at Hand; (as the Authour of truth and wisdome informes us.) And we observe in the <hi>Gospell,</hi> how they who could finde so much fault with the Son of God, for every thing he said or did, could see nothing amisse in themselves; no not when it was evidently shewn them; tis possible there may be such men alive now, that can see a <hi>fault</hi> in their <hi>Soveraigne</hi> where it is not, and none in

themselves, where are great plenty: But for our parts, we affect not to be of their number, our work lies most at home, and there we desire to be imployed: our studies are, to know and practice the <hi>Subjects Duty:</hi> the Prince his <hi>Actions,</hi> belong not to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition; we remember the Apostles precepts, <hi>Study to be quiet,</hi>

                     <p>Nay did we see in the King, what they say, (which we beleeve is not to be seen,) yet durst we not speak after their fashion, for <hi>we have not so learned Christ.</hi> If we have a warrant in Scripture to <hi>Judge</hi> any, it is onely those that <hi>censure</hi> others, and not them neither, but by their fruits, and in matters of our owne Alloy, which concern our own Cognizance, and wherein it becomes us to have skill and knowledge; and indeed upon this ground, we dare boldly say, what ever they tell us of, to be <hi>unbeseeming</hi> the King in <hi>these his Letters;</hi> we are certain in their <hi>Notes</hi> upon them, there is nothing to be found, but what is most <hi>unbeseeming</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and men that professe themselves Protestant Christians, (who have been so <hi>Sanctimoniously ingaged,</hi> with frequent spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall <hi>Vowes of Allegeance,</hi> and Loyalty to their Soveraigne, of affection, and duty to his Person:) this we are confident that none (unless their own dear selves,) will deny: For their <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations</hi> themselves do full loudly utter the same, <hi>in their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Language.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nay, we are perswaded the very <hi>men of Westminster</hi> would not deny this, were it not so much to the prejudice of their own <hi>Safety</hi> and <hi>Reputation</hi> to confess it; both which (indeed) are supported for the present, among many people, by this vilifying and slandering the King, insomuch that (doubtless) a kind of desperate necessity lyes upon them, to doe, and to countenance such things, as they have done. For (say thir sinfully-resolved Consciences within themselves)</p>
                     <q>Woe would be unto us, if the people whom we have Cozened of their wealth and peace, and got ingaged with our selves in this black Rebellion, (under pretence of Religion,) so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Christs Doctrine, should but at length, have a right ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of the Kings good spirit and disposition, they would reckon us the veriest Villaines upon Gods earth: yea
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:29718:70"/>
they would fall upon us, with one accord, and cut our throats to expiate their own guilt, and to recover peace to themselves and to the whole Nation, should they but know in truth, how we have used their <hi>Sovervigne.</hi> Wherefore we must be wise in time and look to our selves, <hi>Suprema tantum nos queant facere securos mala,</hi> our onely safety consists in acting the highest evils: We must <hi>slight</hi> Majesty, we must <hi>contemne</hi> Gods Image, and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daube</hi> his Annointed, with our bitterest inventions; we must <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert</hi> his words, and <hi>put</hi> the foulest gloss, and construction, that Hell can teach us to make, upon all that proceeds from him: and so we shall increase and continue that blinde and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly <hi>odium,</hi> which by our fine policy, we have already wrought in mens hearts against him: <hi>Imperium iis artibus retinetur quibus partum est,</hi> by lying and sland ring his foot-steps, we be began our matchless undertaking, and by the same meanes we must main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it: the Common sort having swallowed down our poyson already, if they be kept strictly to their diet, <hi>Mithridate</hi>-like, may live upon it, and adhere still unto us, untill we have quite destroyed him, whom we hate, with a perfect Hatred for those unsatisfiable wrongs, which our selves have done him: yea, and the people will think too, that they doe God good service in their helping of us, specially if we be but succesfull against him; and also by our following this course, we shall uphold our own Dignitie, and retaine the repute of Holy, and good men; all we do will be thought to be done out of zeal against sin, and out of pure love to our Countrey; we shall be looked upon as impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall men, that will wink at sin in no man; no not in the King himself: we will persecute and destroy him, (though he be our Common Parent,) rather then suffer sin to abide, and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neere in him: yea we shall be apprehended by the vulgar to be Gods speciall favourites, elected, and appointed by him on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, to punish the King, and to pull him from his Throne, that so Christ in us (the Saiuts) may be set up, and rule in his stead; And what ever the King suffers at our hands, shall be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, (by the helpe of our Preachers, men fitted for our turns,) to be Gods just judgement upon him, for those very crimes, which we lay to his Charge, as <hi>Perfidiousnesse,</hi> and <hi>Breach</hi> of speciall Vowes made to us, his Protestant Subjects of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                        <pb n="105" facs="tcp:29718:70"/>
and <hi>Scotland,</hi> for so we call our selves, and under that guize we goe covered.</q>
                     <p>No doubt, (I say) but the Consciences of those I mentioned, have spoken to this purpose within themselves, or else they would confess together with us, that there is nothing in those <hi>Annotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> upon the Kings Letters, but what is most uncomly, and misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming Christian subjects.</p>
                     <p>And truly it is no difficult matter for men resolved, and inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by all they care for, (bodily safety, and worldly reputation,) to deprave the most innocent writing, and to pick out matter thence to defame the Author: <hi>Julian the Apostate,</hi> (these mens elder Brother,) having a deep hatred against Christ, did imploy his maliciously-fine braine, against the <hi>Sacred Bible,</hi> and took great paines to cull out thence, all <hi>shews of errour,</hi> or places seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly contrary to each other, (which he would formalize to his own purpose;) all <hi>ambiguous expressions,</hi> (which he would wrest and pervert to the most sinister construction:) and all <hi>obscure places,</hi> (which by a further entangling he would make more dark and cloudy:) and thus for a season, (with some men) he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced Christ, and his Holy Religion. Now hence we gather, that if one man alone was able (by the helpe of Satan,) to do thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Sacred writings</hi> of God himselfe: It is no marvail if many of the same rank and spirit, laying their heads together, shall with the like assistance doe thus against the writings of the King, who is but a man: for as we doe not make our King <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,</hi> like as they do the Parliament, so we will not put His <hi>wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,</hi> into the same skale of perfection, wherein they weigh their <hi>Votes:</hi> But this we will say, (and from their Malice against him do firmly beleeve,) that he is a lesser sinner then other men are: for the more like in degree their spightfulness against him, is to that of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> against Christ, the more like unto Christ in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and Holiness, is our Soveraigne the object of it: <hi>That Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred which is most deep, and deadly</hi> (in such men as these are,) <hi>is alwayes the most unjust.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And further too, this we affirm concerning our Soveraigne, that of all the Kings His Predecessours, (that swayed the English Scepter, as he hath done,) we beleeve him to be the least sinfull; and we may conclude it, from the pride and fatnesse of these his
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:29718:71"/>
people, who <hi>Jessurun</hi>-like, have kicked up their Heeles against him; had he not been so good, so milde, so gentle towards them, they had not been so malipert, so proud, so injurious towards him: had he been a <hi>wanton Edward the fourth,</hi> and borrowed a pace the rich Citizens monies, and repayed them againe, by lying with their wives; or had he been a <hi>boysterous Henry the eighth,</hi> and chopt off his Subjects heads, in lust and anger; doubtless he had found much better respect and fairness, both of Carriage, and Language, from the men and women of this Nation: <note n="*" place="margin">That free &amp; famous City cannot say that the King in all his time did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver imprison so much as one Lord Major.</note> 
                        <hi>London</hi> had not shut up their Gates thus long against him; had he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served less love, they would have shewn more feare and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to him.</p>
                     <p>No man was ever so perfect, (Christ alone excepted,) but at some times have been guilty of some obliquities; which should they all, that were committed through his whole life, be muste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up, and presented in one view, and continuation together, would make him appeare most strangely sinful; whereas if his life were displayed, in that tenour onely as led, he would haply be an object of admiration, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Bishops</hi> were cryed out upon to be too <hi>Rigorous:</hi> but<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> hath not the carriages of that faction, (which the <hi>Bishops</hi> did op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) since they have gotten Head, largely acquitted them of that imputation, in the judgement of all wise men? surely they forefaw the mischief which we all now feel, and did labour (as became them in their places) to prevent the same: Perhaps eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them did not go the best way to work, nor did use such <hi>apt Instruments</hi> as the case and time required, I justifie no man in all particulars; and perhaps too, some of us, (who are now impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned, banished, and divested of all we have, by this <hi>Reforming</hi> Parliament) did in those dayes suffer more molestation from some of their unworthy Officers, then many of those did, who since that time have been most revengefull. Three factious fellows had their ears clipt, by the sentence of the Lords in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> and were set in the <hi>Pillory;</hi> and this was exclaimed upon for great cruelty in the <hi>Bishops,</hi> (because they (having been abused by them) did not beg their pardon;) but how truly their necks also deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>lter,</hi> hath well appeared by the late temper of their spirits; and the little good use they have made of that their too small, and gentle chastisement.</p>
                     <p>2. The <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> and high <hi>Commission</hi> were two great Eye-sores: for many great and heavy fines, were layd on men, (for their sins sake) in those Courts, by the Kings <hi>Nobles,</hi> and <hi>Judges;</hi> (some of whom are now great men with His greatest Enemies:) But how many of those fines did His Majesty in His tendernesse and goodnesse afterwards remit, or cause to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated? and since the people would so have it, He hath now
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:29718:72"/>
given way, (even before the Act of continuing the Parliament) that those Courts should be suppressed, and so be no more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive.</p>
                     <p>3. Many people of the Kingdome voluntarily departed hence to <hi>New-England,</hi> and this was pretended <hi>persecution,</hi> from some who differed in opinion from them (whom they called their <hi>Antichristian Enemies:</hi>) but now tis plainly apparent, (by that spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which stayed behind in some of their fellowes) that the true cause of their departure was only pride. In themselves, <hi>Cesar-like</hi> they could allow of no superiour, either in Church or State, <hi>no Bishop, no King:</hi> (perhaps, some of them might have tender Consciences through weaknesse or mis-information; and some of the plainer sort might be honest men, and went for company with the rest they knew not whither, in the simplicity of their Spirits.) But tis well known, they had all the countenance of the King and Councell, to further them in the <hi>voyage</hi> and <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;</hi> they carryed their Wealth and Goods with them, and had supply of relief sent them, continually from this Kingdome afterward, untill this Warre caused the returne of many of them, to help forward the destruction of their native soile and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Indeed some are of opinion, that they went to <hi>New-England,</hi> only to learn and inure themselves <hi>to shed mans bloud,</hi> (we hear of few of the Heathens converted by them, but of many masacred:) and by accustoming themselves to slaughter <hi>Infidells,</hi> they have learned without scruple to murder <hi>Christians,</hi> &amp; are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proficients then the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themselves, in destroying those of their own Nation and Religion. But (as was said) when they went first from hence, they were suffered to carry their wealth with them; they were not used as they and their faction use us, who now suffer at their hands, for our Conscience and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell sake: They take away all our goods, make us beggars, and then afterward, if they do not <hi>murder</hi> us, or <hi>starve</hi> us in prison, they <hi>banish</hi> us into strange and desolate places, with scarce cloaths on our backs to seek our fortunes.</p>
                     <p>4. Great Complaints also there was of <hi>monopolies;</hi> people payed an halfpenny more for a <hi>thousand of Pins,</hi> then they were wont to doe; and almost half a farding more, for <hi>a pound of Sope</hi> and Starch then in former times, when money was not so plentifull
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:29718:73"/>
and such like heavy grievances did mightily oppresse them; and made them weary of the Kings Government, because He did permit of such things. And yet the Excize upon bread and beer, and flesh and cloathes, and such like things as are sold in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket for mans use, or spent in families, was not then set up: the <note n="*" place="margin">Committee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Monopolizers</hi> durst not be so detrimental to the poor Subjects of this Kingdom, while the King had the sole power in His Hands: But since they got to be <hi>Members</hi> and <hi>Favourites</hi> of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they with their fellowes, have (<hi>Epimetheus</hi>-like) opened this <hi>Pandor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>5. But the greatest complaint of all, was <hi>Ship-money, Ship-mony,</hi> O that was a grievous burden indeed, not to be stood under, (for a twentieth Part, a fift Part, weekly Contributions, billetting of Souldiers, seizing on Rents, plundring of houses, cutting of throats, ravishing of women, deflowring of Virgins, and such like matters were not yet in fashion, nor yet felt or known by the people of the Kingdome; and therefore <hi>Ship-mony</hi> that was the <hi>great grievance.</hi>) But was not <hi>Ship-mony</hi> disputed and judged Legall before His Majesty did require it? And when he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, did He spend it in Luxury upon Himself, or unprofitably to the damage of His Subjects? Was it not imployed for the dignity and preservation of the Nation? Were not the <hi>Ships</hi> (built therewith) the strength of the Kingdome? Were we not by meanes of them, become formidable to all about us? Surely from hence it was, that our Merchants sailed with more freedom at Sea; and their Factors did negociate with more success and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard abroad; hence it was that the inhabitants by the <hi>Sea Coasts,</hi> slept more securely in their beds, the worshipers of <hi>Mahomet</hi> durst not revell so neere them, nor venture to steal their Children from them, <note n="*" place="margin">26. Children taken at once by the Turkes from off the Coasts of Cornwall, July Anno 1645.</note> as alas, of late dayes they have done: In a word, by the meanes of those ships, (had they still continued under the Kings Command) all our poor Christian Brethren had been pulled ere this, out of Bondage and Slavery from <hi>Turkish</hi> Dens,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:29718:73"/>
(through Gods assistance) as diverse of them before had been: yea, and (as was noted before) all the people of this Kingdome had been interested in that so Pious and Christian a work, by such their Contributions of <hi>Ship-money:</hi> yet this was it they called their <hi>great grievance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus I have shewn in brief, the main things, for which the King was clamoured against at large: Now let all the world speak, whether the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> were unhappy under his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, whether in the whole course of his Reigne, he hath not approved himself <hi>a Defender of the true Faith, a tender Father of his Country, and sincerely affected to his Protestant Subjects:</hi> And whether these men be not highly ingratefull both to God and him, for their suggesting the Contrary.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>But considering him withall to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="112" facs="tcp:29718:74"/>
we are confident, (if we did see any thing <hi>unbeseeming</hi>) that we are not bound to say we saw it: or to tell others of it; nor doe we indeed hold it lawfull, but rather to hide it, or to make the best of it. <hi>Apelles</hi> was not bound openly to paint <hi>Alexanders</hi> skar, it was allowable for him, to lay his finger on it: nor was that other <hi>Painter</hi> obliged plainly to paint <hi>Alphonsus</hi> wry necked, it was lawfull for him to make it so, as if he were looking up to Heaven; for <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Alphonsus</hi> were both Kings, and so is <hi>Charles,</hi> and by Gods grace shall still continue so to be, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight of all opposers.</p>
                     <p>But in our view of these his Letters, we finde that which we conceived might have made their hopes desperate of doing his Majesty hurt by their publication of them: and surely (we think) had not their confidence been great in that strong <hi>infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> which they suppose their own <hi>Notes</hi> upon them, doe carry with them; the world had never seen them: for whereas hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, their endeavours were, to darken, and disparage the <hi>intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall</hi> vertues of their Soveraigne, (and peradventure his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties easiness at first, in beleeving them to be <hi>Honest men,</hi> upon their Religious <hi>Pretences</hi> and <hi>Protestations,</hi> gave too great a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance to that designe, <hi>David</hi> upon like grounds was so decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in <hi>Achitophel.</hi>) But now these his <hi>Letters</hi> have quite dampt that business, for they discover in him such <hi>Strength</hi> of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, such <hi>Abilities</hi> of minde, and <hi>Dexterity</hi> of parts, that we are confident in this their divulging of them, an everlasting check is given to that malignant Accusation. And now his <hi>Morall Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi> onely are the <hi>Objects</hi> of their spleene, which by their tongues and pens, they hope to blemish and defile, and from these his <hi>Letters,</hi> they hope somewhat may be made use of to their assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. But what that <hi>Somewhat</hi> is, will be seen hereafter: In the mean time, I shall be bold to propose a word of advice to the Readers of these <hi>Letters,</hi> to be observed by them in their peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall of them: For as my <hi>Duty</hi> doth constraine me to defend my Soveraigne, so my <hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> doth perswade me to advise my Brethren, for their good: though I know the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies think to scare me and all men else, with the name of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants</hi> for performing either: these men in their impudent <hi>Notes</hi> have one speciall passage, (amongst others,) to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:29718:74"/>
this purpose, (<hi>Page</hi> 46.) Their words are these,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The King wil declare nothing in favour of his Parliament, so long</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Libell.</note> 
                        <hi>as he can find a party to maintain him in his opposition, nor perform any thing, which he hath declared, so long as he can find a sufficient party to excuse him for it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We guess to what purpose this is spoken, <hi>viz.</hi> To intimate that all such, who (out of <hi>conscience</hi> or duty) shal indevour to <hi>vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> the King from their unjust Caluminations, and to preserve people from their snares, shal be accounted <hi>Maintainers of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,</hi> and <hi>excusers of sin;</hi> and as such persons they intend either secretly, or publickly to murder and massacre them: But we hope, (through Gods good grace) that neither their tongues nor their swords, shal ever terrifie us from discharging our Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and we are confident that our God, whom we serve, who is the <hi>God of Peace and Truth,</hi> wil witness for us, that we neither delight in <hi>maintaining strife,</hi> nor yet in <hi>excusing sin.</hi> And for this <hi>advise</hi> which shal be propounded, let the Readers examine it, by the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and if it be not agreeable unto that, let no man follow it, or regard it: It is this,</p>
                     <p>If they meet in these <hi>Letters</hi> with any thing, which (in their<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> apprehensions) seems to speak a failing on his Majesties part, in performing what he had formerly promised, (which indeed is one main thing that these <hi>King-accusers</hi> labour to fasten up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Readers faith) before they imitate these his Enemies, and passe a sentence peremptory, and condemnatory against their Soveraigne, let them but consider of these three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                     <p>1. Whether the King was <hi>Able</hi> to keep his word, in those things wherin he is apprehended to have failed? whether the cause of that failing, was not rather <hi>Lack of power,</hi> then want of wil? and whether his dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oyal Subjects, (who are most apt to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse him) were not they that <hi>robbed</hi> him of his power, and on set purpose, do stil detain it from him? Our observation of them hath been this, They wanting matter to make their King odious to the world, (as they desire he should be) did labour all they could to disable him, from doing as he had said and purposed; that so they might (upon his failing) have some pretence, to tel the people, he was <hi>perfidious,</hi> and a <hi>Promise-breaker.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:29718:75"/>2. Whether the Kings promises when first made, were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended performable only upon the <hi>Condition</hi> of their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> who now tax him; and whether they have performed their duties in those particulars: we conceive that as Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, so the Kings, are made upon such supposals. <hi>If ye be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Isa. 1. 19, 20.</note>

                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 15. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>walk contrary unto you.</hi> If the Kings <hi>promises</hi> should be more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute then Gods, they might be sinful; and so a sin, to keep them, though he had <hi>power:</hi> beside, <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> doth not only make people capable of the thing promised, but doth also inable the party promising to make his intended goodness mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest. It is said that <hi>Christ could do no mighty works,</hi> (in a certain<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 58.</note> 
                        <note place="margin">Mark 6. 5.</note> place) <hi>because of the peoples unbelief.</hi> Did mens unbelief weaken Christs hands, and can it strengthen those of the King? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no man can justly tax the King of any breaches in this kind, unless they can shew, that his <hi>promises</hi> were absolute, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding their <hi>continuation</hi> in Rebellion and opposition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him; or at least can name some one particular of them, (for which they took his word and waited on him, in the way of obedience) which he did not perform to the uttermost of his power.</p>
                     <p>3. Whether those men (who take such pains to have the King, accounted it in the world a <hi>Promise-breaker</hi>) be themselves free from the same crime; whether they have been precise, and punctual, in keeping all their <hi>Oaths, Promises,</hi> and <hi>Protestations</hi> made unto the King: If not, it may be suspected that their <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,</hi> is greater then their <hi>Honesty;</hi> and that they hope to cloud their own fault, by means of this dust which they raise against the King; as conceiving that men wil not be so <hi>uncivil,</hi> as to think them guilty of that which with so much mouth, and fieri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Spirit, they censure in the King. And yet (verily) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are of opinion, that it cannot be shewn, from any story, that there was ever a like pack of perfidious wretches, under the cope of Heaven, professing the Christian Protestant Religion, that have broken more <hi>Oaths</hi> of Allegeance, <hi>Bonds</hi> of obedience, and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:29718:75"/>
                        <hi>Protestations</hi> of Loyalty then these have done.</p>
                     <p>Again, I do further advise the Readers, that if (from any<note place="margin">2.</note> passages in these Letters) they shal conceive, they see in the King some failing, concerning his trust, and dependance on God; that he doth not so totally cast himself upon his strength and providence, as in their thoughts, it be seemeth the <hi>Anointed</hi> of the Lord; and as at the beginning of his troubles he resolved to do, but seems to look out for other helps, as of <hi>Forreiners,</hi> and people of another <hi>Religion,</hi> which (in their apprehensions) is not so proper for him (a <hi>Protestant</hi> Prince) to make use of: Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they passe a rigorous censure against him, (after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of these men) Let them also consider of these three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                     <p>1. That the King is in the state of <hi>Mortality,</hi> and so hath frailties in him as wel as others: Nor was it ever known, that <hi>Faith</hi> was at all times alike strong, and lively in the best believers; somtime they have relied wholy upon God: but somtimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain they have been ful of doubtings, specially when afflictions have bin hard upon them, and God seemed <hi>to stand afar off. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> at some time thought that God had quite <hi>cast him off, and</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ps. 13. 1, 2. &amp;c.</note> 
                        <hi>forgotten him;</hi> though somtime again, he could say, that <hi>God was his salvation;</hi> and when <hi>Peter</hi> that great Apostle felt himself sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,<note place="margin">Mat. 14. 30.</note> his <hi>Faith failed him:</hi> Now considering how tedious, bitter, and heavy the Kings afflictions have bin, we (who are more frail) should rather magnifie and admire the strength of Gods grace in him; that hath supported him so far, and so long, then condemn him for his weakness; the best of us, (perhaps) had despaired, and bin distracted or dead long ere this, under the like continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a far lesse burden.</p>
                     <p>2. That necessity is a Tyrant, and forceth men beyond their wils, and purposed inclinations, and therfore <hi>Seneca</hi> wel, <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num imbecillitatis nostrae patrocinium necessitas, quae omnem legem frangit,</hi> it breaks all laws, and resolutions, and thrusts a man with a kind of Authority into by-paths: it did <hi>David,</hi> when (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing Gods particular promise to settle him in the Throne of the Kingdom, and after a large and frequent experience of Gods delivering him from <hi>Sauls</hi> rage) he said, <hi>I shal one day</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Sam. 21. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>perish by the hand of Saul;</hi> and thereupon used (that which is
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:29718:76"/>
now counted an indirect mean) for his preservation, the help of <hi>Forreiners,</hi> and men of another Religion: He sought protection from <hi>Achish</hi> king of <hi>Gath;</hi> and indeed behaved himself in his court (being there also put to his shifts) somwhat unseemly. And<note place="margin">Gen. 12. 12.</note> so <hi>Abraham</hi> notwithstanding God had promised him his special guard, wherupon he had the more reason to be confident, and to<note place="margin">Gen. 20. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> depend upon him, yet being in a strait, to save his life, used an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct mean two several times, and hazarded the loss of his <hi>Wives</hi> Honour.</p>
                     <p>Our King hath had no such personal and special promises of Gods preservation, as those holy men had, therfore if he had bin so weak in faith, (as some wil happily apprehend him) yet had he shewn himself therein, but <hi>the son of David,</hi> the son of <hi>Abraham.</hi> It would doubtless better become the best of us, to pray with the<note place="margin">Psal. 125. 8.</note> Psalmist, <hi>Let not the rod of the wicked, lie alway upon the back of the Righteous, lest the righteous put forth his hand unto wickedness;</hi> then to condemn or censure a righteous Prince, for his putting forth his hand for <hi>forrein</hi> help, in a cause of this nature, when he is in danger to be deprived both of life and Kingdom: but more of this hereafter.</p>
                     <p>3. Let it be remembred how highly guilty of hiring, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polying <hi>forrein</hi> aid, these his Accusers with their faction are, who oppose his Majesty: notwithstanding that great strength of ships, arms, wealth and men, which are at home under their Command, they have the aid of all men, whomsoever they can get or hire, to help them in spoyling the King, they called in the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nation to this purpose, and it is wel known by divers where <note n="*" place="margin">In Cornwall when Essex his Army was there defeated by his Majesty.</note> neer thirty of their men being at once taken together Prisoners, were found upon examination to be of six several Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and all Papists: wherfore then, may not the King fight with his Enemies at their own weapons, and oppose strangers to strangers, Papists to Papists? Is it so great a sin in him to use such men, and are they no whit to be blamed for the same thing? may not he with as much dependance upon God, do in his necessity, what they do in the midst of plenty? may they imploy <hi>forrein</hi> aid to thrust him out of his inheritance, and may not he with as good leave make use of the like, to keep the possession of what God hath given him? surely upon this consideration, if the King

for his part, be worthy of <hi>censure,</hi> they also deserve a portion of the same <hi>Condemnation:</hi> no honest man but is of this judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>This is that advice which I propound to the indifferent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and which I conceive to be most agreeable to Christs Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel: if they now please to follow it, they may (through Gods blessing) not only be kept out of a sinful path, but also have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter satisfaction, in the matter discoursed upon, then they are likely to receive from these <hi>Annotators,</hi> whom I write against; for these High-boys say plainly, that all such who are not of their opinion, are <hi>perfect Malignants, and not worthy of any reply or satisfaction,</hi> at all in this point, <hi>viz.</hi> at their hands. And they further proceed, saying,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Our Cause is stil the same, as it was when the King first took Arms,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Libell.</note> 
                        <hi>and as it was when the King made most of these Oaths and Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Our three Propositions concerning the</hi> Abolition of Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>the</hi> Setling the Militia <hi>of the three Kingdoms in good hands, by the advise of Parliament, the</hi> Vindication of the Irish Rebels <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all our main demands at the Treaty in</hi> February <hi>last, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the Propositions sent in</hi> June 1642. <hi>before any stroak struck wil bear us witness, that we rather have straitned, then enlarged our Complaints. But were our case altered, as it is not, or were we worse Rebels then formerly,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>These words are added to evidence their former, And the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in them stands thus,</p>
                     <p>If our Cause be stil the same as at the Beginning, and our selves as bad Rebels as we were at first, then the King is such a one as we do repute him, <hi>or would have him believed to be, and those that think better of him are perfect Malignants, and as unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of future satisfaction, as we judge them;</hi> But our Cause is stil the same, <hi>as it was at the first, and we are as bad Rebels as at the beginning,</hi> Ergo.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> in this syllogisme we shal easily grant: But did we not understand how unworthy we are in their account of any reply, we should be bold to deny the <hi>Major:</hi> For we conceive not, how either the <hi>unalterableness</hi> of their <hi>Cause,</hi> or their <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency</hi> in maintaining it, can prove the King (who opposeth both it and them) to be as they report him. Indeed if their <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports</hi>

of him were of a clean contrary nature to what they are, the Argument might wel stand, for the longer he perseveres to resist Rebellion, and rebellious men, the more fully doth he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove himself according to his Title and Profession, The <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of the true Faith, and a tender Father of his Country;</hi> for the <hi>continuance</hi> of their cause, and of them in their way, speaks a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,</hi> if not an <hi>increase</hi> of their <hi>strength,</hi> and this must needs infer a <hi>decrease</hi> of the Kings Power, because what they have is taken from him: and the Kings weakness affords an opportunity of shewing his own true worth. He being debarred of outward assistance and supportments, is separated from that, which makes disfigured Monsters look handsomly. <hi>Patience</hi> is a more substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial virtue then <hi>temperance,</hi> and he that endures famishing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out alteration, hath more virtue, then he that comes from a feast without a surfeit.</p>
                     <p>But I wil not spend words to them that list not to reply, wherfore desiring all men to observe the simpleness and insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of their Argument, for the proof of what they would have it; I shal shew the reason why their Cause is stil the same as at the beginning, when the King first took up Arms in his own defence.

                     <p>At which time to disswade (if possible) from this un natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral War, which he saw they did intend, (and foresaw, would be destructive to his poor Subjects) the King endevoured to heal their ulcered minds with all <hi>Princely favours,</hi> and true shews of trust; to which purpose, he made many of those promises, which they reckon up (in a reproachful way, as not performed by him) at the end of their notes; and wanting other means to manifest further the <hi>reality</hi> of his heart, in those his professions, (they having robbed him of all his power) he did for their very sakes, (that they might have the more assured confidence) confirm his <hi>promises</hi> with an <hi>Oath;</hi> but they being otherwise resolved (as now appears) would themselves believe neither; nor would they (so much as in them lay) suffer any others to credit any thing which the King did say or swear.

his sincere and good intentions. Indeed because they were but <hi>new State-men,</hi> many of us thought it rather an <hi>ignorance</hi> in them of wars miseries, then any <hi>resolved purpose</hi> of acting <hi>Nero,</hi> in destroying their own Mother <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Nation,</hi> which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them at first to take up Arms; for though an easie Capacity might foresee that they could do nothing by such an enterprise, but increase their own sins, and the sins of the Kingdom; yet we were willing to lend what <hi>charity</hi> we could to the worst handed undertaking; but their persistency in their savage course makes us now fear, that even <hi>Ahab</hi>-like they strook at first of all, a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Hel it self, and <hi>sold themselves to work wickedness.</hi> But (alas, alas!) besides their losse of Christ and God, what wil they purchase hereby to themselves? not the Titles of <hi>Fathers of their Country,</hi> as they might have done, had they behaved themselves accordingly, and believed their Soveraign: But <hi>Masters of a slaughtery</hi> wil they be called, because they delight so much in the <hi>slaughtery</hi> of mankind: Posterity wil judge them to have bin Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans <hi>darlings</hi> in their generation: the <hi>fore-men</hi> of his shop, whom he imployed to act his most glorious <hi>Stratagems,</hi> his <hi>generosa sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lera,</hi> his choicest villanies; his <hi>divina mysteria iniquitatis,</hi> his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine mysteries of iniquity: Indeed they have (<hi>Manasseh</hi>-like) fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led<note place="margin">2 King. 21. 16.</note> the Nation with innocent bloud, and made the whole Land a<note place="margin">2 Cor. 23. 12.</note> very <hi>Acheldama</hi> or field therof: And oh that it would please the Judge of all the world to deal with them, as he did with that <hi>Manasseh,</hi> bring them into Bonds and Chains, that so if possible they might be humbled, as he was, before they go hence and be no more; but I return to them.</p>
                     <p>It is yeilded (as they see) that 'twas the truth they spake, when they said, their <hi>Cause was stil the same, as when the King first took Arms, and as when he made most of his Oaths and professions.</hi> And so in like sort is our God the <hi>same</hi> stil, as when the King was first at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and there set up his Standerd: But they tel us further, to their former purpose, that <hi>their demands at the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in</hi> February, <hi>were no other then those sent in</hi> June, 1642. <hi>before any stroke struck.</hi> Which Argument they repeat over the second time, in the 53. Page of their notes, to the same end also; <hi>our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi> (say they) <hi>at Uxbridge in February</hi> 1644. <hi>were the very same as they were in</hi> June 1642. (indeed they are as bold, as high,

as unreasonable to the full: <hi>Ergo,</hi> (say they,) <hi>The King hath no reason to look upon us now, any otherwise then as he did then.</hi> All this is very true; who denyes it? these men (sure) love to dispute with their own shadows: The King had cause to look upon them then, as he doth now; though now he hath cause to express him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self further against them, then he did then: It is the course which God himself takes when people Rebell against him: He endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours at first to reduce them by promises, and allurements unto obedience; but if they slight, and contemn these, and oppose him the more for his lenity and goodness, he then useth to express himself with more wrath and severity against them, and hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for it, we doe not apprehend that the King can transgress, (whatever these wise men say,) so long as he walks in the way of God; though he did not call them by their proper name at first, yet now he may.</p>
                     <p>But for this their Argument, which they seeme (by their often use of it) to be so proud of; had they any true touch or tast of Christianity in them, they would blush to use it.

                        </gap>ful as high, full as unreasonable; and is this to their commendation? Is it to their praise, that the shedding of so much Christian bloud, hath wrought no <hi>Remorse</hi> at all in them? no obedience at all to Gods word, (which commands, <hi>if possible, to live peaceably with all men?</hi>) no <hi>submission</hi> to their King, who hath so often wooed them with the tenders of mercy, and pardon to be quiet? No <hi>Humanity,</hi> no <hi>Piety</hi> to their poor native Countrey, that lyes a bleeding to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction? is this a matter to be gloryed in now, that they are still as stiffe as ever? as far from practicing the first lesson in Christs Schoole, (the point of self-denyall,) as if they had never heard one word of Christianity? surely this their glory will one day be their shame; and God grant it may so be, before the great day, that then (if possible) they may find mercy.</p>
                     <p>Truely this their impenitency, and hardnesse of heart, may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us great matter of Admiration; that neither all the bloud that is shed, nor Gods protection of the Kings person among so many treasons and dangers; from their malice, and against such multitudes of men, who both by secret treacheryes, open Hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lityes, foul mouthes, black pens, and bloudy hands, have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured

                     <p>Indeed (they say) they <hi>have rather straitned then enlarged their Complaint,</hi> (of which this their libellous, and defamatory book is a sufficient witnesse) their propositions also they have straitned from 19, to 3. but it is <hi>proportione Arithmeticâ non Geometricâ,</hi> for these three containe in them fully as much as those 19, and more if possible.

Or was their work ever approved with a like measure of Gods blessing? Hath ever any one Church since the Ascension of our Saviour, brought forth in four-score years space, so many learned men, defenders of <hi>verity,</hi> and oppugners of <hi>Antichristianity?</hi> So many able Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and expounders of holy Writ? so many knowing Christians, and well gifted people of all sorts, as the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath done, under the Government of <hi>Episcopacy?</hi> And must it now be <hi>abolished</hi> in all haste? For what causes I pray? Pretences they have, which we will first consider on; and their true reasons af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.</p>
                     <p>1. They say, because tis <hi>Impious, Unlawfull</hi> and <hi>Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an:</hi> Were then those Martyr Bishops, <hi>Cranmer, Ridly, Hooper, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer, Farrer,</hi> all <hi>Antichristian?</hi> Were <hi>Jewell, Downam, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews, Abbot, King,</hi> and many others of that Order, (that writ against Antichrist) all themselves <hi>Antichristian?</hi> Must Gods Wisdome now receive a check for suffering his Church to flourish thus long under a Government <hi>Antichristian?</hi> Will this new Generation undertake to teach the Almighty also, to rule his
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:29718:80"/>
Flock and Family, (better then He hath hitherto done) by their <hi>Abolition of Episcopacy?</hi> Indeed some of them have taught, that <hi>Hierarchie</hi> it self was <hi>Antichrist,</hi> though <hi>Scripture</hi> speaking of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, calls him <hi>a man of sin;</hi> not <hi>a sinful Order,</hi> (if <hi>Hierarchy</hi> were any such thing) but no marvail that those who think they can teach God himself, do take upon them to contradict the <hi>Scripture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>O but</hi> (say they) <hi>the Romish Religion is Antichristian, and the Government of that Church is by Episcopacy:</hi> And yet this <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is more Ancient then that <hi>Religion</hi> (as now professed) and therefore that <hi>Religion</hi> cannot make it <hi>Antichristian:</hi> Nor is that Church <hi>Antichristian</hi> because of that <hi>Government;</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because the <hi>precepts</hi> of men there, (like our <hi>Ordinances</hi> of Parliament here) are preferred before the Word of God. The <hi>Bishops</hi> there are called <hi>Antichristian,</hi> because (like our <hi>men of Westminster</hi>) they are such abrogators of, and such dispensers with Gods Lawes, and such tyrannous exactors and importuners of their owne: Because (like them) they are (or have been at least some of them) so treacherous in their pretences, so barbarous in their executions, so contrary in their doings, to the meek and milde Doctrine of Christs <hi>Gospell,</hi> breathing forth cruelty, fire and sword against those that are not of their own opinion, though no otherwise offending them, then in their desiring to amend them: Because they are in their conditions, so like unto those that would from amongst us <hi>abolish Episcopacy,</hi> therefore are the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> in the Romish Church called <hi>Antichristian,</hi> and for no other reason.</p>
                     <p>Their Second Argument or pretence why <hi>Episcopacy</hi> must be<note place="margin">2.</note> 
                        <hi>Abolished,</hi> is, <hi>because</hi> (say they) <hi>all other Reformed Churches have abolished Bishops, and till we have abolished them too, Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation will not be perfect in this Nation.</hi> This Reason is false; Or were it true, yet the conclusion from it, is most untrue: The Churches in <hi>Denmark, Swevia,</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi> do retaine <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> after the manner of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Russian</hi> Churches, and those of <hi>Africk,</hi> and the <hi>Easterne</hi> Countries. And for those parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches that have abolished that <hi>Government,</hi> it is first to be enquired, (before there be a conformity to their practice) whether therein they have done well, or no, and whether since that time, they have thrived better without it, then we have done

that have enjoyed it. If it be remembred, what is recorded to be said, at the meeting at <hi>Dort</hi> to our English Divines, by some of them, that were sent thither from those other <hi>reformed Churches,</hi> concerning their own unhappiness, in respect of the want of such an <hi>Episcopal Government</hi> as ours was, and concerning our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches felicity in its enjoyment therof; perhaps it would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that this similitude aymed at with other Churches, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in misery and imperfections, and that those other so admired Churches come short of ours, in perfection of <hi>Reformation,</hi> and not ours of them; and of this opinion (doubtless) were those wise and learned Divines of the Religion (as they are called) in <hi>France,</hi> who petitioned the Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> (as I have heard credibly reported) that they might be permitted to have Bishops over their Congregations; But he answered, <hi>No, for then you would have at least the face of a Church among you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That learned Gentleman Sir <hi>Edwin Sands,</hi> tels us in his <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropae Speculum, that the Papists are more awed with the Reformation of Religion in</hi> England, <hi>then with that in any other Country, and have bin</hi> (says he) <hi>more busie in their attempts against our Church, as conceiving it to be most perfect of any other, in regard of that peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and orderly alteration introduced therein, which was not</hi> (says he) <hi>in a tumultuous headlong way, as was that in other Churches, but by the general consent of the Prince and Realm, representatively as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled in solemn Parliament, as also in regard of the continuation of the Government by Bishops, and vocation of Ministers, which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate weakness of other Churches did not retain, or rather the violent wickedness of profane men, (coveting the Churches possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) would not suffer.</hi> Thus he.</p>
                     <p>But now we have (amongst our selves) some above-board, who (it seemes) are resolved, though with the destruction of Church and Kingdome, to free the <hi>Papists</hi> from their Ancient dread; they will have all things here, as they are and have been in other Churches: that former <hi>orderly Reformation,</hi> which did so awe the Adversary, shall be over-done, and made perfect by an heady <hi>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous innovation;</hi> our Government by Bishops shall be quite <hi>abolished</hi> even <hi>root</hi> and <hi>branch;</hi> and all the Churches Revenues shall be imployed to prophane uses; that so we may be fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to other <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> this is the issue of their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Argument.</p>

                        <hi>abolished, because they have been (specially of late) such enemies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and Persecutors of Gods People, viz.</hi> those of their Faction. For (as if they were all Kings of <hi>China</hi>) they ingrosse to themselves the title of <hi>Filios Coeli,</hi> Gods Children, Heires of Heaven, with exclusion of all, that be not of their opinions, I pray God they may prove so at last: but as yet (sure we are) their actions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim them to be <hi>Filios inferni</hi> rather.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Bishops,</hi> in regard of their office and place in the Church, were bound in Conscience, as they would answer it to God and the King, to suppresse <hi>Schisme,</hi> to keep down <hi>Faction</hi> and <hi>Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and to punish those that were <hi>Seditious;</hi> and they apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (from some strange positions vented in Pulpits, and from the refractorinesse which they found in some spirits, unto the Government established) that some great mischief was in hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, did endeavour to hinder the sowing of that seed, which hath brought forth these bitter fruits, which now (alas!) this whole Nation feeds upon, and weepes under. Now because they would not sleep, and suffer those <hi>envious ones</hi> to scatter their tares into peoples Hearts, so quietly as some desired, therefore they open the mouth against them, as against the Enemies and Persecutors of Gods People. Perhaps (as was said before) every particular of the Bishops might not be so wary and considerate, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of what they did, as had they known the event of things they would have been: and perhaps too, they imployed some persons of too course or base an Alloy, to act in the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, who pulled up <hi>Wheat</hi> and <hi>Tares</hi> together, or peradventure sometime, and in some places the <hi>Wheat</hi> alone, and not the <hi>Tares</hi> at all; and so the Bishops good intendments became scandalous, by the ilnesse of their instruments: But I beleeve now, (experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath taught it to all sober men) that it will be confessed, the <hi>Bishops</hi> were not such great persecutors of Gods People, or <hi>Hunters of Christs Flocke</hi> as was so loudly voyced, but rather <hi>good Shepheards</hi> that endeavoured to keep under those ravenous wolves, who now so much destroy it.

                     <p>So they say: And the Warre they have raised to punish <hi>Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents,</hi> doth sufficiently discover their <hi>brotherly way:</hi> but not to insist upon that; let us consider how well they have begun to put their <hi>discipline</hi> in execution with particulars.

                     <p>And 2. how <hi>Ecclesiastically</hi> have they dealt with him now also, in their divulging these his <hi>Letters,</hi> whereby they have done their worst to make him accounted an <hi>Heathen</hi> and <hi>a Publican,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever so much as the least hint or <hi>brotherly Admonition</hi> before hand. But perhaps they'l say the King is a singular person, and considering the state of opposition, wherein at this present he stands with them, (or they with him;) he is not worthy or capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any such respect at their hands. Let us consider therefore, how fairly they have proceeded with others, and how according unto <hi>Discipline.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to this purpose let us but remember one particular which was before mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> how at their first meeting, when they took from the Bishops power of punishing sinne; they

made a kinde of a publick, <hi>O yes,</hi> to the whole Kingdome, and put the same in print, that none might plead ignorance of it, and sent it into all parts and corners of the Land; whereby they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited all the <hi>Raskality</hi> of the Nation, to bring up to <hi>Westminster</hi> all the complaints they would or could against the <hi>Ministers of Jesus;</hi> which were there received with all alacrity and cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, though never so false or so malitious: and in their open <hi>Committees,</hi> the man in the Chaire would give the Title of <hi>Sir,</hi> and <hi>Master</hi> at every word to the basest beggerliest villaine, that had but the fore-head to come before them, and act the Devills part against his <hi>Minister:</hi> and sometimes also on the other side, he would rattle up and be-<hi>Sirrah</hi> the Messenger of the Lord, before the rabble; and all this before any first or second Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition; yea perhaps, before they knew upon proof whether he were guilty of any fault or no; onely they saw somewhat writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten against him in a paper.</p>
                     <p>And then further yet, lest the negligent world, should chance to forget in after-Ages, this remarkable Act of <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline</hi> in them, concerning the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the Clergy: One <hi>John White,</hi> (then a choice Member of the <hi>Lower House,</hi> though now gone to his <hi>proper place</hi>) did make a Book, and <hi>Authorized</hi> it his own self, wherein the said presentments (though never proved) were transmitted to posterity, and this was his <hi>Dic Ecclesiae.</hi> And to the end, that forreigne Nations also, as well as the Children yet unborne, might the more fully note, and know, the Christianity of these <hi>Abolishers of Episcopacy,</hi> they Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in like manner one <hi>William Prin,</hi> (a dear friend we may be sure of the Bishops) to write an History in two volumes, (beside his Commentary upon the <hi>Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>And thus we have seen what their grand pretences are, for their <hi>Abolition of Episcopacy:</hi> now we shall note their true reasons which are these, some say,</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Because Episcopall Government, confines people,</hi> (as Gods<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> word doth) <hi>to the Bonds of Wedlock,</hi> and punisheth those that vitiate themselves in forbidden pathes, by ordering them to stand in a <hi>White sheet,</hi> or to pay a good sum of money for a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: Yea some persons of place and note in the world, (who think it no shame to <hi>commit</hi> folly, but to be reproved for it) are liable to suffer rebuke, and so disgrace, (as they take it) for their wantonnesse; if <hi>Bishops</hi> continue still Honourable and in esteem amongst us, (for the outward dignity of the reprover adds much vigour to the reproof with some men:) Wherefore that people might be free, and enjoy their Liberty without check or Controule, the Persons of Bishops must be vili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ied, their Estates and revenews taken away from them, and their Jurisdiction from henceforth quite abolished.</p>
                     <p>Indeed it makes all modest men blush to hear what Harlottry and filthiness is voiced to be practiced and countenanced (even by them that would be esteemed the <hi>Reformers</hi> of our Church and Nation,) since the <hi>Courts</hi> which punished that sin have been suppressed, (notwithstanding Gods heavy judgements upon the Nation ever since;) nor must men now speak their minds freely,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:29718:83"/>
for feare of being accounted <hi>disaffected persons, Enemies</hi> to the <hi>State,</hi> and to the <hi>Priviledges</hi> of <hi>Parliament:</hi> But as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> said in his time to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> so I must say (for I am Gods Minister) to those above board in these dayes, <hi>I hear there is such f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>nication committed,</hi> and such filthyness suffered to goe unpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed <hi>amongst you, as is not to be named among Saints,</hi> much less to be connived at, by them that would be esteemed members of the <hi>High and Supreame Court of Justice.</hi> It was not thus when <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy</hi> was in force, nor when Bishops had their place in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament:</hi> O might there but come forth an <hi>Ordinance</hi> to warrant and encourage all men to bring in Complaints against Bawds, Panders and Harlots, with their abetters and maintainers, (as there was once to invite all that would, to bring in accusations against Gods Ministers,) the world might haply see, or heare some new Centuryes of ill livers, yea, and proofs too into the bargain: Yea perhaps they might hear how some unworthy <hi>Members</hi> have attempted to ravish and defloure Ladies of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and no punishment inflicted for the same; How some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers neglected their own wives, have kept divers lewd women, yea, and allow yearely pensions to filthy Bawds to furnish them with such Commodities, for the satisfying their brutish lusts, and base appetites: How some have defloured young Virgins whose Parents (in respect of their abused Children) are unwilling to publish their dishonour to the world: How some, having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this vile wickedness with young Gentle-women, have used, (or advised) to meanes to hinder conception, yea and to destroy the fruit in the wombe when conceived, (which I beleeve in the sight of God is no lesse then rank murder.) How some (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving undone Gentlemen of good quality, by taking away their estates,) have taken advantage of the poverty of their Children, and allured their daughters (personable and proper women) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own basenesse, to the losse of their Honours and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soules for ever; (and to continue in these courses without controule is thought by many, to be one of the chief designes which divers of these new reformers ayme at;) I say, these and many such like things might haply be evinenced to some mens shame (if they have any left in them,) might but as free leave and Countenance be granted to impeach such persons, as was once to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:29718:84"/>
accuse Gods Ministers: Well, some men imagine this to be one<note place="margin">This reason I received lately from the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others and therefore thought fit to insert it in the first place with these that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</note> reason of the Abolition of Episcopacy; that the <hi>Fathers of Gods Church</hi> might not have power to punish and suppress such kind of offenders.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Because Episcopacy is the upholder of truth and order:</hi> this is evident enough to be another reason: themselves cannot deny, that the same was first ordained &amp; established in the Church, for a Remedy against Heresies, Sects, and Schismes, (which even in the Primitive times began to spring up among Christians; the Smectymnists themselves confesse this) and also for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Decency</hi> in Gods worship and service: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore truth and order, being the things which these men purpose to suppresse and destroy, (as appeares by that in-let, which they have given to all false Doctrines and Teachers, and by that confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which they have set up in all places;) therefore a necessity lyes upon it, <hi>Episcopacy</hi> must be <hi>Abolished,</hi> as being a main obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that their intendment or undertaking: This is the second.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Because Episcopacy is a great friend to Monarchy,</hi> a maine supporter of it. <hi>King James</hi> upon experience and observation was wont to say, <hi>No Bishop, no King;</hi> which saying, those that found most fault with it, do now endeavour to make good unto the full, for they intend the utter destruction of <hi>Monarchy</hi> in this Kingdome, (as will appeare by their words anon) a form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment indeed, which their <hi>Faction</hi> have alway maligned and laboured to destroy: <hi>King James</hi> in his <hi>Basilicon Doron,</hi> pag. 4. (which he made before he was King of <hi>England</hi>) complaines of the men of this faction, then in <hi>Scotland,</hi> how they did use to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate him in their popular Sermons, <hi>not</hi> (sayes he) <hi>for any evill or vice in me, but because I am a King, which they think the Highest evill:</hi> and againe, <hi>they informed</hi> (saies he) <hi>the people that Kings and Princes, were naturall enemies to the Liberty of the Church, and could never patiently beare the yoake of Christ,</hi> (which hath been the very Doctrine of these times.) Wherefore that wise King was most specially carefull all his dayes, to countenance and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish <hi>Episcopacy</hi> in all His Kingdomes; not onely as the main <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server of Religion,</hi> but also as the speciall <hi>upholder of Monarchie;</hi> and he layes it as a charge upon his Son, to imitate him therein. And indeed these innovators know full well, that they cannot

                     <p>The 4. is, <hi>because the King at His Coronation, did take a Solemne Oath to maintain Episcopacy,</hi> it being the Government then esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in the Church; and the endeavours of these men are not only to destroy the Kings <hi>Honour,</hi> by their Tongues and Pens; His <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Estate</hi> by their violence and oppression: but also His <hi>Soul</hi> (if they can possibly) by forcing upon Him, the guilt of perjury; which if they could effect, beside that unappeaseable grief, (which in so tender a Conscience as the Kings is) they know they should create, they would also purchase to themselves, an

listen after a certain new <hi>advise,</hi> from these few men, who call themselves <hi>the Parliament:</hi> who as if all wisdom were lodged in them, must take upon them, to Nominate some New <hi>good hands</hi> to settle the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdoms in, for after-times.

                     <p>But may it not be imagined, that men so excessively wise, are ful of reason? what therfore may the grounds be of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable demand? the like to which I never met with in any story: and doubtless should it be granted, the King (as himself says wel) should remain <hi>But the outside, but the picture, but the sign of a King:</hi> For in the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdom, consists the Kings power, his Authority, and to yeild to the setling of this in any hands but his own, were to yeild up his Crown it self: his very Kingdom. Now therfore by what right, or reason, they should claim the <hi>Kings</hi> Crown, I cannot imagine; unless (perhaps) they have bargained for that right, which the <hi>Pope</hi> had therunto, by <hi>King Johns</hi> resignation: The story saies, that the <hi>King</hi> received it back of the <hi>Pope</hi> to hold from thenceforth in fee farm of Him, and his Successours for the yearly rent of a 1000 Marks; Now (perhaps) upon the <hi>Kings</hi> non-payment of the said rent, they have gotten the <hi>Popes</hi> right conveyed to them, and do bottom this their demand upon it: and <hi>that strict intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence which</hi> Lenthall <hi>the Speaker brags that himself keeps with the</hi>

                     <p>1. <hi>Because those good Hands which the Parliament wil make choice of</hi> to settle the <hi>Militia</hi> in, <hi>are sure hands,</hi> that is, <hi>hands</hi> that may be trusted, which wil never part again, with what they have once griped, or laid hold upon; never a pack of Knaves in the world, shal be able to cheat them of their <hi>Magazines,</hi> their Ships, their Towns, and Castles, if once the whole power of the

Kingdom be at their disposing; they wil not take mens words, nor believe their Oaths, nor credit their Honesties as the King hath done: nor wil they be so scrupulous as he hath bin, of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving occasions of suspicion, to his inferior Subjects. Besides themselves being (as themselves say) <hi>Gods Children,</hi> have all power and authority, and what ever else is good upon the earth, of right belonging unto them, as their proper inheritance; though hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it hath bin kept from them by usurpers, (such as <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> are, and all others that be not of their <hi>Faction</hi>) ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if now by any means, they can but be stated in their own rights, it is very probable that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they wil see the whole Kingdom destroyed rather, then part with the same again, for the Israelites did never deliver back the <hi>Aegyptian Jewels,</hi> after they had once borrowed them; nor did they ever resigne to <hi>Og the King of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san,</hi> his Kingdom any more, when once they had gotten pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of it: <hi>Ergo,</hi> because these <hi>good hands</hi> are such <hi>sure hands,</hi> such hold-fasting hands, they would have the <hi>Militia</hi> setled in them.</p>
                     <p>Indeed we do remember that for the space of two seven years before this unhappy Parliament did begin, vulgar hearts were seasoned with this Doctrine; <hi>that Gods people only have a right to the things of this life, and all others</hi> (Kings and all) <hi>are but usurpers of what they do enjoy,</hi> and therfore may justly be dispossessed of the same, by them who call themselves <hi>the people of the Lord.</hi> But we do not believe this to be a true Doctrine, because Christ hath said, <hi>His Kingdom</hi> (or that which properly belongs to his people) <hi>is not of this world;</hi> Therfore we conceive the Argument, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son built upon the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be neither substantial nor sufficient, but only a bare pretence, to gul the ignorant, and to seduce the simple.</p>

                     <p>And then further too, that <hi>Publick form</hi> and manner of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping God, wherin people have bin bred and nourished in the Church, hath bin so decent, and Reverend; that this beastly and slovenly way, which these <hi>New Reformers</hi> (as they call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) would introduce in the room therof, is never like to be wel digested; and therfore as the <hi>Papists</hi> on the one side, have need of a <hi>bloudy Inquisition,</hi> to uphold their <hi>ridiculous</hi> fopperies, and <hi>superstitious</hi> vanities in their worship of God: so these on the other side, have as much need of the <hi>Militia</hi> to maintain, and force their <hi>unhandsome</hi> carriages, and <hi>proud</hi> undecencies in their serving of him.</p>
                     <p>But these men pretending to reform a Christian Church, do they not make use of a wrong instrument? Was the <hi>Militia</hi> of kingdoms ever appointed of God to such an end? We have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways believed that the <hi>Word</hi> was the ordained mean for such a purpose: the <hi>Sword of Christs mouth,</hi> and not of mens hands, must both cut sin from Christs members, and subdue his enemies. Had these men set up a faithful teaching Ministry, in all parts of the Kingdom, we might have hoped for some good by them; but as that <hi>Pope,</hi> who cast away his <hi>Keys,</hi> and betook himself to his Sword; so do they betake them to their iron and steel, they desire the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdom, with which they persec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

with that Religion, whose root is truth, whose branches are cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and whose fruit is good deeds, both towards friends and<note place="margin">Micah 3. 9, 11.</note> enemies: we find in <hi>Micah</hi> the Lord complaining of some <hi>wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Heads of the people, and false Prophet,</hi> who jugling together<note place="margin">Vers. 10.</note> did endevour <hi>to build up Sion with bloud, and Jerusalem with ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> (and had got the Power and <hi>Militia</hi> into their hands to that purpose) and that the silly people might think, that God was wel pleased with that their way, they would (saies the Text) <hi>lean upon the Lord,</hi> and were so impudent as to say, <hi>the Lord is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us,</hi> or on our side: But how did the Lord take this at their hands? It follows in the next Verse, <hi>For your very sakes</hi> (saies<note place="margin">Vers. 12.</note> God to them) <hi>Sion shal be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem shal become heaps,</hi> and by those unfit means, wherwith they preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to build up the same, was brought to pass its destruction.

                        <hi>Judgment is turned away backward; and Justice standeth a far off: Truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.

Our Nobles and Gentry are debased, our Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are beggered, and many thousands of all sorts are killed or starved: the whole Commonalty of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, are in the same Condition with the Asses of <hi>France,</hi> thought<note place="margin">Lucanus.</note> fit for nothing but blows and burdens; no man can now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the use of his proper goods, or the service of his own Children: we hear daily of rapes and robberies, burning of houses, depopulation of Towns: violence and oppression reigns in all places, and confusion is poured out in ful measure among us; insomuch, that our wel-ordered <hi>Common-wealth</hi> that was, is translated into a very <hi>Conjuration of Tyrannies,</hi> by the means of these men, whose aims and endevours are only to keep us in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual slavery, <hi>Militari Jure,</hi> by the Militia, which yet (forsooth) they desire may be setled in their <hi>good hands</hi> for the peoples se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and preservation.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, the people at first chose them, and now they feel them, and have cause to know them: and to confess of them, that they are very <hi>Scorpions</hi> to them, and that their little finger

is ten times heavier then the Kings Loynes. The people chose them, to be Arbytratours on their side against their King, to comprimize, as it were, on their behalf, some matter between the King and them, (for under that notion do the people commonly chuse their Parliament men) and such shal only be carried on their shoulders, whom they apprehend wil be most stiffe against their Soveraign, as if he were the only great Enemy to their welfare and prosperity: But by this time the greatest part of them, (we believe) are otherwise instructed, and (as some of them have confessed) their apprehensions of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> (as they stand now in the tearms contradistinct and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite) is like that, which the Heathens have of God and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: as those adore the <hi>Devil</hi> with gifts and sacrifices, for fear of mischief from him, so do these the <hi>Parliament;</hi> but <hi>God</hi> (say the Heathens) <hi>is good, and wil do us no harm;</hi> so (say these) is the King, and therfore they neglect to do him service: And (doubtless) might people have but liberty now to speak their minds freely, they would utterly renounce the <hi>preservation</hi> of those their Arbitratours, and desire again the Kings protection, after the manner of former times: And wheras these new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours desire to have the <hi>Militia of three Kingdoms</hi> setled in their own hands, for our greater security, we must needs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend from the proof they have given us, of what they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised us, that this their pretence is but one of those bitter <hi>flouts,</hi> which in scorn at our simplicities for thinking them to be honest men, they cast upon us: <hi>Sed Deus vindex,</hi> God shal one day sit in judgment on them.</p>

Can any man think that such a report, would speak the King in a <hi>Glorious Condition?</hi> Would not Strangers reply, and say, Is this the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the English <hi>King,</hi> and his great Priviledge above other Princes? He may enjoy it sure without Emulation, no man wil ever envy him this glory.</p>
                     <p>But is this indeed the English mens kindness to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Father? their gratitude for all their happiness and peace under him? Is this the upshot of all their great promises to him? Is this that Royal Prerogative, that happy freedom, which those who stand so much upon their own liberty, can in their good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, find in heart to afford unto their Soveraign? Would not the meanest of them all disdain to be in that Condition? What? Neither have Command over his Subjects, nor yet over his hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold servants?

And thus we see what great Dignity and Glory, upon his resignation of the <hi>Militia,</hi> is like to be conferred upon Englands King.</p>
                     <p>But what man now not void of Reason, (considering withall the tearmes these Demanders stand in, at the present with the King,) will not conclude this their pretence <hi>of making the King Glorious,</hi> to be onely one of their <hi>Flouts,</hi> which in their pride and bitterness they are pleased to put upon their Soveraigne? even for his easiness and goodness, in giving credit at first so far, to their Oathes and Honesties, as to suffer them already to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach him: truly as a plain scorn we apprehend it; for let them Answer us a question or too: Would dutifull and loyall Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, (as they call themselves) desire any thing in earnest of their Prince, and not first lay down their Harness? Do not these their weapons speak, that by violence or dread, they intend to obtain their purpose? Have not these very men, seized already by fraud and force upon that very thing, without the Kings leave, which they require of him to grant them? Do they not by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling themselves the <hi>Militia,</hi> declare Evidently, that they account themselves the everlasting Masters of it? Do they intend, if the King shall think meet to deny their request, to yeeld up presently that possession which they have already of the same? We sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose not, for they claime in their Tenents all earthly power and Authority to be theirs, by right, as they are Gods Children. They are so bold as to say Gods Providence hath cast into their hands, that strength of the <hi>Militia,</hi> which by unjust meanes they have
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:29718:91"/>
seized upon; and they have entred into an Oath and Covenant, in effect, to keep the same in despight of the King; and with it to suppress and destroy all them that shall ayde, and assist the King, to recover His own again.</p>

                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 23.</note> which S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls for? and that obedience for the <hi>Lords sake</hi> which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> requireth: will you all hold, (as some of your fellow-members have maintained,) <hi>that these Precepts were onely in date, in the Primitive times, when the People of God lived under Heathen Persecutors, and are of no concernment in these dayes, now Gods people have got strength?</hi> Or do you think the bare calling your selves <hi>His Majesties most Dutifull and Loyall Subjects,</hi> a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient observance of those injunctions? We beleeve neither of these excuses will satisfie Christ Jesus at the reckoning day. But in the <hi>interim,</hi> doth not your desiring the King that the <hi>Militia</hi> may be setled in your hands plainly infer, that in your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, you have done him wrong, in seizing already upon it without his leave? Surely if the <hi>right of settling</hi> it be now in him, the <hi>right of seizing</hi> upon it before was not in you: but you did a manifest injury to His Majesty in meddling with it against his will, and a far greater yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you intend to do him, by your resolving still to keep it, by force, if you may not have it confirmed by his Approbation; unlesse you will yeeld, that this your demand pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the scorners Chaire; you must of necessity grant us thus much.</p>
                     <p>But in very deed, these men have other reasons, for this their<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> unreasonable request, though they are ashamed to name them, I shall do it for them, for mine aymes are (like those of Christ my Master in his preaching,) to discover Hypocrites, that men might beware of them: They are these.</p>
                     <p>1. If the King can be gotten, to settle the <hi>Militia</hi> in their hands, all the <hi>Injustice</hi> and <hi>unlawfulnesse</hi> of the war on their side, will be thereby cancelled, and whatsoever they have done against him, and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:29718:91"/>
his subjects will be <hi>Authorized</hi> as found and good: their crafty seizing upon it, at first, and their violent use thereof since, to the destruction of so many, will go for worthy deeds, and the King will be judged, to have been much to blame, in making any opposition against them, and for his calling them Rebells: His own Act, will be the eating of those his own words, and speake them to have been His most humble, dutifull, and obedient sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, all the while they fought against him; yea and all they did in that kinde, to have been done out of pure love, to His <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> and for the benefit of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Common-wealth:</hi> And then too, if withall the King shall but confer some new Titles of Honour, upon their Chieftaines, (as when time was he did upon <hi>Lesley,</hi>) for this they expect and intend to demand too; then they shall appeare, <hi>White</hi> all over, and who will dare to say to the contrary, and full as good subjects almost, as their Brethren the <hi>Scots?</hi> That is one Reason.</p>
                     <p>2. If they can get the King to settle in their Hands, that <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positum</hi> of Power and Authority, which God hath intrusted in His; they shall bring him, (as they desire) into their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: and make him such a one to God, as themselves have been and are to him: whereby Gods displeasure may be so far kindled against him, that he may permit them, (having all the power in their hands,) to bring their endeavours fully to passe in destroying Him, and His posterity: and then the world shall be taught to beleeve that Heaven hath punished him, for such His sin: and confirmed with its blessing, all their sayings and doings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him: that God was of their minde all the while, as now by the success is most apparent: <hi>Honesta quaedam scelera successus facit,</hi> (saies <hi>Seneca:</hi>) the highest Villanies, if succesfull, shall be accounted vertues, and these men care not to obtain <hi>truths,</hi> but <hi>opinions</hi> warrant.</p>
                     <p>3. They desire the <hi>Militia</hi> may be settled in their hands, <hi>quia omnis in ferro salus est,</hi> their whole safety consists therein, it is the Nurse of their wealth, and the sole Anchor of their security: for <hi>O si pateant pectora virûm, quantos intus sublimis agit fortuna metus!</hi> what great feares, have these mens High fortunes created in their Bosomes, could we but view their insides? They dare neither trust the King, nor yet the Countrey that trusted them; for should
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:29718:92"/>
the strength be in any hands but their own, they might be called to an account for all their doings, the Law might be in force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: and <hi>Justice</hi> suffered to shew her face; <hi>Treason</hi> should sit no longer in the seat of <hi>Religion, Truth</hi> might appear above-board; and <hi>Peace</hi> be restored unto the Nation; and <hi>Order</hi> might come again into fashion: Yea, had the King His power again, He might call a Parliament, <hi>a true Parliament, a free Parliament,</hi> which is a thing that they quake to think on; for then like a Company of poore Hope-losts, they should stand below, and look up to that place of Honour, where erst they sat, and have so much abused; and who in their condition, can indure this? <hi>Nemo Hercule ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo:</hi> No mervail therefore, if they desire to hold fast the <hi>Militia</hi> in their own hands.</p>
                     <p>4. Should they part with it, they should not onely degrade<note place="margin">4.</note> themselves of their present Honour, and disarme themselves of safety, but of their wealth and riches too, for all is now at their Command; the Lands, Estates, the goods and Fortunes of all their Country-men: which the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdome, hath inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted them with a right in: and possession must be maintainted by the same meanes as obtained: But should the <hi>Militia</hi> return into the Hands of the right owner; Honest men would enjoy their own as before, and they who are now so Gay, would remaine stark Naked, (like <hi>Jack-daw</hi> in the <hi>fable,</hi> when every bird had re-assumed her own feathers.) And then further too, their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures would also cease, that sweetnesse they feel in shedding of bloud, would be no more: which very want would be as bad as death unto them; their Natures are now so accustomed unto it. In a word, (as <hi>Amos</hi> speakes) <hi>they have gotten them Hornes by</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Amos 6. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>their own strength,</hi> or sleight, and the <hi>Hornes</hi> are the defence of the Head; the <hi>Militia</hi> are these <hi>Hornes,</hi> and should they part with that, they fear they should not keep their <hi>Heads</hi> long after: and therefore great reason they have, rather to desire the settlement of it, for ever in their own Hands.</p>
                     <p>But (with their favour) what reason hath the King to trust<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> them, that will not trust Him? them with His weapons, upon that experience He hath had of their love and kindnesse: Who will not trust Him with His own? Can it be imagined that they will imploy them otherwise, then they have done, (considering what
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:29718:92"/>
their delights are?) Nay, may it not be expected, that they will make Him the Author of all their Evill, which from thenceforth they shall doe, when by His consent the power is once settled in their <hi>goods Hands?</hi> Surely they that <hi>used His name to the raising</hi> of so many men against Himself, to the <hi>killing</hi> of so many of His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, when He openly opposed them, will not scruple to doe all their mischeif, under His Name and Authority, when they have so faire a pretence for it. Nay should the King doe in this, as they would have Him, may not the Just and Holy God account Him a partaker with them in Evill? His Majesty (by His own pious confession) hath smarted under the Hand of God for His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting, though (doubtlesse) against His will, to the shedding of <hi>Straffords</hi> innocent Bloud: and should He againe after His Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation for that, by a new consent, make Himself guilty of many more <hi>Blouds;</hi> the continued Anger of the Almighty, might be too heavy a burden for Him to beare: No doubt but they are, and will be, the more importunate for His consent now; because they see His heart hath smot Him for His consent then; for how ever it was blattered much at the beginning, by those of their faction, <hi>against forcing of tender Consciences,</hi> yet verily, we beleeve there were never men that delighted more in offering violence to the Soules and Consciences of the righteous, then themselves do; wherefore should His Majesty yeild to them in this particular, it would be <hi>in singultum cordis,</hi> a <hi>corrasive</hi> to His Heart for ever; and therein a <hi>glory</hi> unto them: and also it would argue too great a distrust in Gods defence of Him; and be a mean to delay Gods punishment, from falling upon the heads of these lofty Rebells. And besides all this: His Majesty hereby shall give way to the settling of all those Sects and Heresies, to the destruction of Christian Protestation Religion, which by their crafty and violent seizing upon the <hi>Militia,</hi> were but only let in to the Church: May it please His Sacred Majesty, and all His Loyall Subjects to remember, when the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> (these mens Grandsire, for however in words they disclaime kindred with Him, yet are they wholly like Him in Conditions, they tread in His steps, &amp; observe His method, &amp; end, in all their undertakings:) when He (I say) after the fashion of these His Nephews, had fraudulently &amp; force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably seized upon the <hi>Militia</hi> of His Soveraign the Emperour;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:29718:93"/>

But in <hi>Ireland</hi> it is a custome established to their hand. Yea, and further yet, upon Condition, that they wil go thither, and so we in this land may be rid of their Companies; we wil all supplicate the King for a further fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in their behalf, <hi>viz.</hi> that every great <hi>O</hi> amongst them, may have the Honour, to give the <hi>Earl of Tyrones</hi> own Arms, (which is <hi>a bloudy Hand</hi>) for their own proper and most deserved Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance; and that they may also be, all Barons of that Strong I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, which <hi>Tyrone</hi> fortified, and called <hi>Fough-na-Gaul,</hi> the <hi>Hate of English-men:</hi> For in very deed, no man living, did ever better merit that Title, then they have done.</p>
                     <p>But (alas!) we have read that <hi>Ireland</hi> harbours no venimous Vipers; therfore we are confident the great Oes of <hi>Westminster,</hi> wil never adventure thither in their own persons: But if they can get the <hi>Militia</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> setled by the <hi>King,</hi> wholly in their Hands, (that so they may fear no rising here against themselves) they wil therwith force, and press all the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish people, (who wil not take their unlawful and ungodly Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant) which is in effect to renounce the Doctrine of Christs Gospel, and their obedience to the <hi>King</hi> for ever; and send them thither, where they wil expose them to be starved, or slaughte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; as many thousands have bin already: and therfore let all the Countries that have stood out longest in their Loyalty, and

And for those lusty Club-men, in the Counties of <hi>Wilts, Somerset,</hi> and <hi>Devon,</hi> and the like; let them look for this reward at the hands of their <hi>Militia-Masters,</hi> for taking part with them, against the <hi>Kings men.</hi> Such fellows as wil gather together, and make head against those that wrong and abuse them; wil be dangerous to live in a <hi>New State.</hi> They that did thus against the <hi>Cavaliers,</hi> may do as much against the <hi>Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,</hi> when they are but a while as wel acquainted with their Conditions: They that wil be forced from their Duty to their Soveraign and natural Liege-Lord, by such wrongs and oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as (in these troublesome times) are offered to them by the unruly Soldiers; wil be easily driven upon a like sensible occasion, to make resistance against tyrannical usurpers; those Beasts that wil decline from their Allegiance to the <hi>Kingly Lyon,</hi> wil never long rest contented under the obedience of <hi>Cat-a-Mountains;</hi> therfore a timely course must be taken with such persons, they shal all be sent into <hi>Ireland</hi> (out of hand) and be hampered there, for <hi>Ireland</hi> must be the continual <hi>Spain,</hi> or <hi>Carthage,</hi> to our <hi>New Rome,</hi> to rid her of all such mutinous and tumultuous persons: and then shal these Saints, these Bloudy Butcherly Saints, have free Elbow-room to inherit this land; and having neither truth nor King, nor Enemy left, for to disease them; they shal be at leisure (if Pride and faction wil give them leave) to live at peace together.

                        <hi>late sufferings,</hi> and confess them rare: Now we shal view their <hi>patience</hi> too, which themselves call <hi>strange,</hi> specially that which they have shewn even now, <hi>after the discovery of these Papers:</hi> Indeed their publication of them, together with their Preface,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:29718:97"/>
and Notes upon them, after their discovery, is testimony suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of the strangeness of their <hi>patience.</hi> And yet we must tel them, that we conceive by the effects of this their patience, that we have read of such a like <hi>patience</hi> before now, in some others beside themselves: as for example, in a certain <hi>Dragon, Rev.</hi> 12. 15. who when he had persecuted a <hi>woman</hi> there mentioned, (whom some interpret to be the Church of Christ) and driven her into a wilderness, <hi>i. e.</hi> into a low and desperate condition: his <hi>patience</hi> provoked him, <hi>to cast out of his mouth after her, waters as a flood:</hi> which (as Expositors say) were multitudes of slanders, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful speeches, scandalous reports and lies, hoping therby to drown her honour and reputation for ever; (for they would be more easily believed of her, in her affliction) and to carry her away so far, that she should never appear in any credible or comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able condition more: Nor did his <hi>patience</hi> end here, but the Text tels us, <hi>vers.</hi> 17. that he went (farther in the heat therof) <hi>to make war with the remnant of her seed, that keep the Commandment of God, and have the testimony of Jesus.</hi> We are sure this was such a <hi>patience,</hi> which these men are seasoned withal, and which they have shewn since <hi>their discovery of these Papers,</hi> and do stil exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise towards their Soveraign, and all that remain faithful and loyal to him.</p>
                     <p>Nay and farther too, we must tel these men, that this humour which they call <hi>patience</hi> in themselves, though the <hi>name</hi> which they give it be somthing new; yet for the <hi>nature</hi> of it, 'tis no whit <hi>strange</hi> or singular, for many men, before these times, have bin infected with it: <hi>Cain</hi> was, when he kill'd his brother, <hi>because</hi>

And in the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> it was most plentifully abounding, as appears by all their dealings with Christ and his Apostles: Thus (I say) this condition, which these men commend in themselves, for the matter of it, is not so <hi>new</hi> and <hi>strange;</hi> though I confess the <hi>Name,</hi> (by which they call it) seems so to be; for it was wont to be tearmed <hi>Rage, Cruelty, Wrath,</hi> and <hi>Fury,</hi> and not <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience:</hi> Yet I remember Master <hi>Fox</hi> tels us that Bishop <hi>Bonner,</hi> and those of his bloudy Consistory in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days; who (having with as much rage and passion as can be imagined, handled, and oppressed the Martyrs) when they came to read the definitive sentence, and to give them up to the secular power to be put to death; were wont to make proclamation, (as these men here do) to the whole world, of their great meeknesse and <hi>strange Patience,</hi> which they had used towards those <hi>obstinate Hereticks,</hi> as they called them: So that we see this <hi>Patience</hi> here mentioned, is not only by Bishop <hi>Bonners</hi> Authority <hi>a strange Patience,</hi> but also such a Patience, as Master <hi>Fox</hi> himself doth make mention of, in the Book of Martyrs. But the poor Church of Christ hath felt enough, and too much of this their <hi>Patience,</hi> therefore at this time, I wil speak no more of it, onely I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in the words of the Prophet <hi>Micha, The best of them is</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mic. 7. 4.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>The next thing they mention (wherein they Triumph indeed<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> and glory) is <hi>their late extraordinary success in the field:</hi> some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may wonder, how these three can accord together, <hi>great suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, strange Patience,</hi> and <hi>extraordinary good success,</hi> and all of <hi>late:</hi> but they must remember, that their <hi>Sufferings</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> being of that kind, as was shewed before, may wel stand with <hi>extraordinary good success,</hi> yea, in such men as they are, <hi>such suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,</hi> and such <hi>patience,</hi> are the natural fruits and dependants
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:29718:98"/>
of prosperity, and <hi>Extraordinary good Successe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But by the way, take notice of their end, in yoaking these three together; <hi>Prosperity</hi> and good successe, which of old, went currant onely among the Papists, for a Note of the true Church; is now admitted also by these men, to be a speciall marke of the goodnesse of their cause; but in regard our Religion hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to taught, that <hi>sufferings,</hi> and <hi>patience</hi> were rather the marks of Christs true flock, then extraordinary successe in the world; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Euphoniae gratia,</hi> for sound sake, the name of <hi>sufferings and patience,</hi> are still retained, and joyned together here, with <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary good successe; Alteratio non fit in instanti,</hi> if the Change from one extreame unto another, should not be by degrees, it would be too grosse, and palpable: but by that time the three Propositions be granted to them, <hi>Extraordinary good successe</hi> will be able to stan alone, and to go currant among all their Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, for an unquestionable note of the true Church, or cause: it will not need the countenance of these two names of <hi>Suffering</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> which shall from thenceforth be rejected, and wholly disclaimed, as infallible marks of <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed, <hi>successe</hi> is the best Argument they have to win and hold people to themselves, and to their Cause: wherefore tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite that for further discovery, I shew the invalidity, and weaknesse of this their Argument. But first for our better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse therein, we shall consider what this <hi>extraordinary successe</hi> is, which they so brag and boast of, and what are the true grounds and causes of it.</p>
                     <p>Their <hi>Successe</hi> (I confesse) to narrow Capacities, and low braines may seeme (as they call it) <hi>extraordinary:</hi> but to those that consider the causes of things, together with the meanes and manner of their proceedings, it appeareth nothing so.</p>
                     <p>Tis well known how by fraud and policy, they seized at una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares upon the Kings <hi>Militia</hi> and <hi>Navy:</hi> How they ingrossed into their hands, most of his Townes, Castles, Rents, Revenues, and all he had; leaving him nothing of his owne to subsist on: How they rooked to themselves, all the Plate and Money of the Kingdome: and how by the service of false Teachers, they poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned the hearts of his Subjects; drew them from their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:29718:99"/>
and armed them against him: And having done all this, they were able to get a Victory against him at <hi>Nazeby-field;</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had taken away, what ere he had to defend himself, they made a shift to beat him with his own Weapons; after four long years pursuit of him: and what <hi>extraordinary</hi> matter is there in all this? Nay, some say too, they had not prevailed then neither, but <hi>that they plowed with the Kings Heifer:</hi> (as they also did, in their taking those Townes and Castles, which since they entred upon:) Had not some, whom the King trusted, been perfidious, these great Conquerours had not been so prosperous: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the case being rightly stated, it was not altogether <hi>Victorious</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> but partly also victorious treachery, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious money, which was the procurer of such their late <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary great</hi> successe: And yet (perhaps) Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> may be a right valiant man in his way, as many other Commanders on that side are, worthy all to be<note n="*" place="margin">And I hope through Gods mercy to them in Gods time they may, to their own eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall comfort &amp; honour; &amp; the recovery of the Kingdoms lost glory.</note> engaged in a more noble and righteous quarrell; and I wish, with my Soul, for their Soules sake, and for the honour of the English Nation, that either the cause which they strive to maintaine were better, or that their industry wherewith they maintaine it, were not so good.</p>
                     <p>But that none may think that the <hi>extraordinary successe,</hi> which these perverters of Order, these underminers of Government, have had, and which these troubles of <hi>Israel,</hi> these over-turners of Christianity do boast of, is to be attributed to any goodnesse in their cause, or to any Celestiall or Divine benediction upon it. I shall desire them to consider of the true Grounds and Reasons of it. I shall name only those that are most visible, amongst which I might mention private <hi>divisions,</hi> between our Chieftaines, who<note place="margin">Nemo parere gnarus, nemo imperare.</note> to revenge themselves of one another, seemed not to care what advantage they gave to the common foe, nor what detriment to the King: but this hath been too sufficiently, yea, too shameful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly visible, without further notice.</p>
                     <p>I might mention also the <hi>Indiscretion,</hi> or inability of those, who have undertaken to manage the Kings Affaires: The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test <hi>talkers</hi> (sayes the <hi>Proverb) are not always the wisest men.</hi> He<note place="margin">Strenui lingua multi, ignavife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re omnes opera.</note> that can make a witty speech, is not alwayes meetest to sway a Councell; nor are men of quickest gust or relish, always men

of the best and sagest spirit; 'tis one thing to give directions, for dressing of a good Dinner, and another thing to give orders, for the governing of a great Army: Beside, the <hi>Genius</hi> of some men, is neither publick nor noble enough, either to gaine, or keep the Hearts of people, who by a certaine instinct from above, are most regardfull (in troublesome times) of those, whom they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, to be most neglectfull of themselves. Assuredly the King and his Cause both, have received the greatest wounds from the hands of Friends.</p>
                     <p>I might also mention mens <hi>dishonesty,</hi> in falsifying the trust im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in them, when they have by their oppression and violence,<note place="margin">Deni<expan>

But to omit these and many more particulars, (which might be named) which have occasioned that great suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess so gloried in; I shall mention only three, <hi>viz. Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> in the best of ours, <hi>Prophanenesse</hi> in the worst, and <hi>Popular fury.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. Remisness. The best on our side in generall, being not armed or quickned, with such <hi>stings</hi> of <hi>Hatred,</hi> as they on their side are, have been more heavy and dull in their opposite desires, and inferiour to them in their attempts and practises, They by tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and tossing like heaps of snow rowled up and down, have grown great and mighty: and we, by our frosty coldness, have given them leave to harden: Whereby they are encreased to that stupendious heap we see; though 'tis possible yet that a thaw may come, for <hi>rota fortunae</hi> is <hi>in gyro,</hi> notwithstanding their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent bigness, they may be sensible of a diminution, might but the glorious Sun-shine of Gods Countenance, return again upon our Soveraign.</p>
                     <p>And yet (perhaps) this Remisness (which I seeme to tax in these of ours) hath been more from others restraint, then their owne sluggishness; for (alas!) the chiefest care of too many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, hath been to damp the endevours of good men, in
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:29718:100"/>
such places where they might have been most serviceable: yea, to prevent (if possible) their being trusted, or imployed at all; for fear (I think) the Kings Affaires should thrive too well; if such had had the managing of them: many of the Kings friends (as they have been called) have been so faithfull to Him, that they would neither do their own duties, nor suffer others to do theirs; having themselves deserved ill, they could not abide, that others should deserve better; it hath been one of the hardest things, for a known honest man to obtain leave of them, (since the Kings troubles began) to doe His Majesty faithfull service: yea, I have heard it often said, that <hi>the surest and speediest way, for one to bring himselfe to ruine, among many of the Kings men, was to be more active, and honest, then others, in doing the Kings worke.</hi> Nay, if a Minister of Christ hath but laboured earnestly and zealously in his proper way, (according to his Office) in the behalf of God, his Soveraigne, and his Country; He hath growne remarkable on the suddaine, and been noted by many (that should have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged him) for an unsufferable fellow; fit for nothing but for slaughter, (unless presently silenced and dismissed) for they have cryed, <hi>He will spoile the Kings Cause if let alone, and make all the Souldiers stark Puritanes, rank Round-heads, or else stirre up all the people against us:</hi> (and all this, but for his faithfull and true dislike of that which spoiled it.) <hi>Remissenesse</hi> therefore in good men, is granted a mean to preserve their own safeties, but withall tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly one of the special things that hath damnified the Kings Cause, and advanced that of the Enemy.</p>
                     <p>2. As Remisnesse in some, so prophanesse and high impiety in<note place="margin">2.</note> some others of our side hath weakned us, and aided them: tis a true saying, <hi>A divine blessing doth alwayes accompany good causes, where wickednesse and wilfull witlessenesse doth not bar against it;</hi> but when either of these oppose, the blessing is obstructed: and (alas!) <hi>Hinc dolor, Hinc lacrymae,</hi> hence also is the source of our sorrows, and of our enemies good successe: Sir <hi>Edwin Sands</hi> in his <hi>Europae speculum</hi> tells us, that <hi>the Jewes in their speculations of the causes of the strange successe of worldly affaires, doe assigne the reason of the Turkes prevailing against the Christians to their Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemies, and horrid Oathes, which doe wound the eares of the very Heavens, and cry to the throne of Justice for Divine vengeance:</hi>
                        <pb n="165" facs="tcp:29718:100"/>
                        <hi>whereas the Turkes hate prophanation, and will not suffer Christ to be ill spoken of:</hi> the same reason may be given for the enemies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing of late against the Kings men. (Though I doe not say that all on the Enemies side, are free from this hellish sinne, or so respectfull of Christ and God, as the Turkes are in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: <hi>for there are with them, even with them also,</hi> most horrid swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and most execrable blasphemers: but their evills hurt not us, as our owne doe, nor are so mis-becoming their Cause, as ours are to that which we maintaine.) And indeed never any good undertaking had so many unworthy attendants: such hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid blasphemers, and wicked wretches as ours hath had: I quake to think, much more to speak, what mine eares have heard, from some of their lips: but to discover them, is not my present busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; a day may come, when the world may see, that we who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the King for Conscience sake, (what ever is said of us to the contrary) have as truly hated the <hi>prophanesse</hi> and <hi>vilenesse</hi> of our own men, as we have done the <hi>disloyalty</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi> of the Enemy: For indeed, the truth is, betwixt them both (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two mil-stones) the King, his Cause, and our selves too, are ground in pieces: and were the matter well opened, it would appear, that both those and these, have had but one and the same end, even to satisfie their owne lusts, and enrich themselves, with the ruines of their King and Country. But without all question, neglect of Religion, and want of Discipline, hath weakned and undone the Kings Armies: O had His Sacred Majesties Commands, and Orders for the exercise of both, been put in Execution, the Enemy had never been able to have stood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Popular Fury,</hi> (which is like the <hi>rushing of mighty waters</hi>)<note place="margin">3.</note> comes also in, to the making up of this Land-floud, which gives the Adversary such occasion of glorying: the Addition of the <hi>many,</hi> though it can adde no true credit to their Cause, yet it makes the successe appear <hi>extraordinary:</hi> The <hi>People</hi> (sayes <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>)<note place="margin">Jer. 5. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>are foolish,</hi> and know not Gods way: and our Saviour sayes, <hi>the Multitude walke in the broad way;</hi> they are led much by mouth and noise, and incline alwayes to the strongest: their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights are, <hi>to lift up those that are already up, and to throw downe lower, the already downe:</hi> with them the winner hath alwayes
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:29718:101"/>
praise, let a man get power or prosperity how he can, he shall not want vertue in their opinions. A notable Testimony of this we have in that propheticall <hi>vision, Rev.</hi> 13. (wherein is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shewn<note place="margin">Rev. 13.</note> what shall fall out in these latter times) we are there told of a certain <hi>Beast</hi> with <hi>many Heads,</hi> whom all the world <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der after,</hi> in regard of his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> which (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding) was not <hi>lawfull,</hi> or rightly come by, (as the Text infers) For the <hi>Dragon</hi> or Devill did give it to him, and not God, yet such was the blindness and fury of the People, that they did worship and adore him for it.</p>
                     <p>And by the way, let us here note: that <hi>Satan</hi> is sometime said to give power (by Gods permission) as well as <hi>God:</hi> and as that power which is gotten by honest and lawfull meanes, is Gods gift, of which kinde was that of <hi>Pilat,</hi> (though abused by him)<note place="margin">John 19. 11.</note> it was conferred upon him, by the voluntary designement of <hi>Caesar,</hi> the Supream Magistrate: and therefore (our Saviour saies) <hi>it was of God, or from above:</hi> So that strength and Authority (on the other side) which is obtained by unlawfull courses, is the gift of <hi>Satan;</hi> and such was that of the <hi>many-headed Monster</hi> forementioned: He is said, <hi>to have received power from the Dragon,</hi> because by fraud, violence, and unjust wayes, he had gryped a great strength of the <hi>Militia</hi> into his hands, whereby for a season he was succesefull in many designes. Yea, sayes the spirit, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. <hi>He made Warre with the Saints, and overcame them;</hi> He prevailed over men of all sorts, small and great, rich and poore, free and bond; and compelled them <hi>to receive a Marke,</hi> or to take a Covenant, and no man might live and trade, <hi>buy or sell</hi> in all his Quarters, that scrupled at it. And in regard of this his great Power, and success together; all that dwelt upon the earth, or in the Countries where he had to doe, (those onely excepted (sayes the Text) <hi>whose names were written in the booke of Life</hi>) did worship the Beast wondered after him, and admired him: saying, <hi>who is like unto the Beast?</hi> who <hi>is able to make Warre with him?</hi> And no doubt but the Beast did admire himselfe too, for such his greatness and success among the People, whose foolish and froward access (indeed) did make the same so <hi>extraordinary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These I conceive are the chief causes of that prosperity which
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:29718:101"/>
the enemy so much glories in; what invisible reasons there be in Gods secret Councell for his permitting this, I cannot tell; but sure I am, (though the Adversaries may have received their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer as that beast did, to doe as they have done, yet) Gods Hand it selfe, is in the Judgement, as 'tis a punishment. And indeed we have sinned one with another, and therefore are justly punished one by another; we had made this happy and rich Kingdom the stage of our wickedness, and therefore it is become unto us an <hi>Acheldama,</hi> or <hi>field of blood;</hi> and should God make it an Hell al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, for ever to torment us in; it would be but our due merit, and his true Justice: Let us give God his due glory, <hi>He is righteous in all his doings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Judgement (indeed) hath falne hitherto, most heavy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Kings Family, and Party; and this I beleeve is of Gods speciall permission too; but whether because <hi>Judgement doth usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 17.</note>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Yet stil</hi> must needs (according to Grammar) have reference to what precedes, as wel as to that which follows: that which precedes, <hi>is their late extraordinary successe in the field,</hi> scil. when these Papers were surprised: that which follows, is the relation of diverse crimes, which (as must be supposed) they have found in these <hi>Papers:</hi> now <hi>yet stil</hi> is uttered as an aggravation of the said crimes, as if after their <hi>extraordinary successe</hi> (which must be believed, spake Gods approbation of their cause) the King had been guilty of that, which they lay to his Charge out of the said <hi>Papers,</hi> and had written all that is found amisse in them, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were surprized. So that <hi>yet stil</hi> imports thus much: <q>Notwithstanding Gods manifestation of himself against the King, by the late <hi>extraordinary successe</hi> in the field, which the holy and blessed Parliament had against him: He (contrary to this conviction) hath used <hi>clandestine proceedings</hi> against them at <hi>Westminster,</hi> hath <hi>condemned all that were in any degree Protestants at Oxford,</hi> hath <hi>granted a Toleration of Idolatry to Papists,</hi> and <hi>indemnity to the Murderous Irish,</hi> and what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beside is liable to blame (according to their fenses) in these Letters.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this pretty Aggravation of theirs, is but a bare cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance, and therefore I passe it over only with this little notice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="176" facs="tcp:29718:106"/>The Charge it self follows, which consists of an huge heap of hainous words, resembling a man of straw, that at first blush, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries some proportion to our seeming, but being felt and poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, is discovered to be a meer vanity, serving onely to fray Crowes.</p>
                     <p>1. They cry out of <hi>Clandestine proceedings,</hi> scil. against <hi>them at Westminster,</hi> for by <hi>us</hi> here, none else can be intended; these (it seems) they would have in the first place to be marked with a <hi>Noli me tangere;</hi> and great reason for it, many fields in <hi>England</hi> have bin watered with humane bloud, to keep them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing touched: they have deserved so abundantly well of their Country and Nation, in keeping safe the Religion, Peace, and Wealth thereof, without any the least Schism, breach or diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that it were a mortal sin, but to think amisse of them. Wherefore the King must needs be much too blame, for using any <hi>clandestine proceedings against them at Westminster:</hi> and the rather, because they were never guilty of any <hi>clandestine proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> against him. They went openly to work in all that ever they did: told him at first, when he called them together, what he should look for at their hands: yea, and when they sued unto him, to sign their Bil for continuing the Parliament; they plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared, how they would serve him: that they would seize first upon his Magazines and Navy; and then raise a bloudy War against him: that they would separate his Wife from him, and hunt his Person up and down the <hi>Kingdom:</hi> rob him of all his Wealth, and the Hearts of his people: they foretold him of all; nor had they ever any private Conventicles before hand, to plot their businesse, nor since their meeting, did they ever make use of a <hi>close Committee:</hi> They never had any <hi>Clandestine</hi> packing with those of <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor with any other, of any other Nation; but have done all things clearly, and in the face of the Sun: If ought hath befel the <hi>King</hi> to his dislike or distaste, he may thank himself only for it: for he knew their minds before hand, they hid nothing from him; and therefore it must needs be granted, that the <hi>King</hi> doth very ill, to use any <hi>Clandestine proceedings</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such honest plain-dealing men, as those be, that sit at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But (by the way) what are these <hi>Clandestine proceedings</hi> trow
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:29718:106"/>
ye? why we must look into these his Letters for them, wherin we shall finde him plotting with his Queen, about bringing the Treaty at <hi>Uxbridge</hi> on foot againe, and to make her the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof: (could there be but a pre-assurance, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells would submit to reason) <hi>Thou</hi> (saies he) <hi>art the fittest Person, to be the meanes of so happy, and glorious a worke, as is the peace of this Kingdome. Pap.</hi> 2. (was not here <hi>Clandestine proceedings</hi> now, and a dangerous conspiracy against them at <hi>Westminster,</hi> who are resolved to have no peace, till all be destroyed?)</p>
                     <p>Againe, he doth advise his <hi>Queen,</hi> (being in <hi>France</hi>) to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether <hi>Lenthall the Speaker</hi> (according to his own brag) doth keep a strict intelligence with the Cardinall <hi>Mazarine, Though I will not swear</hi> (saies he) <hi>that</hi> Lenthall <hi>says true, yet I am sure 'tis fit for thee to know. Pap.</hi> 1. Here was another <hi>Clande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine businesse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And further he doth consult with her about supplies of Men, Monies and Powder, for defence of his life against them of <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster, Pap.</hi> 3. and gives her direction for the conveyance of it in some other Papers: (a businesse <hi>Clandestine</hi> and shrewd too:) And in Paper 6. he assures her in private, that <hi>Hertogen, the Irish Agent was an arrant Knave,</hi> (a particular which might concerne the <hi>men of Westminster,</hi> and touch them more close, then perhaps every body will yet beleeve) Besides, in most of these Letters, we shall finde the King, and his Queen comforting and suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting each other, under their heavy burdens, with mutuall intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perfect love, and patheticall expressions of conjugall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: All which, are notable proceedings indeed against them at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and great obstructions to their endevours, which are to breake the Hearts of both, and sinke them to their graves presently: And thus we see the nature and danger of the first par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in the Charge, concerning <hi>Clandestine proceedings,</hi> which are so evident, that we can say nothing against it.</p>
                     <p>The 2. followes, the proof whereof, is more and obscure: and that is <hi>condemning all that are in any degree Protestants in Oxford;</hi> by which they would have it beleeved, that the King is so great an Enemy to <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion, that his very friends at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> who have forsaken all they had for his sake, are hated by him for their Religion sake, so many of them as are <hi>Protestants in</hi>
                        <pb n="178" facs="tcp:29718:107"/>
                        <hi>any degree:</hi> But how this is manifest in these his Papers, we are to seek, for though these men have forehead enough to affirme it, yet their fortune is not good enough to prove it. Indeed we find the King in his Letters to <hi>Ormond, Paper</hi> 16. and in his Directions to his Commissioners at <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> taking great care, and giving strict Charge, for the preservation of his <hi>Protestant</hi> Subjects in <hi>Ireland;</hi> but in no place can we see so much as a sillable tending to the condemnation of <hi>Protestant Religion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But these men cannot leave their old trade of Taxing the King with their own Conditions: Heaven and Earth can witnesse, that never was there in England, greater enemies to <hi>Protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> then themselves have been; never was there so much <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Bloud</hi> spilt in this Nation, since the beginning of the world, as hath been by their meanes within these foure years: Never was <hi>London</hi> so full of <hi>Prisons;</hi> never the <hi>Prisons</hi> so full of <hi>Protestant Divines; Protestant Nobles, Gentry,</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> of all sorts, as they have been, since these <hi>good men</hi> kept Court at <hi>Westminster.</hi> Besides, how they have Countenanced and brought into the Church, all kinde of Sects and Heresies to the ruine of <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantisme,</hi> which the King for the Honour and Health thereof, was alwayes carefull to suppresse and keep out? How have they maintained and preached Doctrines of Devills, <hi>scil.</hi> of strife, murder of Brethren, Rebellion against Princes, oppression of neighbours; and practised the same; which are all directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to the Religion of the <hi>Protestants?</hi> How have they aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> established by <hi>Parliament,</hi> to be the <hi>Protestants</hi> publick forme of Worshiping and serving God in this Kingdome? Had the King done but any one of these things, or were he not himselfe a most constant and zealous Professour of <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion in his daily practice, these men might happily have had some Colour, for this their confident Charge against him: and so to have created suspitions of him. But seeing all things are so cleare contrary, we learne onely thus much from this particular on their charge, that they are men, whose hearts are not overspiced with honesty: They passe not what they say, nor with what face, so they say no truth.</p>
                     <p>The third particular which they load their King withall, is<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Tolleration of Idolatry to Papists:</hi> which they speak, as if Idolatry
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:29718:107"/>
                        <hi>sub eo nomine</hi> were already allowed, and set up by the Kings Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, in contempt of God and true Religion, and so (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse) they would have it apprehended.</p>
                     <p>Reasonable men will yeild that there is a difference betwixt Idolatry, and the Penalty thereof; the penalty may be suspended, altered, or taken away for the time, and yet the sinne it selfe not tollerated or allowed: These doubty Champions will not yeild that their Parlia. have granted a tolleration to Adultery, though they have abrogated the penal Lawes against that sin, and so taken away the meanes to punish it: Nor can they prove that the King hath promised any more to Papists, then the Parliament hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready granted to fornicatours.</p>
                     <p>In their after-notes, (where they make repetition of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) they referre the Reader to <hi>Paper</hi> the 8. for their ground of it: In which we finde the King relating to His Queen, <hi>how the English Rebells had transmitted the Commands of Ireland, from the Crowne of England to the Scots:</hi> an expression worthy (by the way) to be observed by all <hi>Englishmen,</hi> that regard the honour of their Nation, considering that the King Himself is a <hi>Scot,</hi> and that the <hi>men of Westminster</hi> intend, if they cannot kill Him, to thrust Him and His Children, (as some of their Hang-bies have whispered) to His Ancient Inheritance in <hi>Scotland;</hi> when they have made use of His People of that Nation, to help to destroy His Kingly Power here, not one <hi>Scot</hi> of them all, shall have any footing, or any more to doe in this Kingdome: I say, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this, every true Englishman hath cause most highly to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the King for His Justice unto, and His care of the dignity of the English Crown. But to proceed; the King tells His Queen, that, by that Act, (that base and ignoble act) <hi>He found Reformation of the Church, not to be</hi> (as they pretended) <hi>the end of this Rebellion:</hi> and concludes, <hi>it would be no piety, but presumption rather in Himselfe, not to use all lawfull meanes to maintaine His righteous Cause:</hi> And as one mean to that purpose, not thought of before, He gives His Queen leave to promise in His Name, that all <hi>penall Lawes</hi> in England, against Roman Catholicks shall be taken away: <hi>as soone</hi> (sayes He) <hi>as God shall inable me to doe it; upon this Conditiion, so as by their meanes, I may have so powerfull assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, as may deserve so great a favour, and inable me to doe it.</hi>
                        <pb n="180" facs="tcp:29718:108"/>
Now how truly from these words, that accusation is collected, let the Readers Judge: Here they see, is no absolute grant, or tolleration of Idolatry (as they pretend) but only a conditionary promise of withdrawing the penall Statutes against the <hi>Papists</hi> His Subjects, if by their meanes, He may be delivered from this bloudy raging, and malicious persecution of the <hi>Puritans,</hi> and settled in His power and throne again.</p>
                     <p>And well may the Papists expect as much favour from the King for such a service, as Adulterers have had already from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>gratis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor perhaps will the King appear so aboundantly culpable in this case (as these men would have Him) if these 3. following par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars be well considered upon.</p>
                     <p>1. The lawfulnesse of using the ayde of Papists, specially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing His own Subjects, in case of life and extremity, of which I have spoaken somewhat before <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 80.</note> to which I referre the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                     <p>All that the Enemy can object is, the Kings Resolution to the contrary at the beginning of this Rebellion: His words to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, they faile not to alleadge in the end of their observations, <hi>Pag.</hi> 55. where also they tell us, that <hi>the King made a strict Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation for the punishing those of that Religion, that should presume to list themselves under Him;</hi> and <hi>that a way by Oath was prescribed for discrimination of them, and instructions granted to the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners of Array in all places to dis-arme them.</hi> All which doth but speak His Majesties full purpose of keeping his Resolution, for the King doubtlesse did verily beleeve, (till experience taught the contrary) that <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion had such a power in the hearts of those that pretended so much unto it, that they would never suffer Him (their Soveraigne and protectour) to stand in need of the help of <hi>Papists</hi> to defend Him. And these men (in the same place) confesse, <hi>that at the battle of Edge-hill, the Papists were taken into the Kings Army of meere necessity:</hi> and they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge (in scorne) the excuse (as they call it) which the King gave for the same, namely, <hi>that by law, they were prohibited Armes in time of peace, and not in time of Warre:</hi> which distinction (say these) <hi>bore date long after the Warre begun, but that was want of invention only:</hi> perhaps so, for who could have beleeved that men
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:29718:108"/>
of their pretendings, should prove so highly vile, and base, as they have done in driving their King to such exigents? or that the People of our Religion should prove so ingratefull, as to leave their Soveraigne, and protector so desolate, as that contrary to His own Resolution, He must be forced in defence of His life, to use those of another Religion, and be put to excuse Himself by that distinction? This makes me remember, that in <hi>Seneca,</hi> when <hi>Hercules</hi> familie was abused: <hi>Ingrata tellus nemo ad Herculeae Domus auxilia venit, vidit hoc tantum nefas defensus Orbis.</hi>

And the particular moving him at that time, to think of this meane of procuring assistance from his Subjects of that Religion, was (as appeares in the Letter) His discovery that the <hi>English Rebels</hi> had (so much as in them lay) transmitted the command of <hi>Ireland</hi> from him to the <hi>Scots:</hi> Which might easily perswade him, that their purpose was to take that of <hi>England</hi> unto themselves; and so his whole Authority in all his Dominions being totally rent from him, and divided amongst them, he was like to be but a <hi>Sans terrae,</hi> or a Cipher signifying just nothing in his three Kingdomes: which also spake plainly to his Conscience, that it was nothing lesse then Reformation of Religion, what ever was pretended, that the <hi>Puritane</hi> Rebels aymed at; upon which considerations he concluded with himselfe, (as the Letter infers). <hi>That it would be no Piety at all, but plain Presumption in him, to neglect any lawfull meane for defence of himselfe, and that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which God had entrusted him withall:</hi> or still to stand upon <hi>scruples,</hi> (which word the malitious Observatours <hi>Pag.</hi> 45. would have the people take speciall notice of) and truly what is it but a <hi>Scruple,</hi> a needlesse <hi>Scruple,</hi> for any to question, whether a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi> Prince, should use the helpe of <hi>Papists</hi> in case of necessity, to defend himself in his naturall rights, and Royalties? it being
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:29718:109"/>
not onely lawfull, but according to his Office and duty, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his Crown and Dignity, by the help of his Subjects of what Religion soever: they being by the providence of God lotted under his Government, as the proper meanes and Instruments for that very purpose. Wherefore (now at length) though the King had not hitherto, (as himself saies) though of this meane, (<hi>scil.</hi> with intent to use it) yet upon this occasion and consideration, <hi>I give thee leave,</hi> (says he) <hi>to promise in my name that I will take away,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>3. The thing promised, which is the <hi>taking away the penall Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes against the Papists, provided</hi> (that in this his necessity) <hi>they afford him that powerfull assistance, as shall inable him to do it.</hi> And truely if <hi>extraordinary successe,</hi> be such a full proof of a good cause, (as these Libellers would now have it) and the King, by the assistance of his <hi>Popish</hi> Subjects, should obtaine the same against his <hi>Puritan</hi> Rebells; then their cause and Religion must for another while, be concluded the best; and (this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being fore-swallowed,) much wrong should they have, in the worlds deeme; if (at least) He whom they have ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, should not suffer them to enjoy the free use of it under his protection.</p>
                     <p>And (besides) if we do but consider, the Carriages of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells themselves, what allowance they have given, and what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises they have made, to men of all Sects, and Religions, for to purchase their assistance, in taking from the King his inheritance and Authority: What advantages they have made, of the Kings fore-mentioned purpose, and promise, not to use the ayd of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists:</hi> How they have sued for that assistance, which he resolved against, and have entertained many of that Religion into their Armies; and what proffers they have made, to those whom they could not prevaile with to help them, only to sit still, and not help him. I say, if we consider of these things, this promise which the King made, will not appeare so unreasonable to men of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, as these would have it.</p>
                     <p>But they Accuse the King (afterward) <hi>for offering this to the Queen, in behalf of the Papists, without either her or their request.</hi> It may be easily beleeved, that they have sued for it heretofore: Besides, if it be but considered, what the fashion of the world is
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:29718:109"/>
now come to be; since the <hi>Puritans</hi> pricked up their ears: Namely, to Capitulate, and bargain with their King, for what they shall have, and what he will grant, before any duty or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice shall be afforded to him: and then too, if it be remembred, what large and unreasonable demands, the Kings worst deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving subjects, do require at His hands, onely for the purchase of life and peace to himselfe and his people: No man will wonder, if the King do think, the <hi>Papists</hi> will look (at least) for Liberty of Conscience, and Religion under him, when by their meanes the land is restored to tranquility, and the King to his Crown and dignity: For (doubtlesse) the Religion of the <hi>Papists,</hi> is as dear to them, as the Religion of <hi>Miles Corbet, Edmund Prideaux,</hi> and <hi>Zouch Tate,</hi> (the three chief examiners of the Kings Letters) is to them; and may with as little detriment to any Church or State be tollerated.</p>
                     <p>And besides, the Penalty which the King promiseth to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, is not as (I conceive) to be levied upon the <hi>Papists,</hi> meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because such: for it may be exacted upon others also though of another Religion, if they be guilty of these particulars: <hi>Scil.</hi> if they shall refuse to take the <hi>Oath of Supremacy and Allegeance</hi> to the King. 2. If they shall <hi>Raise disturbance in the Church or State.</hi> 3. If they shall <hi>Seduce the Kings Subjects,</hi> from their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Obedience. 4. If they shall <hi>Refuse to come to Church</hi> once in a month, (at least) or to hear Divine service. 5. If they shall, (many of them together) <hi>Keep private Conventicles,</hi> and meetings; in such cases onely, (as I conceive) the Laws are in force against Papists, and against all men else as equally, of what Religion soever: Wherefore let any man of understanding and justice speak, whether these fault-finders themselves, be not under the same Penalties, as deeply as ever were the <hi>Papists:</hi> Have not they renounced the Oath of Supremacie and Allegeance to the King, by making a new Oath, and placing the Supremacy in the Heads of their faction? Have not they raised such distractions and Rebellions in Church and State, as the like was never known? Have not they had their private meetings in all places of the Kingdome, and seduced thousands of the Kings Subjects from their duty and obedience? Do not they refuse to come to <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer?</hi> Nay, have they not <hi>Abolished</hi> the same out of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:29718:110"/>
Churches, that no man at all might come unto it? May they, (do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these things, and indeavouring the Kings destruction withall) be freed from the <hi>Penalty</hi> of these Laws? And may not the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi> remaining in their due obedience, and assisting their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne against his Enemies, according both to Law and duty, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably enjoy the same freedome? though peradventure they come short of one of the particulars; which perhaps too, is not so much out of Malice, (as in these others) but out of ignorance and mis-information: and that is, <hi>not coming to Common-Prayer:</hi> to which neither can they come now, (if they had a mind) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is taken away by those very men; who would have the <hi>Statutes</hi> still in force against the <hi>Papists,</hi> for not allowing of that which themselves with all contempt and scorn have abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished.</p>
                     <p>But in the last <hi>Page</hi> of their Notes, they Object in this case also, the Kings resolution, and promise, <hi>not to Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish these Lawes,</hi> but to joyn with his <hi>Parliament</hi> in suppression of <hi>Popery.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In answer to which, let what hath been said already, be well remembred; and withall how they that call themselves His <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamant</hi> have not suffered the King to concurre with them: but have opposed and persecuted him, ever since he declared that his Resolution, to the end he might not be able to pursue the same: Yea, How themselves have compelled him, (in the continuance of his affliction,) to do that which they cry out upon him for; &amp; have endeavoured all they could to force him further, had not a great measure of Divine grace upholden him: He may justly complaine of them, as <hi>David</hi> did of some in his time, <hi>They have</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Sam. 26. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>driven me out from abiding in the inheritance of the Lord; saying, go serve other gods.</hi> They have done what they could to violence him from his Religion, and to force him to be a <hi>Papist,</hi> according as they voiced him. Never Prince had greater temptations and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements, yet never Prince was more constant in his Religion, blessed be the Majesty of Heaven for him. A perpetuall disgrace will it (questionlesse) be to <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion, (in the eyes of all the world beside) that any pretending to it, should shew themselves so unworthy, as to suffer so gratious a Prince to stand in need of <hi>Papists</hi> to defend him; much more that they should by
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:29718:110"/>
ill usage, force him with such promises to seek their ayd; but that they should accuse him also for doing the same, after they have inforced him to it, we must needs cry out, <hi>O nullo scelus credibile in aevo, quodque posteritas neget!</hi> the Height of their villany is the only advantage they have, that it wil not be believed by posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Wel (I say) let all those particulars be thought upon, by all sober men of this Age, and if they be not sufficient, (in their judgments) to plead the <hi>King</hi> Excusable in this case, then let them remember (as they were advised before) that the <hi>King</hi> is a man, (as others are) and in his extremity he declared himself, to be <hi>the Son of David, and the Son of Abraham.</hi>

                     <p>Now if to preserve the lives of <hi>Protestant</hi> Subjects, (impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible otherwise to be done) if to keep <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Regal Power</hi> from subversion, be not two sufficient grounds to excuse (at least) a Christian Prince in a disabled condition, for the Consenting to a present Peace, with the vilest Murderers in the World; I know not what is. Yea and beside, if the Conditions be observed, which the King (in his low estate) requires, to have this Peace granted upon, perhaps they may speak the same very commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>It must be such a Peace as must not be against His Conscience and Honour.</hi>

                     <p>However these Calumniatours please to interpret, to me it seemeth, that this <hi>Peace</hi> with the <hi>Irish,</hi> is like that which <hi>Solomon</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 King. 2.</note> made with <hi>Shimei.</hi> That wise <hi>King</hi> laid such an injunction upon him, for the grant of his life, as he foresaw he was likely to break, and so would come afterward to a due punishment of his former offences: and even so hath our <hi>King</hi> done, in that his grant: for doubtlesse it is as hard a thing for the Irish to abstain from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing to <hi>Rome,</hi> or to continue long in their due obedience, as it was for <hi>Shimei,</hi> to forbear going to <hi>Gath,</hi> when he heard his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant was run thither: and by that time, the <hi>King</hi> (through Gods assistance) may be able to do justice upon them, according to their merits.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Kings</hi> (what ever people think) have choice spirits, differing from those of other men, are better guided, as being in a special sort in Gods hand, which directs them in using a connivent leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where a sharp insight or notice, may work a greater damage for the present. In matters of Government, (which every one that can find fault with, skilleth not in) such accidents fall out somtime, that the Prince must not stand to ask, what may be done by law; but must do what is necessary to be done in that case. <hi>If a Cholerick man,</hi> (as one saies) <hi>be about to strike, I must not go about to purge his Choller, but to break his blow.</hi> So doth the <hi>King</hi> in this case: He labours to break the blows of the Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Irish</hi> that they may fall no longer so heavy upon his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Subjects. Time was when He would have gone in person, to have purged their Choller, and to let them bloud, and so have redeemed his poor afflicted people, from their fury, in a more Kingly way; only his <hi>good Subjects</hi> here, that take upon them to command him, would not give him leave so to do: wherefore he must now do as he may, and not as he would. And surely if those <hi>Abbots of Westminster,</hi> that sit there at ease, fatted with the wealth, and pleasures of the <hi>Kingdom;</hi> sporting themselves with reports of bloud and slaughter, had but any sensible feeling of those miseries, which our poor <hi>Protestant</hi> Brethren in <hi>Ireland</hi> do indure, by the continuation of that War, they would be
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:29718:112"/>
glad of a peace upon any condition; so it were but with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of Conscience and Religion. But they (as is conceived) were the first kindlers of the fire there, thereby to gain advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to themselves, of raising combustions here: and as their phrase, so their fashion is, <hi>to go through with the work, Ergo,</hi> til there be a total ruine, and desolation of all, they wil admit of no peace in either <hi>Kingdom;</hi> wherefore the <hi>King</hi> (as the case then stood) went the only right way, at that present, by a pacification with the rebellious <hi>Irish,</hi> to inable himself to suppresse the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious <hi>English,</hi> (those roots of war, and seeds-men of sedition) and so to recover a Capacity sufficient to correct all offenders, and settle a firm tranquility among all his Subjects.</p>
                     <p>But these Accusers at the end of their Notes <hi>Pag.</hi> 55. do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject divers of the Kings expressions, against the doings of the <hi>Irish,</hi> which (as they apprehend) this his consent to agree with them did contradict: <hi>His words</hi> (say they) <hi>once, were these: We hope the lamentable Condition of</hi> Ireland, <hi>wil invite us to a fair in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, and unity, that we may with one heart intend the relieving and recovering of that unhappy Kingdome, where those barbarous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, practice such inhumane, and unheard-of outrages upon our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable people, that no Christian eare can hear without Horrour, nor Story parallel. And at another time</hi> (say they) <hi>thus the King speaketh: We conjure all our Subjects, by the bonds of Love, Duty, and Obedience, that are precious to good men, to joyn with us, for the recovery of that Kingdom. Also in</hi> July (say they) <hi>at the Siege of</hi> Hull, <hi>He conjures both Houses, as they wil Answer the contrary to Almighty God, to unite their force or recovery of</hi> Ireland. And in <hi>December</hi> the King answers some Irish Protestants thus, <hi>Since the beginning of that monstrous Rebellion, I have had no greater sorrow, then for the bleeding Condition of that Kingdom.</hi> Truly their bare repetitions of these pathetical expressions, and desires of their Soveraign, (with which themselves were no whit mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to unite with him in so pious and Charitable a work) doth plainly discover them to be none of that number of <hi>good men</hi> whom the King <hi>conjured,</hi> nor to have any fear in their hearts of Almighty God. And doing the same to this end, <hi>viz.</hi> (as they hope) to disgrace the <hi>King,</hi> who at the end of their relation, they blush not to tax <hi>for his laying the blame of the Irish miseries</hi>
                        <pb n="189" facs="tcp:29718:112"/>
                        <hi>upon the Parliament, (i. e.</hi> upon the faction so called) which if he should not do, he would sin highly against God and the Truth. I say to repeat those his expressions to this end, (as they do) doth witnesse them to be given up to Reprobate sense, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the most hardened condition of impenitency: And thus have I done also with the fourth particular.</p>
                     <p>There remains now only to observe the other Circumstances<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> annexed to this their Charge for aggravation; taken from the manner of working, whereby these things are said to be effected <hi>in a close trading way:</hi> and from the end; <hi>for meer particular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</hi> I shal answer both these together, in a word, thus;</p>
                     <p>The <hi>King</hi> writes Letters to his <hi>Wife,</hi> and his <hi>Wife</hi> to him again, wherin they communicate their hearts and minds to each other: Now because they did not shew those their <hi>Letters</hi> to the faction at <hi>Westminster</hi> before they sent them, and crave their approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what they had written; therefore they are here accused to go in <hi>a close trading way,</hi> and <hi>to ayme at their own particular advantage,</hi> by certain men, who (as must be supposed) did never do any thing covertly in their lives, nor seek themselves in any matter. But how close and selfish they have (indeed) been, in their proceedings, I have hinted already, and the world hath too sharp a sense of it. Had the <hi>King</hi> from the beginning bin more close and reserved; perhaps ere this, he had quite blown them up: at least (as by a counter-mine) had given a check to their proceedings, and therein done no other, then what became a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick General, whose wisdome 'tis to out-go his Enemies in their own way, and to beat them at their own weapons: But the Kings sincere and plain dealing hath added much (through their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse) to his own undoing: and yet now at length, writing but a few words in private to his own Wife, about his own ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary preservation, because he did not acquaint them with it before-hand, he is inveighed against, and cried out upon, for <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in a close way, for meer particular advantage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the thing they intend chiefly by these words, is to perswade the world, (which is also the main drift of their whole Libell) that the design which the <hi>King</hi> drives at, is to advance Popery; &amp; to this end he useth <hi>clandestine proceedings,</hi> against <hi>them</hi> at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> (the only supporters as must be believed of Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:29718:113"/>
and <hi>condemneth</hi> (as they say) <hi>all that be in any degree Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants at</hi> Oxford: <hi>granteth tolleration of Idolatry to Papists, and indemnity to the murderous Irish;</hi> which (in regard of his many Protestations to the contrary) he being ashamed to own openly, is fain to betake himself to <hi>a close trading way,</hi> to pursue and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish.</p>
                     <p>In Answer to which grand <hi>Calumny,</hi> I shal only set down the extract of a Letter <hi>closely</hi> sent indeed, (that the world may most truly discern the <hi>Kings close trading way</hi>) by his Majesty to the Commissioners in <hi>Ireland,</hi> immediately after <hi>Nazeby</hi> Battail, when he was in <hi>Wales,</hi> and in a most low condition, written by the hand of the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> his Majesties Secretary, I wish I had the ful Letter it self to set it down <hi>verbatim,</hi> for I confesse this to be but the abstract of it, which I received from a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of most approved truth and Candour, as he did only bear the same in memory; which notwithstanding he is confident is but little (if at all) differing from the Original.</p>

He has there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commanded me to let you know, that were his condition much lower then it is, you shal never force him to any further concessions, to the prejudice of his Conscience, and of the true Protestant Religion, in which He is resolved to live, and for which He is ready to die, and that He wil joyn with any Protestant Prince; nay, with these Rebels themselves, how odio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I refer it to all mens Consciences, whether this be not a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient evidence of his Majesties sincerity and affection to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion, considering the estate wherein his affairs stood when this Letter was written; and also whether it doth not fully
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:29718:113"/>
confirm the truth of what I said in effect before, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>what ever concessions were made to the Papists and Irish, were rather by the inforcement of the Puritan Rebels, then by any inward affection of His Majesty to their Religion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But indeed it was needlesse to have alleaged any other of his secret Letters for this Evidence: For these which the Adversaries have here published, and declared to be Evidences of truth, do manifestly speak to this purpose; we read in the eighth Paper, how the King tels the Queen, that <hi>He differs from Her in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Religion.</hi> Are not these the <hi>Kings</hi> own Words which themselves have published? Was not this Letter sent (as wel as the rest) in a close trading way, as they call it? Do they think the <hi>King</hi> ever intended it should come into their hands? And when they laid aside many other Papers, as not fit for publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at this time, was not this thought fit to be divulged by their own wise selves? Is not this one of those <hi>Evidences of Truth</hi> (they speak of in the beginning) <hi>which to have concealed, would have bin a great sin against the mercies of God?</hi> Truly I dare boldly say, that neither the <hi>King</hi> for himself, nor any of his friends in his behalf, could possibly have given a better evidence to the abused Subjects of this Nation, that His Majesty is a true Protestant, then this is which his Enemies have given by their publication of that Letter: Surely the Finger of God was in it.</p>
                     <p>For peoples more clear understanding and notice of it, I wil set down the <hi>Kings</hi> Words as they stand in the Letter: Writing to his <hi>Queen,</hi> about that businesse of <hi>Ireland</hi> fore-mentioned, he speaketh thus,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I need not tel thee, what secres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>e this businesse requires, yet this I wil say, that this is the greatest point of confidence I can expresse to thee; for it is no thanks to me, to trust thee in any thing else but in this which is the only thing of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt us; and yet I know thou wilt make as good a bargain for me, even in this; I trusting thee (though it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern Religion) as if thou wert a Protestant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O what a discovery is here made of the <hi>Kings</hi> sincerity in his profession! When for an obligation upon his <hi>Queen,</hi> to make a
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:29718:114"/>
                        <hi>good bargain</hi> for him, he tels her in his most bosome expressions, that he trusts her to do it for him a Protestant, as if her self were one. The world may here see, though these Observatours them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves (who have helped us) wil not; that in the <hi>closest way of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> (according to their own phrase) which the King useth, he tradeth as a Protestant, and acknowledgeth in his most secret Letters to his Queen, that <hi>there is a difference</hi> (though it be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly difference) between <hi>Him</hi> and <hi>Her</hi> in matter of Religion.</p>
                     <p>And thus have I vindicated my Soveraigns Honour, against<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> this particular Charge also of his enemies; and do expect that I have hereby procured to my self, (though not deserved) from these men and their <hi>Faction,</hi> (whose basenesse I have in part de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected) the imputation and Title, of the <hi>falsest of men, a Papist;</hi> yea, of the <hi>falsest of Papists, a Jesuite,</hi> for it was voted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded before hand, that whosoever should do as I have done, should be so accounted.</p>
                     <p>But notwithstanding all that I have said in the <hi>Kings</hi> behalf, yet this I confesse to these men, so much as concerns the position in general, I am wholly of their opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> that whoever is guilty of those four things, <hi>scil. Of Clandestine proceedings against the Honour and being of Parliament; Of condemning all that be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants in any degree; Of granting a Tolleration to Idolaters; And of indempnity to Murderers;</hi> or that goes in <hi>a close trading way</hi> (to effect those things) <hi>for meer particular advantage, cannot be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by any, but such as deserve the imputation of the worst men.</hi> And therefore I am of opinion that all those, who take upon them to defend the men now above-board, who under the name of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> have not only <hi>undermined</hi> the <hi>King</hi> their Soveraign, but also the <hi>Parliament</hi> it self, in destroying its Priviledges, which they pretend to stand for: who have <hi>condemned all,</hi> to be Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pishly affected, that are <hi>in any degree Protestants at Oxford,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them by the odious names of <hi>Malignants, Papists, Devils, and Dogs;</hi> who have not only <hi>granted a Tolleration of Idolatry,</hi> but set it up, and persecuted with fire and sword, banishment and confiscation, all that wil not commit the same: (themselves whom they call the <hi>Parliament</hi> are the Idol, whom all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Kingdom must fall down unto and worship) who have also <hi>granted indempnity to the murderous Irish.</hi> For I would
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:29718:114"/>
have them but speak out and say, of what Nation and Religion their <hi>Plunket</hi> is of; Nay, let them tell the world (if they dare) what promises have been made from them, by their Instruments, (<hi>in a close trading way</hi>) unto that <hi>Plunket</hi> and <hi>Muskerry,</hi> (whom they Tax their King, for shewing countenance unto) upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they would but sit still, and not helpe their Soveraign. Who also have further yet, in a <hi>close trading way,</hi> cozened us their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Subjects of all we had, that was dear unto us, our Religion, Liberty, Peace, Wealth, and Friends, <hi>for their own meere par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular advantage,</hi> that themselves might rule alone, and bear the sway over our Soveraign, and our selves; over our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences and Estates; which they spoile and sell away accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their pleasures: I say, I doe verily beleeve that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be, that shall take upon them, to defend these men, under what colour and pretences soever, are as bad as the worst of men, yea, falser <hi>then the Papists, then the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites.</hi> But we will listen now to what these men adde farther; they say,</p>

so deeply lock'd with themselves in guilt and bloud, that they dare not leave them: I dare boldly affirme it, that many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of our <hi>English,</hi> had never been ingulpfed in those Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious wayes wherein they are, had they at first but been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the devises of Rebellious Heads; but now things are come to that height, that they know not how to disingage themselves, without a present ruine from them who have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged them. But hence (I say) it plainly appeares to be no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if the <hi>Irish</hi> Rebels did pretend the Kings Authority also, in the beginning of their accursed undertaking, (though whether they did or no, I cannot tell, for I did not hear them;) only this I am sure of, that they who published and printed those reports in this Kingdome, did hope thereby to work (as indeed they did) a disaffection in many people against their Soveraigne, that so themselves might be strengthned with their concurrence in their intended project against him, and all his friends that sided with him; with whom I may affirme they have even dealt as the <hi>Cyclops</hi> in <hi>Homer</hi> did with <hi>Ulisses</hi> and his Associates; who finde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no reason to misuse them, yet having a great desire to feed upon them, would needs perswade that they were Pyrats: So these not knowing any sufficient reason to quarrell with the King and his friends, or to stir up the people against them; yet having a great hunger after the Authority, places, Rights, and profits which they possessed, they would needs perswade they were <hi>Popishly affected,</hi> and were approving and consenting to the <hi>Irish Rebellion:</hi> And because the King would never be perswaded (as the people were) to yeeld himselfe guilty of those evils and miseries which (as themselves quote his words) <hi>He could never hear nam'd but with a bleeding heart;</hi> therefore they are pleased here to adde and say, that <hi>the King himselfe has not appeared with an open face in the businesse.</hi>

                     <p>Their meaning is, that now the King is made to shew his face, whether he will or no, and to appeare (as they think) such a one, as they have reported him: For those secrets which he would have to be kept close, (for feare they should discover him) are

His experience had taught him too well, that they studied to crosse him in all he did, and to mistake him in all he said; yea, so they might prejudice him in his Affaires, and in his peoples hearts, they cared not to go in the way of perversnesse, which (as the Apostle saies) doth lead unto their own destruction: which to prevent if possible, He gives the <hi>Queen</hi> and <hi>Ormond</hi> this Caveat, not to disclose some particulars mentioned to them in his Letters. But (as the saying is) <hi>no man can avoid his proper destiny,</hi> for they being (as it seemes) ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to stumble, <hi>and made to be destroyed</hi> (as S. <hi>Peter</hi> saies some be) shall not escape their meanes of ruine: these very <hi>Papers</hi> (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the <hi>Kings</hi> care) shall miscarry, and fall into their hands; whereby is administred to them, an <hi>occasion of falling,</hi> and so of perishing in their own Corruptions by their evill speaking; and perversely interpreting the things they understand not.

                     <p>There are (I confesse) a few particulars in these their Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which (as I remember) have not been touched upon, in the discussion of the former Generall; these I shall cull out, and only shew them (which will be enough) and so leave them to the world to be judged of. They begin at the end of the Kings Papers, their Observations thus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Much use may be made of these Precedent Papers, and many</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Libell.</note> 
                        <hi>things therein will appear very worthy our notice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In which they speak truth, and had not themselves been of too <hi>spiderous</hi> a nature, they might have made much good use of them indeed; and have noted from them, such dexterity of understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; such undantednesse of resolution; such fortitude of spirit in adversity; such conjugall faith and affections; such paternall care and pitty to his people, and such true Christian patience and piety to be in their Soveraigne; as cannot be altogether Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell'd at this day, in any Prince of Christendome. In a word, these Papers speak our King to be compleatly a Councellour, a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, a Gentleman, and a Scholler, and had he but trusted to himself more, and lesse to the advice of others, in the management of his Affaires; thousands of his Subjects from these his Letters, are most confident, that his enemies had not now been trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant.</p>
                     <p>But the notice of such mattters, serveth not the turnes of these men, nor can their coloured eyes, see any thing of this nature in these <hi>Letters;</hi> faults and errors, only are thought worthy their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance, of which they fancy, they have espied great plenty, in the King and Queen both.</p>
                     <p>The Queens faults, though (for shew sake) they have branched them out into many particulars, may all be reduced to one, and that is <hi>Loving of her Husband.</hi> Indeed they begin their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints against Her, with saying, <hi>She is implacable to our Religion, Nation, Government,</hi> but they can instance neither in word or action, to make the same appear conjecturall; only they tell us afterward, <hi>of her great care, that our Bishops be provided for,</hi> (and the blessing of God be upon her for it:) they hope that people doe still beleeve, that Bishops were enemies to all good, and therefore if the Queen doth but manifest any respect to them, in
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:29718:118"/>
their present affliction and persecution, it doth sufficiently speak her <hi>implacablenesse to our Religion, Nation, Government.</hi> Well, I wish with my soul, that the <hi>men of Westminster</hi> had proved themselves no worse affected, to our Religion, Nation, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, then the Queen hath done; for then I am sure, they had all still been in a most flourishing and happy Condition. But the Queen being the Kings Wife, must help to bear her Husbands Burden of blame as well as Sorrow; even as it shall please these His vassalls to cast it on Her.</p>
                     <p>Indeed they tell us also afterward, out of <hi>Paper</hi> 27. that <hi>the Queen desires the disbanding of the Parliament:</hi> in which perhaps they would have her thought an Enemy to our <hi>Religion, Nation, Government:</hi> But we shall first read Her words, and then we may judge whether they import such an interpretation: the Queen writing to the King from <hi>York</hi> saith: <hi>I understand to day from</hi> London, <hi>that they will have no cessation, and that they treat at the beginning of the two first Articles, and afterward of the disbanding of the Army; certainly I wish a peace more then any, and that with greater reason, but I would the disbanding of the perpetuall Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament first; and, certainly the rest will be easily afterwards: I doe not say this of mine own head alone, for generally those that are for you, and against you in this Country wish an end of it.</hi> These be the Queenes words entirely. She desires a peace more then any, and in order to that, she wisheth a disbanding of the perpetuall Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, because otherwise, peace is never likely to be had; and this is not the judgement of herselfe alone, but of all in generall: that are both for and against the King, in that Country: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if this be an Argument of the Queenes enmity against our <hi>Religion, Nation, Government,</hi> then all those that are both for, and against the King, in that County of <hi>York-shire</hi> are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as well as she, because they joyne with her in wishing an end to the Warre, and restoration of peace unto the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                     <p>But (by the way) I wonder why they should Tax the Queen with <hi>implacablenesse</hi> to our <hi>Government?</hi> is not <hi>that</hi> of our nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Monarchiall,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> of our Church Episcopall? and her Husband the Head and upholder of both? can the Queen then be beleeved to be disaffected to either of these? the men (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse)

                     <p>Let the Reader pardon this digression: her Majesties wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Innocence, and the truth did extort it from me: I return now to her Accusers: from whom I learn,</p>

                     <p>But truly, if I did not evidently see them to be given up to blindnesse of mind, by reason of that malice which is in them; I should much admire, at their folly in these their exceptions, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Queen. I dare say, that <hi>Henry Burtons</hi> Wife, or <hi>John Basticks</hi> Wife, might have done ful as much for their husbands, when time was, (had they bin in a like capacity) and bin no whit blamed by these men for the same: Nay, they should have been commended rather for such Testimonies of their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse and affection. O but the <hi>Queens</hi> fortune is to be the <hi>Kings</hi> Wife, and therefore she must not look to find such grace and favour in the eyes of these jolly men; as to have that in her not censured for a <hi>fault,</hi> which in mean women is entitled <hi>virtue.</hi>

These two last lines were scraped by <hi>Miles Corbet</hi> the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for the <hi>Printer</hi> to put into a different Character, that the Reader might the better observe, the Kings fault in them: But fearing the dulnesse of mens Capacities, (if let alone to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) these quick-scented <hi>Note-mongers</hi> have put too their helping hand, and Collected from them, that <hi>the King professes to prefer the Queens Health, before the Exigence, and importance of his own publick Affaires;</hi> and they hope that people will from hence believe, that he prefers his private Affections to his Wife, before the care of the whole Common-wealth; and therefore will judge it very fit, that he be not onely put by his Office, (for that he is already by his new Masters at <hi>Westminster</hi>) but also kept out for ever, and never trusted more, with any Affaires of importancy.</p>
                     <p>And further they accuse him, for <hi>avowing Constancy to his Wife, and</hi> (as they expresse it) <hi>to Her grounds and documents:</hi> which they would have the Reader apprehend to be, to whatsoever the Queen had already, or hereafter should propound unto him, concerning Religion, and the Government of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: to which purpose also, they say; that <hi>His Counsels are wholly managed by the Queen, though She be of the weaker Sex, born an Alien, bred up in a contrary Religion; yet nothing, great or small</hi> (say they) <hi>is transacted without her privity and Consent.</hi> And for this they quote <hi>Paper</hi> 38. by all which it is apparent, they would have it believed, that as divers mens <hi>Wives,</hi> (being of Masterly dispositions) do take upon them, to command their <hi>Husbands,</hi> so the Queen doth take it upon her, to rule the King, and all his Affaires: and as many men have submitted themselves to their <hi>Wives</hi> yoake, so hath the King yeilded up himself to his Queens direction: and therefore they hope that people have wit enough, to conclude from hence; that it is not fit the Government of this Church and Kingdom, should remain in such <hi>hands</hi> as heretofore; but rather in the <hi>hands</hi> of his <hi>Great and Wise Counsel,</hi> who are men, all of this Nation, and bred up in the Protestant Religion, and so fitter in all respects, then the <hi>Queen</hi> is, <hi>Who is one of the weaker sex, born an Alien, and bred up in a contrary Religion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This mischievous suggestion, (if swallowed for a truth) may be of dangerous consequent: and therefore I hold it necessary, to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:29718:122"/>
shew the falsity of it, which I shall plainly do, both from these letters which these Calumniators have published for their own pernitious purpose, and also from their own very words and confessions in another place of these their Annotations.</p>
                     <p>1. The <hi>Queen</hi> is far from that disposition, to take upon Her to rule Her Husband, wholly, and in all things, (as they would have it beleeved:) for the direct Contrary is most apparent in <hi>Paper</hi> 29. where She submits Her self, wholly to His direction, and desires Him to send Her His commands, concerning a particular business, that She was requested to write about, affirming that She neither would, nor durst, do any thing in it without His direction: Her words are these.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I thought it to be a matter of so great ingagement, that I dare not do it, without your Commnad; therefore if it please you, that I should do so, send me what you would have me write, that I may not doe more then what you appoint.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Had She been of such an imperious spirit, towards Her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, as these Her back-friends report Her, and would have Her supposed, surely, She had never writ, so like an obedient Wife for His Commands, and particular directions: Thus the Queen is cleared.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Neither is the <hi>King,</hi> (as they suggest) of so sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective a Nature, as to submit His affaires wholly to His <hi>Wives</hi> guidance, (were She, as She is not, ambitious of the same) He is more a man, then to forget himself to be an Husband; if the 34. <hi>Paper</hi> be observed, it will be clearly Evident, that the King was never so weakly uxorious, no not the first year of His marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, (when in most men affection prevaileth over judgement) as to lose any whit of His Husbandly Authority in matters of Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Government, He would not consent to any thing, (though of private concernment) which was either unfit for Her as a <hi>Wife</hi> to undertake, or for himself, as an <hi>Husband</hi> to permit: and is there any liklyhood, He should now have submitted all His publick Affaires, and Kingly Councells, wholly to Her manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet, and disposall? no man of wisdome or reason can beleeve it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="210" facs="tcp:29718:123"/>If that which is intimated in the said Letter concerning the Queens disposition, when She was young, and yet unacquainted with Her <hi>Husbands</hi> instructions, be compared with Her present dependance upon his Commands (already proved) and that abundant readinesse now in Her, to do Him service, (which these men so tax and blame Her for:) there will appeare to every Eye, not onely the Kings <hi>Pious discretion,</hi> and the Queens <hi>Godly obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> but also Gods <hi>gratious blessing,</hi> of his endeavours upon Her spirit: and doubtlesse this inward benefit received from him, is a ground of Her more strong, and fervent affection towards him: and makes Her resolve, rather <hi>to neglect her own health, yea to die by Famine,</hi> then to be failing in Her Negotiations for Him.</p>
                     <p>A full compliance in all things, but rarely found, between man and wife at their first meeting; nor is the same so perfectly effected afterward, in many persons, as is evident to be in this Royall paire; for either the Husband wants that <hi>Wisdome</hi> and <hi>care</hi> to work it, which the King had; or the Wife that <hi>goodnesse</hi> of disposition to be wrought upon, as was in the Queen: I could name some Lords and Gentlemen too, amongst the Kings ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who were never so notable for wit or honesty, as to seek their Wives Conformity in this Christian way, as their Prince hath done: But I spare them now, and return to the thing in hand.</p>
                     <p>It is probable (at least) by this time, that the Kings Councels, rule the Queen, and not the Queens Him: (as these slanderers say) but to put the matter quite out of doubt; let us listen to what these very men say themselves, to this purpose, in the next <hi>Page,</hi> where among other railing expressions against the King, (forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what they had said before) they affirm, that <hi>as He surpasseth the Queen in Acts of Hostility, so in the way of managing the same,</hi> scil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>with more close and deep secresie:</hi> and a little after they tell us, that <hi>He urgeth the Queen to make personall friendship, with the Queen of France,</hi> (they do not like the word friendship) and (say they) <hi>He doth furnish the Queen, with dexterous polli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

will looke into, for the further manifestation of their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie.</p>
                     <p>The fifth <hi>Paper,</hi> (from whence they collect, that the King <hi>vows Constancy to the Queens grounds and documents</hi>) was written <hi>Jan.</hi> 2. 1645. when there was a way making for the Treaty at <hi>Uxbridge;</hi> And a Rumor of somewhat the King would do, had beed presented to the Queen (as appears by the Letter) in the ugliest form, which also Her love to Her Husband might make more affrightfull, (perhaps it was that, He would trust his person among them.) But what ever it was, it seemes the Queen had writ thereof unto the King, in Her former Letter, and receives his Answer in these words.</p>

                     <p>Be it known (I say) unto you all, and remember it well, the end of all these warres and fightings against the King, is <hi>to destroy Monarchy</hi> in this Kingdome, and to keepe you the free-borne Subjects of it, in this turbulent, slavish, and underly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition whereunto a few of your Tyrannicall fellow-Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects have already brought you: they tell you sometimes, that 'tis the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdome onely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which they would have settled in good hands, and the King shall be King still; but your experience have taught you, that no <hi>hands</hi> are so <hi>good</hi> as his; neither can the Kings bare Title be able to defend you in your possession. They tell you that they will defend you; but you have payed for so much wit, as to judge of what you <hi>shall</hi> have, by what you <hi>have</hi> had already from them: therefore as <hi>no man having tasted old wine, straightway desireth new, (viz.</hi> if he be also acquainted with the relish of the new) <hi>for he saies the Old is better;</hi> so you having had a sufficient tast of both Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the <hi>Monarchicall,</hi> and the other new one (which we cannot yet tell by what name to call) have no reason by any meanes, to allow of <hi>this,</hi> since you are so sure that <hi>the old is better.</hi> In a word, let this Conclusion be rooted in your Hearts, which experience
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:29718:126"/>
hath in part confirmed unto your senses, that as the <hi>Moone</hi> and <hi>Starres</hi> would fall infinitly short of that bright Lustre, which now they have, if the <hi>Sunne</hi> were stripped of his abundant shining; so take from the <hi>King,</hi> his Royall Prerogative, let him be as a <hi>King</hi> and <hi>no King,</hi> and all the people great and small will quickly feel, that from his flourishing Condition proceeded all their happinesse.</p>
                     <p>I shall not here need to spend time in shewing the Excellency of <hi>Monarchy</hi> above all other Governments, and the fitnesse of it for this Nation; abler Pens have done that abundantly, since the beginning of this unreasonable Rebellion; only this I say, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce any other forme into this Kingdome, is a new thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet in being here, and therefore I apprehend such an Act to be a perfect <hi>opposition</hi> unto Gods <hi>revealed will,</hi> whosoever be the Agents in it; for as the saying is, <hi>Qui mala introducit, voluntatem Dei oppugnat revelatum in verbo, qui nova introducit voluntatem Dei oppugnat revelatum in rebus,</hi> and therefore I advise all States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men <hi>consulere providentiam Dei cum verbo Dei,</hi> to take Councell of Gods Providence, as well as of his Word, in cases of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But I returne again to these men.</p>
                     <p>Who would have us, by these their words, (of His Maj. soliciting the <hi>King of Denmark,</hi> and in him all other Princes) to take notice that he calls in forraign Aide: which fault they amplifie over and over in other places, for though themselves may, without offence or sinne, call in another Nation, and hire them (with I know not how many 1000. Pounds a moneth) to help them cut the throats of their Country-men; yea, and may make use of any forreiners in the world, of what Nation, Religion, or Spirit soever they be to help them to destroy and pull down <hi>Monarchy;</hi> yet the <hi>King</hi> may not without exclamation, desire the aide of a <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> Prince, no not of his neerest Kinsman, the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> to uphold the same. But what is the reason that the <hi>King</hi> must be confined to this restraint, &amp; themselves walk so much at Liberty?</p>
                     <p>Why they tell us, at the end of their notes, that <hi>the King had made resolutions and promises, that he would never bring in forreine forces.</hi> Which themselues indeed never did, nor ever intended, for doubtlesse they resolved at first, to bring their defignes to passe by any meanes, and rather then faile, to get assistance

                     <p>But these words of the King alleadged by these men against Him, do plainly discover to every honest eye, that His Majesties designe was, never to use any but His own Subjects; nor did He think it possible, (and the rather in regard of His own good me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits) that people so long instructed in Protestant Religion, should ever prove so ungratefull, as to force Him (their Prince) to stand in need of forreigne assistance: and therefore the Heads of the faction, having in their malicious policy, (to work feares and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies against Him) told the people, that the <hi>Popes Nuncio</hi> (that great Bulbegger) was soliciting both in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> the Kings businesse for forreigne aides: and of this they said they were advertized, from <hi>Venis,</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> yea, and from <hi>Rome</hi> it self; (with which it seems they held intelligence even from the very beginning.) <note n="*" place="margin">My selfe did heare (in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vignion) a Gentlemen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Cardinall Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barine menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by name one of their Agents, at Rome: and how many thousand pounds a yeare (he beleeved) he did there spend in his Negotiation, for them.</note> Now to remove this foolish vanity, and to retaine a clearnesse in His peoples hearts, the King expressed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in that sort unto them; assuring them that they were all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries against Him; and that he did wholly <hi>cast Himself upon the Affections of His people,</hi> and was confident that <hi>no sober man, could beleeve Him so senselesse, as to entertaine such a designe, which would have been so detrimentall both to Himself and His Kindom;</hi> and in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deed, if before he had tryed his own people, he had called in such Armies of <hi>Forreiners,</hi> as they reported, it must needs have been confessed a desperate part in him, &amp; a mean to have brought a suddain <hi>Destruction</hi> upon his Kingdome, and a perpetuall <hi>Infamy</hi> upon His Name.</p>

                        <p>The Story of the Rebels unchristian behaviour toward their Soveraigne, and his meeke and gracious Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age towards them, since the beginning of these trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles related by themselves, and their impudency therein noted.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THey begin thus: <hi>Notwithstanding all this</hi> (scil. the gratious profession forementioned, and patheticall quickning them for the reliefe of Ireland) <hi>the Parliament out of their Jealousie, did open the indisposition of the whole State, in a plaine and sharp Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance; to which the King Answers,</hi> (most mildely indeed, as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves witnesse, by alleadging his words to be these:)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For the preserving the peace and safety of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, from the designes of a Popish party, we have and will concur with all the just desires of our people, in a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary way. For</hi> Ireland <hi>we thank you for your care and cheerefull ingagement, for the speedy suppression of that Rebellion, the Glory of God in the Protestant Profession, the safety of the</hi> Brittish <hi>there, our Honour, and this Nations so much depending thereupon, &amp;c. your promises to apply your selves to such courses as may support our Royall Estate with Honour and Plenty at home, and with Power and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation abroad, is that which we have ever promised our selfe, both from your Loyalties and affections.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now mark these men: because the King had not answered
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:29718:130"/>
their rude Remonstrance, with a like stile and spirit as they did write it, they quarrell at him, and begin thus: <hi>Here are words that sound nothing but grace, and here is a cleare Testimony from the Kings owne mouth, concerning the merit of this Nation unto this day:</hi> the King had too good an opinion of them, and gave better words of them, then they deserved, and this was his fault; or else their thirst was strong for bloud, their fingers itched to be fighting with him; and because by his soft answer to their wilde and unparaleld provocation, they were delayed, and put off from doing mischief, therefore they open the mouth against him: their Consciences told them, that the words imported more <hi>Grace,</hi> then belonged unto them, therefore they cry, <hi>They are but bare words:</hi> and to perswade others thereunto, they adde, <hi>But notwithstauding these promises and Testimonies, the King discovers more and more regret for Straffords execution,</hi> (as if it were impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible the Kings regret for that, and these promises should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent) <hi>Yea and</hi> (say they) <hi>He sticks closer to the Councells of the same faction,</hi> (but who were of that faction, could never be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med unto this day, onely all in generall, that were <hi>Loyall</hi> and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the King, or hated Rebellion, Sedition and Bloud, since <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords</hi> death, have been esteemed of <hi>Straffords</hi> faction.)</p>
                     <p>Then they tell us of a Businesse, which they had published to the world, at least an hundred times before, and repeated over, (for want of other matter) nine severall times in one of their particular Declarations; and for peoples better observance of it, lest happily we had forgot it, they again relate it, scil. <hi>The Kings Charge of Treason against the six Members: His comming to the House to require Justice against them:</hi> (though they never menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how the King was provoked thereto, by their neglect, and contempt of his Messages, sent formerly unto the House to the same purpose:) <hi>And this</hi> (say they) <hi>was the fatall commencement of the Warre</hi> (now they had that occasion of quarrell so long thirsted after) <hi>for the House declares the next day, that themselves could not sit in safety any longer at Westminster,</hi> and thereupon adjourne for some dayes, and retire into the City, require a Guard, which the King dislikes, with these expressions.</p>

                        <hi>We are ignorant of the Grounds of your apprehensions, but protest before the face of Almighty God, had We any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or belief, of the least designe in any, of violence ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther formerly, or at this time against you, We would pursue them to condigne punishment; with the same severity, and detestation, as We would the greatest attempt upon Our Crown: And We do ingage solemnly the word of a King, that the security of every one of you from violence, is, and shall be ever, as much Our care as the preservation of Us and Our Children.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These words of the King (they confesse) were <hi>sweetly tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, but</hi> (say they) <hi>won no beli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>That his reception of such an unusuall request, is a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent instance of his singular estimation he hath of the good Affections of the City, which He beleeves in Gratitude will never be wanting to His just Demands and service.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From which they gather: That <hi>the King speakes nothing hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, but in justification of the Parliament and Peoples Loyaltie:</hi> it seemes he had not yet learned to amend his Errour, in speaking better of them, then they deserved.</p>
                     <p>Then they go on and mention the Tumults about <hi>White-Hall,</hi> of which they speak very sparingly, as if they had been raised neither by the rabble, as (they say) the King imputed them, nor yet by the Kings party, (as they had formerly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed) but by their owne very selves, saying, <hi>They a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to no Warre,</hi> viz. to no such bloudy Warre yet, as they intended.</p>
                     <p>Then they declare us two more of his faults. 1. <hi>The Kings declining the pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He might well think, they desired to have him Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the hands of the Rabble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore had reason to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for his safety by departing; wherein he did according to Christs example, when they would have thrown him down head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. <note n="*" place="margin">Luke 4. 30.</note> 
                        <hi>He departed from among them,</hi> (sayes the Text) <hi>and went his way:</hi> and according to <hi>Davids</hi> Example, who thought it no safe staying for Him in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> when <hi>Absolom had stollen away the hearts of the people.</hi> 2 Sam. 15.</p>
                     <p>Yet soon after (they tell us) the King sent them a message <hi>to state the differences between them on both sides, promising that when they shall be digested into a body fit to be judged of, it shall appeare what He will do.</hi> In this (sure) the King was in a great errour, thus to send to them about composing differences, when their intended work, was to make, and widen them rather: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wholly neglecting that particular, <hi>The House of Commons,</hi> (say they) <hi>the Lords refusing to joyne, did onely in Answer thereto requi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Militia by Law is subject to no Command, but His owne, which He will reserve to Himself as a principall and inseparable Flower of His Crowne, and professes to take care of peace, and the rights of the Subject, equally with His life, or the lives of His dearest Children.

                     </p>
                     <p>Surely here was enough from the mouth and hand of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious King to have prevailed with any, that had not before en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred

into a Covenant with Hell: <hi>But</hi> (say these men) <hi>the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament could not</hi> (because they would not) <hi>beleeve themselves secured by these professions, and asseverations: and the King would not</hi> (because He could not) <hi>understand, that the setling the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia at this time in confiding Hands, to prevent Civill War, was any other, then the taking the Crown from his Head. Hinc illa Lacrymae</hi> (say they.) So they are resolved (it seemes) at the very first, to raise a Civill War, unlesse the King would beleeve that he might put more confidence, in other men, then in himselfe, and that he might maintain his Crown and dignity, without having any Command over the <hi>Militia:</hi> Well yet notwithstanding all these affronts, put upon His Majesties <hi>faithfulnesse,</hi> and these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of His gratious Asseverations: The <hi>King</hi> (say these men) <hi>neverthelesse persists to declare his abhorrence of the Irish Rebellion, frequently inciting the Parliament to send succours,</hi> (which made them more averse thereto, lest the King should please himself, in thinking they regarded Him, or his desires in any thing, which (indeed) would have been, a very Grand errour in him.)</p>
                     <p>Then they relate, How <hi>the King abjures any privity to plots and designes against the Laws, and makes strict Proclamation for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them in execution against Papists,</hi> (who were reported to be the plotters) that so if possible He might give satisfaction. But the Parliament being resolved, do still pursue their own designe, and (as if it had been the onely Businesse, for which the King by his Writ did call them together) they still urge Him to settle the <hi>Militia</hi> upon them, <hi>And</hi> (as they remember us) <hi>upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusall so to do, (thoughts of peace being laid aside) they seazed upon the Towne of Hull,</hi> (His Magazine of Armes) <hi>without his leave, and held it out against Him,</hi> and so taught him to seize upon <hi>New-Castle: And now</hi> (say they) <hi>the Warre being thus far advanced, yet it is not agreed, which part was put to the Defensive,</hi> and (as it seemes) to resolve this, the 19 <hi>Propositions</hi> were dispatched to the King: which indeed were the meanes of Light to thousands in this Kingdome, of discovering the scope of their intentions, namely to be, to ruine the King, and to bring him into a worse Condition then his meanest vassals.

                     <p>BUt the maine thing in those 19. <hi>Propositions,</hi> (say these men) were <hi>Reformation of Church-Government: that power Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and Civill might be put into confiding Hands:</hi> and <hi>that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of Parliament might passe upon Delinquents;</hi> We grant they were; for these three containe all the rest. But here I must beg leave of the Reader to digresse a little, to speake a word of this last particular, having discussed at large of the two first already.</p>
                     <p>They had, or have two Reasons, for their requiring of the King, that <hi>Justice of Parliament might passe upon De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>2. <hi>To out-voice the Kings demand forementioned:</hi> for if they should not shew zeal against sinne, in calling themselves for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment to be done upon <hi>Delinquents,</hi> the world would think that the six Members (whom they rescued from a legall triall, which the King would have had them unto) might be very faulty, and that His Majesty had just reason to take Armes to bring both them, and their abetters to it; but to prevent this, they (<hi>by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, they take up Weapons to bring Delinquents to punishment</hi>) do avow the War to begin on their side, and so leave the King to be Defender. Although I must tell the world that this devise of <hi>bringing Delinquents to Punishment,</hi> was resolved upon, to be a chief ground of the <hi>Warre,</hi> some certaine moneths after the <hi>War</hi> was begun: I beleeve I could name the place and time, when it was first taken into Consideration, and upon what occasion; and though I nominate not the Persons, yet I may tell the story.</p>
                     <p>Upon a time, diverse of the Members were met together at a certaine <hi>easie Lords</hi> House in the Kingdome, (who was also in his Country, one of the maine Pillars of this rank faction) where in like sort were present, some of their Chaplaines, and amongst them, there was one Scholler; who I think (truly) was an honest man at that present, (and verily I beleeve, doth stil so continue) he being (like that <hi>Disciple which was known to the High Priest</hi>) well<note place="margin">John 18. 16.</note> acquainted with the Company, and therefore might speak more freely to them, and amongst them, then another man could be suffered to doe; and indeed so did: He moved them to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, while they were at Supper, or sitting at Table.</p>
                     <q>Gentlemen, you have begun a Civill Warre in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and you are come bere into the Country, to draw us further to your assistance, by requiring us to Associate with you: You shall doe well to declare what it is, that you doe bottome your Warre upon, and what is the cause of this your undertaking, that Seeing your Grounds to be lawfull and good,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:29718:133"/>
we may with the better Conscience concur with you: for though we take you to be wise, and honest men, yet it doth not become us to yeild you our blind obedience, in a matter of so High concernment as this is. Say therefore (I pray) for what cause doe you wage this Warre? Is it for Religion? Can you complaine of any restraint in that? Are not the Temples open? Have we not Liberty to Preach and professe the whole Truth of God? Is true Religion so freely exercised in any Nation under Heaven as here? Is not the King himselfe a Protestant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

What can you hope to get more by Warre, concerning this thing, then you may have, nay, then is offered to you in a way of Peace? Wherefore declare (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you) whether it be for <hi>Religion</hi> that you fight: and if so, what <hi>Particular in Religion</hi> it is, that you would have us joyne with you to maintaine and defend.</q>
                     <q>One of the <hi>Members</hi> that thought himselfe the best speaker, undertooke to Answer the Schollar, (for the Chaplaines (poor soules) were posed, they sat stil and said nothing: though some of them had been as far as Edge Hill.) And at length, did (after some shuffling) fairly confesse, being thus urged, that in very deed, <hi>it was not Religion they fought for;</hi> the Doctor asks, Why do you then pretend it to be so unto the people? His answer was, <hi>we shall never else win the people to us.</hi> Well, but what is it then? (replyed the Doctor) Is it the <hi>Abolition of Episcopacy,</hi> that you so contest about? You know God hath sufficiently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested his approbation of this Government, by his so abundant blessing of this Church and Nation under it: none in the world hath thrived better, nor so well under any, as ours hath done under this: you know also, that the King hath given you leave to punish, or to see punished in a regular way, all persons, that have miscarried themselves in the execution of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (without exception of any.) He hath given you power to see that all abuses in <hi>Discipline</hi> be removed, yea, and what ever is liable to exception in our <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Lyturgie</hi> to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, for the ease and satisfaction of tender Consciences: yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He hath yeilded to you, for prevention of injustice afterward,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:29718:134"/>
the taking away the <hi>High Commission,</hi> and hath left it to you to purge all Ecclesiasticall Courts beside; and as a pledge of Assurance against all growing Corruptions; he hath enacted a <hi>Trienniall Parliament,</hi> for the calling of ill officers, and faulty Church Governours to an examination, every three yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your selves. Now do you think that notwithstanding all these particular Considerations, that the <hi>Abolition of Episcopacy</hi> is a thing of that grand necessity, as to imbroile this whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Kingdome in its own Bloud?</q>
                     <q>The <hi>Member</hi> (being convinced also by these Reasons of this particular) answered, Truely it was not; but as the former, so this pretence also was to be used, <hi>to winne and hold the</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Let the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple observe by this, how they have beene cheated.</note> 
                        <hi>people.</hi> Why then (sayes the Doctor) will you tell us, what is the cause, why you fight? The Wiseman answered, <hi>to bring Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents to punishment:</hi> and so (for ought I know) the disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ended, for this is all that I heard of it.</q>
                     <p>But I would have any of them all, to name six <hi>Delinquents</hi> if they can, that were so declared to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they raised their first Forces; some 3. or 4. persons perhaps fled the Kingdome, but must the whole Nation bleed for that reason? 'Tis true (indeed) they fell afterward to make <hi>Delinquents</hi> apace, and all that would not renounce the <hi>Doctrine of Christs Gospell,</hi> which is a Doctrin of Loyalty and obedience, and which they had alwayes been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in; all that would not abjure their <hi>Oath of Allegeance,</hi> &amp; break that <hi>Protestation</hi> lately imposed by these very men, (which was <hi>to maintaine &amp; defend the Kings Person, Honour, and Estate</hi>) are looked upon as <hi>Delinquents,</hi> and persecuted as such, with fire and sword: yea, divers of the Members of both Houses <hi>who had</hi> (to speak in these mens owne phrase) <hi>so much Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and goodnesse in them, as not to desert their trust in Parliament,</hi> to their King and Country, by giving up themselves to their wills, are all become <hi>Delinquents</hi> too upon the suddaine, and to bring all these to punish nent, (that <hi>Justice of Parliament</hi> may passe unto them) are these Warres said to be undertaken and pursued: and when they have by their Votes, put all them to death, whom they have done wrong unto, perhaps they will sit still and be quiet, but not before. Well fare the good King yet, He named six <hi>notorious Delinquents,</hi> (whereas these men
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:29718:134"/>
never named any) and when he saw he could not have the <hi>Justice of Law</hi> against them, rather then make any further disturbance, he declined their prosecution; indeed he is blamed for his so doing by these men (as was noted before) but O that <hi>they</hi> had had the grace to have been guilty of such an errour! And thus much by way of digression in the case of <hi>Delinquency:</hi> I now return to their Story.</p>
                     <p>They tell us that the Answer returned to the foresaid Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions was, <hi>That if these things were granted, the King should remain but the out-side, but the picture, but the sign of a King:</hi> which very Answer (they say) <hi>was the Trumpet of War, and the sound of defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, scil.</hi> in their ears; who had a great lust to quarrel, now they had got weapons: but their misery was, the King stil crosses them, for He would not permit it to be so owned, <hi>Stil</hi> (say they) <hi>He saies, He intends not to fix any disloyal design, upon both or either House of Parliament: He is rather most confident of the Loyalty, good Affections, and integrity of that great Bodies good intentions; but the malignity of the design</hi> (He saies) <hi>hath proceeded from the subtile informations, mischievous practices, and evil Counsels of ambitious turbulent Spirits, not without a strong influence upon the very Actions of both Houses.</hi> Thus they of the King.</p>
                     <p>And the Result which they make of this their whole relation is two-fold.</p>
                     <p>1. To justifie themselves; which they would do from the Kings expressions of them: He did not give them such ill language as they gave him, <hi>Ergo,</hi> they would conclude themselves to be as <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> as they make him <hi>Faulty:</hi> to his words last alleaged they adde, <hi>this was the utmost Charge that could be then brought against the Parl.</hi> they argue a <hi>non velle ad non posse:</hi> He did not, or would not, <hi>Ergo,</hi> He could not: Let the Reader judge of this Argument.</p>
                     <p>2. To cast further blame upon the King, <hi>scil.</hi> for having a worse opinion of them now, then (by these expressions) he seemed to have had then, when he returned that answer to their 19. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions: <hi>Our Propositions</hi> (say they) <hi>at Uxbridge in</hi> Feb. 1644, <hi>being no other in effect then those of</hi> June 1642. <hi>This inference may be truly made, that the King hath no cause to look upon us now, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then as he did then: and if he have varied since from those Vows and Asseverations which He made then, the blame wil not remain on</hi>
                        <pb n="234" facs="tcp:29718:135"/>
                        <hi>this side, but on His; so that the bare calling to mind what hath been said by the King, is now sufficient for our purpose.</hi> These be their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect words: But how ill a consequent they make, and how false an inference this is: how truly little to <hi>the purpose,</hi> I have shewn already, and to what is there said, I refer the Reader.</p>
                     <p>They then fall to reckon up the Vows and Affeverations, made by the King, which they would have apprehended to be broken by him, which I have opened the nature of, and answered already also, yea and manifested evidently, that if the King hath swerved any thing from his primitive purposes, it hath been full sore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his will, and only by their inforcement. I adde but this, we find in the 11 <hi>Paper,</hi> these words of the King to his Queen, <hi>The breach of my Word, is that I hate above all things:</hi> and we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that the publishers of these Letters have told us, that what we find in them <hi>are Evidences of truth,</hi> and therefore we are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly satisfied concerning the Kings truth in his promises, what ever can be said by them to the contrary. Indeed we do believe that as Gods promise to the sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> did not bind him to the sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> no more doth the Kings promises to his <hi>Great Councel,</hi> tie him to his <hi>Grand Enemies. I said indeed</hi> (saies the Lord to <hi>Eli) that thy house should walk before me (scil.</hi> in the Priests<note place="margin">2 Sam. 2. 30.</note> office) <hi>for ever: But now</hi> (I say) <hi>they that Honour we wil I Honour, and they that despise me, shal be lightly esteemed:</hi> If holy <hi>Priests</hi> turn filthy <hi>Adulterers,</hi> or if good <hi>Subjects</hi> turn impudent <hi>Traitors,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth God, nor the King swerve from their former selves if they break with them: <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas</hi> might with as much justice have taxed God, as these men do their King.</p>
                     <p>But there remains yet one particular, and only one not replied unto, which I shal also now do, and so conclude.</p>
                     <p>They accuse the King of <hi>making War against his Parliament: Having</hi> (not only spoke so well of them, as before, but) <hi>renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all intentions of War:</hi> to which purpose they alleage chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Declaration at <hi>York, June</hi> 16. 1642. wherein (they say) are these words: <hi>We assure the World, in the presence of Almighty God, our Maker and Redeemer, We have no more thought of making War against Our Parliament, then against our Children: yea, and again in</hi> July <hi>the same year</hi> (after the date of <hi>Essex</hi> his Commission from them to War against him) <hi>He desires</hi> (say they) <hi>no longer the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection</hi>
                        <pb n="235" facs="tcp:29718:135"/>
                        <hi>and blessing of Almighty God upon himself, and his Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, then He and they shal solemnly observe the Laws in defence of Parliaments:</hi> Also in <hi>August</hi> 12. <hi>He acknowledgeth that the King and Parliament are like the Twins of</hi> Hypocrates, <hi>which must laugh and cry, live and die together.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These were the Kings words (say these men) <hi>It is true indeed</hi> (say they) <hi>afterwards, He was driven</hi> (by their making Wars up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him) <hi>to save himself by distinctions,</hi> saying, <hi>He had not disclaimed all War in General, but all invasive War; all War, but what was in order to his own defence:</hi> which distinction they scorn at, and say, <hi>it was not thought of, or fore-seen before:</hi> perhaps so, for it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the imagination or fore-sight of man, that any Subjects pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending as they did, being so dealt withall, as they were, should bring their Soveraig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to such a strait, or drive Him ever to use any <hi>Distinction</hi> at all.</p>
                     <p>Then they deride Him also for another, which they did put him upon, <hi>scil. That the King may defend himself, against a Parliament, but not fight against it; or He may assail a Malignant party in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and yet not touch the Parliament it self.</hi> And surely so He may: For as there may be a Malignant party in a Church or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, that may be assailed and corrected, and yet the Church or family it self, be no way damnified or hurt thereby, but bettered rather: So also in a Parliament; for as the whole Church of God, consisting of Head and Members, is said not to Erre in matters of God, though there be many wicked men in the Militant part thereof: so in matters of State, a compleat, and whole Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, consisting of Head and Members, may be said not to Erre, though there be many wicked ones amongst them, that deserve punishment. And they are not ashamed to say, that the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which they deride the King for, is good when themselves use it, but not when the King useth it: <hi>it wil hold</hi> (say they) <hi>on our side, but not on His.</hi> All things are lawful to them, but unto the King nothing is allowable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> (say they) <hi>by what distinction wil the King put a period to this pertual Parliament without violence? Or how can He deny it the name of a</hi> Parliament <hi>without hostility?</hi> As if they had said more fully out thus, <q>We are sure we have posed him in one thing, and put him to a non-plus: We had him on the hip, when by
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:29718:136"/>
feigning our selves honest men, we got Him to sign the Bil of continuation of the Parliament, which we resolve shall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall, and last for ever in despight of him: All his distinctions shal not serve his turn to put a period to that; He must do it by open force and violence, if he do it at all; but we by that fine Christian Policy of ours, in getting him to passe that Act, have got possession of so much strength and power, that we are able to keep it in being, for all the violence that he can use to the contrary: we have fastned him now upon the Crosse, wherefore if he be the Anointed of God, and would be so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, let him loosen himself (if he can) and come down; (but let him be sure he shal never do it without violence, if he can do it that way, and we are able to hold it out against him no longer) then we wil believe him, and acknowledge him. Confident we are, that he cannot, (at least he shal not) deny us the <hi>name</hi> of a <hi>Parl.</hi> without <hi>hostility:</hi> secretly indeed we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand by his Letters, that he doth not acknowledge us to be a Parl. though he doth it publickly: <hi>He imparts unto us the name, but not the thing;</hi> yea, but we having got all the <hi>Militia,</hi> by Land and Sea into our Hands, we are resolved to fight it out with him, in maintenance of our selves, and of our Title: we are a <hi>Parl:</hi> and we wil be a <hi>Parl.</hi> yea, and a <hi>perpetual Parl.</hi> too, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight of him, let him say and do the best he can to the contrary.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>These are pretty men (we see) every Age cannot shew their fellows: But (truly) if there was no othet reason for the King to desire and seek to put a period to their <hi>Parliament,</hi> this were alone sufficient, in that they call it <hi>perpetual,</hi> and intend so to make it, for the Kings Office and duty is, not only to give his people good Laws, but also to see, they have the use and comfort of them; now I would have these men, with all their wisdome, shew the world, how we shal ever enjoy the benefit of the <hi>Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennial Parliament</hi> (which was the highest Act of Grace ever gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the most likely foundation of future happinesse, that was ever layed for the Subjects of this Kingdom) wherein all corrupt instruments and enemies of their Countries welfare, of what rank soever, are to be called to answer for their demerits, and to be censured accordingly. I say, let them shew how possibly we can enjoy the benefit of this Act, unlesse a Period be first put to
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:29718:136"/>
this <hi>perpetual Parliament</hi> (as they call it) which indeed is rather a Combinanion of Tyrants Covenanted together, to enthrall their Country-men in perpetual bondage, a very Confederacy of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiratours against the Realm and Church: therefore 'tis undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly the Kings office and duty, as he wil answer it to Almighty God, to do his utmost to <hi>disband</hi> them, and to bring them to their <hi>Legal tryals,</hi> and this he may do without making War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his <hi>Parliament;</hi> nay, (in order to his solemn observance of the Laws) in <hi>defence of Parliaments.</hi> Yea, and all those that have taken the General <hi>Protestation,</hi> are bound by the same (as wel as by their <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi>) to aid and assist the King and His Friends, in the bringing <hi>to condign Punishment</hi> these dishonourers of Parl. who under the name thereof, have scandalized and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med its reverend esteem and dignity: and <hi>by Force, Practice, Councels, Plots, Conspiracies, and all other waies have done things contrary to every thing in the said Protestation contained:</hi> let all men read over their Protestation, and withall consider wel of these mens doings; and then speak their Consciences in this particular.</p>
                     <p>But further, to answer these men, though they think they have posed the King, when they say, <hi>How can he deny them the name of a Parliament?</hi> Yet let them know, that not only his Majesty, but all men else too of reason and judgement, may both deny them the name, and also prove that (in the truest and best sense) it<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 6.</note> doth in no sort appertain to them; for as S. <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>All are not Israel, that are of Israel;</hi> so may we say, <hi>All are not the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that are of the Parliament.</hi> As there was of old, a malignant party, that stood more upon the Title of <hi>Israel,</hi> then the true Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites did: so is there now a like company, that make more ado about the Title of Parliament, then those who are the true Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it, whose endevours rather are (as they ought to be) to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove themselves, by their actions, worthy of the name: our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour<note place="margin">John 8.</note> in the Gospel, disputes the matter at large, with those false Israelites, who pleaded lustily against him, (as these do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the King) that they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> Children, which our Saviour denies to be true, in the right and best sense, <hi>for,</hi> (saies he) <hi>You do not the works of Abraham, you go about to kill me, a man who hath told you the truth,</hi> (your Saviour and your Soveraign) <hi>so did not Abraham.</hi> I desire that these men would but seriously
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:29718:137"/>
in their consciences, consider whether this be not the very case: and if so, then let them be content, that the <hi>King</hi> should imitate the <hi>Son of God,</hi> in his thinking and speaking of them; and deny them to be a <hi>Parliament</hi> in the truest &amp; best sense, or some time (as they say he doth) yeild them a Parliament in publick, and yet se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly not acknowledge them so to be: for as S. <hi>Paul</hi> yeilds the Jews to be <hi>Israel,</hi> and yet not <hi>Israel;</hi> and as Christ yeilds them to be <hi>Abrahams</hi> Children, and yet not <hi>Abrahams</hi> Children: so the King may yeild them to be a Parliament, and yet no Parliament.</p>
                     <p>Again, as the <hi>Councel of Trent</hi> is denied by all the Reformed Churches of <hi>Germany</hi> and other Countries, to be a true Councel, because it was not free for all persons to come unto, with their Appeals, their Complaints, and their Reasons, (as Councels ought to be) for the honest Protestant party were not admitted a safe conduct, but in danger of their lives, if they did adventure to come, by the Maglignant and Popish faction, who bare all the sway, and were both Accusers and Judges; so upon the very same Ground may this Parliament be denied to be a true Parliament, for a Parliament ought to be free ('tis the special Priviledge of it) for all men, specially for its own Members, all of them ought to have liberty to speak their minds and consciences, and all the Kingdome beside to bring their grievances and petitions thither: But in this particular Assembly, which they call the Parliament, there is no such thing; for as at <hi>Trent,</hi> so at <hi>Westminster,</hi> the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and rebellious Faction alone, bear all the sway, they are both Accusers and Judges, they imprison, murder, persecute the honest side; yea, many of their own Members they have forced and driven away from thence, whereby in very deed, themselves have dissolved the very being of the Parliament, and made it to be no Parliament at all: indeed as that Assembly at <hi>Trent,</hi> is customa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily called a Councel, and therefore (perhaps) hath that appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion also, even among the Protestants: So the King may happily somtimes call that Assembly at <hi>Westminster</hi> a Parliament, but 'tis only fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> custome sake, and because 'tis so fancied by the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant party.</p>
                     <p>Once more, upon the very same grounds, that <hi>Rome</hi> is denied to be a true Church, by the men of this faction, (which we are troubled with) may themselves be denied to be a true Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:29718:137"/>
they say, <hi>Rome</hi> was once a true Church, at its first instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but now so many corruptions have crept into it, that it hath un-Churched it self, and is become no true Church of Christ: but even the very Throne of Antichrist, thus they: And thus may we say of them, they were once a true Parliament, at their first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution and meeting, but now they swarm so much in evils, are guilty of acting and authorizing so much wickednesse, that they have plainly un-Parliamented themselves, and are become no true Parliament, but even the Throne and Synagogue of Satan.</p>
                     <p>Besides, a true and compleat Parliament, (as every one knows) consists of Head and Members, of King and People; and as a man without an Head, is no true man; so a Parliament without the King, is no true Parliament. Indeed if the King should come to <hi>Westminster,</hi> and sit amongst them, and they behave themselves towards him (yet at last) as becometh <hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>Members</hi> of that Honourable Court, I know no reason but they may (by the Kings mercy and favour) recover again that truly honourable <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Title.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though some affirm, when both the Speakers fled<note place="margin">This was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the late Accident.</note> from them (in regard of these late tumults) that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Law, the Parliament was dissolved; <hi>The true Parliament,</hi> (they say) <hi>ran away, and that which now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth is an Adulterous Parliament, a very Junto, and there must of necessity be a new</hi> Writ <hi>from the King, to the making of a true Parliament.</hi> (But I leave that to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued by the Lawyers) My observation only shall be, of Gods Hand in that businesse: First, that themselves were driven away from the Houses, in the same manner, as by their procurement, the King and His friends were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. Secondly, that the Almighty by his permissive Providence hath exposed them, (who thought and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led themselves a perpetuall Parliament) to be denied to be any Parliament at all, by their own Adorers, and to become a publick scorn and derision, by the means or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of those that had so many years together paid
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:29718:138"/>
their devotions to them: Let all the world admire Gods wisdom: And <hi>let all that fear the Lord, praise his holy Name.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus all may see whither I have brought these men, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more properly whither they have brought themselves, by this their impertinent and peremptory question, <hi>How can the King deny us the name of a Parliament?</hi> They are proved to be no true Parliament, by the witnesse of Jesus Christ, (who is Truth it self) by the testimony of S. <hi>Paul</hi> in a like case, by the judgment of all Reformed Churches in Christendome, and by the evidence of their own dear selves and faction, in their way of opposition unto other parties: Wherefore stil may His Majesty in truth, and with a good Conscience say, as He did at first, <hi>We again in the presence of Almighty God, Our Maker and Redeemer, assure the world, We have no more thought of making War against Our Parliament, then against Our own Children.</hi> And He may desire stil <hi>no longer to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Protection of Almighty God, upon Himself and His Posterity, then He and They shal solemnly observe the Laws in defence of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments:</hi> for as yet He hath done nothing against His high Court of Parliament, nor ever wil He; for according to His owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, <hi>He, and that are like</hi> Hypocrates <hi>twins, they wil live and die together.</hi> 
                        <q>And let them not die, but live, O Lord our God; Let the King live, that Parliaments may not die; save thou Him, that this Kingdome may still be blessed with them; and in thy pitty to this poor Nation, break thou in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces this confederacy of rebellious men, who do so earnestly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour the destruction of both. Put thou a period to this false Parliament, (which they resolve shal be perpetual, in despight of Thee; O God, and of thine Anointed) that we may have the benefit of a true one, for the mending up of those great brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (which have been made by these Conspirators) upon our Religion, our Laws, and natural Liberties; yea, and upon our high Court of Parliament it self: This grant (O thou mighty Majesty of Heaven an Earth) for thine own Honour and Justice sake, and for the sake of Christ our Saviour.</q>

                     <hi>I</hi> Thought it requisite (in this new Edition) to prefix a few words to this following <hi>Parallel,</hi> because I understand that some few persons, (through inadvertencie) have taken offence thereat, and affirmed of me, that <hi>out of my zeale to flatter the King, I had blasphemed Christ,</hi> in comparing them thus together: Yea some of them, upon their bare view of those words in the Title, <hi>A Parallel between the sufferings of our Saviour and our Soveraigne,</hi> have presently shot their bolt, (as men byassed with ignorance and prejudice use to doe) and rejected the whole Book as unworthy their further inspection. Now though the ready and friendly acceptance which the same hath found with the Church and people of God, doth speake me cleare in the opinions of most<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that I need not say any thing to vindicate my selfe, from the inconsiderate cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of these few; yet because Soules are precious things, and I am for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden (as a Brother) <hi>to suffer sin to rest upon any:</hi> and commanded<note place="margin">Lev. 19. 17.</note> (as a Minister) <hi>to instruct with meeknesse them that oppose, or are contrary minded;</hi> therefore I must not slightly, and with contempt of<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 25.</note> them, passe by their errour, (as they doe my Booke) but will speak some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what for their satisfaction, or better information, in the thing which they take offence at.</p>
                  <p>The two crimes which (at one breath) I am charged withall, are <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemy</hi> and <hi>Flattery.</hi> Concerning the first, may my Accusers please to know, That I understand not the word <hi>Parallel</hi> as <hi>Mathematicians</hi> doe, though perhaps if I did, I should not (in the judgement of learned me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 17</note> and in another place, He inferres, that <hi>we cannot know the power of His Resurrection, unlesse we have a</hi> fellowship <hi>in His sufferings:</hi> As<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 10 Mat. 9. 3. 4 John 10. 33.</note> He was traduced, sclaundred, censured for <hi>a blasphemer</hi> (as I am now) when He spoke but the truth; as He was rejected, betrayed, falsely accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and unjustly dealt withall, &amp;c. so must we be used at one time or other, in the very same kinde; and this is, to have a <hi>fellowship in his suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings:</hi> or (which is all one) to hold <hi>Parallel</hi> with Him in His sorrowes.</p>
                  <p>Yea, we are often told from His own mouth, that we must <hi>take up His Crosse, and follow Him:</hi> That <hi>we must have the same entertainment<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 36 10. 24, 25.

                  </p>
                  <p>May my mistakers please therefore to observe well, the things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Parallel</hi> or Resemblance is made, or shewn to be: It is not in simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of <hi>sinlesse</hi> or spotlesse nature: I have not applyed or communicated to the <hi>King</hi> any of the <hi>Divine Attributes,</hi> (as some have to their <hi>Parliament</hi>) nor doe I liken him to the Son of GOD in <hi>measure</hi> of <hi>graces,</hi> nor yet in the <hi>merit</hi> of his <hi>innocent sufferings:</hi> I say not <hi>they are satisfactory</hi> (as Christs were) <hi>for the sins of his people,</hi> I beleeve indeed, they cry for vengeance rather, though I know His Majesty, like a pious Christian, a gracious Prince, and a tender Father, doth endeavour daily that their cry against us, may be out-voiced by that other of his prayers for us.</p>
                  <p>Nay further yet, I have not equalized the <hi>Kings afflictions</hi> and wrongs, with those of Christ in <hi>measure</hi> and <hi>degree,</hi> I have onely noted their likenesse in <hi>kind:</hi> and declared <hi>Historically,</hi> in an Observationall way, (and that by evidence of many particulars) what a specificall simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude there is, or hath been betwixt them; upon the which I may, and do affirme, that the King hath tasted of Christs <hi>very cup,</hi> yea drunke deep of his very sorrowes: and as the Apostle said of himselfe, so may I of His Majesty, (and yet be guilty of no <hi>Blasphemy</hi>) that <hi>He hath filled up that which was behind, of the Afflictions of Christ in his flesh, for his Bodies sake which is the Church,</hi> (whereof He is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">Col. 1. 24</note>

Protector and defender,) <hi>viz.</hi> for its imitation and consolation; in a like condition. And indeed we the persecuted and oppressed Members of it at this time, looking upon the most Heroick and Christian example of our King, do with the more courage and patience <hi>run the race that is set<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 1.</note> before us:</hi> And we beleeve 'tis a great matter of rejoycing to our <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne,</hi> that He is thus, at this time, for this end a <hi>partaker of Christs sufferings;</hi> that seeing He cannot free us, from our sorrowes, He doth yet strengthen us under them by His owne; These things I desire those that have taken scandall at me, to consider seriously upon; which if they shall vouchsafe to do, I presume they will not in their hearts think me a <hi>Blasphemer</hi> for saying of <hi>Him, whom God hath sanctified,</hi> (and fitted for such great tryalls) that <hi>He is</hi> (at least in this) <hi>like unto the Son of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second Crime laid to my charge is <hi>flattery of the King,</hi> which is fancyed to be the ground of the former: <hi>I blasphemed Christ</hi> (say they) <hi>out of my zeal or desire to flatter the King;</hi> but upon due considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this <hi>foundation</hi> may haply prove as vaine, as the <hi>structure</hi> upon it hath appeared faulty: I was never till now (that I know) taxed of <hi>flattery,</hi> though (I confesse) often of <hi>indiscretion,</hi> for not serving the times (as others did) to mine own advantage; my Lot hath hitherto lien on the side of the oppressed: I remember well some six years agoe, when <hi>Gods Children</hi> (as they were called and accounted) began-first to turn <hi>Rebels</hi> against their King, and <hi>Apostates,</hi> from the Gospell (which they had formerly professed, while they were in this their more proper and low Condition,) divers of mine acquaintance met together about me, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what the reason was, that I who had alwayes tooke part with the Church and people of God, in their <hi>Afflictions,</hi> did thus desert them in prosperity, now they had got power into their own hands, and were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into their long-expected flourishing condition: it was confessed, that I had faithfully discharged my Conscience, unto that present; and had preached against the irregularities of the times, and had suffered much disturbance, for not complying with the ungrounded fancies, and practicall innovations of some men: And after some debate to this purpose no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son being given, the result of all was this; <hi>Certainly God hath even gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him up to the spirit of madnesse.</hi> Now I doe verily beleeve that I might (upon better grounds) be concluded <hi>mad</hi> at this present, both by them, and many others if I should affect to <hi>flatter</hi> the King, as the world now goes with him, He not being either in a condition or in a way to be so dealt withall, for indeed they are wayes of <hi>sinne</hi> and not of <hi>sufferinge</hi> that <hi>flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers</hi> use to assist in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Flatterers</hi> are men, that look at themselves, at

their own speedy advantage, and therefore are unseparable servants, even Covenanted Hang-byes to the <hi>Militia;</hi> they love not to plow in <hi>winter,</hi> they sow all their seed in <hi>summer,</hi> because they lack patience to wait long for an <hi>Harvest;</hi> therefore if I am one of them, certainly I am a rare one: for my <hi>flattery</hi> appears to be the fruit of my <hi>faith;</hi> the thing it looks at, is a great way off, even in Gods own hand not yet visible, nor scarce cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible to the outward sences.</p>
                  <p>True flatterers (as I was saying before) are no <hi>Purgatory</hi> Bats, but pure Birds of <hi>Paradise,</hi> Butterflyes of Prosperity, that can at any time (with ease) leave Gods blessing for the warme sun; they frequent <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi> (now a dayes) as flyes doe the Butchers shambles, where some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be gotten: and were I of their number I would thither too; and there tell the <hi>Lower</hi> House <hi>that they are the supream power and Judicature in the Kingdome, unto whom all other powers ought to submit.</hi> I would never suggest what men say of them, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are <hi>ipsis nati, multis noti, &amp; omnibus nocui,</hi> empty Vines, better knowne then trusted, and Physitians of no value, <hi>though at first apprehended desirous to cure the diseases of the State, yet now found upon experience to study only to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves up, and their patients down:</hi> I would never talke to them of such stuffe, but I would tell them, that all <hi>the people doe with all thankfulnesse acknowledge, their unwearied paines, uncessant la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and constant endeavours, in the Common cause of. God and this Kingdome,</hi> and <hi>that the Nation, doth at this present enjoy a quiet exemption, from all illegall impositions, a blessed deliverance from all tyranny and oppression; and many unparalleld benefits and freedoms, by their sole meanes and happy Government:</hi> I would applaud all they doe, their very opening of <hi>Tavernes</hi> and <hi>Alehouses</hi> by command, and shutting up Church dores on Christs birth day; their si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing, suspending, and imprisoning the Ministers of Jesus, for taking the opportunity to offer the knowledge of him unto the people; I would war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant them they did all things well, and nothing was amisse in their doings; though their infallibility should fal into contempt, yet their power wil carry them out. Thus would I busie my selfe, and thus make my applications to men of place and power if I were a <hi>flatterer;</hi> and not stand wasting time and words in speaking good of the <hi>King,</hi> unlesse He were in a more shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and promising Condition: I thinke most men of commonsence (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering His Majesties present state) will take my word in this particular, and so acquit and discharge me of the second imputation.</p>
                  <p>But now let me aske my Accusers a few questions: would they in their
<pb facs="tcp:29718:142"/>
good natures have no man lay to Heart, or take notice of the <hi>sufferings</hi> of their <hi>Soveraigne?</hi> desire they that He might have the occasion also to use those words, <hi>Have you no regard all you that passe by the way?</hi> Do they thinke it was well done of the <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>Levite,</hi> to afford no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion<note place="margin">Luk 10. 32</note> to the wounded man? would they have me carry my selfe towards the King, as many of my Coat (in these dayes) have done; Helpe to wound Him, and then divert others eyes from looking on Him? must I be a <hi>blasphemer</hi> and a <hi>flatterer,</hi> if I doe not adde something to His bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and speake of Him as of one <hi>hated of God,</hi> because afflicted? were <hi>Jobs</hi> friends commended by the Almighty for so doing? let them deal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously, and make the case their owne: suppose themselves were in the <hi>Kings</hi> condition, afflicted and wrong'd on every side as He is: and I (as a <hi>Minister</hi>) should remember them of their <hi>Saviours</hi> usage in the world; and shew them how in many particulars their condition is like unto His, and thereupen should say unto them in the Apostles words, <hi>Rejoyce that<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 13</note> you are partakers of Christs sufferings,</hi> would they account this <hi>Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy</hi> and <hi>flattery</hi> in me? I suppose not: must the King then alone be deprived of the <hi>Comforts</hi> of Gods word, and of Christs Example? must <hi>these</hi> together with <hi>those</hi> of His Crowne be taken from Him? then I would say, O the miserable Condition of a King!

                  <p>I am perswaded that nothing but the Kings prayer can obtaine Gods pardon for His <hi>Afflicters:</hi> it is worth the observing; the Sin of <hi>Jobs</hi> friends (and we know what that was) could not have been forgiven if <hi>Job</hi> whom they had <hi>afflicted,</hi> (though but with harsh censures,) had not been their intercessour: the Lord said to <hi>Eliphas</hi> the <hi>Temanit, my wrath is kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled<note place="margin">Job 12. 7, 8.</note> against thee and thy 2 friends—wherefore go ye to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my servant</hi> Job, <hi>and offer up for your selves an offering, and my servant</hi> Job <hi>shall pray for you, for him will I accept, lest I deal with you according to your folly.</hi>

                  <p>To conclude therefore, let me advise all, that have had any hand against the King, in the causing or aggravating of his sorrows, that they would fear the wrath of God, which hangs over them, for the same; and (in pitty to their own soules, and to their <hi>posterity</hi>) that they would in true humility goe to their <hi>Soveraigne</hi> and beg both his Pardon and his Prayers; And so, by giving him the advantage of shewing his mercy and goodnesse, they may at last (there being now no other way left) be helpers in making him to appear (according to their word at first)</p>

                     <p>It is a fearefull thing to be given up to shed bloud; King <hi>James</hi> would say, <hi>if God should leave him to kill a man, he would think God did not love him:</hi> and I believe your selves were of the same opinion, all the while the Doctrine of Jesus Christ (which commandeth love to enemies) did season your hearts; but what a strange alteration is there now in your dispositions, since the Doctrine of Devils hath been preached unto you, for no other is this of butchering your brethren, of <hi>killing, slaying,</hi> and <hi>destroying,</hi> then the doctrine of him who is a murtherer from the beginning: you would not have been hired heretofore to have acted the executioners part, which is a lawfull office, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Malefactor condemned by lawfull Authority, so tender you were of shedding bloud; but now you make no scruple at all of it, you are greedy and thirsty (many of you) to spill the bloud of Innocents only for their constancy in that <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Loyalty</hi> to the King, which your selves also in Christs Schoole have been instructed in, meerly upon the temptation and motion of them you call the <hi>Parliament,</hi> who have no more Authority over the lives of men without the Kings allowance, then your servants have over yours; nay, which is more strange yet, you are bewitched by their seduction,

                     <p>I beseech you, <hi>in the bowels of Jesus Christ,</hi> think seriously upon the matter, (O that I could perswade you to it) while there is time for repentance, and <hi>save your selves at length yet, from this untoward generation;</hi> break their yoak from off your necks,<note place="margin">Act. 2. 40.</note> renounce their societies, have no more to doe with them, read, mark and ponder upon that place, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 10. to the 20.

                     <p>2. Consider whether this way wherein you have gone be not also contradictive to the <hi>Law of the Land:</hi> The denyall of the Kings Supremacy in this Kingdome, hath been wont to be accounted so heinous an offence, that he who is guilty of it, is judged by the Law to die as a Traytor: And the doing of any thing in prejudice of the Kings Authoritie, as the raising of Forces without him, nay the having but thoughts of mischief towards him, though they never breake forth into Action, is reckoned by the Law for no lesse then <hi>High Treason,</hi> and some have suffered death for such things; nay, further yet, the bare instilling misconceits of the King into the people, to with-draw their affections from him, hath even in this very <note n="*" place="margin">In the Charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Earl of <hi>Strafford.</hi>
                        </note> Parliament been cald <hi>High Treason:</hi> Now whether the Kings <hi>Supremacy,</hi> not only in things <hi>Spirituall,</hi> but also <hi>Temporall</hi> be not denied, and whether by your opposition to his Majesties Person and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and by whispering, yea, by open speaking evilly of him, and consenting to what hath been written against him, you have not made your selves guilty of that grand Crime, let your own consciences also determine unto you.</p>
                     <p>3. Consider whether it be not against common equity to practice the taking away from any one, that which comes unto him by lawfull inheritance, succession, or just election?
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:29718:151"/>
whether you would not so judge it, if any should divest you of what was left you by your Parents? and whether the Kings Authority and Revenews, (which you with others have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to dispossesse him of) be not of the same Tenure, and held by the best Title: indeed if men come to power and Authority by fraud and violence (as your <hi>new Masters</hi> have done) the case is otherwise, lives lost in conspiring the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of such, may be reckoned well sold; every man in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon equity (were there no tie of duty or allegeance) is to help him to right that suffers wrong: but to <hi>concurre</hi> in <hi>oppressing</hi> the <hi>Supreme</hi> Magistrate, and in taking from him what belongs unto him, if conscience be suffered to make report, it will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed to be the highest injustice; for as to detract from the <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard</hi> which is the rule of measures, is the greatest sinne, so is it to detract from the King who is the <hi>Standard</hi> of righteousnesse in his Kingdome.</p>
                     <p>4. Consider whether the demand of having the <hi>Militia</hi> out of the Kings hand (wherein his Authority and Power consists) which your Leaders and you insist upon, be not against piety, and a plaine urging the King to act <hi>Esau's</hi> part in resigning up his<note place="margin">Gen. 2533.</note> birth-right; and whether you think in earnest (as some of your Preachers have suggested,) that you have a sufficient ground to expect Gods blessing upon your undertaking, though it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, because <hi>Jacob</hi> was blessed afterward, though the means<note place="margin">Gen. 27. 19. &amp;c.</note> which he used to accomplish his design were not approvable? nay, seeing the King is not like <hi>Esau,</hi> so easily drawn to part with his birth-right, but rather like <hi>Naboth</hi> will keep his<note place="margin">1 King. 21.</note> inheritance, for feare of Gods displeasure: consider I pray whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you in going about to force him thereto by violence, are not all the while acting the parts of <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezabel,</hi> who were persons that had <hi>sold themselves to work wickednesse?</hi> nay, whether you are not more deep in the evill then they were, in regard the King is not to you as <hi>Naboth</hi> was to <hi>Ahab,</hi> a subject, nor have you as he did, tendred an answerable exchange, or rather a better for what you demand from him; consider I beseech you and thinke well in your owne hearts of this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
                     <p>5. Consider and call to mind, whether those Teachers who
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:29718:151"/>

And here (by the way) let me exhort all men to read that Book often in these times, and they shall find a very great resemblance between the bloudy Persecutors of those dayes, and these now, and a great similitude in their courses; it was not doubtlesse, without a speciall providence, that the said Book was of late twice reprinted, that so there being a greater plenty of them, we in these times might (being many of us) be more enlightned, supported and comforted in our sufferings: And I would have you observe among many other things, that Note of Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> How <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, that deposed <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, was the first of all English Kings
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:29718:152"/>
that began the mercifull burning of Gods Saints, for their standing against the Papists: so that we may thence learn, that 'tis no new thing for <hi>them</hi> to be given up to the acting of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties against Gods Church and people, <hi>who</hi> have first given up themselves to practise Rebellion against their Soveraign; these two sinnes (as it seemes) before now have gone together: But I return.</p>

                        <hi>Prynne</hi> (the Parliament Champion) cryes out upon him for being <hi>malignantly jealous over them,</hi> and sayes, 'tis <hi>most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable, unchristian, detestable, fanatique, groundlesse and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable jealousie in him, yea, venomous Malignancy, Oxfordian Aulicisme.</hi> But to proceed; These men do, and will (as you shall find, unlesse God blast them) require as simple, as absolute, and as unlimited an obedience at your hands, as ever the Turk or Pope hath done from their Vassals; an obedience not of <hi>will</hi> only, but of <hi>judgement</hi> also, which is a direct blind obedience; And truly as the Doctrine of <hi>infallibility</hi> is the root of all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour among the Papists, so is it now among them that are the <hi>worshippers</hi> of the Parliament; for when it was once believed that the <hi>Pope could not erre,</hi> then he might oppose Princes, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate Kings, absolve Subjects from their obedience, raise warres, shed bloud, yea, live as wickedly as he pleased, have as many Bastards as he could get, the people were fast enough locked up unto him in obedience; so now this being swallowed

that <hi>the Parliament cannot erre,</hi> the lusty Members thereof may raise Rebellion too, absolve people from their Loyalty, persecute the King, and murther his Subjects, seize upon all their Estates, and sell or give them to whom they please: yea, and let them live as wickedly as they list, as vilely and basely as they please, let them get Bastards, ravish and defile Ladies of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and then defame them when they have so done, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted so to do, they may doe it <hi>impunè,</hi> for they be worthy Members all the while, they have none above them to call them to an account, and the people being fast linked to them, by the vertue of blind obedience, will be apt to give faire interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of all their doings; well, think seriously of these things in your retired thoughts.</p>
                     <p>8. Consider also of times past, and compare your experience of the present, with them and say, whether the light of God doth now shine so comfortably upon your Tabernacles, as when the King enjoyed his Rights and possessed his Throne? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are now so stored with coyne, or have that leisure and wherewithall to build pleasant Houses? whether you lie so soft, all of you, fare so well, and have that entire Command in your own Houses, over your own goods and servants, as formerly? whether you can say as truly and freely, that <hi>what you have bought and paid for is your owne,</hi> as heretofore? I would that the Londoners and Citizens would consider, whether they be all so well Plated, Jewelled, and attired, themselves, wives and children? whether their bags be not lanker, their banks lesser, and their meanes scanter then in those times of old? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they enjoy like Liberties and Priviledges under their new Masters, as they did under their King? And I would have the Countrey-man consider, whether his payments bee not more, and his oppressions greater, then they were wont to be? whether hee had not a merrier heart in his bosome, and more money in his purse, when hee payed his Rents to the true owner, his right Landlord, then ever he hath had since he dealt with these new Usurpers? O you poor seduced and abused people! these new Lords promised indeed that you should have your Farms at a lower rate then formerly, so they might receive the Rents; but consider with your selves, hath not
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:29718:154"/>
your supernumerary Rates and Taxations, and your Billiting and furnishing out Souldiers, amounted to more then the full payment? and can you think that you shall not be skrewed up to the highest pin by those Hucksters to whom they shall sell or give away your true Landlords Estates, or appoint to be as their own Task-masters over you? can you expect possibly any thing but blows and beggery under them? perhaps indeed you may obtain at last (in lieu of all your Wealth and Labours, and former happinesse) to be partakers of that Priviledge which the Pesants of <hi>France</hi> and specially of <hi>Normandy</hi> doe enjoy, <hi>scil.</hi> you shall have leave to begge freely up and down the Kingdome without danger of whipping; consider seriously of these things I beseech you.</p>
                     <p>Nay, consider (O all yee people of all sorts) whether you think in Conscience, these your new Rulers with their crew be the very <hi>meek Ones of the Earth</hi> as they account themselves, to whom the intire right and possession of all earthly blessings and inheritances doe appertaine? whether it be a true position which since the <hi>Militia</hi> hath been in their hands they have been bold to maintain, <hi>viz. that right by Conquest is the best Title,</hi> else Gods providence would not permit them to be successefull? and whether (if that Tenent be maintained) any one of you all, can promise to your selves the use and comfort of any thing, that is either left unto you or purchased by you? let this also be thought upon.</p>
                     <p>9. Consider, whether in any thing these men have performed what at first they promised? whether <hi>Religion</hi> be better setled, the <hi>Church</hi> better reformed, and united, the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> more flourishing, the <hi>Subjects</hi> more happy, then when they took these matters into their hands? you were told by them (as you well know) when they first inticed you, to engage your selves with them in this Warre, that the same would be quickly over; and oft-times since when they came to borrow more money of you, have they not pretended continually that <hi>the worke was almost done,</hi> if you would but come off well and afford another good pluck, it would be quite ended? they promised also (when they moved unto the warre) that they would exact nothing against your wills from you, no, God forbid that they should
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:29718:154"/>
use any violence, they desired that men should do freely and without constraint, only what themselves pleased, they were all for the freedome of the Subject; but have they proved as true of their words as you did of your Assistance? have they used no enforcements to get your money since that time, or are your miseries concluded, and your expences yet at an end? Are the <hi>Scots</hi> paid all their Arrears? Is <hi>Ireland</hi> reduced to obedience or as quiet as at their first meeting? Is the King setled in his proper Rights and Dignitie as was pretended, and the Subjects in their Liberties? Is Judgement and Justice executed in our Gates, and oppression driven from our Streets, and every thing removed that may provoke Gods further displeasure? Nay, doth not the late prevailing of these men speak rather a neernesse of Gods more heavie Curse upon us, and a beginning rather then a finishing of your sorrowes? Is it not probable that God will take the matter into his owne hand by Plague or Famine and call both them and you to a reckoning for that Christian bloud that is spilt by you without lawfull Authoritie? Or are not all the Nations of the world Gods Instruments, and cannot he employ some of them to punish you, for your punishing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers without a warrant from his Vicegerent? or cannot he send a spirit of division amongst your selves, as once between <hi>Abimilech</hi> and the men of <hi>Sichem,</hi> after that by conspiring together, they had prevailed against the House and Family of <hi>Gideon?</hi> sure <hi>bloud</hi> and <hi>oppression</hi> are crying sinnes in Gods eares, and the Judge of all the world will doe Justice; and 'tis a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing to fall into the hands of God when he is angry; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider in your hearts of these things.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Master <hi>John Goodwin</hi> one of your Ministers doth enform you in his 12. <hi>Serious Considerations,</hi> that <hi>to violate an abhominable and an accursed Oath out of Conscience to God, is an holy and blessed Perjury.</hi> Now therefore if I prove that your Oath and Covenant is <hi>abhominable</hi> and <hi>accursed,</hi> then it will follow, that as it was an high sinne to take it, so is it an higher to keep the same, and according to the Doctrine of one of your own Teachers, an <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>blessed Perjury</hi> will it be to breake it. But this I shall make good, and thus I argue.</p>
                     <p>That which is ungodly and unlawfull, both in respect of matter and form, is <hi>abhominable</hi> and <hi>accursed:</hi> But such is that Oath and Covenant which you have taken, therefore you ought to breake it, and in no hand (unlesse you will run upon your owne damnation) to keep the same.</p>
                     <p>This I shall evidence in both particulars, that 'tis <hi>ungodly</hi> in respect of matter, and <hi>unlawfull</hi> in respect of form.</p>
                     <p>First, An Oath is ungodly in respect of matter, (and so by consequent unlawfull,) when it is to performe ungodly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull things, <hi>viz.</hi> things forbidden of God, and formerly disavowed by us; But of this nature is this Oath and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: For</p>
                     <p>1. 'Tis to <hi>oppose the King, and Forces raised by Him,</hi> whom God hath forbidden you to <hi>resist,</hi> and commanded you to <hi>fear, honour and obey,</hi> and whom you have <hi>sworne</hi> Allegeance unto, and <hi>Protested</hi> to defend in <hi>his Estate and Dignity</hi> against all Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers, <hi>with your lives and fortunes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. 'Tis to <hi>kill, slay and destroy</hi> your Countrey-men and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, which as a work of the Devil you renounced in your Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, and is directly opposite to the sixth Commandement, <hi>viz. Thou shalt not kill,</hi> which then also you vowed and promised to keep and observe.</p>
                     <p>3. 'Tis <hi>never to lay downe Armes,</hi> or to be quiet, <hi>so long as there is any left on the Kings side for you to oppose;</hi> whereas strife and contention are works of the flesh disclaimed also in Baptism and forbidden in Gods word, which commands you to <hi>live</hi>

                     <p>Therefore this your Oath and Covenant being of this nature, 'tis utterly ungodly and so unlawfull in respect of the matter of it; 'tis of the same kind with that which the fourtie men entred into, <hi>neither to eat nor drinke till they had killed</hi>

                        <hi>Paul;</hi> which none of you will grant had been fit to be kept, nay, rather 'tis of a farre worse kind then that was, for 'tis a Vow or Covenant, not only to breake Gods Commandements, and to kill your Brethren, but also to slight your Promise in <hi>Baptism,</hi> and to renounce all your Oathes and Protestations of Loyaltie and Obedience formerly taken; yea, and to persist in so doing: think I beseech you, how you will answer this at Gods Tribunall.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, An Oath (as I apprehend) is unlawfull in respect of the form (and so by consequence <hi>ungodly</hi> too) when it is not expressed, administred and taken in such verie words as by Law are prescribed, or when it is not enacted by full and compleat Authoritie: But of this nature is this Oath or Covenant which you stick upon: <hi>Ergo,</hi> 'tis unlawfull and by consequence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly; for confirmation of this; let it be remembred, how (before this unhappie Parliament begun at a meeting in <hi>Yorkshire</hi> about the first coming in of the <hi>Scots,</hi>) the King tendred an Oath of Loyaltie to the Lord <hi>Say,</hi> and some others, who refused the same upon this ground, <hi>It was not lawfull in respect of form, for the words, method, or frame thereof had not been agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, settled, or established by Act of Parliament,</hi> viz. by the King and the two Houses: And so the alledged reasons, why those Oaths tendred by <hi>Bishops and Archdeacons</hi> at their Visitations were condemned by this verie Parliament for unlawfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was in respect of their formes, they were not administred in the precise termes, and direct words which by the King and whole Parliament were prescribed and Authorized.</p>
                     <p>Now if this be so, then this verie Oath and Covenant which you have taken, being as you all know, defective this way, cannot be legall, the King and whole Parliament never enacted it as a Law for you to take and observe. But onlie that corrupt

And for your Preachers who perswaded you at first to take this Covenant and now to keep it, they being in the same condition with them that imposed it, no marvell if they labour to hold you still under the bondage of it. But why doe not those your Preachers answer those Books which have been written against it, wherein the impietie and unlawfulnesse of it is fully evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced; foure <note n="*" place="margin">Besides the <hi>Oxford</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons lately published, which all the Assembly of Divines are never able to confute.</note> severall Bookes have been written against the same, and not one of them yet answered, which very thing (if well considered) discovers their resolution in evill; they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade you to take and keep a Covenant, which themselves are not able to maintaine to be lawfull by Divinity, or Reason, or anie other Argument, but onely Club-Law: Nay, one thing more let me mind you of, do but think with your selves how God hath manifested himselfe against this Covenant in breaking asunder manie of those that were knit together by it: How are they divided? How bitterly the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> write and speak against each other? a rotten Covenant it must needs be, that cannot hold the spirits of the Takers one three yeares together; doth not God hereby plainly manifest his dislike of it? hath he not visibly made good his word against it by this breach among them? <hi>Es.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>Associate your selves O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces, give eare also you of a farre Countrey</hi> (you <hi>Scottish</hi> Covenanters) <hi>gird your selves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, yet shall ye be broken in pieces; gird your selves and ye shall be broken in pieces:</hi> 'Tis worth the marking how the words are doubled in the Text, which according to the interpretation of <hi>Joseph,</hi> in whom the Spirit of God dwelt, is to shew the<note place="margin">Gen. 41. 32.</note> certaintie of the thing that God hath established it, and will <note n="*" place="margin">Indeed this day this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is fulfilled in our eyes.</note> shortly and surely bring it to passe.</p>

                     <p>First, for the Title of <hi>Patriots</hi> which you thirst after; O had you been advised by your King, had you closed with your Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign when he at first committed things to your care, to order, rectifie and settle for our good, had you minded that work for which you met, and made that your businesse as he would have had you, how should we all have rejoyced in the very mention of you as of <hi>Patriots</hi> indeed? how should we have hugged your names in our affectionate memories, and conveyed them to Posterity with a charge to keep in everlasting Honour?</p>
                     <p>As <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were our undertakers or representers in <hi>Paradise,</hi> so were you in <hi>Parliament,</hi> and as God to them, so the King to you, gave a Liberty over all the Plants and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in his Garden; restrained you in nothing, save onely from one particular thing, which was the <hi>forbidden fruit;</hi> but nothing would satisfie your ambitious reach save onely that, whereby you have brought upon us all, Gods heavie curse, and all kinde of miseries. O how farre were you from the disposition of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest <hi>Joseph,</hi> who being tempted to meddle with that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed<note place="margin">Gen. 39. 8. 9</note> not to him, was with-held by the consideration of that great trust, which his Master had reposed in him, and of that liberty and authority which in all things else was granted to him: And how did God soone after reward this his faithfulnesse by advancing him to as great Authority over the whole Realm, as he had before over one Family; wherein also all but the Throne was at his disposing, <hi>in that only</hi> (sayes <hi>Pharaoh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) I will be above thee:</hi> which he (good man) was farre enough from<note place="margin">Gen. 41. 40.</note>

seeking after; for his endeavours only were to settle <hi>Pharaoh</hi> more firmly in it, and to advance his wealth and dignity, as the story at large tells us; by which meanes he procured honour and favour sufficient to himselfe, both with God and Man; he lived desired of all, and died lamented by the whole Nation. O I say, that you had had the wisdome and the grace, to have imitated this <hi>Joseph,</hi> this good Councellour of State; you were tied in as great engagements of gratitude as he; but you without any other temptation, save only the corruption of your owne hearts, have laboured to ravish from your Lord and Master his reserved <hi>jewell</hi> of Majestie, and to rob him of his wealth and of the <hi>hearts</hi> of his people: yea, and to invest your selves with that Honour and esteem which with your strongest studies you ought to have fastened eternally to his Crown and Diademe. Therefore you must never think (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever your flatterers doe bedawb you,) that you shall ever be dignified by good men with that Title of <hi>Abraes,</hi> as <hi>Joseph</hi> was, or be reckoned for <hi>Patriots</hi> of your Countrey.</p>
                     <p>I have read that true Patriots have these foure conditions.</p>
                     <p>1. They will love and obey their true and lawfull Prince, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving example to all others of doing the like; for to love their Countrey and hate their Prince can never stand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                     <p>2. They will defend their Prince and Countrey against such as are enemies thereof, and that go about to dispossesse him of the Rule and Government.</p>
                     <p>3. They are carefull to conserve their Countrey from deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and ruine, by inland dissentions and Civill Warres.</p>
                     <p>4. They will also maintaine others that are borne in the same Countrey as well as themselves in the fruition of their lands and goods rightly belonging to them.</p>
                     <p>Now I would have your own consciences speak, whether any one of these foure conditions have appeared in you since you met together; nay, have you not rather shown a direct oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto them all? have you not carryed your selves towards your naturall Prince in all wayes of hatred, contention and diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience? Have you not abandoned his Authority and gone about to take away his absolute Soveraigntie from him? Have
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:29718:162"/>
you not occasioned desolations, spoiles, and robberies, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Nation, by these unnaturall divisions and Civill Warres which you have kindled? Have you not taken by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence from your Country men their ancient possessions, left them by their Fathers, giving and selling the same away to stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, broken all their strong Priviledges, and most tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally and cruelly shed their bloud? let your owne Consciences speake whether these things have not been done by you.</p>
                     <p>You would (I know) be <hi>famous</hi> amongst men, and to this end you set your adorers on work to talk of great things which you have done, and to attribute to your sole praise those acts of grace, which were the fruits of the Kings goodnesse, (the benefit whereof notwithstanding you will not suffer the people to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,) yea, and they call you the <hi>Phoenix-Parliament,</hi> and the <hi>wonder-working Parliament,</hi> but if we speake the downright truth, you are famous only <hi>in infamy;</hi> it was said in <hi>Josiah</hi>'s praise, but it may be affirmed on the contrary to your disgrace, that <hi>never the like went before you, nor followed after you;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you are indeed a <hi>rare</hi> and <hi>Phoenix-Parliament:</hi> and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders we confesse you have wrought too, even such as Hell it self doth both rejoyce in and stand amazed at; but Christian man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind hath cause for ever both to abhorre and loath: It's true, <hi>pulchrum est eminere inter illustres viros,</hi> (as <hi>Seneca</hi> sayes) 'tis a faire and desirable thing to stand in the rank of renowned men; but they that will do so, (as he teacheth <note n="*" place="margin">Consulere pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I Have now but a word more to adde, and that shall be to those Loyall men, who for Conscence and duty sake, have adhered to their Soveraign, and kept themselves unspotted from this sinne, which like the <hi>Arian</hi> Heresie hath so suddenly ore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread the whole Nation, and for this cause have been persecuted and hated by these <hi>evill men,</hi> who have also deprived them of all their outward comforts: And what shall I now say unto you, (most worthy and approved?) shall I bewaile your sad condition, or lament over you for the wrongs suffered? this would be an endeavouring to bring you lower then you are, to draw you down to basenesse, to weaken your spirits, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you to be more despised, and so to do you a greater injury then hath yet been done you; for <hi>Pity</hi> is the poorest and most helplesse salve of <hi>misery,</hi> and by noble minds farre more abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red then the worst of fortune: Away therefore with such femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine and feeble <hi>Cordialls,</hi> which women use, and children relish; let me tell you, that you are more then men, you are Christians chose out of many by Almighty God, to suffer for his sake; to be in your Age the glory of Religion, and the honour of your Nation: you are no chaffe, the wind hath not blown you away, nor can the flaile hurt you, as they fancie that afflict you; they think they rob you, in taking from you what God gave you; but they think amisse; for he can make them vomit up againe that wealth of yours which they have swallowed, or can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn it <hi>in specie</hi> another way; all the substance and riches of the Earth are at his disposing, who observes and notes who they
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:29718:171"/>
are, that lose all for his sake; at least doubtlesse, he will and doth repay <hi>outward</hi> losses with <hi>inward</hi> graces: And be confident of it, the more damage and affliction Gods truth brings you, the more felicitie and joy abideth for you; 'tis Gods cause for which you stand, 'tis the honour of the 5. Commandement which you maintaine, as the <hi>Martyrs</hi> in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> daies did of the second; and hence 'tis that you are spoiled, and have your lives sought after; but what an high dignitie is it, in the meane time, which God hath here called you to? It was the confession of blessed Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> in a case of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that <hi>himselfe had deserved the miseries he lay under at Gods hand, and not only them, but even Hell too; notwithstanding</hi> (sayes he) <hi>so loving hath God been, that he hath converted the punishment of my sinnes into a testimoniall of his truth and verity, which indeed the Prelates persecute in me, and not my sinnes; and therefore they persecute not me, but Christ in me, who I doubt not but will take my part unto the end;</hi> put but <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> instead of <hi>Prelates,</hi> and the words may be your own without alteration of a syllable. So Bishop <hi>Hooper</hi> in those daies, being at the stake appeales to God in these words; '<hi>Tis knowne to thee O Lord, wherefore I am come hither, and why the wicked doe persecute thy servant, not for my sinnes and transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions committed against thee, but because I will not allow of their wicked doings, to the contaminating of thy bloud, and the deniall of thy truth received;</hi> each of you in your condition may make a like appeale, and also adde what another Martyr said, in the behalfe of himselfe and others, <hi>If we would but seek to please men in things contrary to thy holy Word, we might (as others doe) enjoy the Commodities of Wife, Children, Goods, and Friends.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Besides, 'tis not for Gods truth only, that your engagement is; but for your Countrey too, <hi>&amp; dulce est pro patria mori,</hi> it hath at least, in old time been so accounted; nay, what good man can wish life to see his Countrey buried? <hi>vitae nimis est avidus, quisquis non vult mundo secum pereunte mori,</hi> saies wise <hi>Seneca,</hi> they are over greedy to live, that think it not an honour to die at the funerall Celebration of Church and Kingdome, which to the eye of over-timerous and doubting

nature, may seeme perhaps to be neare approaching. And were it so, that a generall destruction should come, yet how happie shall you be above those other men, who having first made ship-wrack of a good conscience, are forced afterward to lose all things else.</p>
                     <p>But our dutie is, both to hope and pray for better; for God is now the same he was of old, as gracious still as ever, nor must we as many doe, trouble our selves with Gods Decree, and grow dull upon it; for himselfe sayes, <hi>if the same at any</hi>

                     <p>Wherefore friends and fellow-sufferers, we now see what we are to doe, even to resolve by Gods grace, if we live and thrive, not to doe to them as they have done to us; but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn rather <hi>good for evill,</hi> for thus it becomes us to do, as we are Christs members, <hi>nos pati poenas decet, non esse poenas,</hi> we must be ambitious to be conditioned in this case, like that good Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> of whom it was said, <hi>Do my Lord of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury a shrewd turn, and you shall have him your friend ever after;</hi> but of all people, we must take heed of being like our enemies, of whom it may be said on the contrary, <hi>Doe them a good turn, and you shall have them your enemies ever after;</hi> their custome you know hath been, when we have fallen into their power, to interpret the same to be by Gods providence, to the end that they might torment, mischief, and abuse us, which they, or some of them have not failed to doe in full measure; and when they on the other side have fallen into ours, and fared well, to insult thereupon, and say, no thank to us therefore, for we would fain have done them hurt, but God would not suffer us, but restrained us, by holding our hands whether we would or no, and delivered them from us, to the end they may do God service in punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us afterward, if they can but get us: Now perhaps they may be of the same opinion still, when hereafter they shall be at our

                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>if we die,</hi> by their despightful hands, before God doth turn the wheel upon them, we must resolve to conclude our daies as Christ our Saviour did, with praiers in our mouths for them, which it may be (through Gods working) may have a like effect after our death, as Christs had, to the conversion of some of them; the conversion of those 3000. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. is held to be a fruit of Christs prayer upon the Crosse; and <hi>Sauls</hi> conversion, of <hi>Stephens</hi> prayer at his death; so who knowes, but our meeknesse, our patience, and our prayers at such a time, may be effectuall to a like pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose? even to draw some of our persecuting Countreymen from their bloudy and rebellious way, into the paths of Christ and of his Gospel; yea, whether we live or die, if we can do Christ and the King service no other way, let us resolve and endeavour to pray down their and our enemies by praying for them: And by all meanes while breath is in us, let's have a care so to live, as we may still credit our righteous cause, and as becometh those that are designed to slaughter <hi>for Jesus sake,</hi> and for the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine<note place="margin">Act. 2. &amp; 3. cap.</note> which he left us; <hi>Holy bloud</hi> (believe it) <hi>will prove of harder digestion to them, then prophane;</hi> that they <hi>had killed the holy and the just one,</hi> was that which afterward pierced the hearts of these mens elder Brethren when time was; I say no more: But, the Lord strengthen and guide us all in our Christian and Loyall way by his grace and spirit; that though we be a people <hi>robbed, spoiled, snared in holes, hid in prison-houses, driven to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and exposed for a prey;</hi> yet we may walk before our God in all humilitie and well-pleasing, to the restauration of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spells honour, the inward comfort of our own spirits in the midst of miseries, and to the conviction and shame of our unnaturall Countrey-men, who seeke to take away our lives also from us.</p>

                  <head>A POST-SCRIPT to the READER.</head>
                  <p>THis Book was prepared (as now you have it) and might have seen the light, within lesse then the compasse of that year, wherein the Libell (which it Answers) was first published, had there been at hand the convenience of a Presse, and strength to bring forth: But 'tis no small advantage, which the enemies have, against <hi>Truth</hi> and the <hi>King,</hi> that with them is both liberty and ability to vent what they please, whereas with us is neither: Had we but halfe the like helps, encouragements, and powers, which they have had, the world should see that the <hi>King</hi> hath <hi>Subjects,</hi> and the <hi>Truth Defenders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There hath been a further alteration of Affaires (to the worse on the Kings side, since this Book was written (as may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from many passages therein:) and divers particulars concerning the enemies deportment, here expressed, have so fallen out, as foreshewn (for indeed 'tis no difficult matter, for any man acquainted with their spirits to fore-speak their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:) Had there appeared any change in them to the better; nay, had their growth but promised a probability of more Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity and duty, in their future, then hath been in their past Actions, or then was here prognosticated of them, this publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation perhaps, (having been thus delayed) had been still sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended; though in very deed, there is no reason, why for such a cause it should have been quite stifled; seeing that their Libell (which it confuteth) is divulged, printed, reprinted, and still sold, to the Kings darkening and defamation: Besides many other scandalous and vile Pamphlets have been and are daily sent forth on purpose, to damp his Lustre, and to staine his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; yea, and translated too they are, into other Languages, that he might appear deform'd and spotted to the eye of Forraign Nations; which because they have not been Answered with a
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:29718:176"/>
like industry on our parts, Strangers have thought, yea, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that nothing could be said for him, because nothing was; (<hi>scil.</hi> to their capacitie,) <hi>we have</hi> (say they) <hi>read in our owne languages many Bookes against him, but none in his behealfe;</hi> it must be acknowledged in very deed, that this way the enemies have been more diligent in defaming, then we have been in defending the <hi>King;</hi> though in our own tongue there hath been abundance written in his justification and to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
                  <p>The Protestants of other Countryes unto whom the <hi>Kings</hi> bosome was alwayes open in their distresse, towards whom his bowels alwayes yerned, and for whose reliefe his commands went often forth, to all Churches in his Kingdomes to make Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections; how have they (at least too many of them) by meanes of those industrious <hi>Lies</hi> and <hi>Libels,</hi> opened their mouthes and stretch'd forth their tongues against him? And how are we (that suffer with him and for him, or rather for the Truth maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by him) esteemed of, in our banishment amongst them? are we any other but objects of scorn and taunting to them? 'twas our delight (but 'twas our duty, and our work is with the Lord) to obey God and him in contributing to their necessities in the day of their visitation; but they take pleasure in this of ours to wound our very wounds, and to enlarge our sorrows, yea, every way to help forward our affliction; at what a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance have they looked upon us, because the hand of God is out against us? what bitter words have they darted at us, and which is to our great griefe, against the Sacred Person of our Soveraign? with what violence and confidence doe they ignorantly undertake to justifie the false reports of his enemies against him? Nay, how is our Church it selfe. (the late glory of Christendome, and of the whole Earth) despised and slighted by them, in this time of our persecution? The Papists on the one side, scoffingly ask us, <hi>where is now your God?</hi> where is your Church become? you may now freely boast of its <hi>Invisibility</hi> (if you please) you have a ground for it, &amp;c. And our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren on the other side, (that outwardly professe the same Faith with us, and from whom we expected better) they act <hi>Edoms</hi> part as reproachfully upon us; crying out against our <hi>Church,</hi>
                     <pb n="307" facs="tcp:29718:176"/>
and the <hi>Government</hi> thereof, <hi>down with it, down with it, even to the ground;</hi> For they (the <hi>Protestants</hi> of <hi>France</hi> in speciall) are willingly perswaded, by those Letters and Pamphlets sent them out of <hi>England,</hi> that the Professours of the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here (before this Parliament begun) were kept in a like underly condition, as themselves are in their own Country; though those <hi>French</hi> Congregations allowed in <hi>England</hi> might in their gratitude to our King, have given them a better and more true information, had they so pleased; But upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit they in <hi>France</hi> apprehend this Warre here against the King, to be undertaken only to recover Liberty to worship God in the right manner; that is to say, after the <hi>French</hi> Mode or Discipline (as they think at least, and are made to believe) and most people loving their own wayes and fashions best, (though lesse perfect then their neighbours) cannot but wish good luck to all such as are stooping towards them and rejoyce for them; though we believe it would be wisdome in them to beware that their Jubilation at the prevailing of the <hi>English Rebels,</hi> doth not work a jealousie and suspition against themselves in the hearts of their own Princes; our prayers are and shall be that God would not lay their inhumanities against us to their charges; we know the Lord <hi>was sore displeased at the Heathen,</hi> for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnesse<note place="margin">Zach. 1. 14.</note> to his people in their affliction; and we believe he cannot be well pleased to see Christians so conditioned; O<note place="margin">Obad. 12.</note> sayes God to <hi>Edom; Thou shouldst not have looked with pleasures on the day of thy Brother, in the day that he became a stranger, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shouldst thou have rejoyced over the Children of Judah, in the day of their destruction, neither shouldst thou have spoken proudly in the day of distresse.</hi> That speech of God to <hi>Moab</hi> is worthy the observation of all that are at ease, when other Nations are in trouble; <hi>Take Councell and be well advised, let mine out-casts</hi>

                     <hi>dwell with thee</hi> Moab, <hi>make thy shaddow as the night, in the midst of the noone-day; be thou a Covert to them, from the face of the spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler hide them, and bewray not him that wandereth.</hi> But <hi>Moab</hi> cast these words behind her, and was so farre from comforting the distressed <hi>Israelites,</hi> that she <hi>derived at them</hi> in their banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Jer. 48. 27.</note> and <hi>skipt for joy</hi> to see them miserable; and therefore within three years after, <hi>Moabs</hi> own self was in as wofull and
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:29718:177"/>
deplorable a condition, which (as appears by the two Prophets)<note place="margin">Read Esa. 16. and Jer. 48.</note> was layd upon her for a punishment of that her unkindnesse; Had she afforded shelter, she had not her self (at least so soon) been put to seek it, <hi>Deus fratribus nostris (Ecclesiae Gallicanae praesertim) avertat omen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But probably these sinnes of our Brethren of other Churches, will in a great measure be imputed partly to the <hi>malice</hi> of our enemies: for impoysoning their mindes by their Lyes and Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets, and partly to our <hi>negligence</hi> (if it may be so called) who have not been as equally active, in giving them the true informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things in their own Language from the beginning.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore I wish that now at length, all those who love the Truth, and are acquainted with our English Affaires, and have a skill in forraign Languages, would consider seriously of this particular; and as they are Christians, not permit those, <hi>for whom Christ dyed,</hi> thus to perish in their Errours for want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; <hi>Thou shalt in any wise</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>rebuke thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lev. 19. 17.</note> (when faulty or mis-led) <hi>and not suffer sinne upon him;</hi> yea, I would desire all Loyall Englishmen to whom God hath given the <hi>tongue and pen of the Learned,</hi> that they would imploy their Talents at this time this way, in the vindicating of Truth, and the King, and so manifest their bowels of compassion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their dear and native Countrey; for undoubtedly so long as our Soveraignes name lies thus imprisoned under <hi>obloquy,</hi> we his people and the whole Nation shall lie burthened under <hi>misery;</hi> (never since the birth of that grand scandalous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance, (which as an usher made way to all the reproachfull Libells and Sermons, that have been vented since) did this Kingdome enjoy one day of felicity:) The Prince's <hi>Honour</hi> is the Subjects <hi>glory,</hi> and so ought to be esteemed; 'tis that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, that <hi>beame of Divinity</hi> which God hath stampt upon Him, and commanded us to maintaine and reverence in Him; tis to be regarded by us above ten thousands of us; yea certainly, he that preferres not the advancement and illustration of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his own pofits and safety and all he hath, deserves not the name of the <hi>Kings friend,</hi> of a <hi>Loyall Subject,</hi> nor of a <hi>good Christian.</hi>

is writ already; for people are <hi>given up to beleeve lies,</hi> they are willingly deceived, and even hardened against the knowledge of the truth. Perhaps all are not, but were they so, how came they into this condition? was it not by those untruths which have bin Published and Preached to them? Surely, by defaming the King these <hi>mischiefes</hi> have been raised, this <hi>Rebellion</hi> against him hath been woven up; is it not therefore the more probable, that the same may be unreaven againe by a full Vindication of the Kings name, and a frequent ditection of these evill workers? What is not effected at first, may be done at last, and by others, which is not by some, <hi>In the morning sow thy seed, and in the</hi>

                     <hi>God may at length give light and repentance to them:</hi> This hath been wont to be Gods way, both of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the <hi>ignorant,</hi> and confounding the <hi>obstinate;</hi> and the truth is, we have nothing else now left us, but tongues to pray for our King, and pens to write for him; but the Apostle<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 10.</note> tells us, that <hi>when we are weakest</hi> in our selves or to outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, <hi>then are we strongest, scil.</hi> in regard of the neernesse of Gods blessing; his power is most apparent at such a time, he<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 27.</note> chuseth the <hi>weakest</hi> to confound the <hi>mightiest;</hi> poore <hi>Luthers</hi> tongue and pen (when things were in a low condition) did <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Gospell</hi> more service against the <hi>Pope,</hi> then all the swords that have been drawn against him or his Religion have done ever since.</p>
                  <p>Doubtlesse there be thousands of honest and Religious soules, that in the simplicity of their spirits, are hooked into this black Rebellion, by the craft of others, to whom if the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the scope, aymes, and actions of their leaders were well layed open and proved, they would hate them with a perfect hatred, and rather lose all they have lent them then proceed one foot further in their way with them; Nay, who knowes but the greater part of their Souldiers and men of warre, (in many of whom (to speak truth) the sparks of <hi>Ancient English valour</hi> are apparent) if they were at length but well informed, might quickly turne the points of their swords the right way, and so redeeme their lost glory? without all question discourses

of this nature will be meanes to rouze up and awaken those truly <hi>generous and noble Spirits</hi> that have been alway loyall and are still alive; to consider more feelingly yet of the condition of their King, of their Country, and of the Royall Progeny, those sweet and heart-conquering Princes (who are all now either <hi>in ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,</hi> or <hi>in bondage</hi>) and thereupon, to enterpize in their behalfe, some such high and worthy Acts as may eternize their owne names, and convey them with an honourable mention to Posterity.</p>
                  <p>Or however, were we certaine of it, (as we are not) that these of this Age on the one side, (who <hi>received not the Truth,</hi> or<note place="margin">2 Thes. 2. 10.</note> retained not the love thereof, when they had it) are given <hi>up to such strong delusions,</hi> that they cannot be recovered out of Satans snare: and those on the other side, were not likely to be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by such endeavours; yet our duty is to have respect to after Ages, &amp; to prevent, that the spirits of Posterity be not stained with a false opinion of our King, as doubtlesse they also are like to be, by those Bookes and Libels of the enemy conveyed unto them, unlesse as much or more of ours be left too, to present him in his true character to their knowledge. Without question, we that are now alive shal never scape the censure of succeding Generations, (<hi>viz.</hi> to have been too basely sluggish and faint-heared) if such transcendent villanies should be acted in our dayes against our <hi>King,</hi> our <hi>Religion,</hi> and so many of us, and many of us should not be found to have layed open the enemies basenesse to their faces; nay, when they that come after us shall apply themselves to write the History of these our times, how will they be able truly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paint these superlative Hypocrites in their due colours, if plenty of our Books be not extant to this purpose, to hint the notice of their true conditions.</p>
                  <p>Let no man therefore plead that writing will do no good, as if silence could doe more, or had done any; I know indeed that much hath been writ already; more a great deal then hath or may be read; for the enemie hath set forth many threats and orders against such as shall sell or buy the same; and hereupon many are discouraged from writing more. And perhaps too, many have feared to Publish what they have further written, lest they prove obstructers to a desired Peace, and so doe
