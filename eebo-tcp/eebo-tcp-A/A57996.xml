            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I Cannot without some despondency of mind and awful fear of the Greatness of Your Majesty, make an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering at Your Sacred feet of so small an esteem and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable value, as these following Histories. For having travelled long in remote Countries, and resided no less than eighteen years in <hi>Turky,</hi> the World may reasonably expect some rich returns unto Your Majesty in Persian Silks, and Tyrian Purples, or in the finest Carpets, and other Gaye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in which the softness and luxury of the Lesser <hi>Asia</hi> did an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently abound: and may now judge me a Bankrupt, or an ill Husband of my Talent, when they see me at home trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in Your Royal Presence, with a Gift no more worthy than a few sheets of Paper; which being a Sacrifice inferiour and beneath the acceptance of so Great a Monarch, I might reasonably fear, that they would take fire at the heat of Your just displeasure, were they not with all humility and reverence consecrated to the Royal Clemency. For in this glorious Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and Attribute, Your Majesty (as is notorious to the World) exceeding all the most Serene and the most Clement Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours that ever were, expects not from me, either Gold or Jewels, but rather a true account of my time, how I have spent it in the Service of God and of Your Majesty: and how I have administred that Publick Trust and Interest which was committed to my Management. Accept therefore, <hi>GREAT SIR,</hi> these following Discourses to discharge part of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my time, with other Treatises which have been the Employment to fill up my vacant Intervals: the remaining
<pb facs="tcp:98602:3"/>
account of my hours are not to be justified by my own report, but by the Testimony of others, whose wisdom and goodness will be as ready to owne my Industry and Faithfulness in their Concernments, as they will be to excuse and pardon my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities.</p>
                  <p>Ever since the time of Your Majesties happy Restauration, my Lot hath fallen to live and act within the Dominions of the Turk, and there to move in a Publick Capacity; which though it was in an Administration of one of the lowest note and degree, yet the great Influence which the flourishing Estate of that Trade hath on the common Good of <hi>England,</hi> nourished in me a secret pride and satisfaction in that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, which called and raised up all my endeavours to acquit my self therein with prudence, faithfulness, and industry, there being the same Regularity required in the Stars of the lower, as in those of higher Magnitude.</p>
                  <p>This hath been the first, and indeed the only Affair I ever managed for the Publick; for before Your Majesties blessed Return, the Character noted on my Family of being Loyal, as it made them at first active and zealous in the Service of Your Glorious Father, so afterwards it famed them for their Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and rendred them and me uncapable of Office. But Your Majesty returning like the Sun to animate and cherish all living Creatures with an equality proportioned to their several Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, hath been pleased also to bestow a Ray of Your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign Influence on my self, whereby having received comfort and refreshment, I do with all sense of my Duty, and with entire Devotion pray unto the King of Kings for the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, long Life, and immortal Glory of Your Majesty, and with all reverence and humble submission devote and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate my self, for ever to remain,</p>

                  <p>But the other part of this History beginning from the Year <hi>1660.</hi> and continued to the Year 1677. is the Product of my own Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, being matters transacted in my time, which being part seen by my self, and in part received from good and probable Advices, I call by the Name of my MEMOIRS, in regard that I am little obliged to other Writers for those Collections; and therefore by Gods assistance assume the chief Merit of that Work unto my self: which I desire and heartily wish, Good Reader, might for thy satisfaction, and for the benefit of the World be still continued, and the thread of History drawn out unto future Ages: as also that those Errours and Mistakes of which I have been guilty herein, might be corrected and amended.

                  <head>THE REIGN OF Sultan MORAT OR AMURAT IV. THE Eleventh EMPEROUR AND Twenty first MONARCH OF THE TURKS.</head>
                  <p>THE weak Understanding of Sultan <hi>Mustapha,</hi> and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1623"/> for Rule, caused the Affairs of State both at home and abroad to move disorderly and irregular. <hi>Where vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and injustice prevail, there is so little distance between the most eminent height of Grandeur and the lowest abyss of misery, that a Prince may in a moment step from one unto the other.</hi> The Janisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Military Officers commanded more now than the Civil, all things being guided by the air and fancy of the Souldiery, who placed and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed with that wind of favour and displeasure, which is agreeable to the humor of a multitude and the licentiousness of Arms. For at the same time there were three Emperours, seven Great Viziers, two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain-Pasha's, five Aga's of the Janisaries, three Treasurers, six Pasha's of <hi>Cairo,</hi> and in proportion the changes and alterations were as many in all the Provinces of the Empire. All this confusion evidently proceeding from the weak and almost sensless understanding of <hi>Mustapha;</hi> the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98602:5"/>
and people concurred as it were in an universal consent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne him a second time, and exalt into his place Sultan <hi>Morat</hi> Brother to <hi>Osman,</hi> who was murthered the year before. The principal Actors in this contrivance were <hi>Kiosem</hi> the Mother of <hi>Morat,</hi> and the Mufti; but in the execution hereof three difficulties occurred. The sirst was <hi>Chusaein</hi> Pasha the Great Vizier, who by reason of the inabilities of <hi>Mustapha,</hi> being become absolute Lord and Soveraign of all, would be unwilling to assent unto that Proposition, which might degrade him of his Dignity, and divest him of his Power. A second obstacle was the fancy and humor of the Souldiery, who having with much zeal and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion exalted <hi>Mustapha</hi> to the Throne, it might be doubted, that in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the same humor they would with equal obstinacy persevere in their Election. A third was the poverty or low ebb of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, which at that time was in no capacity to supply that Donative to the Souldiery, which was usual and customary at the Inauguration of every Sultan. To forward and hasten this change and ripen this Plot, the News of the Rebellion of <hi>Abassa</hi> did much contribute, who with a Body of fifteen thousand Horse roved over all the Plains of <hi>Kara-hisar,</hi> calling himself Avenger of Sultan <hi>Osmans</hi> Murder, and Enemy of the Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, by whose Mutiny and Conspiracy he was put to death; in satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for which he not only killed all Janisaries which fell into his hands, but their wives, children, and those allied to them he destroyed with implacable malice and bloody rage. Upon this advice the Janisaries at <hi>Constantinople</hi> being moved with equal fury and desire of revenge, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied themselves to their Aga, proposing a speedy union with the Spahees for suppressing this Rebellion before time gave it greater growth, and made the humor more stubborn and difficult to be purged. At the same time also came Letters from <hi>Cicala</hi> Pasha (who was dispeeded into <hi>Asia</hi> with a strong Party to give a stop to the farther progress and advance of <hi>Abassa</hi>) advising that upon his near approach to the Enemy, so general a fear possessed his Souldiery, that most of them disbanded and forsook their Colours; and that at present he had no more than five hundred Janisaries, and two hundred Spahees under his Command, which he found to be an unequal match to contend with the increasing power of <hi>Abassa.</hi> This Intelligence served happily the occasion of the Mufti, Vizier, and Aga to give a turn to the desired change, and supplied them with an answer to the Janisaries, that they were ready to yield compliance unto their Address, but that the incapacity of their Soveraign obstructed their proceedings, and that the defect in the principal wheel disordered all the motions of good Government. At which reply the Janisaries becoming more unquiet, assembled themselves in a tumultuous manner at the Mosch of Sultan <hi>Solyman,</hi> where making an <note n="*" place="margin">Avack in Turkish signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a Foot.</note> Ayack Divan, (so called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they sit not down, but stand on their legs to denote the present haste and urgency of their affair) it was enacted by an unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Civil and Military power, That young <hi>Morat</hi> or <hi>Amurat</hi> should be promoted to the Throne, and that <hi>Mustapha</hi> should be depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: and because the Exchequer was at its lowest ebb, and wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted by miscarriage of the Officers, the Souldiers were contented to dispense with their Donative, which they relinquished in consideration of the publick good, reserving still their Title and Claim thereunto at times of a more happy Inauguration. With this News the Vizier imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately mounted on Horse-back to signifie this universal Decree to <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stapha,</hi>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:98602:5"/>
but he found him so stupid, as if he had been insensible of the Message; and his Mother wanting power to resist this strong convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, gave way to necessity, and seemed to embrace what she could not oppose.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Mustapha</hi> falling from the Heaven of his Throne to the Abyss of his Prison, seemed to return unto his centre; for being only by the wild-fire of Fortune carried as far aloft, as the force of popular powder could reach, he afterwards by the meer weight of his earthly temper returned with the like quickness of motion to the place from whence he ascended.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon Sultan <hi>Amurat,</hi> a Youth of about fourteen years of age, was brought forth to the people, and placed in the Throne with all the acclamations and rejoycings of the people. And being taught by his Mother in a feigned manner to refuse acceptance of the Empire, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that the Exchequer was exhausted, and that therefore he was not able to demonstrate the affection and esteem he had for them, and that since they had killed their former Sultans, he was fearful lest the tenderness of his age should betray him to the like violence: but the Souldiery having not the patience to hearken to his excuses, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carried him to the Divan, where having cloathed him in white, they <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Amurat</hi> instal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> seated him on a Safraw erected with four Pillars studded with precious Stones; the Covering of which was of Crimson Velvet richly embroide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Gold and Oriental Pearl. And being so seated, the Mufti with all reverence approached, and kissed his hand; and then turning to the people he demanded of them, if they were contented with that Prince whom they now beheld in the Seat of the Ottoman Kings; to which they having given assent by their loud acclamations, <hi>Morat</hi> with a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming gravity encharged the Mufti to take care that Justice and the Law be executed, and so retired to his Lodgings with general satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. The next morning he was carried by Water to the Mosch of <hi>Jub</hi> in the Suburbs of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where according to the Solemnity of the Ottoman Empire, having performed his <note n="*" place="margin">Which is a dispensing of Mutton to the Poor.</note> 
                     <hi>Corban</hi> or Sacrifice, and having his Cemiter girt to his side by the Emirsheriff, he mounted on Horse-back, and with a magnificent Train entred by the Gate of <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Mustapha,</hi> who was more worthy to bear a Fools Cap than an Imperial Diadem, was conducted to Prison, and more narrowly guarded than formerly; howsoever no man offered to take away his life, the persons of Fools and Idiots being sacred in esteem of the Turks, and the least injury offered to them accounted irreligious and unlucky.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Morat</hi> was of a lively countenance, full-fac'd, dark hair, of a black and lively eye, ruddy and sanguine Complexion, and in every degree of a promising and hopeful Aspect: but his exteriour appearance did not correspond with the internal cruelty of his violent Spirit, having some similitude with the Swan, which hath white feathers and black flesh.</p>
                  <p>The Great Vizier who assisted at this Solemnity was (as we have said) <hi>Chusaein</hi> Pasha, a person of self-interest, who had wasted and consumed the Treasury, and converted a great part thereof to his own benefit; he was a Tyrant, hated of all men, and supported himself by no other Art than bribing of the Souldiery: and to his other Crimes he added that of having unjustly persecuted <hi>Halil</hi> Pasha, and deprived him of his Office, his power not reaching to the taking away his life; which being
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98602:6"/>
reserved for better times, he was again recalled from his retirement, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1624"/> by special command of the Sultan, was unwillingly restored to the Office of Vizier, being best pleased with a quiet and pacifick life, to which his melancholy temper had naturally disposed him. In the mean time <hi>Chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saein</hi> Pasha being terrified by the sensible touches of his own conscience, took his flight by way of the Black Sea, and being out of the reach of Justice, a Fine was set of five thousand Zechins, and of Lands to the Revenue of an hundred thousand Aspers a year, to be given unto him who should bring his head; many of those who had sold him their friendship and favour being affrighted with this Sentence, voluntarily disgorged the rewards they had received, and amongst the rest the last Aga of the Janisaries, who had been his Kahya or Steward for the space of three months, restored eight hundred thousand Dollars as an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his sin, and a ransom for purchasing his own life and Office. At length by force of the foregoing reward <hi>Chusaein</hi> Pasha was betrayed and taken alive, and being brought to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> was immediately strangled before the gate of the Divan.</p>
                  <p>Many were the difficulties which this young Sultan was to encounter, the greatest of which was the insolence of the Janisaries, who feeling themselves empty of money, began to repent of the prodigal and easie remission of their Donative, and in a tumultuous manner to redemand it again. There was no argument or debate to be used against men of the Sword, who hearkned to no other reason than their own wants, and to satisfie them there was no other remedy than compliance; wherefore all Officers and persons not employed in Military Affairs were forced to contribute towards a large Tax, and a shameful demand was made for the Loan of thirty thousand Zechins from the four Christian Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours resident at the Port, that they also as Friends might yield an assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand towards the present urgency of Affairs: so little consideration and shame have Turks to lay open the nakedness and distress of their Country even to strangers and enemies of it. And indeed such was the insolence and uncontroulable power of the Souldiery, that their desires and commands were Laws, and their determinations Rules for their Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and his Subjects.</p>
                  <p>This humor of Usurpation and unlimited Power wearied all the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Empire, and inclined them secretly to approve the cause of <hi>Abassa</hi> Pasha of <hi>Erzirum,</hi> who declared and stiled himself Enemy to the Janisaries; and of <hi>Bechir</hi> Pasha of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who was joyned with him. The Vizier also finding his power abridged by the arbitrary will of the Souldiery moved slowly and coldly into <hi>Asia,</hi> where all the Force he could make consisted of no more than fifty thousand new and unexperienced men, such as were uncapable to contend with a more numerous Army of veterane Souldiers; to which also the Beglerbei of <hi>Anatolia</hi> joyned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as did all other the chief Timar-Spahees, who conspired together to confound and destroy the pride and government of the Janisaries. The Vizier also was of the same Party, and coldly at first answered the request of the Janisaries, when they earnestly pressed him to lead them against <hi>Abassa</hi> their common and mortal Enemy: at length being fortified with the Force of the Timar-Spahees, he told them plainly, That if they would go and fight, he would be a Spectator of the success, but would not ingage himself in a quarrel wherein the blood of <hi>Musselmen</hi> might be spilt on one side and the other: by which means the Rebels in <hi>Asia</hi> took
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98602:6"/>
head, increased in force, and every day rendred them in a more formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1625"/> and dangerous posture.</p>
                  <p>But this was not all the trouble which ensued; for the Tartars having refused that King whom the Grand Signior had appointed them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, declared for <hi>Mehmet</hi> his Brother, who was seconded by the Votes of the generality, and maintained by the strongest nerve of that Nation. The Vizier was unwilling to ingage in this quarrel, alledging, That a Civil War was the worst of evils, and that it was better to coanive at a present inconvenience, than in this distracted time of Affairs to pollute the Empire with the blood of Tartars, who were their Brethren and of the same Religion and Alliance with them. Howsoever the Divan was of another opinion, and resolved to dispeed the Captain-Pasha with a Force sufficient to re-instate <hi>Gherey</hi> (for so the elder Brother was called) in the Government of that Kingdom: but yet the Instructions given ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directed him to act with dexterity than with force, supposing that the Authority of the Turks abetted with the presence of a considerable Force would create an inclination in the Tartars to obedience, so soon as they discovered them to appear on their Coast. The Captain-Pasha being arrived at <note n="*" place="margin">The chief City of the <hi>Krim</hi> Tartar.</note> 
                     <hi>Caffá,</hi> declared, That he was sent by the Grand Signior not to exclude either one or other of the Pretenders, but only to be Witness of a free and fair Election, that so all Civil discord ceasing, that Party might be chosen who was most pleasing to the generality of the people: to which end two Standards were erected, one for <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Gherey</hi> the name of the Family.</note> 
                     <hi>Gherey</hi> the elder Brother desired by the Turks, and the other for <hi>Mehmet</hi> beloved of the Tartars. The people in multitudes ran to the Standard of <hi>Mehmet,</hi> and but few to that of <hi>Gherey,</hi> which demonstrated at how mean a rate the Tartars esteemed the protection and favour of the Port. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain-Pasha vexed hereat, denied to give his assent to the confirmation, on pretence, that he was first to demand the Grand Signior's pleasure; but at length was perswaded by <hi>Gherey</hi> to land a Force of about eight thousand men to owne and maintain his Cause, on hopes, that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ingage against the Turks, the people would condescend to Terms in his admission and favour. The Tartars not being in the least dismayed hereat, arrayed themselves in a warlike posture, and feigning fear and flight, allured the Turks to a pursuit of them, until they had brought them to a place where thirty thousand Horse lay in ambush, which on a sudden arising and encompassing them round, had entirely destroyed them, had not <hi>Salil</hi> the Brother of <hi>Mehmet</hi> given a stop to the slaughter, on hopes, that such a testimony of friendship would recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the spirits of the Turks, at least might render his Brother's prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more tolerable and grateful to the Turks. In this conflict <hi>Ibrahim</hi> and <hi>Chusaein</hi> who were Viziers of the Bench, the Kahya and a Capigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bashe of the Seraglio were slain, whose bodies were afterwards trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> six hundred Janisaries and as many Sea-men were killed, and fifteen hundred Prisoners were taken, whose liberty was procured at a mean ransom for the sake of that Faith and Religion which they joyntly professed; they also took thirty Pieces of Cannon, and might also have become Masters of the whole Fleet consisting of thirty six Gallies, had they been desirous to have prosecuted their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to the utmost advantage: and moreover in that conjuncture of affairs, when a general consternation had overspread the principal parts of the Ottoman Dominions, when the Counsels were feeble and faint,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98602:7"/>
and that a languishing pulse beat in all the Government, had the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar with an Army of fifty thousand Horse then ready to march, made up to the Walls of <hi>Adrianople;</hi> it might have proved such an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for dividing and destroying this Empire, as hath not offered at any time since that occasion. But the two Brothers <hi>Mehmct</hi> and <hi>Salil</hi> stiling their War forced and defensive, used that moderation in their Victory which might not provoke a desire of revenge in the Turks. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain-Pasha being thus permitted to depart from <hi>Caffa</hi> with his Fleet, sailed to <hi>Varna,</hi> a Port in the Black Sea about two hundred miles distant from <hi>Constantinople;</hi> where the News of this defeat being arrived, put all the City into confusion, and raised the Viziers at midnight to consult of those remedies and expedients, which were agreeable to the present emergency of Affairs. The Great Vizier <hi>Ali</hi> was of opinion, that the Grand Signior ought to condescend to Terms of Accommodation, though to the disadvantage and disreputation of his power; and that accordingly a Letter should be wrote to <hi>Mehmet</hi> the Tartar, beginning with the usual Complements of Friendship and Salutation; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards declaring, That it was never the intention of the Port to ingage in a War against him, the late conflict having only proceeded from a mistake and misinterpretation of Orders; and that there was no other design than to compose the Civil differences amongst themselves by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing that Prince to the Kingly Dignity who was most pleasing and grateful to the people. This advice was approved by the rest of the Council, and a Messenger dispatched with the Letter, accompanied with a Cemiter and Vest of Sables, which are the Signals of the Sultans favour. In the mean time the people murmured at the pusillanimity of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, saying, That they had sent an Ambassadour to thank the Tartar for not seizing their whole Fleet, and acknowledge their obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him for the blows and wounds he had given their Army. The Tartars also gloried in this submission, and took the boldness to vaunt of their Linage and Descent to be more Ancient and Noble than that of the Ottoman Family; and that in this time of decay and degenerate procedure of that Monarchy, it appertained to the Greatness of the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars to stir up the fire and snuff the lamp, that the Splendour of that Empire might become more bright and shining than in former Ages: and so little respect did they now maintain for the Port, that they surprised two Ambassadours sent from the Moscovite in their way to <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> robbed and killed them, as also the Turkish Chiaus that was with them, lest his testimony should be brought in for an evidence against them.</p>
                  <p>During these Troubles the Cosacks taking advantage of the Captain-Pasha's <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1626"/> absence in <hi>Tartary,</hi> entred the <hi>Bosphorus</hi> with about an hundred and sifty Sail of Saicks and Boats; these Boats and Vessels which the <note place="margin">The form of Cosacks Boats.</note> Cosacks use are built long and light with ten Oars of a side, and two men to an Oar; the Head and Stern are not unlike, so that they hang the Rudder sometimes at one end, and sometimes at the other, being not obliged to turn their Vessel, but without loss of time to proceed with that end which happens to be foremost. Each Boat carries fifty select men armed with Fire-arms and Cemiter, in the management of which they are very expert; and are a People sober, enduring labour and hard diet, and so speedy in their Incursions, that they forestal the advices, and commonly strike before they threaten. With these Boats
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98602:7"/>
and people (as we have said) they entred the <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> where they burnt several Villages and Houses of Pleasure; on the Grecian side they burnt <hi>Boyuc-deri</hi> and <hi>Yenichioi,</hi> on the Asian side <hi>Stenia.</hi> The appearance of this Enemy so near the Imperial City caused a general consternation, not unlike that at <hi>London,</hi> when the Dutch entred the River of <hi>Chatham.</hi> To oppose this Force there was not one Gally in readiness, so that Saicks, Chimbers, and small Boats were armed to the number of four or five hundred, and man'd with such people as the present haste and expedition offered; the great Chain was then brought forth to cross the <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> which the Grecian Emperours used at the Siege of <hi>Constantinople:</hi> and ten thousand men were issued from the City to defend the shoar from depredation and farther mischief. The Turkish Fleet faced the Cosacks to give them a stop, whilst they hovered about the middle of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel in form of a Half-Moon, and so continued the whole day until Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set; when with the night they returned into the Sea, carrying with them, besides their Booty, glory sufficient to have entred the Chanel, and without blows or opposition to have braved the Capital Seat of the Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman Monarchy, and the most formidable City of the whole World. Not many days after they returned again with a greater Force than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which put the City into the like consternation; and having hove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red about three or four days at the Mouth of the Black Sea, they burnt the Pharos or Lantern with certain Villages thereabouts, and being laden with Spoils and Glory, they again returned into their own Country. Thus we may observe, how bold Enemies are made with the weakness of a State: a Horse is soon sensible of his Rider, when backed by a faint hand and an unaccustomed lightness, but a stisf Rein and a close knee makes him obedient to his Ruler. All people having discovered the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillity of the Government, made head against it: and the young Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan had those for his Enemies in the time of his Nonage, which in his strong and fiercer years became the most submissive and fawning Slaves in the World.</p>
                  <p>And though at this time the Turkish Ministers were corrupt and rebellious, and the Souldiery mutinous; yet <hi>Bethlem Gabor</hi> Prince of <hi>Transylvania,</hi> a Christian, was observant to the Port, demanding licence <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bethlem Gabor</hi> desires assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance against the Emperour.</note> to wage War against the Emperour, which was easily granted, and upon payment of the usual Tribute of ten thousand Hungars, the Ambassadour with thirteen of his Followers received Coftans or Vests of Honour, and a promise of Succour and Protection, as the condition of his Affairs should require. Thus we see, that whilst the Turks themselves endeavoured to rent in pieces their own Monarchy; to which one would have thought, that the Christians had most reason to contribute: yet such was the unhappy Fate of Christendom, that <hi>Gabor</hi> was the only person at that time to court the Turks; and that for no other reason, than that he might be supported and abetted in a War against the Emperour and other Christian Princes of <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Army of <hi>Bethlem Gabor</hi> consisted of above thirty thousand men, with which he marched over all <hi>Hungary,</hi> having taken most Towns of consideration, unless <hi>Presburg aliàs Possonium, Rab,</hi> and <hi>Komorra:</hi> but if we penetrate into the depth and foundation of this War, we shall find that it had a deeper interest than that of <hi>Gabor,</hi> and had its Original from the discord and Civil War of <hi>Germany.</hi> For the House of <hi>Austria</hi> being at that time in a condition to render it self formidable, and in a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98602:8"/>
posture to create a jealousie in all the Princes subjected to it, did under colour of subduing the Palatine of the <hi>Rhyne,</hi> oppress also the liberty of the Empire, and of the several States which composed it. For after the Emperour against the Constitutions of the Golden Seal, and the sense of the Electoral Colledge, had divested the Palatine and his Children of their Estates and Dignity, not so much by force of Arms as by deceit and breach of promise; instead of disbanding the Army, which was to have been performed according to agreement, new Troops were added; and though the Protestant League was dissolved, yet the Catholick Combination with all its Adherents remained armed and immoveable to compel the Protestants to a restitution of the Ecclesiastical Revenue, notwithstanding the Articles of Peace to the contrary: so that the Princes and Towns of the Lower <hi>Saxony</hi> entring into a new League raised an Army under the Command of <hi>Christian</hi> of <hi>Brunswick</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alberstadt. Bethlem Gabor</hi> having his interest adjoyned to this Party, entertained the same desires and intentions to suppress the Greatness of the Emperour; and having the just complaint to alledge of wanting his annual Pension of fifty thousand Crowns, as was agreed by the Treaty of <hi>Niclasbourg,</hi> he resolved to force it by Arms, and take part with the Princes of the Protestant Religion which he professed: but because his strength and power was not sufficient without the assistance of the Turks, he not only obtained their permission and approbation of this War, as we have said before, but by payment of fifty thousand Dollars presented to the first Vizier, and of forty thousand by way of annual Tribute, he procured an auxiliary Force of fifty thousand Turks and Tartars; with part of which, commanded by <hi>Budiani,</hi> he made an irruption into the Lower <hi>Austria,</hi> and with the other <hi>Bethlem</hi> himself about the beginning of <hi>October</hi> entred into <hi>Moravia,</hi> defeated the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Tissenbach,</hi> retook the Town of <hi>Turnova,</hi> and routed the Count of <hi>Montenegro</hi> General for his Imperial Majesty before the Town of <hi>Gho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> on the Frontier of <hi>Moravia,</hi> which he afterwards beleagured and held besieged until the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> when <hi>Stanislaus Turzow</hi> a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garian Palatine became Mediator of the Peace, and at length obtained a Truce: the principal Articles of which were as followeth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That on both parts Arms be laid down for ten months, and all Acts of Hostility cease, that on neither side any attempt should be made either by force or fraud to take any Castles, Forts, Cities, or places of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence during this time; and that both Germans, Hungarians, and Turks should be alike comprehended.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That if the Emperour were desirous to treat and conclude a final Peace with the Grand Signior, he should use <hi>Bethlem Gabor</hi> as Mediator, and do nothing therein without his privity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That all Places and Forts taken by the Prince of <hi>Transylvania</hi> in his late Expedition, and that all Cities and Castles now in possession of either, should so remain without any alteration.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That all Passages should be open for free Trade of Merchants, and all other the Subjects and Friends of either side.</p>
                  <p>A Truce being thus concluded, the Turks in their return made great havock, carrying with them great numbers of poor Christians into Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, which <hi>Gabor</hi> out of compassion seemed willing to redeem with a low price at his own charge, which the Turks refusing, carried those miserable Wretches into Captivity. The Count <hi>Esterhast</hi> Governour of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98602:8"/>
                     <hi>Newhausel</hi> for the Emperour, being highly incensed at this treacherous action contrary to the Truce so lately concluded, having drawn out a sufficient Force from the neighbouring Garrisons, fell on the Rear of the Turks in their March towards <hi>Buda,</hi> and charged them so home on the Banks of the River <hi>Niter,</hi> that he killed five hundred of them on the place, took all their Baggage, with divers Prisoners, and gave liberty to many Christian Slaves. The next day but one after he charged ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Party of them, as they attempted to pass a Bridge, which the night before he had caused to be broken down; of which having killed a great number, the rest saved themselves by swimming: howsoever many Christians procured their liberty thereby, and a considerable Booty was made of Horses, Camels, Waggons, and all Provisions. The other Troops consisting of greater numbers were worse treated than the former; for <hi>Esterhast</hi> having received a Recruit of Horse from <hi>Reiffemberg</hi> Governour of <hi>Komorra,</hi> and <hi>Breuner</hi> of <hi>Javarin</hi> or <hi>Rab,</hi> he proceeded boldly to meet the Turks, and joyning Battel with them, he slew twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred on the place, gave liberty to fourteen hundred Christians, took divers of their principal Commanders with all their Bag and Baggage, besides a considerable quantity of Gold and Silver in Plate and Money. Nor were <hi>Reiffemberg</hi> and <hi>Breuner</hi> less successful over those who passed through their Quarters to joyn with the Garrisons of <hi>Alba Regalis</hi> and <hi>Canisia,</hi> having killed seven hundred of them, and taken all their Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage. Moreover Count <hi>Serini</hi> in his Journey towards <hi>Vienna</hi> defeated six hundred of them, and presented their Colours to the Emperour: and <hi>Esterhast</hi> in like manner after his several Exploits offered thirty Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets at his feet, with six Prisoners of Quality, one of which was Kinsman of <hi>Bethlem Gabor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These rebuffs cooled the courage of the Turks a little, and altered the resolution of the Council for carrying forward the War on the side of <hi>Germany,</hi> as was intended, had the success answered expectation: For these misfortunes abroad, and intestine troubles at home, with Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Famine, which at the same time greatly afflicted the parts of <hi>Constantinople</hi> (whereby an hundred thousand people dyed) abated the mettle of the Turks, and caused them to take new measures in all their determinations: and for that reason Ambassadours were sent both to <hi>Vienna</hi> and into <hi>Poland</hi> to renew the Articles of Peace, and so to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the League, that whilst the Sultan was imployed in his Wars with <hi>Persia</hi> and the Eastern Countries, nothing should intervene from the Western parts to trouble or obstruct his progress, or recal him from his Enterprise. For now the Rebellion of <hi>Abassa,</hi> joyned with <hi>Bechir</hi> Pasha of <hi>Bagdat,</hi> growing daily more considerable, and his strength increasing to that condition, that he was able to keep the field in despight of the Grand Signiors Forces, he adventured to quarter within five days March of <hi>Constantinople:</hi> and at the same time Letters coming from <hi>Hafish</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sha General of the Army in the Province of <hi>Bagdat,</hi> that the King of <hi>Persia</hi> was entred into the Dominions of the Turk with a powerful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, a general consternation seized the whole Turkish Court, the wisest and stouiest having occasion to call up for all their wisdom and courage to assist at a time when the Government was assailed on all sides, both at home and abroad. Various were the Counsels and Proposals in what manner to proceed in times of such emergency. First it was resolved to proclaim a War both against the King of <hi>Persia</hi> and the Rebels in <hi>Asia,</hi>

and that whosoever took of the Grand Signior Pay from one Asper a day to a higher value, should be in readiness to serve in the War upon penalty of losing his Estate, of being accounted a Rebel, and his wife and children sold for Slaves. But the more sober and moderate sort judged it policy to take off <hi>Abassa</hi> by sending him a general Pardon, with a concession of all his demands, upon condition, that he should turn his Arms upon the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> who was the common Enemy of their Country and Religion: but the Janisaries would by no means assent to this agreement with a person to whom they bore a more inveterate ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, than to the Persian himself, as he did also to the Janisaries. For that he might better justifie his pretence of revenge, he declared, That being one day in a Mosch at his Prayers the murdered <hi>Osman</hi> appeared to him, and taking him by the hand said, My faithful <hi>Mussulman,</hi> since thou art the most generous of all my Slaves, I command thee to revenge my death, with the blood of sixty thousand Janisaries and Spahees, good Fortune shall accompany thy Arms, and Victory shall crown thy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. During these intrigues and difficulties of reconciliation, <hi>Abassa</hi> spoiled the Lesser <hi>Asia,</hi> and the Persian King conquered the City and Province of <hi>Bagdat</hi> or <hi>Babylon,</hi> took <hi>Kur Asan</hi> Pasha an old Souldier Prisoner, possessed himself of <hi>Mosul</hi> and <hi>Leska</hi> on the Persian Sea, and meeting no considerable opposition, he divided his Army into four parts. The first was dispeeded into <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> commanded by the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. The second made Incursions into <hi>Palestine.</hi> The third infested the Coast of the Black Sea: and the fourth marched towards <hi>Mecha,</hi> with hope and design of sharing all the parts of the Eastern Empire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ali</hi> Pasha, who opposed the King in <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> was slain and his Army wholly defeated, so that the Province became a prey to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: the success in <hi>Palestine</hi> was equally fortunate by the revolt of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascus,</hi> a place of great riches and importance; the Coast of the Black Sea was grievously infested, and a Port taken near to <hi>Trapezond;</hi> and little opposition being made at <hi>Balsora,</hi> the Town was taken by that Army in their March towards <hi>Mecha</hi> and the parts of the Red Sea, where they rendered themselves Masters of <hi>Medina</hi> the City of their Prophet <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To repair these losses, and to encounter numbers so strong and valiant in all parts, the Vizier was dispeeded with a powerful Force to the Town of <hi>Bagdat;</hi> but by reason of Mutinies and Tumults amongst the Souldiery, matters found not the success expected: and the Garrison making valiant and vigorous Sallies against the imbecillity of the Turkish Souldiery, which were always most obstinate and stout to oppose their <note place="margin">The Siege rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed at <hi>Bagdat,</hi> and the Turks overthrown.</note> own Commanders, obtained an advantage in every Attempt; by which discouragement many forsaking their Colours, the Siege was raised with dishonour, and the interest of the Turk impaired and almost irreparably lost in those Provinces. This News arrived at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that the Camp was risen and fled by night, that they were forced to burn their Tents and Provisions, and to break their great Artillery and cast them into the <hi>Euphrates:</hi> that the miseries in the Army had been such by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and Pestilence, and want of all Provisions and Ammunition, that the like was never known: that the Vizier had beheaded three of his Pasha's, that so he might cast the whole blame upon them; and that now retreating with his Army into the Turkish Dominions, the Persians pursued them in the Rear, and for ten days did execution on them, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

the best use they could of their Victory; which relation silled the hearts of all people with sadness, and disordered the Counsels with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion. The cause of which ill success according to custom being impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the General, he was deprived of his Office, and sacrificed to the fury of the Janisaries.</p>
                  <p>These troubles were increased at <hi>Constantinople</hi> by the Addresses which the Prince of <hi>Transylvania</hi> made unto the Port by his Kapi-Kahya or Agent, representing to the Grand Signior, That he wanting Heirs Male to succeed him in his Principality, the States at a Diet had with common consent elected his Lady for his Successour, and therefore desired consir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from the Port; in excuse of her Sex he alledged the urgent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of the present times, which perswaded rather to admit of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a Woman, than that his Principality should for want of an Heir fall into the hands of the powerful Family of <hi>Austria.</hi> To make good this demand, Duke <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Weymar</hi> and Count <hi>Mansfelt</hi> arrived <note place="margin">Duke of <hi>

The Emperours Resident at <hi>Constantinople</hi> greatly exclaimed against these proceedings, which something troubled the Counsels of the Turks, who in that conjuncture were unwilling to give beginnings to a new War; so that besides fair words they promised to write such Letters to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sha of <hi>Buda,</hi> as should give a stop to the Investiture of the Princess; but to say truly, the Instructions given were in such ambiguous terms, that they in essect lest the whole matter to the discretion of <hi>Morteza</hi> to act, as he judged most agreeable to the state of Affairs on the Frontiers, and security of the present Peace.</p>
                  <p>Thus did the Turkish Court seek to ward off the blow of a War with <hi>Germany,</hi> and yet secretly nourished and encouraged it, by giving Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the Pasha of <hi>Buda</hi> to take up his Winter-quarters with the Prince of <hi>Transylvania,</hi> and to follow his directions; but yet so to govern mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with caution, as not to engage too far on uncertain grounds or doubtful hazard, but to embrace Propositions of Peace, if offered with honour and security. In prosecution of these Rules, <hi>Morteza</hi> observing, that <hi>Weymar</hi> and <hi>Mansfelt</hi> having united their Forces with <hi>Gabor,</hi> had formed a considerable Army, and were able to sight with <hi>Wallestein</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Imperialists; joyned also his Forces to theirs, judging it a prudent and politick design to wage a War at the blood and expence of others. With these encouragements, and with the favour of a good opportunity the Confederates fell upon the Army of <hi>Wallestein</hi> near the River <hi>Gran,</hi> who not being able to withstand their force and fury, was <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Army deseated.</note> put to flight, and pursued in the Rear with great slaughter; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to pass the River on two Bridges of Boats, were closely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the Princes Forces, who gaining the pass, put the whole Army into great amazement, and resolved to pursue them to the Gates of <hi>Presburg</hi> or <hi>Vienna.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding this success, the Prince of <hi>Transylvania</hi> observing the backwardness of his Allies to contribute the Succours of Men and Money which they had promised; and fearing that the unfortunate estate of the Turkish Affairs should cause the Sultan to disown the War, dispeeded a Messenger to the Emperour in the Winter-season to excuse the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint upon him of taking up Arms, and to offer Terms of Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

and Peace: but the Emperour refused all Treaties, until such time as <hi>Gabor</hi> had separated himself from his Allies, and from association with the Turk; upon which Answer <hi>Gabor</hi> retired to <hi>Cassovia,</hi> and <hi>Morteza</hi> to <hi>Pesth.</hi> This compliance gave beginning to a Treaty at <hi>Komara,</hi> where the Commissioners on part of the Emperour, of the Grand Signior, and Prince of <hi>Transylvania</hi> assembled. All Parties seemed inclinable to War, and yet with occult intentions to make Peace, being necessitated thereunto by the urgency of their distinct Interests. The Emperour was urged by his Wars with the Protestants of <hi>Germany,</hi> and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Forces from <hi>England</hi> in favour of the Elector Palatine, then King of <hi>Bohemia:</hi> the Grand Signior was encumbred by the unfortunate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <note place="margin">Peace conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded between the Emperour and <hi>Gabor.</hi>

In short, <hi>Gabor</hi> concluded a Peace with the Emperour apart, which gave some jealousies and displeasure to the Grand Signior: howsoever he dissembled his discontent, and willingly interessed <hi>Gabor</hi> with <hi>Morteza</hi> as Commissioner for him; who being va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously disposed, yet moved with the considerations of their common advantage, worked all differences into a Composition of Peace, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of which being brought to <hi>Constantinople</hi> by an Internuntio from the Emperour, and delivered in presence of the two Ambassadours of <hi>Gabor,</hi> they were accepted by the Chimacam, and ratified by the Grand Signior.

                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:98602:11"/>By these Articles we may observe, that both Parties were desirous of a present Peace, rather than one which was durable; for things are so slubber'd over to serve the present occasion, that they leave all disputes undecided, till time should happen more proper to interpret them with the Sword, than with the Pen: like sores obducted by an unskilful Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion, which festering within, must be again opened before they are cured: howsoever they served the turn of <hi>Gabor,</hi> whose interest it was to maintain an ill correspondence between the two Emperours. Peace <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1627"/> being thus concluded between <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Second and Sultan <hi>Morat,</hi> gave some reputation to the Affairs of the Turks: so that notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the late success of the Persian in their War by raising the Siege of <hi>Bagdat,</hi> and overthrow of the Turkish Army; yet that King finding himself now engaged alone, and singly to contend with the Ottoman Power, feared the Puissance of that Empire, lest being roused and heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the sensible pinches of the late disgrace, they should call up and invigorate all their Forces to a revenge, which might at length tend to a ruine and destruction of <hi>Persia,</hi> unless Fortune which attended the first auspicious beginnings with success, did also continue constant, and still accompany their Arms, which could hardly be expected.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore on these considerations becoming more faint in prosecution of the War, the Persian dispatched an Ambassadour to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> furnished with various Proposals and projects for a Peace; but still mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters driving so as to reserve the City and Province of <hi>Bagdat</hi> or <hi>Babylon</hi> in the hands of the Persian, the Treaty became ineffectual, in regard the Vizier (who was then called <hi>Halil</hi> Pasha) judged it a high and an irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable disreputation to the Empire to be dismembred of so principal a part of it. Wherefore the Ambassadour being dispeeded away with some neglect, the Turks armed with that diligence and heat, that they entred <hi>Persia</hi> with an Army of an hundred and fifty thousand men, with which appearance the people being dismayed, suffered <hi>Tauris</hi> to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken without much opposition. From hence marching to <hi>Bagdat,</hi> they found the City well provided and defended with a numerous Garrison, from whence many Sallies were made with variety of Fortune, till at length the Turkish Souldiers being wearied and tired with incessant la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and watchings, many of them fled from their Colours; and with such diminutions, the Army being much abated in its numbers, the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier withdrew them from the Persian Dominions.</p>
                  <p>Some months after the Turkish Army being reinforced, the Vizier entring again into <hi>Persia,</hi> overthrew the Turcmen who opposed him in <note place="margin">Another Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition into <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </note> his March, and destroyed the Gregorians, who were friends to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian, with a very great slaughter, took <hi>Moroc</hi> their General and cut off his head, and adding to these Victories the report of having taken some few inconsiderable Towns, this Expedition ended without other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, or progress of their Arms. This ill success much troubled the Councils at <hi>Constantinople;</hi> for they considered that they had now waged an expensive, laborious War for the space of three years without any effect agreeable to the blood and charge which maintained it, but rather to the loss and damage of the Empire. The Souldiers abhorred the length and tediousness of the way, and the misery of the March, being to pass over vast Countries and Desarts, where there was nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides rocks, sands, and barrenness: many Horses, Camels, and other Beasts of burden perished for want of nourishment; and where provisions
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98602:12"/>
were to be had, the price was so excessive, that the Timariots and other Souldiers had not a purse to defray their charges. The Enemy likewise was very strong, for the Sosi was at the head of forty thousand brave Horse, which daily infested the Ottoman Camp, beat their Convoys, and cut off their Provisions, and so obstructed them, that they could not advance. The Vizier <hi>Halil</hi> then General being discouraged by these <note place="margin">Proposition made by the Persian for a Peace.</note> disasters, was inclinable to accept of the Proposition made by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Babylon</hi> should remain to his eldest Son in Fee, and to his Heirs and Successours, acknowledging to the Grand Signior a Tribute as great as the yearly Revenue which proceeded from it, at the time when it was in the hands of the Sultan. But this middle way seemed an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient dishonourable to the Greatness of this Empire, and that which argued pusillanimity and want of courage in the Government, and therefore was rejected by the Council of State as well as by the Military men. Howsoever the Persians taking their measures by the disposition they discovered in the Vizier thereunto, adventured to dispatch an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour to <hi>Constantinople</hi> with tender of the same project; but as he was coldly and faintly received, so he was in a few days dispatched with few words and little respect, as if he had been sent as a Spy to discover <note place="margin">Rejected by the Turk.</note> the state and condition of the City, and the inclination of the Prince, rather than to obtain any benefit by a Treaty. For now <hi>Amurat</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into years, increased in spirit, and discovered a Martial courage; he began to leave his delights, and walks in gardens, and the society with his Mother and Women, and to assume thoughts of War and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: such as entertained him in softness and luxurious pastimes were reproved by the Ministers about him, and by them perswaded to buckle on his Armour, and to delight in Martial Exercises: so that now new measures were taken in all Affairs; and in the first place <hi>Halil</hi> the Great Vizier was recalled from being General in <hi>Persia,</hi> and the Pasha of <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biquier</hi> put into his place; and though he was Brother-in-law to the Grand Signior, yet being esteemed at Court as a person who had amas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed great richess in his employment, he was forced to disgorge five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand Crowns as an ease of his burden, and an atonement to pacifie the Sultan for the fault of his misfortunes and ill success.</p>
                  <p>In these times of licentiousness and revolt, the Pirates of <hi>Algier</hi> and <hi>Tunis</hi> began also to cast off their respect and reverence to the Ottoman Empire; for being become rich by the Prizes they had taken on Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Vessels, they resolved to set up for themselves, and to esteem the <note place="margin">The Pirates of <hi>Tunis</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier</hi> trouble the Seas.</note> Peace which Christian Princes had made with the Grand Signior not to concern them; but as if their Governments had been independent, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a particular Treaty, and distinct Articles with themselves: so that now daring to do any thing, six Vessels of <hi>Tunis</hi> chased some Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Ships into <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and there attaqued them, notwithstanding that the Castle shot at them: they afterwards took a Dutch Ship which had laden at <hi>Alexandria;</hi> and entring the Port of <hi>Salines</hi> in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with two Venetians: the lesser Ship made a good resistance, but having no help she was thrice fired, and at last burnt: the other being a Ship of eight hundred Tuns, was cowardly set on fire by the Mariners, and abandoned, escaping ashore with their Boats. Then they sailed for <hi>Scanderone,</hi> where finding a Dutch Ship and a Polaca they took both, and then landed. The Aga of the Scale with all the Inhabitants fled, so that finding no opposition they ransacked and robbed all the Ware-houses,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98602:12"/>
and afterwards set them on fire: the greatest loss fell upon the English and Dutch, the first lost about ten thousand Dollars, and the latter about thirty thousand. Of these losses and breach of Peace the Christian Ambassadours much lamented; and complained, that if some remedy were not applied thereto, all Trade must be given over, no security be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be expected in the Articles and Faith of the Grand Signior: to which, though the Vizier and Great men did seem to yield a favourable ear, and promise redress; yet being corrupted with some share of the Spoils, and sweetned with part of the robbery, they began to reject the Memorials of the Ambassadours, and to allow the pleas of the Pirates as grounded on some solid foundation of reason and Religion: fuffering them to publish discourses, that the Turks were obliged to maintain a perpetual War with the Christians, as Enemies to their Law and Alcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran; and though policy may suggest some conveniencies by peace with them, yet those considerations are matters of sin rather than of reason. To make all this good, the Divan of <hi>Tunis</hi> sent two Deputies to remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the great benefit and advantage the Port received by the depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations and hostile acts which they committed on the Christians; and to inculcate this argument the better, they declared, That they had lately taken two Gallies of <hi>Malta,</hi> out of the spoils of which, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented unto the Sultan two Stirrups of Gold, with divers Slaves, two of which were Cavaliers, one of the Roman, and the other of the French Nation: those which were Youths, and comely in shape and feature, were entred into the Service of the Seraglio, and the more strong and robustious were committed to the service of the Gallies; so that the Turks were inwardly pleased with these Piracies, howsoever gave good words to the Christian Ambassadours, promised much and effected no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. At that time Trade flourished greatly in those parts, and had done much more, had it not been interrupted by the Piracies of <hi>Barbary;</hi> and the Trade was especially so great with <hi>Venice,</hi> that a Turkish Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant called <hi>Rodul</hi> Aga, whose whole Negotiation and dealing was for that place, dyed worth a million of Soltanees, of which for want of children the Grand Signior became the sole Heir. But one accident hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened about this time on the Seas worthy to be recounted. The Seas (as we have said) swarming then with Pirates, the General of <hi>Candia</hi> with three Gallies coasting on the Seas for defence and protection of Merchant-Ships, arrived in the Port of <hi>Andro,</hi> from whence espying a Gally plying close under the shore, and believing her to be a Corsaire or Pirate, made up to her; and because it was about the glimpse of the evening, so that she could not be well known or distinguished, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rashly charged her, and meeting a stout resistance, many were killed before it was known that the Gally belonged to the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> commanded by <hi>Dervis Bei,</hi> one of the Grand Signiors Captains: but so <note place="margin">A Fight at Sea by mistake.</note> soon as the mistake was discovered, the Candiot General demanded of the Turk a thousand excuses, returned him his Gally and Slaves again, and whatsoever was taken from him, bestowing with them an infinity of complements, supposing that thereby the spirit of the Turk being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what appeased and mollified, he would represent this encounter with the more favourable terms and advantage at the Port. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which offices of kindness, <hi>Dervis Bei</hi> without farther loss of time pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> bringing his Gally in without Lantern, shot thorough, ill treated, and shattered, feigning himself also to be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98602:13"/>
related that he had lost forty four Levents, and seventy seven Slaves which were killed; and that all the Haratch or Tribute-money, which was collected for the Grand Signiors service from the several Islands, was robbed and embezled by these Candiots. His complaints were aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by many circumstances, and being assisted with the clamours of other Beys or Captains of Gallies, the noise and dispute was exceeding high in the Divan, urging, that the Venetians were obliged to make good a loss which they had caused rather out of malice than mistake. At that time <hi>Georgio Giustiniano</hi> resided at <hi>Constantinople</hi> for the most Serene Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, who to oppose the high clamours of these Complainants, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed courage, and accompanied his answers with prudence and resolution, which are often very convincing in the Turkish Court. They alledged, that the Peace was broken, he answered, That it would not be the first time, and that they ought not to yield entire credit to the relation of persons passionate and partial in their own cause; that such accidents as these were as ordinary and common in the World as cold and heat, as fair and foul weather; and that so soon as the errour was discovered, and the Gally known not to belong to <hi>Barbary,</hi> but to the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior, it was punctually and entirely restored with all the excuses imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. In short, this business which had so bad an aspect at the first, by the dexterity of this Minister, and giving something to <hi>Dervis Bei</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to stop his mouth, the complaint ceased, and all farther proceedings were superseded.</p>
                  <p>The Wars in <hi>Persia</hi> being unsuccessful, it was proposed in Council, <note place="margin">Proposals of Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassa.</hi>
                     </note> that a Peace should be made, if possible, with <hi>Abassa</hi> Pasha; that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, whatsoever they were, should be granted, and promises given him of Honours and Preferment: but the inveterate enmity and hate which the Janisaries bore him, and the difficulty there was to perswade <hi>Abassa,</hi> that the overtures made him were free and candid, and not mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with treachery and design, were obstructions not to be obviated or overcome. Wherefore <hi>Abassa</hi> keeping mutual Intelligence with the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians, and receiving assistance and succours from them, was become very formidable and strong, and the Town of <hi>Erzirum</hi> well fortified with Works and a numerous Garrison. Howsoever the Janisaries, his mortal Enemies, pressing the Vizier to proceed against him, at length obliged him to besiege the place; which having done, and closely begirt it, the most forward and brave amongst the Janisaries were the first to scale the Walls, but were repulsed by the valour of stout and resolute Souldiers; <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Erzirum</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged.</note> for they knowing that there was no other safety but in their Arms, and no other mercy than an ignominious death, being the just reward of their Rebellion, refused to give or to receive quarter: wherefore they made frequent Sallies on the Enemy, and as many Janisaries of them as they took Prisoners, they immediately hanged about the Walls, as a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle of horrour to their Associates. This resolution and cruelty deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Turks from their frequent assaults and storms made upon the Town; and the many Batteries and Fortifications rendred the place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most impregnable, so that there seemed no other hopes to remajn, but to overcome them by a long Siege and Famine: but <hi>Abassa</hi> had so well provided against this danger, with such plenty of provisions, that the Turkish Army began to be more straitned for want of sustenance than the besieged; so that becoming weary and discouraged amidst so many difficulties, they raised the Siege with such disorder and haste, that they <note place="margin">The Siege rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</note>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:98602:13"/>
left several Pieces of Cannon behind them, and retiring with some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, were charged in the Rear, so that many Janisaries fell a Sacrisice to the hate and revenge of the Enemy. The News of this success co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> was ill received; but the disaster thereof, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the usual custom, was attributed to the Vizier who was General; for which cause he was deprived of his Office, and the Selictar Aga (who carries the Sword before the Grand Signior) was put into his place, a person of a fierce, bloody, and cruel disposition.</p>
                  <p>To these, new troubles were added out of <hi>Tartary.</hi> For <hi>Mahomet</hi> the King of that Country, exalted to the Princely Dignity (as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declared) by the favour and Election of that People, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <note place="margin">New troubles from <hi>Tartary</hi>
                     </note> to the sense and pleasure of the Port, was now fallen from the good esteem which they conceived for him, because he gave some hinderance to their usual Incursions on the Polonians and Cosacks out of memory and gratitude to the assistance they had contributed towards his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for which reason being as it were famished for want of their usual depredations, they refused to obey his Commands, and then openly threw off their Obedience to him as their Prince. The Turks, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways envied this Dignity to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> rejoyced to see this discord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and his People, and therefore thought it time to make use of this occasion to re-instate <hi>Gherey</hi> the elder Brother into the possession of his Kingdom; whom the Turks, for his better security, having placed at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> the usual Retirement of the Tartarian Princes, dispatched a Squadron of Gallies to fetch him from thence to <hi>Constantinople;</hi> where being arrived, he was received with a magnificent and Princely Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment by the Sultan: that so the Fame thereof forerunning his arrival in <hi>Tartary,</hi> the people might be better prepared to concur with the Port in their acceptance of him for their King. He was afterwards conducted to <hi>Caffa,</hi> the Grand Signiors Town in <hi>Tartary,</hi> with a strong Fleet of fifty Gallies, where at his first landing he was received by <hi>Cant-Emir,</hi> a rich and powerful Tartar, and Chief of the Turkish Faction, and by many others with great honour and solemnity, with whom also a considerable Party most willingly engaged. But the Cosacks of <hi>Poland</hi> and Circas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians, friends to <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Brother, joyning their Troops to his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, became too strong for the Turks; for giving them Battle near the Inclosures of the <hi>Danube,</hi> at a place called <hi>Bandet,</hi> they defeated them, and killed three or four thousand of their men, putting all to Fire and Sword round about; and entring on the Seas with their Fleet of Boats, took five of the Turkish Gallies: with which ill success the Tartars, which took part with <hi>Cant-Emir,</hi> being discouraged, abandoned their Colours and fled; so that <hi>Cant-Emir</hi> was forced to take Sanctuary in <hi>Caffa,</hi> which being a Town belonging to the Grand Signior, it was hoped, that the reverence they owed to that Name, would cause them to refrain all violence thereunto. But the Tartars, provoked by this late effusion of blood, lost all respect to that Government; so that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieging the Town, they assaulted and took it, and therein the Son of <hi>Cant-Emir</hi> whom they cut in pieces, the Father escaping in a disguise from the City. The News hereof arriving at <hi>Constantinople</hi> was greatly displeasing, and caused many serious Debates and Consultations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; the wisest and most sober of the Council was for dissembling the matter, and with their usual dextcrity to suffer what they could not remedy: for that it was by no means advisable in the present conjuncture
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98602:14"/>
of Affairs, to proceed unto an open rupture with the Tartars, fearing lest the Christians, Persians, and other Enemies should make a benesit of this occasion, and joyning with a Nation so strong in Horse, should dangerously press upon the Empire, and force them to the ultimate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of affairs. Wherefore an Envoyé Extraordinary was sent to the Tartars, who covering the inward sentiments of regret and anger which the Sultan conceived for the late disgrace, seemed to wonder at the cause and reason of the last Engagement, as if it had been acted without the knowledge or order of the Grand Signior; and thus with gentle terms insinuating, that the Surrender of <hi>Cassa</hi> would be very acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable to the Port, and that which would atone for all miscarriages, and be such an offering of pacisication, as would reconcile all past differences, and restore a perfect correspondence between the Sultan and them, the Tartars readily assented to the demand, upon condition, that the Turks should impose no other King upon them than him, whom by general consent they had elected for their Prince.</p>
                  <p>Though differences were thus concluded with the Tartars, yet the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1628"/> Cosacks continued still their enmities, entring the Black Sea with eighty Saicks, which they so infested, that the Turks could for that year avail themselves little of their Navigation in those Seas: so that the Turks, to curb these insolencies, gave Orders to build two Forts at the mouth of the Black Sea: the Polish Ambassadour made complaint hereof, and protested against it, as an Act contrary to the Capitulations of Peace; but the Turks esteem little of the air of Bravadoes, whilst they are not accompanied with something else more solid than their own levity.</p>
                  <p>But the grand Concernments which busied the thoughts of the Turks was the Rebellion of <hi>Abassa,</hi> and the War in <hi>Persia,</hi> the management of which was the charge and care of the Selictar Aga lately made Vizier, called <hi>Serches</hi> Pasha. His Head-quarters were at the beginning of this year taken up at <hi>Iconium,</hi> called by the Turks <hi>Conie;</hi> and <hi>Abassa</hi> was encamped at <hi>Kaisaria,</hi> against whom the Vizier marched; and being nearly approached, the Janisaries earnestly urged, that Battle might be given the Enemy; but the Vizier having received Instructions not to engage, if possible, but rather to enter into a Treaty, and to propose terms of Accommodation, delayed the time, and with various excuses eluded the present premures of the Janisaries; at which they became so angry, that they slew into an <note place="margin">The Janisaries mutiny.</note> open Mutiny, cutting the Cords of his Tents, stoning him, and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in the head: by which open violence the Vizier being compelled to make known his Orders, he assembled the chief Commanders of the Spahees and Janisaries, giving them to understand, that the Grand Signiors pleasure was to make up the difference with <hi>Abassa,</hi> as the only means to conclude an intestine and unnatural War, and to be able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Persians, and regain the Country and reputation which the Turks had lost. This Proposition seemed plausible to the Commanders at the General Assembly, and more especially because it was the pleasure and injunction of the Grand Signior; but more difficult it was to incline the rough and obstinate minds of the Janisaries to a resolution so diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to their natures, and so contrary to that revenge which they had deeply rooted in their hearts and sworn to execute: howsoever the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions which the Officers used to their inferiour Souldiers, putting them in memory of the blood of their Companions, and how destructive the continuance of such a War must necessarily prove for the future by those
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98602:14"/>
large essusions of blood hwich they must expect farther to make, were so prevalent upon them, that at length they condescended to a Treaty, and to receive <hi>Abassa</hi> for a Friend and a Fellow-Souldier. <hi>Abassa</hi> at <note place="margin">They consent to treat with <hi>Abassa.</hi>
                     </note> first suspecting some treachery, refused to give a private meeting to the Vizier; but the Vizier giving his Brother the Beglerbegh of <hi>Caramania</hi> and the Pasha of <hi>Anatolia</hi> for Hostages, the day and place for a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence was appointed; where both Parties meeting, Articles were agreed, that <hi>Abassa</hi> should still continue to be Pasha of <hi>Erzirum,</hi> his Son Pasha of <hi>Bosra,</hi> his Kahya or Lieutenant to be Pasha of <hi>Maraseh</hi> (all which were places on the Confines of <hi>Persia</hi>) a general Act of Pardon and Anmestie was to be given to <hi>Abassa</hi> and his whole Army, and the Articles sworn unto in the most solemn manner by the Vizier, and confirmed in the publick Camp of the Janisaries, who also promised to maintain this word and promise of the Vizier; to all which the Grand Signior gave his Hand, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Abassa</hi> recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to the Grand Sigmot.</note> and affixed his Royal Signature. A Reconciliation being in this manner compleated, the City of <hi>Erzirum</hi> resigned it self to the Obedience of the Grand Signior, and the Army of <hi>Abassa</hi> was employed on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of <hi>Persia,</hi> and converted against the Enemy. The Vizier also was appointed to proceed on the same Enterprise; but his Army was so ill provided of all necessaries, that he made his excuse, and refused to march forward; but on the contrary, he returned to <hi>Constantinople</hi> in company with <hi>Abassa,</hi> where with many demonstrations of friendship and respect, he was conducted to the presence of the Grand Signior to receive Honour, and the reward of his penitence, and return to obedience. The approach of these two great Personages near to <hi>Constantinople</hi> made much noise and rumor in the City; some blamed the weakness of the Government for accepting an Enemy unto favour, and that the crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Rebellion with rewards, was to encourage others in the like practices. The Vizier was also murmured against for leaving the Army and the War, contrary to the Royal Command, by such as were emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his Greatness: but as envy is converted into veneration, and <note place="margin">The Vizier and <hi>Abassa</hi> make their Entry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
                     </note> ceases as smoke doth, when it is blown up by the flame of success and glory; so those who were emulous of these persons, submitted to all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequious offices towards them, and dissembling their malice, went to meet them as far as <hi>Scutari,</hi> that they might add to their Train and Equipage, and help at the Solemnity of their Entrance. All people now cast their eyes on the Vizier and <hi>Abassa,</hi> as the two great men of this Age; the first was esteemed for his dexterous and successful management in bringing over <hi>Abassa</hi> to his submission and obedience; for though he was not famed much for his great Feats of Arms, yet this Reconciliation of <hi>Abassa</hi> was accounted a Master-piece of Policy, and better service than a Victory. <hi>Abassa</hi> also drew the eyes of the people, who crowded to see so great a Captain, that could contend with the Port, and put all <hi>Asta</hi> into disturbance, and in conclusion could make the same Arms serve his Master, which had lately before given a check and stop to all the Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Force. The Vizier was the first introduced to the Royal Presence, where being graciously received, he was presented with a Vest of Sables and a Cemiter set with Jewels. <hi>Abassa</hi> was afterwards admitted, and having performed his obeisance by touching the ground with his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head after their fashion; he declared, that he never was other than a faithful Vassal to the Sultan, and that he had taken up Arms for his sake, that he might subjugate the insolence of the Janisaries, and with their
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98602:15"/>
blood revenge the death, and sacrifice to the Ghost of his murdered Brother <hi>Osman,</hi> that they might learn to reverence their Princes for the suture, and learn to know how sacred the blood is of their Soveraign. The Grand Signior seemed kindly to accept this Apology, and as a token thereof bestowed three Vests upon him, which was a treble Honour of that kind, and made him Pasha of <hi>Bosna;</hi> on which employment he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately entred: and though when such Offices are bestowed, it is commonly the custom for that person who is invested in the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given, to kiss the sleeve of the Grand Signior publickly by way of thanks; yet lest such demonstration of Honour should ill afsect the eyes of the Janisaries, and cause murmuring and repinings amongst the most envious of the Souldiery, his last Audience was designed privately, and his Dispatch procured in more secret and familiar manner, and therefore more obliging than was usual.</p>
                  <p>To yield some assistance to the present growing Charges of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, the Vizier imposed a heavy Tax on the Christians and Jews; on the first it was levied with all severity; but the Jews found more favour by their Arts and secret management of Affairs; for they are a people <note place="margin">The Jews at <hi>Constantinople</hi> how treated.</note> of some Authority and Power in <hi>Turkie:</hi> they are cursed by particular persons, but caressed by the generality: they are Slaves in all Countries, and yet acquire somewhat of Mastership and Propriety: they are Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds, and yet every Country is their own: they cannot buy Lands, and yet daily increase their Fortunes: they multiply in abundance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they all marry, and are not destroyed by Wars: they are great Confidents of the Turks, and Enemies to the Christians. In short, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness in <hi>Constantinople</hi> is like a publick Courtisan, to whom the Jews are the Panders and Ruflians.</p>
                  <p>The Grand Signior passing one day through the streets, unhappily <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1629"/> met with the Ambassadour of the Prince of <hi>Transylvania,</hi> who because he did not immediately descend from his Horse in token of reverence, he caused him and his whole Family to be imprisoned; but being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards excused by the Chimacam to have only been a matter of inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, his omission was pardoned, and so released from his restraint.</p>
                  <p>The Souldiery having for a long time been governed by a loose and gentle hand, continued their licentious way of living, committing many outrages on the Merchants and Inhabitants of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> against which many Decrees having been published, and Proclamations made without any effect or notice of the Souldiery; the Vizier was unwilling to dally longer; and therefore taking a Spahee and a Janisary, hanged them up, and cut off their Heads, and with such course and method of severity he so abated the haughty stomachs of the Souldiers already mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by the assumption of <hi>Abassa</hi> into favour, that they began to yield unto Command, and to behold their Rulers with an eye of respect, as those which were seated in some degree above themselves; for till now there was scarce a common Janisary, but who thought himself to be the Creator or Elector of his General, and therefore to be little inferiour to him in Power and Dignity. And as this Vizier was severe towards the Souldiery, so he demeaned himself with equal rigour towards the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sha's and Grandees of the Court; which though it was an humor in the Vizier at that conjuncture laudable and necessary, yet it procured him such enmity, as removed him at a distance, and caused him to be sent into <hi>Persia</hi> to command the Army, and by that means to expose him to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98602:15"/>
the hazard and difficulties of doubtful success in a dangerous War.</p>
                  <p>The Vizier being departed, the Grand Signior appeared in publick on Horse-back, together with his Brother by his side, an unusual sight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Turks; but the Queen-Mother, who in absence of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier ruled much, commanded that it should be so: the Grand Signior had this year a Son born which caused great rejoycing at <hi>Constantinople;</hi> because there were few Males at that time surviving of the Ottoman Line; but scarce was the Festival ended before the Child died.</p>
                  <p>But let us now for a while withdraw our Discourse from the Wars of <hi>Persia,</hi> and look to the Actions in <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Transylvania. Mehmet</hi> the late King of <hi>Tartary,</hi> who was so displeasing to the Port (as we have already related) was now dead, to whom succeeded a Kinsman of his called <hi>Fembeg Gheray,</hi> universally pleasing and acceptable to that people. This new King, to demonstrate his prowess, and to act something acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable to the Port, dispeeded forty thousand Horse into <hi>Podolia</hi> and <note place="margin">The Tartars o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown by the Polanders.</note> 
                     <hi>Russia</hi> to sack and ravage the Country, which dividing themselves into several Parties, made their Incursions as far as <hi>Socal.</hi> But in the mean time the Polonians and Cosacks having formed a strong Body of Horse under the Command of <hi>Stephen Chmieleskie,</hi> met them at their return near to <hi>Burstinow,</hi> where they gave them a total overthrow; and in like manner <hi>Stanislaus Lubomiski</hi> encountred another Party, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw them, leaving thirty thousand slain on the place, and taking two thousand Prisoners, amongst which was the younger Brother of the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar King. This defeat, as it was the greatest that ever was given to the Tartars, so it is probable, that had it been well prosecuted at that time by the Polonians, they might have entred the <hi>Chersonesus Tauricus,</hi> and without much opposition have put an end to that Kingdom; but <hi>Sigis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> King of <hi>Poland</hi> had other designs in hand: such mixed Monarchies as that being better able to defend their own Dominions, than to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire or conquer others.</p>
                  <p>To this News ill received at <hi>Constantinople</hi> supervened the unexpected death of <hi>Bethlem Gabor;</hi> unexpected, I say, because that though he had <note place="margin">The death of <hi>Bethlem Gabor.</hi>
                     </note> been long labouring under the diseases of Dropsie and Asthma, yet the greatness of his Soul, and activeness of his Spirit mastered for a long time his indisposition, so that he seldom or never omitted his Counsels and business; and to the very time of his death was meditating and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving designs, whereby to preserve his Dominions, and enlarge them. And indeed the Government of <hi>Transylvania</hi> required no less than such a stirring Spirit: for being seated between two such powerful Monarchs, as the Emperour and the Turk, there was need of dexterity and courage to steer between the rocks of such opposite Interests: sometimes it was necessary to joyn with one, and anon with the other: so <hi>Sigismond Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tori</hi> Prince of <hi>Transylvania</hi> uniting his Forces with the Emperour's in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Conflicts overthrew the Turk, and kept the scale in an equal ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance: <hi>Gabor</hi> on the contrary inclined to the Turks, and supported his Interest with the Ottoman Power, following such Maxims as had been more ruinous to Christendom, had he transferred them to a Son to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and pursue; but dying without issue, the Government devolved to his Princess by Vote of the States of the Country, and by Confirmation of the Turk, as we have already intimated. <hi>Gabor</hi> knew so well how to deal and treat with the Turks, that he gained an abatement of ten thousand Dollars of the annual Tribute; he managed his affairs so
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98602:16"/>
subtilely with the Emperour, that he was always invited to a Peace, and accordingly made his advantage by the Treaty. The other Princes of Christendom in like manner courted him, and particularly the Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> employed one <hi>Bornemis,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Transylvania,</hi> a Lover of the French Interest, to be always about him, by whose means, and with the assistance of twenty thousand Crowns of yearly Pension, he obliged him to make War on the Emperour, at such seasons as it should be intimated unto him to be most conducing to the advantage of <hi>France.</hi> At length, as we have said, giving way to mortality, he died on the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> after he had reigned eighteen years: he was a Prince of great abilities, but exercised them ill to the damage of Christendom; howsoever he was a Souldier of extraordinary courage and conduct, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving begun to manage his Sword at seventeen years of age, and as it is said, had been engaged in forty two several Fights. His Widow <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine,</hi> Sister of the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> rendred an account to the Port of this accident, and the Grand Signior immediately returned An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer by <hi>Sulficar</hi> Aga, condoling the misfortune, and encouraging her to a dependence on the Port: which she accepting with due resentment promised obedience to the Grand Signior, and begged his Protection. But the weather was too boisterous and rude for a Vessel to be naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted well under the Pilotage of a Woman; for the situation of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try between two mighty and potent Monarchs required more than a masculine mind and courage to free and defend it from the plots, snares, and violence with which it was, as with a toile, encompassed by those two great <hi>Nimrods</hi> of the East and West. And though the Sultan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to defend his Female Ally, yet the diversion of the Ottoman Arms in <hi>Persia,</hi> the intestine distractions, and the Minority of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour were such burdens on the foundation of Empire, and obstructions to great and Heroick Atchievements in behalf of the distressed Princess, that all the promises made to her were unavailable and ineffectual. For <hi>Stephen Bethlem,</hi> a Kinsman of the deceased Prince, a man conspicuous <note place="margin">The Widow of <hi>Bethlem Gabor</hi> perswaded to quit her Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> in his own Person and Estate, as well as for the several Governments divided amongst his Sons, and the interest he had gained in his Country, procured means to convoke the States at <hi>Claudiopolis,</hi> and insinuating the foregoing inconveniencies of a Female Government, so prevailed with the Assembly, that they perswaded the Princess to yield up her Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty to <hi>Stephen Gabor,</hi> as one better capacitated for Rule and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty than her self. <hi>Stephen</hi> having thus obtained his intent, entred into a serious Consultation with his Friends and Relations, whether he should labour to confirm the Government to himself and entail it to the Family, or renounce it to some other. The first seemed a matter very dubious and difficult; for that <hi>Bethlem Gabor</hi> his Predecessour had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliged the principal Boyards or Barons of the Country, and thereby derived an envy and hatred to all his Family: his long and violent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment annexed to the interest of the Turk, had not only rendred his Memory odious to his own-People, but likewise to the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> which would be ready to continue the like prejudice and aversion to any of the same Family, as it did to the last thereof. For which Reasons, after due and mature consideration, it was resolved to offer the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>George Ragotski,</hi> a person rich in money and of great interest, by reason of the Jurisdiction and Castles which he possessed in <hi>Hungary,</hi> belonging to his own paternal Inheritance; and in pursuance thereof they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98602:16"/>
sent <hi>Stephen</hi> the second Son, and <hi>Solomon</hi> a Kinsman of that Family for Ambassadours to <hi>Ragotski,</hi> representing to him, that they had preferred his Merit before the Interest of their own Family, and therefore desired <note place="margin">The Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity offered to <hi>Ragotski.</hi>
                     </note> him, that he would be pleased to take upon himself the Regency of the Principality. The offer of Government was a savoury bait to the palate of <hi>Ragotski,</hi> which he embraced with singular afsectation and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and was easily perswaded on this occasion to take a Journey to <hi>Varadin,</hi> one of the principal Fortresses and places of consideration in that whole Province, and was there received by <hi>Stephen</hi> the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, Governour of the Citadel, with firing all the Cannon, and with the common Joy and Festivity of the whole City. But in the midst of this mirth, an unexpected Messenger arrived with News, that the States had with common consent elected another Prince, which was <hi>Stephen Bethlem,</hi> Father of the Ambassadour, and Author of this Counsel. <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotski</hi> was strangely surprised with this Intelligence, and the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours were put to the blush to see their Negotiations under such a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful defeat: howsoever resolving to continue constant to their first Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and to renounce the interest of their own Family, they still main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the same obsequious offices of Honour and Reverence towards <hi>Ragotski,</hi> as formerly. And notwithstanding the Orders received from the States to abstain from any other demonstrations of Honour to <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotski,</hi> than what were ordinary towards a private person of his Quality and Riches; and that he should retire from the Confines of <hi>Transylvania</hi> to the Precincts of his own Castles: yet they still persisted to execute their first Commission, and so to attract people to his Party; that the number thereof daily increasing, it was at length agreed, that the first Election not being fair, the point in Controversie should be determined at <hi>Sazburg,</hi> a City of <hi>Saxony.</hi> The States General being assembled, <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotski</hi> accompanied his pretensions with a large effusion of Gold, the most powerful and most convincing Argument imaginable: to which he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That he had no design to affect the Principality, had not the same been first offered to him from <hi>Stephen Gabor</hi> the Father by the hand of his Son: that it was very improper for that person to offer a Dignity to another, which he affected for himself: that it was in the power of the Transylvanians not to have offered him the Principality; but having once chosen him to it, they could not, without his disparagement and prejudice, retract from their Election. In short, these considerations, assisted by the interest of the Princess Dowager, so far prevailed, that <hi>Stephen Bethlem</hi> was put aside, and <hi>Ragotski,</hi> who attended the success of this matter at <hi>Varadin,</hi> was with common consent elected Prince; <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ragotski</hi> cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen Prince.</note> from whence being with great Acclamations, and a general concourse of the people, conducted to <hi>Alba Julia,</hi> he there took the usual Oath with much Solemnity and Magnificence; and with Princely Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence entertained and treated the two Ambassadours <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and dispensed freely his money unto divers; who before being Enemies, were now reconciled, and become his Friends and Admirers. Liberality in a Prince is the most resplendent Gemm in all his Crown, and is a light so forcible, that it dazles envy it self, and puts out all the eyes of suspicion and jealousie.</p>
                  <p>By this time the Great Vizier was far advanced with his Army into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1630"/> 
                     <hi>Persia,</hi> having been encouraged to proceed by the feigned flight, or rather retre at of the Enemy, who burned, destroyed, and laid waste all
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98602:17"/>
round them, as they retired; which put the Turks to such inextricable difficulties, that in two months March they had all the inconveniencies and miseries to contend with, which commonly attend Armies in strange Countries; the Plains through which they travelled were abandoned by the Inhabitants, and void of provisions, the Mountains were covered with Snow and comfortless; and what was worst, the Persians kept all the narrow passages so strongly guarded, that the Vizier was now more in danger of Famine than of the Sword: but being a person of great sense and experience in Military affairs, he prudently disingaged himself from the intricacy of these dangers; and encamping his Army in the Plain of <hi>Amedan,</hi> he so provoked the hot Spirits of the Persians, that they resolve to assault him on that side of his Camp, which they judged <note place="margin">A Victory gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Turks over the Persians.</note> to be the most weakly defended; of which having some advertisement, he secretly laid an Ambuscado in the way, which so happily succeeded, that he killed eight thousand Persians on the place; but howsoever the Victory cost so dear, and was so bloody by the loss of the stoutest Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, and the bravest of the Souldiery, that the news thereof made lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle noise or rejoycing at <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With this Intelligence the Vizier demanded new Recruits; for that besides the abatement of his numbers by the last Engagement, the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of the Enemy increased, and his own Souldiers fled from their Colours; of which many being observed to enter <hi>Constantinople,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the severe Decrees of Martial Law published against them, put the Grand Signior into a high choler and indignation. And being desirous to reinforce the Viziers Army with all the Recruits that he was <note place="margin">The difficulty of sending men into <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </note> able, Proclamations were made, that all the Militia at <hi>Constantinople</hi> should immediately pass over unto <hi>Scutari</hi> under their respective Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders; and that whosoever received one Asper of Pay from the Grand Signior in quality of a Souldier, should immediately pass the Chanel into <hi>Asta,</hi> and follow their Leaders to the War. But so great was the abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency which the Souldiers had to this March into <hi>Persia,</hi> calling it the Sepulchre and Cemetery of the Turks, that few or none would obey, every one flying, hiding, and shifting for himself as well as he could; during which fears and troubles, the ways from <hi>Persia</hi> were so obstruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Curdes,</hi> that in the space of three or four months no News arrived at <hi>Constantinople</hi> from the Army, which caused as great appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions and affrightments there, as if the Empire had been reduced to the utmost extremity. Nor did the Sultan want jealousies and fears of receiving affronts from the Emperour, and King of <hi>Poland;</hi> the first of which had a fair opportunity presented of regaining all <hi>Transylvania,</hi> especially at a time when that Country was divided by two several Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; but more pressing and troublesom were the Cosacks, who daily <note place="margin">The Cosacks trouble the Turks.</note> infested the Black Sea, and to the great reproach of the Imperial City perpetually disturbed it with Alarms, passing up almost in sight of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople:</hi> of which complaints being made to the Polonian Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, he answered with some indignation, That the Cosacks had reason for what they acted; for that since the Tartars had by Orders from the Grand Signior made their late irruption into that Country, as they could well prove from the Commission taken amongst the Baggage of the Prince of <hi>Tartary</hi> in the last defeat, the Cosacks might with all justice assume to themselves a method of revenge. But the Grand Signior not being able to support this affront, or to see himself braved on the very Banks of his
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98602:17"/>
Imperial Seat, and his Villages and Towns round about burnt and pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by a crew of Free-booters and Pirates, cast all the blame on the Chimacam, to whom in his rage he gave such a blow with his sist on the face, that blood issued from his nose; and had not the Queen-Mother interceded for him, he had been delivered into the hand of the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to take away his life. Nor was the Captain-Pasha in less danger at his return; because, that upon his assurance, that the Cosacks would not for that year make any attempt in the Chanel of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the Grand Signior had assented, that the Fleet of Gallies should that Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer make a Voyage into the <hi>Archipelago;</hi> which mistake having been the cause of all this affront, the Captain-Pasha was to share in the blame, and had likewise in the punishment, had not good Friends interposed between him and danger. Nor were the Cosacks satisfied with their late Plunder, but speedily made another return with two hundred Boats; and though the whole Fleet of Gallies were then in Port, yet they had the boldness to proceed as far as <hi>Pompey's</hi> Pillar, and thereby to hinder all Provisions from passing to <hi>Constantinople</hi> by way of the Black Sea. And what gave greater fear than all this, was the News which came at the same time, that the Poles were on the Frontiers with thirty thousand Horse; to whom immediately a Chaous or Envoyé was dispatched with Propositions very advantageous to the Crown of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> conditionally that the continual irruptions made by the Cosacks should be stopped, and they restrained within the due terms of peace and moderation. The Chaous found a civil reception from the Poles, and promises of compliance, in regard that the King had some intentions of making War upon the Moscovite; but whilst these things were in agitation, and that the Chaous was ready to return, behold on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den News came, that ten thousand Tartars were broken into <hi>Podolia,</hi> which put all things back again, and so changed the stile of Affairs, that in the stead of Articles of Peace, the Chaous was again returned with the menaces of War, and with reproaches for the last perfidious action.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding all these troubles abroad, the Puissance of the Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire might have been able to have struggled with greater diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, had not its own intestine distractions rendred all things dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and of a malevolent aspect. The Government was at that time chiefly in the hands of the four Brothers-in-law, who had married four <note place="margin">The disorders in the Ottoman State.</note> Sisters of the Grand Signior's, and for that reason were powerful, and employed in the principal Offices of State, and commonly drew contrary to the opinions of the Mufti and Chimacam, which two last were not well accorded between themselves; for that the latter encroached on the Office of the Mufti, to the great scandal and discontent of all the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and literate men in the whole City; howsoever they both joyned in consultation by what means they might best secure themselves and the Government from the lusts and evil designs of this quadruple Fraternity; but their wisdom and interests were too weak to contrive remedies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such high oppressions; for besides the violences daily practised by the Brothers, the extravagant humors in the Sultan himself added to the disorders of State, and increased the discontents and dissatisfactions of the people: for though <hi>Morat</hi> was naturally endowed with a good wit and parts, was stout and of a good courage; yet as his perpetual debauchery in Wine rendred him in appearance but of a weak under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, mixed with much levity, so it caused his accessions of the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98602:18"/>
sickness (to which he was subject) to return often, whereby the strength of his brain was daily weakened and impaired: he was negligent also in the performance of those Ceremonies which his Ancestors were accustomed to observe; nor did he live with that gravity and regular course which is agreeable to the Grandeur of so great a Prince: for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he would go out of his Seraglio with no other Attendance than of three or four men, which were for the most part Buffoons, Players up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Gittern, and Eunuchs; and with no better an Equipage would he sometimes be seen on Horse-back, or in his Boat rowed on the <hi>Bosphorus</hi> with six Oars only: by which actions and other mean sallies of Youth, he created such a contempt towards his Person, that evil men grew fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and weary, and entred into Conspiracies against his life, whilst the good men feared and presaged the ruine and downfal of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: for neither justice, nor order, nor obedience prevailed; no Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were conferred for Merit, but by money, or some other unlawful means; there remained no Counsellors of true faith and integrity, nor Souldiers almost either of experience for Sea or Land-adventures. The people being burdened by double Taxes and Imposts were mutinous; and ready to take the least fire of Rebellion; the Souldiery were disorderly for want of Discipline and their constant Pay: the Pasha's of remote Provinces grew insolent, taking upon themselves rather an absolute than a depending Soveraignty. In short, all things looked with that black appearance, that nothing seemed to keep the frame of Empire together, but only the expectation of good success to the Army in <hi>Persia,</hi> the which, as it depended on uncertain events, so the Ottoman Monarchy was then shaking, and stood tottering on its deepest foundation.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore all people being intent to hear of good News from <hi>Persia,</hi> were much pleased to understand, that the Vizier having by advantage in the last Engagement laden his Army with Plunder and Spoils, was now preparing to besiege <hi>Bagdat,</hi> for whose good success Prayers were <note place="margin">The Vizier prepares to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege <hi>Bagdat.</hi>
                     </note> daily made in the Moschs; and the Schoolmasters surrounded the streets with their young Scholars, singing out Prayers with the Amen at every period, according to the custom of that Country. The Vizier marched towards <hi>Bagdat,</hi> and began to besiege it about the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>September;</hi> in order whereunto he amassed great abundance of all sorts of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and made his Magazine of them at <hi>Mosul,</hi> two thousand Camels, each laden with two Sacks of Cotton, every Sack being of about ten foot long, were carried to the Siege, for shelter of the Souldiery, and to fill the Ditches. The Vizier having passed part of his Army over the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Tigris,</hi> the rest with the Cannon remaining on the hither side, he dispatched <hi>Nasuf</hi> Pasha of <hi>Aleppo</hi> with six thousand Spahees to take a view of the place, and discover the Avenues unto it: in his way thither he met with eight thousand Persian Horse sent to reinfore the Garrison, which he valiantly engaged; but being dangerously wounded, was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to retreat with the loss of almost half of his men, part killed, and part taken; those which were carried Prisoners to <hi>Bagdat</hi> were treated with all civility by the Governour, who gave them a view of the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which consisted of twenty thousand effective men, shewed them their Stores and Provisions, and that there was scarce an unuseful mouth in all the City to devour them. Notwithstanding this disaster at the beginning, the Vizier nothing dismayed proceeded on his design, spending the whole month of <hi>September</hi> in making his approaches. In the month <note place="margin">The Siege.</note>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:98602:18"/>
of <hi>October</hi> he mounted eighteen Pieces of great Cannon, which for the space of twenty five days battered continually the Curtain between the two Bastions on which were four Pieces of Cannon not perceived by the Turks; there was also a deep and large Ditch not discovered by them, for that it was planked over with Boards, and covered with a green Turff, so that it appeared like a plain and firm ground; the broach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made, and seemingly undefended, the Turks resolved to make an Assault; wherefore the Vizier on the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> commanded the Spahees under the Conduct of the Beglerbei of <hi>Anatolia,</hi> accompanied with Pasha's, Sangiacks, and other persons of note, as also with Janisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to the number of thirty thousand, to enter the breach: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing performed, and great numbers crowding on the Turff, the weight of them pressed down the Planks; and therewith the whole Engine gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way, five or six thousand were in a moment taken as it were in a Pit-fall, and swallowed up without any possibility of succour to be yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their Companions. After which on an instant there appeared fifteen thousand men on the breach and on the Bastions, which with their <note place="margin">The Siege rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</note> Cannon and continual Vollies of Musket-shot, so galled the Spahees, that they broke their main Body, and killed the Beglerbei of <hi>Anatolia</hi> with other persons of note and quality, and made the whole Army to retreat. Two days after this disgrace the Vizier raised the Siege, and marched towards <hi>Mosul,</hi> and the Persians encouraged with this success, pursued the Turks with eight thousand Horse, assailed the Rear-guard of the Enemy; and though the conduct and care thereof was committed to the charge of the Pasha's of <hi>Aleppo</hi> and <hi>Damascus,</hi> yet the Persians killed three thousand Turks, and had defeated the whole Rear of the Army, had not the Spahees turned their Horses, and withstood the shock with great Valour.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding this dishonourable Retreat the Vizier lost not his courage, or hopes of taking the Town, in order unto which he appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all things necessary to renew the Siege again in the months of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> and <hi>October</hi> following; for that the foregoing months are either too rainy, or too hot in those Countries to undertake a design or enterprise of that nature: he fortified all the small places in those parts round, and quartered his Souldiers in them; so that having all conveniencies of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, they might be induced to continue, and not abandon their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours: especially he took care to fortified <hi>Illay,</hi> a place of about two days journey from <hi>Bagdat,</hi> reinforcing the Garrison with six thousand men under the Command of three Beglerbegs, in regard that it was a very considerable Pass, and the principal Magazine and Granary of Corn and other Provisions. At the same time he sent Letters to <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> representing the state of his affairs to be in a hopeful condition; and desiring Recruits both of men and money, gave great assurances of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering the City at the next Attempt.</p>
                  <p>In this perillous condition of the Ottoman State one would have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that Christian Princes would have seen their own interest, and made use of their advantage; but God not having as yet fixed a period <note place="margin">The Poles and Turks make Peace.</note> to the bounds of this Empire, was pleased by his secret Providence to divert both the Emperour and the King of <hi>Poland</hi> from making War with the Turk, inclining them to employ their Arms on their Christian Neighbours. For though the Chaous (as we have said before) was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from <hi>Poland</hi> with disdain, and with an angry Message; yet the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98602:19"/>
Chimacam, when he made <hi>Moses</hi> Vayvod of <hi>Moldavia,</hi> encharged him to perform all offices of Mediation between the Grand Signior and the Poles, perswading them to restrain the Incursions of the Cosacks, and to send an Ambassadour to the Port: in which affair <hi>Moses</hi> so well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his Negotiation, that applying Lenitives to the anger of the Poles, he reduced them to Articles of Peace, and to promises of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining the Cosacks, on condition, that the Turks reciprocally forbid and withhold the Tartars from joyning or affording assistance to his Enemies the Moscovites. These Conditions being agreed, an Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour was sent from <hi>Poland</hi> to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where he was received with as much joy as he was expected with impatience. The Cosacks and Tartars were two sorts of people which lived equally on Spoils and Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the first as offensive to the Turk, as the latter to the Pole; and <note place="margin">The Cosacks and Tartars compared.</note> therefore as it was an equal benefit, so it was an agreement of even Terms to counterchange the caution given reciprocally for one and the other. But the Engagement for such wild people was more easily given than performed, which because it was a point agreeable to both Parties, it was expressed with the most clear words and strict terms possible. The Poles were weary and grieved to see their Provinces depopulated by the Tartars, who yearly carried away some thousands of souls: the Turks on the other side were not less infested with the Cosacks, who captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their people, burnt their Towns and Villages, and kept them in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Alarms. But because these people are hardly restrained from their robberies and pillaging, the Poles, as a remedy, resolved to carry the Cosacks to the War against the Moscovite, and better to secure the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, the Polish Ambassadour obliged to pay them twenty thousand Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins yearly, and six thousand pair of Boots, according to the ancient Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Peace; on which considerations the Tartars were engaged never to enter <hi>Poland</hi> in a hostile manner, but to serve that King in his Wars against all Nations whatsoever, the Turks only excepted.</p>
                  <p>In this manner were the Turks this year freed from all apprehensions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1631"/> of Alarm from the Cosacks, and of War with <hi>Poland.</hi> And the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was so busied concerning the surprize of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> and engaged in the quarrel about that Dutchy, and with some ambitious thoughts rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to <hi>Italy,</hi> that the Turks hoped to have prosecuted their Wars in <hi>Persia</hi> without fear of diversion from the Western parts. But yet the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs <note place="margin">Troubles in <hi>Hungary.</hi>
                     </note> towards the parts of <hi>Germany</hi> were not so well secured, but that the turbulent spirit of <hi>Ragotski</hi> administred subject for dissention; for being lately seated (as we have said) in his Principality, he was doubtful, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were most for his interest to incline unto the Emperour, or to the Turk; and whilst both Parties courted his friendship, and cheapned his acknowledgments (for of necessity he must be a Vassal to one or the other) the Heyducs who were Tenants to the Lands of <hi>Gabor,</hi> refused to return to the obedience of the Emperour, demanding protection from the Grand Signior. The jealousie of those ill consequences which this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion might produce alarmed all the Country; and the Emperour and <hi>Ragotski</hi> being hereby raised to a mutual defiance, advanced their Troops one against the other upon the Frontiers; but all <hi>Hungary</hi> trembling with fear of those calamities which ensue from War, several of those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned interposed so far towards an Accommodation, that Deputies were appointed to meet at <hi>Cassovia</hi> to treat of Peace: but in the mean time the Palatine of <hi>Hungary</hi> passing eight thousand men over the River <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biscus</hi>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:98602:19"/>
to make seisure of a certain Fort built by <hi>George Basta,</hi> so alarmed and awakened <hi>Ragotski,</hi> that he dispatched a Gentleman to him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the cause of this motion; and not receiving an answer agreeable to his expectation, he advanced upon him with an Army of ten thousand men, and engaging him with great resolution, killed four thousand on the place, and so caused him to retire: from these beginnings all the mischiefs of a bloody War had certainly ensued, had not <hi>Ragotski</hi> refused to receive Succours from the Turk; but he depending on his own strength (having fifteen thousand men in Arms for defence of his here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Lands in <hi>Hungary</hi>) contemned all external assistances, as savour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much of vassalage and dependence; howsoever the Pasha's of the Frontiers assembled their Forces, and yet acted with such caution, as not to proceed to an open Rupture; for the Wars in <hi>Persia</hi> being unsuccessful and pressing, required moderation and Lenitives on this side, that so the differences now on the Frontiers might be transferred to an opportunity more seasonable for dispute.</p>
                  <p>In the month of <hi>September</hi> Sultan <hi>Morat</hi> being at his small Seraglio cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Daout</hi> Pasha, and sleeping there one night in his Bed, he was on a sudden awakened by a terrible Lightning; which entring his Chamber <note place="margin">The G. Signior affrighted with Lightning.</note> rounded his Bed, leaving several marks on his Sheets and Quilts; and whilst he sought some place to hide himself in, it passed under his arm, and burnt part of his shirt, the affrightment of which so astonished him, that he remained for some time in a swound, which for ever after did much impair the strength of his brain: he now began to be sensible that there were other Thunder-bolts than those that proceed from his own Throne; and like <hi>Tiberius</hi> learned to tremble at the voice of God, whilst he heard him speak in the clouds: <hi>Nec Deum unquam nisi iratum pertimuit, &amp; turbatiori Coelo fulminantem.</hi> And so affected was the Sultan with this accident, that afterwards he dismissed divers of his Buffoons from the Court, and particularly a Mute whose ridiculous gestures were his common Divertisement, and for some time caused him to abstain from Wine; and as a farther token of his Conversion and thankfulness to God for this escape, he ordered five thousand Dollars to be given in alms to the poor, and Korban to be made of three hundred sheep; and the Friday following he solemnly went to the Mosch, to render thanks unto God for having so prodigiously preserved him from the Executioner of his Vengeance.</p>
                  <p>During all this time the Great Vizier wanting Succours and Supplies of men and money, had great difficulty to contain his people in their due obedience, or within the bounds of their Quarters; for they were apt to leave their Colours, and would really have disbanded, had not their spirits been daily held up with the hopes and amusements of Pay and Recruits. The four Brethren-in-law which greatly apprehended lest their Power and Authority should be abated by the return of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier, exercised all the diligence they were able to make new Levies, the reinforcement of which might instill new courage into the Souldiery, and be a means to continue the Vizier in those parts; but the Mufti ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed all Levies on the side of <hi>Greece</hi> and the Frontiers of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, alledging, That the best Souldiers being sent from those parts, would hazard the Empire by exposing and laying it open to the Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the Christians: by which contrary opinions and delays the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier wanting the assistance expected, the Persians recovered all the little
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98602:20"/>
Fortresses which they had lost the year before, with the considerable place of <hi>Illay;</hi> which being taken by assault and by an absolute force of Sword and Arms, the greatest part of the Garrison consisting of eight thousand men commanded by the three Pasha's before-mentioned, were cut off, which was an important loss to the Turks, not only for the slaughter of so many brave Souldiers, but also for the quantities of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, being the Granary and Magazine for the whole Army. Therein <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Illay</hi> retaken from the Turks.</note> were likewise taken forty Field-pieces carrying eight pounds Bullet, with a great Chain of Iron, which usually encompasses the Treasury which is carried into the Field. With this ill success the Vizier retreated from <hi>Mosul</hi> as far as <hi>Mirdin,</hi> from whence he redoubled his instances for Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies for men and money. At length it was agreed, that an Army of thirty thousand Tartars should be sent thither; but <hi>Ragotski</hi> advising, that he was upon the point of breaking with the Emperour, it was orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that their number should be reduced to ten thousand; the which taking their Journey into <hi>Persia</hi> by the way of <hi>Circassia,</hi> were there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred by <hi>Han Gherey,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Tartary,</hi> (whom we formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to have been deposed by that people) and by him obstructed in their passage, the Vanguard of their Army being cut off by him; so that they were forced again to retreat and to embark their Men and Horse at <hi>Caffa</hi> to be transported by Sea to <hi>Trapezond;</hi> which as it was a matter of great trouble, so it was a course unpractised by the Tartars. The G. Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior being unable to render a more considerable Succour than this unto his Army, which was now reduced to the weak number of two thousand Janisaries, and three thousand Spahees, he resolved to condescend to Terms and Articles, as the only means to save his Honour, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of his Forces. In order unto which, he released a Persian Lord from his Imprisonment in the Seven Towers, and qualified him with the Title of Ambassadour, bestowing upon him an Equipage of Men and Horse agreeable to his Character, with four thousand Dollars to defray his Expence; and that the King of <hi>Persia</hi> might be assured of the Sultan's real intentions and desires of Peace, he recalled his Army in the Spring, whereby all Acts of Hostility ceased: and thus the Vizier being returned to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that pride and rigour which he exercised towards all in the time of his prosperity, laid him low by misfortunes in the esteem of his Enemies; who gladly embracing the opportunity to disgrace him with all the terms of obloguy and detraction, deprived him at length of <note place="margin">The Vizier de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of his Office.</note> his Office. One of the four Brothers-in-law married to one of the Grand Signior's Sisters, and Prime of the Cabal, being constituted Vizier in his stead. Nor did the late Vizier easily escape with his life, until he had reprieved it with an atonement of an hundred thousand Zechins of Gold and some choice Horses which he presented to the Sultan; the like Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample other Pasha's his Companions followed in proportion to their Estates and Employments; by which Presents the empty Treasury was in a manner recruited, and the present necessities of the Sultan relieved.</p>
                  <p>But this new Vizier enjoyed not long either his Honours, or his life; for the first act he performed, was to mitigate the <hi>Valedé Sultana</hi> or Queen-Mother to obtain a Hattesheriff, or writing under the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior's Hand for cutting off the Head of <hi>Casref</hi> Pasha, the <hi>Spaheeler-Agasi,</hi> or General of the Spahees, which being executed by <hi>Mortesa</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief in <hi>Persia,</hi> his Head was brought and thrown at the Gates of the Divan. The Spahees astonished at this spectacle, and enraged to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1632"/>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:98602:20"/>
see that Head on the ground which they so much esteemed and loved, forgot all the terms of duty and obedience to their Superiours; and without regard to the place wherein they were, even within the Walls <note place="margin">Mutiny of the Spahees joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisaries.</note> of the Grand Signior's Court they threw stones at the Vizier, and beat him from his Horse; which though the Grand Signior and all the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers highly resented, as the most scandalous indignity that could be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the Majesty of a Supreme Ruler and to all Government, yet their Counsels rather sought remedies to suppress the Mutiny, than to make Proposals of executing Justice on the Offenders; for the Spahees seconded by the Janisaries, (who were glad of any cause to make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion) assembled in the <hi>Hippodromo,</hi> from whence they sent an Arz to the Sultan, requiring the Heads of the Great Vizier, and of divers others, as well within as without the Seraglio. The Grand Signior de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying positively to assent hereunto, the Souldiery as plainly threatned to depose him, and place his Brother in the Throne; at which barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous resolution the Grand Signior being affrighted, his youthful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy was so shaken, that he wrote to his Mother to desire her excuse in case he assented to the death of her Son-in-law the Great Vizier; for that the storm of the military fury was so great, that he could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to protect him without the loss of his life and Crown: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Vizier being turned out of the Gates of the Seraglio, he was immediately butchered in the presence of the Sultan. Nor did the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous rage of the Souldiery end here, but they proceeded farther to demand the Head of the Janisar-Aga, or General of the Janisaries, who was reputed the chief Instrument of the death of <hi>Casref,</hi> because he was a principal Favourite to the Grand Signior; but he wisely taking divers off with Money and Presents, sowed division between the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisaries and Spahees; so that some difficulty arising hereupon, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of his death was deferred for a while; howsoever they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to demand, that the Mufti should be discharged of his Office, and that the Tefterdar or Treasurer should be delivered into their hands. To the first the Grand Signior assented; but being willing to save the other, he pretended, that he was escaped and fled; but when he was found, he should run the same Fate with the Vizier. But the military Sedition not being appeased with this answer, they roved through the whole City, and <hi>Galata,</hi> and other parts of the Suburbs: the Spahees persisting to require the Head of the Janisar-Aga, and not finding him in his House, they plundered it, and departed; and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a Youth, a Favourite of the Grand Signior's, they killed him; and so returning with the like fury to the Seraglio, they required ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to the New Vizier and Mufti. <hi>Regep</hi> Pasha, another of the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers-in-law, was then made Vizier, who with the new Mufti trembling at these Tumults, were careful to treat the Souldiery with all lenity and condescension imaginable, desiring them to declare their grievances, and whatsoever might give them satisfaction should be granted. The sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Souldiers replied, That they were resolved to see the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior's Brother, for that when the present Sultan did not govern well, they might know from whence to produce another of better abilities, and more agreeable to the designs of the Empire. That necessity which caused the late easiness of condescension to former demands, made way also for compliance with this; so that the young Prince being brought forth, they obliged the Sultan not to attempt any thing against his life,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98602:21"/>
and caused the Vizier and Mufti to become caution and security for it. Nor did these concessions contribute towards a pacisication; but rather their insolence increased thereby, renewing their exclamations at the Gates of the Seraglio for the Heads of the Janisar-Aga and the Testerdar; nor would they be satisfied with answer, that these men were not found in the Seraglio, but still persisted in their rude out-cryes and menaces, losing all respect and reverence to the Sultan and the Superiours; so that the Grand Signior resolved once to sally out upon them with his own Guard; but trying their temper and resolution, he discovered most of them to be poysoned with the like spirit of Sedition, and combining with the others as Associates in the Treason. The Viziers and other principal Officers perceiving the Mutiny to increase daily, and not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what degree it might arise, made it their business to search out for those proscribed by the Souldiery: at length the Aga was happily discovered by a certain person, to whom a reward was given of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Zechins, with the Office of Zorbasi or Captain; and the Aga con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing that he had counselled the death of <hi>Casref,</hi> he was immediately strangled, and his body hanged upon a tree to publick view. The like Fate befel the Testerdar, who being also taken, was killed and hanged up, together with the body of the Aga. All which persons thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanely murdered by the Souldiery, were the Enemies of the present Great Vizier <hi>Regep;</hi> for which cause the Grand Signior suspecting that he secretly contrived and nourished these Rebellions, never after looked on him with a gracious eye. Of which the Vizier being sensible, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined with the Souldiery; and judging it almost impossible to set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self right in the affection of his Master, he courted the favour of the Militia, as the only means to protect his life, and maintain his Power. But as the revenge of Princes is not like a Thunder-bolt, which wounds on a sudden, but rather like a Mine which requires time to form, and is then sprang, when it may do the best execution: so in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Grand Signior dissembled his hate towards the Vizier, until one <note place="margin">The Vizier strangled by order of the Grand Signior.</note> night being present with him in the Seraglio to see certain Fire-works, he called him aside, and whispered to him, that he should go into his private Lodgings, where being entred, the door was shut upon him, and he strangled by certain Eunuchs, who were appointed to attend him for that purpose. But little benefit or riches did the Grand Signior reap by his death; for the Vizier having for some time expected this blow, had concealed his Treasure, and conveyed it away for the use of his Posterity. The like hatred did the Sultan conceive against the Souldie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, resolving in his mind to execute his revenge especially on the Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, as the most turbulent Fomenters of Rebellion and Treason, and to vent his anger either by the Cord or Sword, or some other more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite way, as opportunity presented: and to prevent or oppose the like Seditions for the future, he fortified the Seraglio, and brought Arms in thither by night, chusing into his Guard select men of còurage and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness: and being sensible, that the being of his Brother attempered his Soveraignty, and drew away the hearts and eyes of his Souldiers and People from fixing entirely on his own person; he therefore intended to cut him off, but the caution and security given by himself and chief Ministers to preserve his life, diverted him from this resolution.</p>
                  <p>In place of the deceased Vizier, <hi>Mehmet</hi> late Pasha of <hi>Cairo</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, and the Seal consigned to him, with whom the Grand Signior consulting of the present emergency of affairs, often uttered his displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98602:21"/>
against the late Seditions, and signified his intentions to redress them for the future; in order unto which, he caused the Heads of the most mutinous Spahees to be cut off, and on various pretences separated the Souldiery each from other into divers parts; some numbers of Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries he commanded to march to the Confines of <hi>Persia,</hi> and caused ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others of them to be killed by night, and by various other means greatly weakened the Chambers, both by diminishing the numbers, and taking off such who were the men of best courage and conduct: many bodies were found swimming in the <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> and known to be Spahees; great part of the Lands belonging to the Timariots was taken away, and the Pay of the Spahees was abated, and divers Offices of Profit and Honour were taken from the Militia, that so men might be made sensible of the indignation of their Prince, and that there is no sport or jesting with the anger of a provoked King, who knows no other mean of his passion than the total evaporation of his choler and venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. To maintain and make good these several acts of just punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, young <hi>Morat</hi> growing in courage with his years, mounted on Horse-back well armed, and like a Souldier attended with a select Party of Cavalry, passed through the most publick streets of the City in a huffing manner, and casting a stern eye upon the Souldiery and People as he went, and making a hundred passes through the midst of them, struck them with an awe of his Majesty, and admiration of his warlike and Martial appearance; with which severity and gallantry the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery being affrighted, began to consider, that they were not longer to be governed by a Woman, or a Child, but by the most brave Prince that ever swayed the Ottoman Scepter; and thereupon for the future resolved upon an impartial submission and obedience unto him. To encourage them in which, and to reconcile their spirits and affections to him, <hi>Morat</hi> oftentimes assembled his Souldiery at <hi>Ackmeidan,</hi> where he exercised with them shooting with the Bow at Marks and at Rovers, rewarding those who shot best with adding an Asper a day to their Pay; besides which he distributed six thousand Hungars amongst them, to demonstrate that wise Princes are used to mix Lenitives with their rigour.</p>
                  <p>These Mutinies and Seditions in the Capital City encouraged rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Spirits in divers other places: so that a certain bold and audacious Fellow drawing a number of Miscreants after him, possessed himself of the City of <hi>Prusa:</hi> another of the same temper called <hi>Elia</hi> Pasha made himself Master of <hi>Magnesia,</hi> where he committed all the outrages which <note place="margin">Rebellion in <hi>Anatolia.</hi>
                     </note> Enemies inflict on a conquered People; and being about twenty four miles distant from <hi>Smyrna,</hi> so assrighted the people of that place, who were Merchants, and such as lived by Trade, that they fled with their Wealth, and such things as were portable, left they should be exposed to the robbery and spoil of Thieves and Rebels. But the Beglerbey of <hi>Anatolia</hi> suffered not <hi>Elia</hi> to reign long in his lust, but giving him Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel in those Plains, wholly defeated him, and sent twenty of the Heads of the chief Commanders to the Sultan for a Present; and pursuing <hi>Elia</hi> and the rest of his Army to <hi>Magnesia,</hi> besieged him in that City. The Grand Signior being advised hereof, and fearing left the Siege should take up too much time, and move other ill humors in that Country, dispatched Orders to offer Terms and Conditions of Accommodation with <hi>Elia,</hi> which were secretly treated, and great promises made him of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98602:22"/>
favour and rewards from the Grand Signior. The easie Fool accepted the Conditions, and embraced the promises; and leaving his City of <hi>Magnesia,</hi> proceeded confidently to <hi>Constantinople</hi> to receive the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rewards of the Sultan for his past Services. At his Entry into the Seraglio in place of the <hi>Kapislar-Kahyasee</hi> or Master of the Ceremonies, he was received by Officers with a Cord in their hands, who bestowed on him the gracious reward of his Masters ultimate favour.</p>
                  <p>These Rebellions were no sooner suppressed in <hi>Asia,</hi> but that other Mutinies of the Janisaries for want of Pay began at <hi>Buda</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mutinies at <hi>Buda.</hi>
                     </note> where they threw stones at their Aga, and pursued him to the very Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of the Pasha, electing another into his place. They also cut in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Governour of <hi>Pest,</hi> and bestowed his Office upon his Lieutenant. To remedy these disorders, and extinguish the Mutiny, the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior sent Commissioners to examine the matter, and to render him an account of the grievances and demands of the Souldiers: but they fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be surprised with some severe acts of Justice, prevented or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalled the inquiries of the Commissioners by acknowledging their fault, and demanding pardon, with surrender of four of the Ring-leaders to punishment, declaring, That by their seducement and evil perswasions, they were debauched into that disorderly course of proceedings: the Sultan accepted the submission, and all things were quieted in <hi>Hungary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Howsoever new troubles arose in <hi>Moldavia:</hi> for that People being <note place="margin">Troubles in <hi>Moldavia.</hi>
                     </note> oppressed over-much by their Prince <hi>Alexander,</hi> made an Insurrection against him, and drove him out of the Country, who for refuge fled to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> And the people desirous that one <hi>Bernoschi,</hi> a Polonian by Nation, might be put into his place, to obtain his Confirmation he came to the Port, and offered himself before the Grand Signior; but <hi>Morat</hi> suspecting, that to obtain the Principality for himself, he had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly instigated and nourished the late popular Commotions, caused his Head to be cut off in the publick Divan.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amurat</hi> had now born to him a seventh Daughter by his Slave, called the shining Star; and though he was much troubled that she had not brought him forth a Son and Heir, yet so much was she beloved by him, that he resolved to create her Queen, had not his Mother declared against it, as a thing not usual for any Woman to be honoured with that Title before she had supplied the Inheritance by the Birth of a Male Child. And that he might now totally extinguish the fire of Sedition amongst the Souldiery, he caused <hi>Ferdum Efendi</hi> and <hi>Saluc</hi> Aga, two prime Chiefs of the Spahees, with eight principal Janisaries, to be put to death; after which severity, fearing another Insurrection, he passed the Water, and retired to his Seraglio at <hi>Scutari,</hi> where he fortified himself.</p>
                  <p>It happened about that time, that a Turk Woman a Slave was found aboard a French Ship, ready to sail from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which the Turks highly resented, and aggravated the crime so much against the French Ambassadour, that they imprisoned his Son then embarked, and would have confiscated the Vessel and her Lading. In those days the Christian Ambassadours resident at that Court, kept better Union and Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence amongst themselves than they do at present; so that all of them as concerned, joyned together to represent before the chief Ministers, that such a fault merited not so grand a forfeiture, for that it was most probable to have been committed without the privacy either of the Ambassadour or Commander of the Ship. The Ambassadours then resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98602:22"/>
were Sir <hi>Peter Wych</hi> for <hi>England,</hi> the Sieur <hi>Marcheville</hi> for <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Pietro Foscarini</hi> for <hi>Venice,</hi> at whose warm and urgent instances the Turks condescended to release the Vessel and the Goods laden upon her, with free liberty to depart. Howsoever it being represented to the Grand Signior by the Captain-Pasha (who is Admiral of the Seas) that one <hi>Baldasar,</hi> an Armenian by Nation, but Dragoman or Interpreter to the French Ambassadour, was a principal Instrument to move the Ambassadours to unite in this pretence; and being observed to manage the Interest of his Master with warm and earnest sollicitations, the surly Sultan grew so angry that one of his own Slaves should presume to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage a dispute with him, in fury and rage commanded, that he should <note place="margin">The French Interpreter empaled.</note> be immediately empaled; and that he might be assured that his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence took effect, he would see him with his own eyes on the Stake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would pass the Water to his Seraglio at <hi>Scutari.</hi> The resolution was so sudden, and the Execution so speedy, that there was neither ear lent to hear, nor time given to mediate in his behalf; and the act be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing performed, complaints would not serve to redress a tyrannous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on now past remedy, and not to be recalled: wherefore as the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours were forced to acquiesce and patiently endure the affront; so if they would have resented it, they could scarce have found one amongst their Interpreters of so bold a spirit, who durst have opened his mouth after so terrifying an example. The truth is, the Dragomen or Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters to Ambassadours at <hi>Constantinople</hi> are required to be men of Learning, Courage, and Courtship, their studies ought to endue them perfectly with the Turkish, Greek, and Arabick Languages, with some knowledge also of the Persian, and with good Elocution, and readiness of Tongue: their constancy and presence of mind is always necessary at their appearance before those Grandees or Great men, who are ever proud, haughty, and arrogant in all their expressions and ways of Treaty, the which they commonly manage towards Christian Ministers with the same respect which we use towards our Servants, or our Slaves. And therefore by reason of this and other Presidents of like nature, Drago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have been always timorous in representing the true sence of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours and Consuls; at least have so minced and tempered their words, that they have lost much of that vigour and accent which is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to inculcate perfectly a business into the Understanding of a Turk, especially if you intend to incline him to Reason and Justice. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it would be an excellent Qualification for an Ambassadour himself to understand and speak the Turkish Language, or at least to have a young man by his side of the English Nation educated in the Turkish Court, who should be ready to explicate those matters which are too thorny and prickly for Subjects of that Country to handle.</p>
                  <p>Had all the foregoing Troubles, Mutinies, and Misfortunes encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the spirit of an easie and a gentle Sultan, certainly the Fate of this <hi>Amurat</hi> had been the same with that of <hi>Osman,</hi> who retiring within his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1633"/> Seraglio, could never have appeased the seditious humor with all the concessions he could give to an unreasonable multitude: but being a resolved and busling Prince, he at first gave some few steps backwards, as if he would yield somewhat to the impetuosity of that Torrent which he could not resist; yet it was only like a Ram who retires, that he may butt with the greater force. Howsoever the Politicians and sober men attributed the true cause of all these Commotions in the Souldiery, to

have no other foundation than the ill success and miseries which attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the War in <hi>Persia;</hi> for the way being long, and the Countries hot, barren, and for the most part void of all comfort, the Souldiers abhorred the fatigues, and march thither, and hated to consider, that they should be made a Sacrifice to the lust of voluptuous Ministers, who, to gain Estates and Riches out of those Monies, which were designed to carry on the War, did not care, whilst they lived at ease and in delights, what labours, wants, and dangers attended the Militia. These considerations made likewise some impression in the Sultan, who therefore inclined to hearken unto those Propositions of Peace which were brought him by an Ambassadour from <hi>Persia;</hi> and being accompanied with very great Presents, the Peace was clapt up and concluded on a sudden. But as <note place="margin">The Peace made with <hi>Persia,</hi> and speedily bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> things quick in their birth and production are not long-liv'd, nor long durable; so this Peace was broken the same year with an inconstancy equal to that inconsideration with which it was agreed and signed. For no sooner was the News hereof flown into the Eastern World, than the Great <hi>Mogol</hi> dispatched his Ambassadour with Letters to the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior, perswading him to make War again with the Persian, promising to assist him therein, by stopping up the passage of <hi>Nachivan,</hi> which is a City in the Lesser <hi>Armenia,</hi> built upon the River <hi>Aranes,</hi> and is the common Road into the <hi>Indies;</hi> the which motion, as it was pleasing to <hi>Morat,</hi> so being accompanied with Indian Curiosities and Presents of an inestimable value, the Ambassadour was graciously received and treated with such Feasts and Entertainments as are not usually known amongst the Turks; and returned again with Letters giving hopes, that he would speedily take an occasion to break with the Persian. But those who had experienced the difficulties of a War with <hi>Persia,</hi> and observed, that in the present Conjuncture of Affairs it might be more easily and with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage waged on the side of <hi>Hungary,</hi> endeavoured with many preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant arguments to perswade the Grand Signior thereunto, giving him <note place="margin">Perswasions for a War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</note> to understand, that <hi>Gustavus Adolphus</hi> King of <hi>Sweden</hi> being victorious over the Emperour in <hi>Germany,</hi> had taken many Towns and Cities of great strength; and having overthrown him in divers Battels, had slain or taken his best Captains and most Martial men of Valour; and that other Christians, who were desirous to abate the pride of the Austrian Family, were ready to embrace the same Conjuncture, whereby they might entirely shake off the yoke and servitude to the Imperial Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. These advantages being well represented, took place easily in the mind of <hi>Morat,</hi> so that he dispatched express Orders to the Pasha of <hi>Buda</hi> to assemble his Forces, and put all things in a readiness on the Frontiers: in compliance with which, though the Pasha set forth his Tents, and made great appearance of a March, yet some secret designs caused him to move slowly, and to affect a Peace rather than a War; so that receiving an Ambassadour from the Emperour at <hi>Pesth,</hi> he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily admitted him, and gave him safe conduct and Convoy unto <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople:</hi> at which time Advices coming, that the Great <hi>Gustavus Adol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> was slain, and that the Affairs of the Swedes went backwards and unsuccessfully in <hi>Germany,</hi> altered all the measures of the Ottoman Counsels; and though <hi>Ragotski</hi> endeavoured all he was able to foment the differences, and encourage the Turks to a War, having besides other specious pretences, an Army of thirty thousand men in a readiness to joyn with the Turks against the Emperour; howsoever the Turks look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98602:23"/>
on the condition of the Swedes as desperate, and the proffers of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotski</hi> to be uncertain, and of no true foundation, and the state of affairs amongst themselves to be turbulent and unsetled, gave a kind reception <note place="margin">A Peace made between the Emperour and the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior.</note> to the Emperours Ambassadour, and signed the Agreement for continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Truce. By this and other actions of like nature <hi>Ragotski</hi> lost much of his esteem with the Emperour and the Grand Signior; the first always looked on him as an ambitious Prince, exciting the Turk against him, and ready on the least occasion to enter his Country with fire and sword; the other looked on him as a false Friend, who never made proffers but those which squared with his own designs and interest, and particularly he had disgusted the Port by presuming to instate one <hi>Mathias</hi> in the Principality of <hi>Valachia,</hi> and to eject another constituted there by Authority of the Grand Signior, called <hi>Stridia</hi> Bei, or Lord <hi>Oysters,</hi> because his Father was a Fisher-man, and gained a good Estate by the Trade of Oysters; howsoever it being the Grand Signior's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to ordain such a person to that Office, it was a presumption and a bold piece of Usurpation in <hi>Ragotski</hi> to dispose of that Government by virtue of his own single Power: howsoever the Grand Signior, to avoid contention with the resolved spirit of <hi>Ragotski,</hi> confirmed <hi>Mathias,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition of a double Tribute paid for the Investment to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality. But besides these reasons for a Peace with the Emperour, the designs the Grand Signior entertained of making War upon <hi>Poland</hi> with the assistance of the Moscovites and Tartars, and of dispossessing <hi>Emir Facardin</hi> of his Government, were strong inducements to make fair weather on all other sides of the neighbouring Princes. The envy which the riches and greatness of <hi>Emir Facardin</hi> (who was a Prince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting in the parts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> to whom a large tract of Land with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Fortresses did belong) had contracted to him from the Pasha's of <hi>Damascus, Tripoli,</hi> and <hi>Gaza,</hi> caused them to accuse him before the Grand Signior of Rebellion and other enormous Crimes: the Plea against him was managed especially by the Pasha of <hi>Tripoli,</hi> who alledged, That he was an Enemy to the Mahometan Law, destroyed the Moschs, kept cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence with the Malteses and the Corsaires of <hi>Ligorn,</hi> permitting them freely to take water in his Country; that he openly favoured the Christians, suffering them freely to build Churches in his Country. That he continually fortified his Castles, and encroached on the Lands and Territories of the <hi>Emirs</hi> his Neighbours. In short, his riches were so great, that every one feared and envied him, and therefore represented his case in that manner, that the Grand Signior resolving to destroy him, sent great Forces into those Countries under the Command of the Pasha <note place="margin">Preparations of War made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Emir Facardin.</hi>
                     </note> of <hi>Tripoli,</hi> to whom he commanded the Pasha's of <hi>Damascus, Gaza, Aleppo,</hi> and <hi>Cairo</hi> to joyn their Forces: and for better expedition, the Captain-Pasha was appointed to equippe his Fleet, to transport Men and Ammunition into those parts. The Captain-Pasha in his passage by Sea encountred two English Ships lading Corn in the Gulph of <hi>Vola,</hi> called the <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Ralph,</hi> and <hi>Hector:</hi> this being a prohibited Commodity <note place="margin">A Fight of the whole Turkish Fleet against two English Ships.</note> not to be transported under penalty of forfeiting Ships, Goods, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the men, moved the Pasha with the sight of such a Booty to command his Gallies to seize the Vessels; which being only two, it was imagined, that they would immediately yield and surrender without contest. But these bold Brittons knowing the consequences of such a surrender, resolved not tamely to yield themselves, at least to sell their
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98602:24"/>
liberties, lives, Ships, and Goods to the Turks at the dearest rate they were able: wherefore cutting their Cables, put themselves under Sail, and got into the main Sea, fighting with the whole Fleet above three hours; sometimes they were boarded by one Gally, sometimes by two at once; but plying their Quarter-deck Guns with small shot, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending themselves manfully with their half-Pikes, they often cleared their Decks, and put off the Enemy with great slaughter: the Captain-Pasha being ashamed to see such resistance made by two such Vessels against his whole Force, resolved to enter his men at the Gun-room port of one of the Ships, and running the Prow of the Gally into the Stern-port, the valiant crew of the Gun-room clapt an Iron Spike into the Trunnel-hole of the Prow, whereby the Gally being wedged fast to the Timbers of the Ship, they brought their Stern-chase laden with cross Bars, pieces of Iron, and Parteridge-shot to bear upon them, which raking them fore and aft, killed the Captain-Pasha himself, with near three hundred out of the Bastard Gally. At length having spent all their shot, they charged their Guns with pieces of Eight, and being over-powered by numbers of their Enemies, and not able farther to resist, they set fire to their Ships, which blowing up, destroyed two or three of the Gallies which laid by their sides, together with those men which were then fighting aboard at handy-blows on the Deck with the defendants; so that none of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish were taken, unless three or four fished out of the water. An end being in this manner put to the Fight, the Turks gained the Victory, with the loss of twelve hundred Slaves killed and wounded, besides Turks, and were forced into Port, where they remained a full month to repair their Gallies; the which Fight affected all Turks with an asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of the English Bravery, or obstinacy, (as they call it) and is a matter remembred and talked of to this day, especially by the Son of the Captain-Pasha who was slain, called <hi>Omem,</hi> Pasha <hi>Ogli,</hi> who is Pasha of <hi>Rhodes</hi> at present, (as I remember) and commands three or four Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; for which reason he is so inveterate an Enemy to the English, that to satisfie his revenge, he buys what English Slaves he can get into his Gallies, and sells none out under a double price or ransom. The News of this Fight coming to <hi>Constantinople</hi> provoked the Grand Signior to the height of indignation; howsoever the Officers either being ashamed of their loss, or entertaining some secret admiration of the English Bravery, suffered the matter to be compounded for the Sum of forty thousand Dollars, of which the English paid only their share with the French and Venetians, whom (for I know not what reason) the Turks equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the occasion.</p>
                  <p>Whilst the Turks were appointing a new Captain-Pasha, and again refitting their Fleet, the Pasha of <hi>Damascus</hi> dispatched a Summons to <hi>Facardin</hi> to surrender <hi>Seida</hi> up to him, with other Castles and places of strength. The Old man resided then at <hi>Barut,</hi> where pretending to be retired from all business, answered, that he had resigned the whole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment into the hands of his Son <hi>Ali,</hi> as he had already testified by publick Acts: that he was but a Subject, and a Souldier under his Son, and therefore to him they ought to make their applications. <hi>Facardin</hi> had at that time an Army of twenty five thousand men, the which he divided into two Bodies, commanded by his two Sons. <hi>Ali</hi> his eldest he ordered with twelve thousand men (a thousand of which were Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronites, and two thousand Druzes) to march to <hi>Saphet</hi> for hindering the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98602:24"/>
conjunction of the Emirs of <hi>Ferue</hi> and <hi>Therabith,</hi> and the Pasha's of <hi>Gaza</hi> and <hi>Damascus,</hi> whose Forces being joyned together, did not compose a greater number than that of <hi>Facardin. Ali</hi> encountring with them, and being a brisk and hot-metled Prince, engaged and charged them so home, that he defeated them, and killed eight thousand of their men; but such a Victory as this not costing him less than seven thousand of his men, was in effect his own overthrow; for being the next day charged again by the Enemy, both sides fought with that obstinacy, that (as is reported) <note place="margin">The Son of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardin</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown,</note> there remained not above an hundred forty six of all the Souldiers which followed <hi>Ali;</hi> and he himself having his Horse mortally wounded under him, and being out of breath, weary, and faint, yielded himself to a common Souldier who promised him quarter; but afterwards having him in his power he stranged him with his Match, and cut off his head <note place="margin">and is stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled.</note> and his little finger on which he wore his Seal-ring, and so presented both to the Pasha. But this proud Conquerour refused to accept this Present without Ceremony, until first the Head had been perfumed with sweet waters, the beard combed out, and covered with a rich Turbant, and having kept this Trophy for some days by him, he sent it afterwards to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> But before the News of this Defeat reached the ears of old <hi>Facardin,</hi> the Captain-Pasha with his Fleet of Gallies arrived at the Port of <hi>Tripoli;</hi> to whom <hi>Facardin</hi> being desirous to shew all friendship, and profess loyalty to the Grand Signior, he caused his Army to retire into the parts of Mount <hi>Libanus,</hi> whilst he himself with about three thousand men between domestick Servants and his Guards went to <hi>Scida,</hi> from whence he sent two <note n="*" place="margin">A sort of Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel or Ship so called by the Turks.</note> 
                     <hi>Caramosauls</hi> laden with Provisions and refreshment to the Captain-Pasha for a Present, assuring him that he was an humble Vassal to the Grand Signior, and was ready to obey all his Commands; and because the Sultan may probably have received sinister reports relating to the Arms he had taken up, he assured him, that they were no otherwise designed, than to suppress the Robberies of the Arabs, and the Incursions of their Kings; and that he was ready to conduct his Army to any place, where his Master the Grand Signior should think fit to employ them. But these fair words could not divert the Captain-Pasha from his resolutions to enter the Port of <hi>Scida,</hi> nor from his Instructions of demanding, and upon refusal of forcing posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Castle; which as it was the most considerable Fortress, and the most pleasant Seat of all his Dominions, so he could not without much regret and sorrow hearken to such a Proposition: wherefore that the Pasha might not persist in this demand, he secretly proffered him an hundred thousand Zechins as a Bribe to himself, and his Son <hi>Mansour</hi> to be carried for a Hostage and Earnest of his faithfulness to the Grand Signior. The Captain-Pasha liked well the hundred thousand Zechins and the Hostages, but still required the Surrender of the Castle with them; on which whilst <hi>Facardin</hi> deliberated, News came of the death of his Son <hi>Ali,</hi> and the destruction of his Army, with which losing all courage, he yielded his Castle of <hi>Scida</hi> to the Captain-Pasha, retiring himself to his City of <hi>Barut;</hi> nor could he rest quietly at that place; for being pursued, he was forced to quit it, and retire with his Maro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites and Druzes into the Mountains, lest being inclosed within the Walls of a City, he should fall alive into the hands of his Enemies. And now all good Fortune forsaking unhappy <hi>Facardin,</hi> the Maronites and Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes his Subjects revolt to the Pasha of <hi>Damascus,</hi> his Palaces and Gardens
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98602:25"/>
of Pleasure were all ruined, his Friends forsook him, his two remaining Sons were lost, one carried to <hi>Constantinople</hi> for a Hostage, and the other slain in fight; his Towns of <hi>Gazir, Saphet,</hi> St. <hi>John d'Acria,</hi> and others were surrendred to the Pasha of <hi>Damascus:</hi> only some sew strong pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Mountains remained to him, where living in League with <hi>Reba</hi> a King of the Arabs, he committed all the spoils he was able on the Lands belonging to the Pasha of <hi>Damascus.</hi> But being hunted from one Mountain to another, and from one Cave to another, he was at length forced to surrender upon Conditions, that he should have liberty to proceed unto the Grand Signior with his own Equipage of three hundred men and Trumpets founding, and that he might carry with him all his Treasure consisting of a million of Zechins all in gold, together with other Riches, which were carried by fourteen Camels; and that he should not be conducted as a Prisoner in Triumph, but that he should with freedom approach the presence of the Sultan, like other Pasha's, who are in grace and favour. These Proposals being granted, <hi>Facardin</hi> with his two young Sons began his Journey to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and being about two days journey from thence, he dispeeded eight Chests of Gold before him, to prepare and make his way to the Grand Signior; who being pleased with the gold, and greatly rejoyced to receive the submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Homage of one who had so long stood out in Rebellion, he went out in a disguise and Habit of a Pasha to see and discourse with that person, of whom there had been so general a rumor: and having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly encountred with the Emir, he sate down in his Tent with him, desiring him to relate the story of his life, with the several particulars of his late misfortunes. Emir <hi>Facardin</hi> well knew the person of the Grand Signior; but feigning as if he was unacquainted with whom he discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and that he took him for some Pasha, began to recount the course of his life, the reasons why his Enemies falsely suggested evil reports of him to the Grand Signior, how he was forced for defence of his life to take up Arms, and what ill success accompanied his affairs; all which he represented with such quickness and eloquence, that the Grand Signior pitying his misfortunes promised to be his Advocate, and mediate with the Grand Signior in his behalf. The day following <hi>Facardin</hi> made his Entry in a Triumphant manner, and received a most favourable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience from the Grand Signior; and all the Pasha's and great men in conformity to their Master, and in hopes of sharing some part of his gold, shewed him a like kind favourable countenance and aspect. But finding afterwards that <hi>Facardin</hi> increased daily in the esteem of the Grand Signior, and that the old Rebel was become a new Favourite, and that he was likely to over-top and out them, they generally conspired together, taking the Mufti on their side to accuse him of many crimes, and more particularly that he was a Christian and an Apostate from the Mahometan Faith. This point of Religion so sensibly touched the Grand Signior, that he resolved to condemn him in a manner solemn and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary; for mounting one day on his Throne, he commanded <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardin</hi> to be brought in, and placed on a low chair, where ordering his crimes whereof he was accused to be recited, he passed a formal Sentence of death upon him: but <hi>Facardin</hi> arising to justifie himself, was not permitted to speak, only he obtained a quarter of an hours reprieve to make his Prayers, and afterwards was strangled by the hands of two Mutes.</p>

He imposed a great Tax upon Copper; and because he had several Ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses filled with that Metal, which had for many years lain by, he forced the people to buy it at his own rates; at which aggrievance the Commonalty growing desperate began to mutiny and rebel; but <hi>Morat</hi> put a speedy stop thereunto by cutting off the Heads of fifty of the most seditious, and so passed to <hi>Prusa</hi> with the attendance of six Gallies. He caused a Kadi to be hanged, to the great displeasure and universal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment of the Ulemah, who are Students in the Law; who to make known their aggrievance, and consult a remedy, assembled in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers at the House of the Mufti. The Queen-Mother being acquainted with this Meeting, and fearing the ill consequences thereof, gave imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate advice to the Sultan, who with like expedition dispatched a Boat to bring over the Mufti and his Son to <hi>Prusa,</hi> who were no sooner ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived than they were strangled, being not permitted to speak for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or to alledge any plea or excuse for their lives.

It was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon custom of the Grand Signior to walk the streets in disguise, when meeting with any drunken person, he would imprison him, and almost drub him to death. It was his fortune to meet a deaf man one day in the streets, who not hearing the noise of the people, nor the rumor of his approach, did not so readily shift out of the way, as was consistent with the fear and dread of so awful an Emperour, for which default he was strangled
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98602:26"/>
immediately, and his body thrown into the streets. All people feared and trembled at these practices, and were as careful to look out abroad for the Grand Signior, lest they should be surprised with the bluster of his presence, as Mariners are of being taken unprovided by some sudden Gust or Hurricane; for there was scarce a day, that one innocent or other was not sacrificed to his fury and tyrannical sancy.

                        <note place="margin">Hangs a Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Merchant.</note> 
                        <hi>Zanetti,</hi> a Venetian Merchant, who had built a losty Jardac, or a high Room of Prospective on the top of his House, was accused to the Grand Signior to have designed that place for no other end, than that he might with a Long-glass oversee the Chambers of the Ladies, and the Gardens, and Walks of the Seraglio: for which reason, without farther inquiry, he was hanged in his shirt on the top of his Jardac with a red Streamer in his hand, that so the Grand Signior might be sure, that the Sentence was executed. The Estate of <hi>Zanetti,</hi> whether belonging to himself or Principals, was consiscated; but in regard the Goods for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity were privately conveyed to the Ware-houses of several Frank Merchants, strict search was made for them; but in regard the Marks and Numbers were altered, they could not be distinguished: wherefore the Grand Signior concluding, that all the Frank Merchants had combined together to deceive him, he imprisoned every man of them, nor would he release them until they paid forty thousand Dollars for their ransom and liberty. After which upon pretence of a Plot, or agreement of the Franks to defend themselves from the leviation of this Tax, the Turks searched their Houses for Arms; in taking of which they were so rigorous, that they spared not so much as a Birding-piece, nor yet the Sword of Sir <hi>Peter Wych,</hi> then Ambassadour for <hi>England,</hi> though he alledged, that it was the very Sword with which his Majesty had conferred the Honour of Knighthood upon him.</p>
                     <p>But from these transactions at home, let us pass to the Wars in <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Persia.</hi> That invincible Prince <hi>Uladislaus</hi> King of <hi>Poland</hi> had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed such good success against the Czar of <hi>Moscovy,</hi> that the Czar was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to demand assistance from the Turks. The Grand Signior, though he had lately made a Peace with <hi>Poland,</hi> and sworn to maintain the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of <hi>Chocin</hi> concluded by his Predecessour Sultan <hi>Osman;</hi> yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual depredations which the Cosacks made, did always administer reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable pretences for a War: to which <hi>Abassa</hi> one of his chief Counsellours, a valiant and presumptuous Captain, did much incite him; for promising to himself the Conduct of that Army designed against <hi>Poland,</hi> did much <note place="margin">The Turks make War on the Poles.</note> flatter the Sultan and himself with the fancy of mighty success. The War being thus resolved upon, the Turk who commonly strikes before he quarrels, gave Orders to <hi>Abassa</hi> to make Levies of men in <hi>Moldavia</hi> and <hi>Valachia,</hi> and to put the Tartars in Arms, and the Militia of <hi>Buda,</hi> and of the parts along the <hi>Danube</hi> into a warlike posture, and with all expedition to enter <hi>Poland. Abassa</hi> who had with wonderful diligence put his Troops in readiness, ordered the Tartars with a Body of sifteen thousand men to enter <hi>Poland;</hi> which they performed with such cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that passing the River of <hi>Tyr</hi> above <hi>Chocin</hi> and <hi>Rinczug,</hi> they in a few hours laid all waste for the space of ten leagues round <hi>Kemenitz,</hi> and so retired with their Booty into <hi>Moldavia;</hi> howsoever their haste was not attended with such good speed, but that they were overtaken on the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> by <hi>Stanislaus Konispolzki,</hi> General of the Polish Army, with no greater Force than two thousand five hundred Horse; howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98602:26"/>
surprising them whilst they were seeding their Horses, he put them into such confusion and disorder, that he easily recovered all the Booty, and took five of their Chief men Prisoners, of which the Son-in-law of <hi>Cantemir</hi> was one. But this was a faint resreshment in respect to that terrible storm of sixty thousand men composed of Turks, Tartars, Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davians and Valachians, which under the Command of <hi>Abassa</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready passed the <hi>Danube. Konispolzki</hi> the Polish General having not sufficient Force to oppose them in open sield, nor time to assemble a greater Army, gathered what Supplies he could from the Cosacks and Lords of that Country, and therewith encamped himself upon a Hill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the River <hi>Tyr</hi> and the Town of <hi>Chocin,</hi> that he might be the better able to succour <hi>Kemenitz,</hi> which the Enemy designed to assault. <note place="margin">A Fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Turks and the Poles.</note> 
                        <hi>Abassa</hi> who contemned this weak Force of the Poles, resolved without farther consideration to attack them in their own Camp, and force them to sight; of which the Poles being well advised, placed several-Pieces of Artillery, and lined all the Hedges and Ditches with Musquetiers where the Turks were necessarily to pass, drawing out their whole Army into Batalia; the Turks who hastened the nearest way to charge the Enemy, fell into the Ambush, where having lost about five hundred men, they began to make a stand, and to consider of some more advantageous way to their design. Wherefore <hi>Abassa</hi> taking another course, which he judged to be free from all concealed dangers, ordered the Tartars to charge the right Wing, and the Moldavians and Valachians the left of the Enemy, and he with his Turks would fight the main Body. The Tartars with great resolution performed their part, and had wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seated that Wing, had not <hi>Wisnovitzki</hi> with some Troops and a Train of small Artillery come in seasonably to their succour: the Moldavians and Valachians sought so faintly against the Enemy, whom they consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be Christians, Brothers, and Neighbours, that they soon turned their backs and fled, but were not far pursued by the Poles. <hi>Abassa</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving this repulse sounded a Retreat, and immediately repassed the River <hi>Tyr,</hi> and marched with all the haste he was able, stopping no where, until he arrived at <hi>Rinzur</hi> about thirty English miles from the place of the Fight, and arriving at length on the Banks of the <hi>Danube,</hi> he gave licence to his Souldiers to disperse into their Winter-quarters; in the mean time <hi>Abassa</hi> dispatched Advice to the Grand Signior of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of the Fight, and of his great Victory by an entire defeat of the Polish Army. The Grand Signior believed the report, which none durst to contradict, and which was confirmed by the rumour of an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour coming from <hi>Poland.</hi> For the Poles being at that time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged <note place="margin">An Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour sent to the G.

About that time that the Ambassadour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached near to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the Grand Signior had another Son born, but of a weakly and sickly temperament, howsoever great joy was expressed, and all the City was enlightned with Torches, Bonsires, and Fire-works; and that the Grand Signior might evidence his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Magnisicence to the Ambassadour, he took this occasion of the Birth of a Son to make a solemn Entrance into the City, and to make

                     <p>Before the Grand Signior would grant Audience to the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, he ordered that <hi>Abassa</hi> should treat with him, and understand his business and desires: <hi>Abassa</hi> carried himself high in the Negotiation, he pretended the damages and charges of the War, the demolishment of certain Palancas, which were the places of Refuge for the Cosacks, and the Tribute of ten years past, with security of payment for the time to come. The Ambassadour positively refused to hearken unto any terms about Tribute, and that for other matters the Presents which he had brought to the Grand Signior would reasonably answer. His Presents were
<list>
                           <item>A Coach lined with Velvet, with six very fine Horses.</item>
                           <item>A Bason and Candlesticks of Silver richly gilt.</item>

                     </p>
                     <p>Being at length admitted to Audience, and thereunto conducted by the Aga of the Spahees and the Chaous Bashee, the Grand Signior asked the Ambassadour, which was not usual: <hi>For what reason he was come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi> To which he answered: <hi>That he was come to bring his Majesty advice of the Coronation of his King, and to establish a Peace, if his Majesty should judge fit to accept thereof.</hi> To which the Sultan replied: <hi>That all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Kings ought either to receive the Ottoman Laws, or pay him Tribute, or try the sharpness of his Sword.</hi> And taking a Cemiter in his hand which hung by him, he drew it half out, and said: <hi>With this I will subdue my Enemies, and though my War in</hi> Persia <hi>continues, I do not fear to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take another in</hi> Poland. To which the Ambassadour returning a modest Answer, was dismissed of the Royal Presence.</p>
                     <p>And now the Grand Signior, to put a good face on the business, and to make the World believe, that he designed what he spake, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed a War with <hi>Poland,</hi> and ordered his Tents to be carried abroad, supposing hereby to draw the Poles to his own terms of agreement: and in pursuance hereof he mounted on Horse-back and rode in state through the City, his upper Vest was made after the Hungarian fashion lined with Sables; in his right hand he carried a Quiver of Arrows, in his left two drawn Swords, on his Turbant he wore a large Plume of Feathers encompassed with a Circle of Diamonds; and in this manner entring his Tents he proceeded to <hi>Adrianople.</hi> But before his departure the Count <hi>Puchen,</hi> Ambassadour from the Emperour, arrived with other sumptuous Presents, offering Incense and gifts of Peace at the Throne of this Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                     <p>But before we relate the transactions at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and the success of affairs at that place, let us recount several dismal accidents at <hi>Constantinople.</hi> The Grand Signior returning by Sea from a place called <hi>Stravosta</hi> in the Bay of <hi>Ismit,</hi> anciently the Bay of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> where he had for some <note place="margin">Several mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs by water and fire.</note> time held his Court and great Divan, he was followed by several Vessels appointed to transport the people, in one whereof were ninety five per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons embarked, all of them Pasha's, Aga's, and chief Officers of the Court; the Vessel was over-set by a sudden gust of wind, and all the people drowned, excepting three Sea-men which saved themselves by swimming. More considerable were the mischiefs by fire. For on occasion of some Fire-works made in one of the Grand Signior's Chiosks or Houses of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, the fire took so siercely on the Tavan or wooden Works of the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98602:29"/>
Sieling, that it endangered the whole Palace, and had consumed all, but that many hands and active men gave a stop to the farther progress. This fire was but the fore-runner of a greater, which began the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> in that part of the City of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which is called <hi>

                        </note> being between the Wall and the Port where live Taverners, Butch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Fishmongers, and others who sell provisions. The fire took first in one of those Houses which had been a Tavern, and are Buildings only made of Deal-boards and Timber, which combustible matter flamed out so violently, that it took hold on all the Houses round, and was so quick in its motion, as if it had taken by a train, or that some wicked people with Fire-balls had employed themselves in the mischief; the fire took its course against the wind, burning on one side and the other to the Historical Pillar, and to the Mosehs of Sultan <hi>Mahomet</hi> and Sultan <hi>Selim;</hi> so that in a short time one third of the City was reduced to ashes. It is difficult to express the lamentable destruction was made hereby, what Riches, what Palaces, and Moveables were consumed in it, there being twenty thousand houses reported to be burnt; which mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery is best represented by the remembrance of our calamitous Incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at <hi>London,</hi> the greatest difference between one and the other was, that that at <hi>Constantinople</hi> was more quick in its motion; for it burnt a larger compass of ground in one third of the time, than ours did at <hi>London;</hi> for that City for the most part consisting of slight Buildings of Wood met not the resistance which ours sometimes did against the Walls of Brick and stones. The fire being extinguished, and men ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving time to lament and think, began to impute the cause and fault to those whom they most suspected; sometimes they accused the Persians for having fired the City, for which crime one of them the next year suffered death: some attributed the cause of all to the Janisaries, and that they out of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, that they expected Orders from their Aga, but likewise hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and discouraged others. Howsoever the Grand Signior not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his own part to contribute all assistance possible, sent four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men out of his Seraglio to work about the fire, not excusing the very Officers of his Royal Chamber from contributing their authority and personal aid; some of which ventured far into the fire to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate their courage, activeness, and obedience to the Commands of their Emperour: but all this was too little against an obstinate and an invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Enemy, for the fire slamed and proceeded until it wanted nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and food to consume. In fine, twenty thousand houses were burnt, two hundred Mosehs, and the library of the Mufti, which for the number of the Arabick and Persian Books was curious and of high esteem: the Albengs or Habitation of the Janisaries containing three hundred Chambers, of which each Chamber was capable to receive four hundred men, were all burnt and reduced to ashes. The which fatal and miserable spectacle did a little touch the heart of Sultan <hi>Morat;</hi> so that he gave out considerable Sums to comfort the distressed who had most suffered by this calamity, and to raise from its ashes his consumed and languishing <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which being revived and slourishing, was again miserably consumed by flames in the month of <hi>April</hi> 1660. But such is the benesicial and commodions situation of that place, and the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98602:30"/>
riches thereof by trade, and the presence of the Ottoman Court, that the Inhabitants again rebuilt it in fewer years than could be imagined.</p>
                     <p>But now to return to the Grand Signior at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> we find him resolutely designed to make a War upon <hi>Poland,</hi> to which he was indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the perswasions of <hi>Abassa,</hi> and the present conjuncture of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to joyn with the Moscovite, it seeming great Policy not to suffer <note place="margin">Reasons for a War with <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                        </note> the Countries of <hi>Moseovy</hi> to be over-run, or the Poles, who is a warlike and dangerous Nation, to grow puissant and powerful by his success and Conquest over his Neighbours: wherefore preparations were made on all sides for the War; great quantities of Provisions and Ammunition were sent into <hi>Moldavia</hi> by way of the Black Sea and the <hi>Danube.</hi> The Tartar <hi>Han</hi> sent word that all his Forces were in readiness, and expected nothing but their Orders to march; the Beglerbey of <hi>Greece</hi> made his Rendezvous at <hi>Philippolis</hi> with an Army of thirty thousand men, where he attended to joyn with the Forces of <hi>Bosna, Silistria,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Europe; Moldavia</hi> and <hi>Valachia</hi> made an appearance of levying men, and joyning with the Turk, but their hearts were towards the Poles, with whom they kept a secret correspondence, and would be ready to adhere on the least opportunity. In short, the Army of the Turks was so great, and all his affairs in that readiness, that he scorned to incline an ear to Propositions of Peace; in which opinion <hi>Abassa</hi> humoured and perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, that the Poles were so fearful of his Forces, that they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready yielded to Terms of compounding for a yearly Tribute. All which proved false; for in the mean time <hi>Vladislaus</hi> King of <hi>Poland</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting nothing of the heat and vigour of his War against the Mosco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, he was so successful therein, that he forced an Army of eighty thousand men, which he had besieged in their Camp, to lay down their Arms, and surrender themselves, which was an action scarce to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, <note place="margin">The Victory which the Poles obtained <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

These difficulties and inconveniences inclined the King <hi>Vladislaus</hi> to bend a favourable ear to the many supplications and instances which the Moscovites made for Peace; so that the Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiaries being assembled, it was agreed, that the Dutchy of <hi>Smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesko</hi> and <hi>Czernieschou,</hi> which two hundred years past had been taken <note place="margin">They make a Peace.</note> from <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Lituania,</hi> with many other Towns and Countries to the extent of two hundred leagues, should be restored to the Kingdom of <hi>Poland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The News of this sudden Peace coming unexpectedly to Sultan <hi>Morat</hi> caused his Bravadoes against <hi>Poland</hi> to cease, and to turn the stile of his fury and indignation against the Moscovites, whom he vilified with all imaginable terms of perfidiousness and cowardise, and abused and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned their Ambassadours. He considered that he had provoked an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my who was victorious, valiant, and powerful, and one who at any time was able to contend with his united Force, much more whilst it was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98602:30"/>
and disjoyned by his War in <hi>Persia:</hi> wherefore in all haste he dispatched an Ambassadour into <hi>Poland</hi> called <hi>Shahin</hi> Aga, desiring to renew the ancient League and Articles of Peace. This Ambassadour <note place="margin">The Turk sends an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour into <hi>Poland</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire a Peace.</note> found the King at the Diet in <hi>Warsaw,</hi> where he publickly endeavoured to excuse his Master for the late Acts of Hostility, assuring them, that they were not performed according to his Masters desires and original intentions, but as they were moved and guided by the evil suggestions and artifices of <hi>Abassa,</hi> who being solely culpable of this fault by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ill counsels to his Master, he assured them in the Name of the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, that he should receive such punishment, as they should think sit to inflict upon him. Hereunto the King <hi>Vladislaus</hi> gave this answer, That since the Grand Signior could so easily infringe the Articles of that Peace which had been solemnly and sacredly established, it was now his part, and the wisdom of that grave Assembly to contrive such conditions and bonds wherewith to oblige his Master, as could not easily and at his pleasure be broken or avoided: and at the same time the Polish Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour being returned from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and discoursing in the Diet of the pride and perfidiousness of the Turks, and the scorn where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they received Christian Ambassadours, so incensed the spirit of the whole Assembly, that with a general consent they approved the words of the King, adding, that they would no longer be subject to the insults and falsities of that Tyrant, whom they would make to know, that they wore as well offensive as defensive Arms, and were not of that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject spirit or mean condition to permit the Sultan to violate the most sacred Articles of Peace, and then at his pleasure to salve them with a fawning acknowledgment, or a flattering speech. In this manner the Turkish Ambassadour was returned, whilst the King <hi>Vladislaus</hi> went into <hi>Podolia</hi> to take a view of his Armies, which he found to consist of eighty thousand fighting men, all well accoutred, of good courage, and ready to follow their King to the Walls of <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fear of the motion of this great Army in a conjuncture when the Wars broken out again in <hi>Persia</hi> were not prosperous, affected the mind of <hi>Morat</hi> with much terrour; so that he became very sollicitous to find out and make some substantial Proposition in order to an Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. One of the Viziers called <hi>Morteza</hi> was very active in this business, plying continually the General <hi>Konispolzki</hi> with Letters, Ossers, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients for a Peace; to facilitate which and shew that the Grand Signior did heartily relent, <hi>Abassa</hi> was strangled by two Kapugees, and given <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Abassa</hi> stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled.</note> for a Sacrifice to appease the anger of his Enemies; a person who was a stout Souldier, and one who had performed great and signal services in the War of <hi>Persia.</hi> But the Poles not being pacified with this single act of penitence, but thirsting farther after the blood of the Turks, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to spoil and pillage their richer Provinces. Howsoever at length the Council of <hi>Poland</hi> entring into more serious debates, considered that the Troops lately come from <hi>Moscovy</hi> were but in a bad condition, that the part of their Army which consisted of Voluntiers would not endure a long and tedious War, and that the expence and charge of this <note place="margin">Articles of Peace agreed between the Poles and the Turks.</note> great Army was immense and almost insupportable: for which reasons it was resolved, that a Peace should be made, which was soon afterwards concluded and agreed on these following Articles.</p>
                     <p>That the Vayvods of <hi>Moldavia</hi> and <hi>Valachia</hi> should be confirmed by the Grand Signior with the consent and recommendation of the King of <hi>Poland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="50" facs="tcp:98602:31"/>
That <hi>Cantemir</hi> and his Tartars should abandon the Country of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zac,</hi> and in case of refusal, that then the Turk and Tartar <hi>Chan</hi> should joyn their Forces to expel them from thence.</p>
                     <p>That the Poles shall suppress all Acts of Hostility of the Cosacks in the Black Sea.</p>
                     <p>That the Turks renounce for ever all demands, or future pretence of Tribute from <hi>Poland:</hi> and that they shall build no new Forts on the Frontiers.</p>
                     <p>That the Navigation on the River <hi>Nieper</hi> shall remain free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disturbed to the Poles. That all other Articles shall remain as formerly in their true force and virtue.</p>
                     <p>In this year happened out great differences between the French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour and the Turkish Officers. The first disgust had its original from the year 1631. when the Marquess of <hi>Marcheville</hi> going Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour <note place="margin">A difference between the French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour and the Captain-Pasha.</note> to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> was in his Voyage met off of <hi>Scio</hi> by the Captain-Pasha and his Fleet of Gallies, who immediately sent off a Boat to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise him, that he should strike his Flag, and make ready the Presents which were due to the Grand Signior's Admiral: <hi>Marcheville</hi> duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering, that this submission would blemish the Honour of his Master, and the Dignity of his Character, refused compliance either in one or the other; howsoever that he might testifie the friendship and good correspondence which he came to confirm between the two Kings, he stood off at some distance and fired five Guns to salute the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior's Standard; but the Captain-Pasha not contenting himself here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, required the Ambassadour to come aboard and speak with him, which after divers Messages from one Vessel to another, the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour was counselled to perform, not knowing how far otherwise he might engage the Honour of his Master. <hi>Marcheville</hi> being arrived at <hi>Constantinople</hi> did greatly complain of the affront and violence he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Captain-Pasha; which though the Grand Signior and other Ministers seemed not to approve, yet the Ambassadour received little other satisfaction than fair words and promises, that his Honour should be again repaired. At the Arrival of the Sieur <hi>Marcheville</hi> the Count <hi>Cesi,</hi> who was the former Ambassadour, was to return into <hi>France;</hi> but the debts which he had contracted by a certain way of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, were so great, that the Creditors would not suffer him to depart without payment; for default of which he endured many affronts offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his own person, and was detained at <hi>Constantinople</hi> until this year 1634. during which time the Marquess <hi>Marcheville</hi> managed all the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Embassy, who keeping still in mind the affront offered him before <hi>Scio,</hi> watched all opportunities to disparage the actions and person of the Captain-Pasha; who at length returning from the Black Sea, where he had some success against the Cosacks, was graciously received by the Grand Signior; and being advertised, how during his absence the French Ambassadour had endeavoured to blast his reputation by many instances of diminution, which he often inculcated by his Druggerman, took advantage of the Grand Signior's good humour, to vent before him the resentment which he conceived thereof: the Grand Signior to gratifie the Pasha, promised to hang the Druggerman, which the Pasha acknowledged as a singular favour, and returned from the presence of the Sultan full of joy and contentment: but better to cover his malice, and to ensnare the poor Wretch, he sent a Messenger to the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98602:31"/>
assuring him that he desired his friendship; and that there might be a right understanding between them, he perswaded him to send his Druggerman to him, that by his mouth he might signifie the esteem he had for the Ambassadour, from whose spirits he was willing to take off all jealousies and ombrages of discontent. The Ambassadour not suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the perfidiousness of the Pasha, sent his Druggerman to him, who <note place="margin">The French Druggerman hanged</note> being come within his power, was immediately hanged by the Grand Signior's express Command, and ordered that he should remain on the Gallows with his Velvet Cap on his head, which in this Sultan's Reign all Druggermen wore to distinguish them from others. The Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour complained greatly of this affront and violation of Articles, to the Chimacam and other Officers, but could receive no other answer or satisfaction than that the Grand Signior might execute Justice, as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, on his Subjects, without asking leave, or concerning the King of <hi>France</hi> or his Ambassadour in the matter. But <hi>Marcheville</hi> not resting satisfied with this reply, still prosecuted his pique and animosity to such height, that the Captain-Pasha farther incensed thereat, obtained Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from the Grand Signior to dispeed him away: so that sending one day for <hi>Marcheville,</hi> and first reproaching his contrivances and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs against him, told him plainly, that it was the Grand Signior's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure that he should depart at that instant; to which he constrained the Ambassadour so precipitately, that he would not give him time to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertise his Servants, or make up his Baggage; but forced him aboard a French Ship then in Port, which he immediately compelled to sail; and the wind being contrary, caused the Vessel to be toaed abroad by two <note place="margin">The Sicur <hi>Marcheville</hi> forcibly sent away.</note> Gallies into the open Sea of the <hi>Propontis.</hi> After the injurious departure of this Ambassadour, the Count <hi>Cesi,</hi> who had been detained at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> for the reasons before denoted, took again upon him the function of Ambassadour, to execute which in better advantage of Trade and Commerce, he was advised to a compliance with the Captain-Pasha, and to use such means as might mitigate that acrimony of spirit, which this Pasha nourished against the French Nation. These disputes between the French and the Turkish Officers revived certain disgusts and aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion against all the Frank Nations, which favoured the Latine Rites; so that in despight to them the Grand Signior restored again <hi>Cyrillus</hi> the Patriarch to the Patriarchal Jurisdiction, who had long been persecuted by the Jesuits, and by their means been deposed, promising that for the future he should continue undisturbed, in opposition to all those of the Roman Religion.</p>
                     <p>The Peace (as we have said) being concluded with <hi>Poland,</hi> the Grand Signior was more at leisure to attend the Wars in <hi>Persia,</hi> with the labours and toils of which the Janisaries being wearied, began new troubles and Seditions in the Camp; the which disorder <hi>Morat</hi> attributing to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence or cowardise of the Officers, as wanting courage to suppress <note place="margin">Acts of cruelty.</note> them, summoned the Janisar-Aga to appear before him, and without long process or excuse cut off his Head, and consiscated his Estate to the Exchequer, which amounted to a million and seventy thousand Dollars: another Janisary also more rich than seditions, was in like manner sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed, and an hundred and sixty thousand Dollars of his Estate added to the Treasury of the Sultan. The Pasha also of <hi>Damascus,</hi> with several other Officers of the Army enriched with spoils of the people, fell a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to <hi>Morat's</hi> avarice and cruelty; to whom riches and blood were
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98602:32"/>
so pleasing, that none acquired a higher degree of grace in his favour, than those who could give him notice of opulent men, who having found riches he undertook to find them guilty, and to prove their wealth so corrupted by extortion and violence, that nothing could hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low or purifie it but his Coffers.</p>
                     <p>The next News from <hi>Persia</hi> brought advice, that that King at the Head of a powerful Army was encamped in the Country about <hi>Van,</hi> with which the Turks not having sufficient Force to fight, the Vizier wrote to the Grand Signior, that his presence was necessary to increase the Army, and encourage the Souldiery; whereupon he resolved to leave <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and transfer his Court to his Seraglio at <hi>Scutari,</hi> that <note place="margin">The G. Signior returns to <hi>Scu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tari.</hi>
                        </note> so remaining on the Banks of <hi>Asia,</hi> he might be nearer to his business, both to receive Intelligence and administer Supplies; and because Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and discontents in the people do always obstruct the motion of publick Affairs, he not only ruined the Taverns and Tabaco-shops, but forbid Coffee-houses, and other idle places of concourse; nay into Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers shops no more than one was suffered to enter at a time; for those being places of resort, Treason was frequently vented there, men of that profession being notorious through the World for their talk and intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance of language: and farther to restrain Meetings and secret Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions strict Orders were given, that after an hour and half in the night all fires and candles in the City should be extinguished, which was the general discontent of all people. But what shewed much of the fierce spirit of the Sultan, was a certain fury which he conceived on this occasion. On a certain day riding on his Horse, thirty Indian Pilgrims met him in the way to demand his charity, and being in a different ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit to what the Turks wear, and not accustomary in that Country, the Grand Signior's Horse started at the sight of them; and being spurred for bogling in that manner, the Horse capred and reared an end, so that he threw his Rider; at which the Grand Signior being highly enraged, drew out his Cemiter, and with his own hand killed his Horse, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of alms prepared a place of entertainment in the Gallies for those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Indians.</p>
                     <p>The Grand Signior being returned to his Palace at <hi>Scutari,</hi> which is seated on the Asian side opposite to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> applied his whole mind entirely to the Affairs in <hi>Persia;</hi> and being resolved to march thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">The G. Signior resolves to go to <hi>Persia</hi> in person.</note> in person, he put abroad the Horse-tail, which is a signal of depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he visited the Sepulchres of his Ancestors, made his Corban, which is a distribution of flesh to the poor, for a Blessing on his Enterprise. The Officers of the Army contended to out-vy each the other in their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents to the Grand Signior, some furnished him with Royal Tents, others with curious and light Arms; and others with Horses and Furnitures of value. Great Sums of Money were extracted out of the Exchequer for Military preparations and payments of the Souldiery. The charge of Affairs in absence of the Grand Signior was committed to the Bostangi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bashee, who was made Chimacam of <hi>Constantinople;</hi> and so with a fierce spirit, and aspect full of indignation and anger he mounted his Horse at the head of an Army of an hundred thousand; he departed from <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> about the end of <hi>April.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But before we recount the particulars of what succeeded in <hi>Persia,</hi> it is requisite to cast our thoughts back to the troubles of <hi>Transylvania</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1635"/> by the competition of <hi>Stephen Bethlem</hi> and <hi>George Ragotski</hi> for
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98602:32"/>
that Principality. <hi>Bethlem</hi> (as we have said before) being grieved and discontented at his hard Fortune in being put by the Government, and resenting the punishment which <hi>Ragotski</hi> inflicted on his Son for the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Bethlem</hi> renews his complaints to the Grand Signior.</note> crime of manslaughter, he went to <hi>Buda,</hi> and there renewing his old complaints to the Pasha, he was with recommendations from him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied to the Port, where being introduced to the presence of the chief Ministers, he at large declared the Merits and good Services of his Family towards the Sultan: <q>That for this reason only, in dishonour <note place="margin">His reasons to be re-inslated.</note> and despight to the Ottoman Empire, he was excluded from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and therefore challenged its assistance to re-establish him therein, in consideration of which, he promised the same faithfulness and devotion to the Sultan, which was professed and maintained by his Ancestors, and was natural to the Family of <hi>Gabor.</hi> That as to <hi>Ragotski</hi> it was apparent, that he entertained different principles; that he was a person of elated thoughts and a turbulent spirit, and was ever united in combination with the Emperour, Germans, and other Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Ottoman State.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Turks moved with these reasons, resolved to favour <hi>Stephen,</hi> and to discountenance <hi>Ragotski;</hi> and though the conjuncture of affairs was such, as that any other Engagement in War, besides that of <hi>Persia,</hi> did not square with the present designs; yet at all times it was judged convenient to sow the tares of discord, and promote differences amongst Christians, which have ever produced advantages to the Mahometan Cause: and likewise the Pasha of <hi>Buda</hi> was commanded to enter <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sylvania</hi> with a Force sufficient to contend with <hi>Ragotski;</hi> and lest the Emperour should be alarm'd with this commotion, a Chiaus was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched to give him a perfect understanding of the reasons, why an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my <note place="margin">The Turks send an Army into <hi>Transyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania.</hi>
                        </note> marched into <hi>Transylvania;</hi> the design of which was not intended in the least manner to impeach the Articles of Peace between him and the Grand Signior, but only to displace a man of a furious and turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent spirit, and to ordain another in his stead of a more sober and quiet temper, by whose moderation and prudence the Peace between the two Empires may be improved and continued.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ragotski</hi> startled at this design intended against him, assembled the States of his Country to determine and consult concerning a remedy, and immediately dispatched a Messenger to the Emperour, to desire <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ragotski</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plores aid from the Emperour.</note> and implore his Imperial succour and protection: and though <hi>Ragotski</hi> was sensible of the disparity of his strength, in comparison of that of the Turks; yet neither did his counsels nor behaviour betray fear or want of constancy. The Hungarians seconded those instances which <hi>Ragotski</hi> had made at the Imperial Court, and the Party which he had made at <hi>Vienna</hi> brought the matter to a debate in Council, which was argued on both sides with solid and convincing reasons. Those who spake in disfavour of <hi>Ragotski,</hi> alledged, That all assistance contributed to him would be a just cause and pretence to the Grand Signior to make War with the Emperour. That <hi>Ragotski</hi> himself was of an uniquiet tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, not unlike to <hi>Gabor</hi> his Predecessor, who had often bid defiance <note place="margin">It is debated in Council.</note> to the Emperour, and over-running all <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Austria,</hi> had often erected his Standard in the sight of <hi>Vienna.</hi> To protect and cherish a person of this disposition, was no other than to nourish a Serpent or Viper in their bosom; who being elevated at the expence of the Empire in successes against the Turk, would convert that power which he had
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98602:33"/>
gained to the damage of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> combining with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of other Princes to procure its destruction. Let us therefore, said they, stand at a gaze, and as men on the shore or in a good Port behold the agitation of Ships in the Ocean; perhaps the change of a Prince in <hi>Transylvania</hi> may turn to our benefit, and one may succeed into the place, of such a mild temper and serene disposition, as may better agree with the Maxims of this Court, and may cultivate that Peace which can only render these Countries happy.</p>
                     <p>Howsoever there were other opinions to the contrary, amongst which it is said, that D. <hi>Annibal Gonzaga,</hi> a person acquainted with the State of <hi>Transylvania</hi> and of the Turks, and Director of the Imperial Army, delivered himself in this manner.</p>
                     <p>May it please Your Sacred Imperial Majesty,</p>
                     <p>IF <hi>Ragotski</hi> had been the lawful Son and hereditary Successour of <hi>Gabor,</hi> who was an Enemy to your Majesty, we might then apprehend the evil consequences of a Son, that traces the same path and footsteps of his Father. But here is another person, another Prince, in emulation different, and by enmity hating the House of <hi>Gabor;</hi> wherefore I cannot imagine, how this Prince can possibly entertain Maxims of like nature with the other. For my part I believe, that it behoves your Majesty to maintain a good correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the Princes of <hi>Transylvania</hi> by a close Vnion against the Turk; your adjoyning Countries being like contignous Buildings, which are strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a mutual support: let us therefore support it, for if it depends not on us, it will be over-run, and remain oppressed without us. To aggravate the faults of <hi>Gabor</hi> to the disparagement of <hi>Ragotski,</hi> is no Logical consequence, unless you will argue, that the faults of the guilty are to be punished on the innocent. Let us therefore consider, which agrees best with the security of the Empire; that <hi>Transylvania</hi> should remain in the hands of <hi>Ragotski,</hi> or of the Turk; or that we had better strike against the rock of jealousie, which we conceive against this Transylvanian, or on that ruinous rock of the Turkish Power. The Ottoman Counsels commonly look asquint, they cast their eye on the Prince, when their sight aims at the Principality, and threaten the person, when they design to vent their fury to the subjection of his Country. The true intent of the Turk is to reduce <hi>Transylvania</hi> to the same condition with <hi>Moldavia</hi> and <hi>Valachia,</hi> and to incorporate this with infinite other Provinces into the gross body of his Empire. It is notorious to all the World, that the Emperours your Predecessours have lost a large tract of Land by the Turks, and your losses will every day be greater, as their Conquests increase; and when their Dominions in <hi>Europe</hi> are so enlarged, that they are able to quarter their Asiatick Cavalry in these Countries, your dangers must necessarily be inevitable and full of terrour. For I compute, that when the Turk designs to make War upon us, he marches with an hundred thousand men, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ten thousand Camels, besides other beasts of burden; so numerous a body as this cannot be maintained until the grass be fully grown, which is not until the middle or end of <hi>June;</hi> and from that time they have more than a month or six weeks March before they arrive upon our Consines; the which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of time prolongs their Enterprises, and protracts the time of our da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages. But if once they become Masters of <hi>Transylvania,</hi> and that that Country be laid to <hi>Moldavia, Valachia,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Hungary,</hi> they may then commodiously winter amongst us, and begin their Wars and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98602:33"/>
upon us early in the year, and pursue them until the last season of the Autunin: and in this manner, whilst we are debating and taking our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures in our Diet, they will fatten themselves, and satiate their appetites with our spoils. It is good therefore for us to defend <hi>Austria</hi> in <hi>Transylvania,</hi> keeping the eaver as far from the heart, as we are able. Let us suppose, that <hi>Ragotski</hi> is the most ungrateful man in the world, and that after we have supported and succoured him, that he will reverse his Arms upon us: howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he is not so strong and considerable as to do us much hurt, and therefore it were better to have him our Neighbour and our Enemy, than the Turk, though our Friend: the first can only administer some little causes of jealonsie, but the other may destroy and supplant us: the first is but like a putrid fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which is cured with every small evacuation; but the latter is a pestilence, which dilates and diffuses it self, and is deadly and irrecoverable. Let not the seruple neither of breaking with the Turk trouble us; for we may admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister assistance under-hand, and without noise effect our business, without arriving at the extremity of a rupture. It is folly and weakness in us to be charmed by the statteries of the Turks, and the fair words of this Chaous, or to imagine, that when they have over-run all <hi>Transylvania,</hi> they will stop in the midst of their career, before they arrive at the Gates of <hi>Vienna;</hi> no, their intentions are to lull us asleep, and to destroy our Neighbour first, and then us; they cannot devour us both at once, but husband their diet, and reserve us for another meal. The Turk is like a Serpent, who lyes quiet and coiled up all the Winter, not because he wants either a sting or poison, but being benumbed with cold, wants warmth and heat to give it motion and operation. This is my sense and opinion, which I most humbly tender before the greater Wisdom of Your Sacred Majesty.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding these convincing Arguments, the result of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil determined otherwise, and <hi>Ragotski</hi> was left to shift for himself, and <note place="margin">The Emperour resuses succour to <hi>Ragotski.</hi>
                        </note> to stand upon his own legs, which was a pernicious resolution, and that which was afterwards the cause of the subjection of <hi>Transylvania</hi> to the Turk, and the original of many mischiefs to the Empire; but this was the fortune of the Turks, more favourable to them than to the Christian State.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ragotski</hi> being thus abandoned by the Imperialists, and exposed to the mercy of an insatiable Enemy, though his courage was good and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, yet he began to despond of his Force, unable to deal with such an unequal Match, as that of the Turk: and his Subjects being fearful of the event, perswaded him to give way, and resign his rule to the hands of <hi>Gabor</hi> his Competitor; <hi>Ragotski,</hi> that he might not seem to neglect the counsel of his Subjects and Friends, and to gain time, pretended to hearken to their advice; and accordingly entred into a Treaty with <hi>Gabor.</hi> During which debate he secretly obtained some Forces from <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ragotski</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains succours under-hand.</note> 
                        <hi>Poland,</hi> by connivance of that Government; and the Hungarians being his friends, privately favoured him, knowing that the Conquest of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sylvania</hi> would be a step to their destruction; and being at length well fortified and recruited, he began to declare openly, that he found no security to himself in this Surrender, for that a place was denied him, wherein he put his chief hopes of defence; and therefore that he was resolved to support and maintain his state and cause in the best manner that he was able. Hereupon the Turks entred <hi>Transylvania</hi> with an <note place="margin">The Turks en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Transylvania.</hi>
                        </note> Army of twenty five thousand men under the Command of the Pasha of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98602:34"/>
                        <hi>Buda: Ragotski,</hi> to obstruct their March, dispeeded his General <hi>Cornis</hi> with seven thousand men to prepossess an advantageous ground, with Order to entertain, but not fight the Enemy, until he could come up to him with the gross of his Army. The Turks perceiving their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in number, resolved to engage the Enemy before they were rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced with new Succours; to perform which they made a detachment of twelve thousand Horse, and two thousand Janisaries, and some Field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces commanded by the Pasha himself and <hi>Stephen Gabor. Cornis</hi> not <note place="margin">They fight with <hi>Cornis,</hi>
                        </note> being able to disingage himself or avoid fighting, made a vertue of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, and put his Forces into form of Battel, and exhorting his men to follow his example, assured them, that Victory was sooner acquired by valour than numbers, and that Fortune was always more favourable to the valiant and brave, than to the cowardly and pusillanimous. <hi>Cornis</hi> unsheathing his Sword fought in the head of his men, and led them through the thickest of his Enemies, the first rank of which not being able to sustain the surious charge of the Christians, gave way; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing disordered, the first Squadrons ran foul of the second, and at length all of them betook themselves to a shameful flight. The Transylvanians <note place="margin">are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown.</note> took all their Cannon and Baggage with ten Ensigns, and killed three thousand Turks. The Pasha of <hi>Agria</hi> was wounded, and <hi>Olac</hi> Bei of <hi>Temiswar</hi> was taken Prisoner; and the whole Army had that day been defeated, had not the Janisaries, who fortified themselves in a thick Wood, given a stop to a farther pursuit. <hi>Ragotski</hi> likewise in divers succeeding Skirmishes overthrew the Turks, killing many Pasha's and Souldiers of quality, and at length remained sole Master of the Field. The Turks retired to <hi>Lippa,</hi> and <hi>Stephen</hi> to <hi>Temiswar,</hi> whilst <hi>Ragotski</hi> made his Incursions into the Country of the Turks, burning and spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two thousand Villages; with which being terrified and beaten into terms of reason, they agreed to suffer <hi>Ragotski</hi> to injoy his Government, <note place="margin">Peace is made.</note> conditionally, that the Goods and Estate of <hi>Gabor</hi> in <hi>Transylvania</hi> should be restored unto him: and thus <hi>Ragotski</hi> established himself in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and obtained a confirmation thereof from <hi>Constantinople</hi> to his Son, accompanied with Presents and Ornaments of a Prince. And this example shews us in what manner we are to deal with Turks; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution and rigour are better Arms against them than complements, and with an Enemy it is more advantageous to make Peace with weapons in our hands, than to condescend to the hard terms which a Tyrant pleases to impose on an easie and an unprovided People. So soon as this News arrived the ears of the proud Sultan, he was so incensed, that in a fury he would have desisted from his present War in <hi>Persia,</hi> to vent his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge upon <hi>Transylvania;</hi> but the cooler and more moderate counsels of wiser friends advised him to defer the execution of his anger, until he could discharge it more to the purpose, and in a conjuncture when it would fall more easie on himself, and more heavy on his Enemy: howsoever in the mean time <hi>Ragotski</hi> made such use of this remote diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Ottoman Arms, by advantaging himself of an Alliance with the Cosacks, and by the ill correspondence and diffidence which at that time intervened between the Tartars and the Port, that he not only avoided the revenge threatned by <hi>Morat,</hi> but obtained an establishment of the Inheritance to his Son.</p>
                     <p>By this time Sultan <hi>Morat</hi> was arrived at <hi>Erzrum,</hi> which is a City belonging to the Turks on the Confines of <hi>Persia;</hi> where the first Act <note place="margin">Morat at Erzrum.</note>
                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:98602:34"/>
which he performed of Justice, was to cut off the Head of the Pasha for his oppression and extortions inslicted on the people. Entring into <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi> he was grieved to see the upper and lower Provinces so miserably destroyed and wasted by the War; to recover which he commanded the people under pain of death to return again to their ancient habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions within the space of twenty days; but they being setled in other Cities, where perhaps they had purchased Houses and Lands, could not possibly comply with the severity of this Decree; and therefore were constrained to buy a dispensation and release from the penalty for a Sum of money.</p>
                     <p>About the beginning of <hi>July</hi> in the parts of <hi>Erzrum, Morat</hi> made a general review and Muster of his whole Army; with which those he brought from <hi>Constantinople</hi> joyned to Recruits by the way, and those Forces which had waged War in <hi>Persia</hi> amounted to near the number of three hundred thousand fighting men, but such as were admirably well disciplined, not only by the severity of their Soveraign, but by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample he shewed them of frugality and patience: for he often marched afoot in the midst of the heats, he was extremely temperate in his diet, though he was naturally of a gluttonous and luxurious palate; for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <note place="margin">The Grand Signiors pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</note> months he made use of no other Pillow for his head than his Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, nor other Blanket or Quilt than the Covering or Foot-cloth of his Horse. Being arrived near to the City of <hi>Revan</hi> he bestowed that lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gess on the Souldiery of a Dollar a man, which is accustomary to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at all times, when the Grand Signior marches in person, and then made known to them his intentions of besieging that place; and in case he took it not in the space of ten days, that then he would leave it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girt with forty thousand men; and dividing his Army into three Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, he would enter the bowels of <hi>Persia</hi> by divers ways. The Tents of the Grand Signior and of all the Camp were pitched, Batteries raised, the Trenches opened, and all matters laid in the formal manner of a Siege. The Garrison within commanded by Emir <hi>Gumir</hi> consisted of <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Revan</hi> betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by Emir <hi>Gumir.</hi>
                        </note> fifteen thousand men, sitted and provided with all sorts of Ammunition, and wanted neither courage nor provisions; howsoever at the end of nine days the City was surrendred to the Sultan, upon terms of quarter to the whole Garrison both for life and freedom of Estate; and because this Governour Emir <hi>Gumir,</hi> a principal Noble-man of <hi>Persia,</hi> had by corruption thus voluntarily delivered up the City, he acquired a place of high grace and esteem in the favour of the Grand Signior, to which his courtly manner of indulging his humor, and complying with him in his Wine and Feasts (to which the joy of this present success priviledged him to return) gave him daily a new Title to receive extraordinary Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours from him. The news of this prosperous success was posted to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> as the first essay of the good effects of the Sultan's presence, and was there celebrated with Feasts, Joy, and Lights, according to the Turkish fashion, called <hi>Danalma;</hi> to perform which the Turks obliged <note place="margin">Rejoycing and a Festival kept for it at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople.</hi>
                        </note> likewise the Christian Ambassadours, saying, that if they were friends, they ought to evidence their satisfaction by demonstrations of joy in the prosperity of their Ally: the Festival was kept for the space of four days, during which two Brothers of the Sultan, <hi>viz.

The Turk entring farther into <hi>Persia,</hi> inconsiderately fell into an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bush, where twelve thousand of their men were defeated; howsoever the remainder of the Army not being discouraged with this Encounter, proceeded on their March, making most miserable havock and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of all before them, carrying that dread and terrour to the Countries round, that all people fled, leaving their houses and things <note place="margin">The Turks en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter farther into <hi>Persia.</hi>
                        </note> not portable to the possession of the Enemy. Howsoever the Turks found greater difficulties than they expected; for meeting frequently Parties of the Persian Cavalry, which were practised to manage their Horse and Sword, were often defeated, at least endured and sustained the shock of bloody Skirmishes; and then the Persians retiring into the Mountains known to them, but unknown to the Turks, which served them better than fortified places, returned again when any advantage or Booty appeared, which perpetually vexed and wearied the Enemy; and burning all things which might afford them relief, rendred that fruitful Country more desolate and barren than the Desarts of <hi>Libya,</hi> or the Sands of <hi>Arabia.</hi> In this manner the Turkish Army being destitute of all sorts of provisions and refreshments, were forced to retire to the Country of <hi>Tauris;</hi> which being harassed and impoverished like other Provinces, caused a miserable famine in the Camp, whereby multitudes of Horses and Camels perished for want of nutriment; at which the Grand Signior being highly incensed against the Inhabitants of <hi>Tauris,</hi> committed their City to the will and mercy of the Souldiery, who having <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Tauris</hi> destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> pillaged and sacked it, left it a miserable spectacle of fire and sword.</p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Persia</hi> seeing in what manner the Troops of his Enemy were wearied and consumed, took hold of this opportunity as seasonable to propose certain Articles of Peace by an Ambassadour, to which <hi>Morat</hi> seemed to incline a flexible ear; but lodging his Souldiers in their Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-quarters in the parts of <hi>Damascus</hi> and <hi>Aleppo,</hi> he took his way towards <hi>Constantinople,</hi> with intention to ease the hardships and labours of the Summers War, by a voluptuous ease and Winters pastime in the delights and softness of the Seraglio. The 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>December</hi> he arrived at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> having passed from <hi>Ismit</hi> through the Gulph of <hi>Nicomedia</hi> with the attendance of fourteen Gallies: he made his Entry by the Jews Gate, and not by that of <hi>Adrianople,</hi> as was accustomary; he was mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on one of the best of his Horses, and cloathed with a Coat of Mail, a Casket on his head with three Feathers adorned with Pearls and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, his Sword was girt to his side with his Bow and Quiver, his beard was in a rough and neglected manner, which made him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more fierce and Martial; the Chimacam came after him, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the Traitor who surrendred <hi>Revan.</hi> This Festival for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn <note place="margin">Festival for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the G. Signior.</note> was celebrated for the space of a whole week, during which time the Shops were shut, the doors and outsides adorned with green Boughs and Paintings, and by night the streets with Torches were made as clear as the day: howsoever the people secretly murmured, that the War was not prosecuted, and the advantages taken when Fortune began to smile and favour their Enterprises; and that now desisting in the middle way, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1636"/> the work was again to be begun, and all the foregoing blood and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure was spent and consumed to no purpose: these murmurings of the people were not without some ground and cause; for after the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Grand Signior, the Persians put themselves again into the field, and recovered the Country which they had lost; and having
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98602:35"/>
offered a Sum of money to <hi>Mortesa</hi> Pasha to surrender <hi>Revan;</hi> which he refusing to accept on principles of fidelity and honour, they prepared to lay close siege to the place: the Janisaries were also displeased to see themselves neglected, and cast out of the Guard, and their places sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the Bostangees; nor less disgusted were the Lawyers to see se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of their Judges and Kadies hanged, and their heads cut off, upon pretence of Sedition and Faction. His ill humor more increased to the height of Tyranny, by reason of certain twinges which he suffered of the Gout, which is not usual in persons of his age, not surpassing twenty six years; and because his Physician a Jew forbid him wholly to drink wine, as poison to his disease and complexion, he was so enraged, that he drove him from his presence with indignation, and immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived such anger and prejudice against the whole Nation, that he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their Houses to be searched, and their Jewels taken from them. But what was most strange, was his horrid aversion to Tabaco, the taking <note place="margin">His aversion to Tabaco.</note> of which by any person whatsoever he forbid upon pain of death; which sentence he so rigorously executed, that he caused the legs and arms of two men, one that sold Tabaco, and the other that took it, to be sawed off, and in that manner exposed to the view of the people: he also caused two others, a man and a woman to be impaled alive, for the same offence, with a Roll of Tabaco about their necks.</p>
                     <p>As the Gout caused him to be froward and ill-natur'd, so more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when ill News came from <hi>Persia,</hi> he was observed to be more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and tyrannical than ever: his Army in <hi>Persia</hi> wanting provisions disbanded; <hi>Mortesa</hi> Pasha Governour of <hi>Revan</hi> being killed, the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Revan</hi> regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian.</note> rebel, open the Gates, and yield themselves to the Persian; for which offence the Janisaries fearing the Justice of their Master the Grand Signior, two thousand of them took up Arms in service of the Enemy: the sense hereof vexing <hi>Morat</hi> to the soul, he caused the Register of the Janisaries to be hanged, and another of their principal Officers to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, <note place="margin">The Grand Signiors seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> and strowed the streets of <hi>Constantinople</hi> with dead bodies, some for one cause, and some for another, which struck the whole City with a general dread and consternation. He often walked in the night, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing quarrels and disorders of the streets, and meeting two women wandring in the dark, he caused them to be cut in pieces. He put his Cook to death for not dressing his Meat well, or not seasoning his Sauces according to his palate. In his Seraglio sporting with his Arms, he wounded himself with a Dart in the thigh; and by accident wounded the Son of <hi>Mehmet</hi> the late Vizier with a Carbine-shot, of which in a short time after he dyed.</p>
                     <p>The Persian having taken <hi>Revan</hi> (as we have said) instituted Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Janisaries in that place after the Turkish fashion, paying them in the same form as at <hi>Constantinople;</hi> and to allure the Spahees to enter into his Service, he offered to all that came in twelve Aspers a day of constant Pay, and declared, That their Faith and Law had no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from the Mahometan. The Grand Signior receiving these Advices with extreme indignation, proclaimed his intentions to return again into <hi>Persia;</hi> and though the design pleased not the Militia, who were weary of the War, yet his power was too great to be resisted, and his humors too violent to be diverted by sober counsels; for having subjected and absolutely subdued the insolence of the Souldiers, and suppressed the arrogance of the Lawyers and Church-men, he ordered every thing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98602:36"/>
to his arbitrary and uncontroulable pleasure, which being ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred extravagant and unsupportable, by reason that in his Cups, and at the time of his debauchery he would often take his Counsels and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine his resolutions, were notwithstanding with more patience endured upon hopes that they would not be lasting, and that excesses would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celerate his death, and the end of their oppressions. The Pasha's of greatest note and richess he put to death, and consiscated their Estates to his Exchequer; and whereas avarice and cruelty were equally predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant in his nature, there was scarce a day wherein he made not some demonstration of those dispositions: the English Ambassadour making some instances for the releasement of English Slaves from Captivity, was forced to purchase their liberty by giving two Russians, or other Slaves in the place of one English-man. He took a singular delight to sit in a Chiosk by the Sea-side, and from thence to shoot at the people with his Bow and Arrows, as they rowed near the Banks of the Seraglio, which caused the Boat-men afterwards to keep themselves at a distance from the Walls of the Seraglio. And as he likewise took pleasure to go from one Garden to another on the <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> so if he observed any so bold, as to put forth his head to see him pass, he commonly made him pay the price of his curiosity by a shot from his Carbine. In all his Gardens and places of pleasure his chief recreation was drinking, in which his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal or almost sole Companions were Emir <hi>Gumir</hi> the Persian who betrayed <hi>Revan,</hi> and a Venetian of the Family of <hi>Bianchi,</hi> who having been taken by the Turks, when he was young, was placed in the Seraglio, and educated in all the Learning and Customs of it, and becoming as well a Proficient in drinking, as in other vices, he was made a Favourite and Companion to <hi>Morat.</hi> And thus did they follow this trade of drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness so constantly, that the health of the Grand Signior began to impair, and at length he became so sensible of his extravagancies, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the Chimacam not to obey him after dinner: and when in the heat of his Wine he took a humor to ride through the streets, the Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries and Officers would sometimes run before to advise the people to withdraw, and sometimes drive them away with stones, that so they might escape the hazard of this capricious Tyrant. As it cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in what dread and fear the people stood of him, so neither in what Veneration he was with his Servants, who observed the looks and every cast of his eyes, had learned his nods, and the meaning of every motion and gesture of his body. It happened once, that a paper falling casually from his hand out of a window, the Pages ran in all haste down the stairs, striving who should be the first to take it up; but one more desirous than the others to evidence the zeal of his service, took the nearest way and leaped out of the window; and though with the fall he broke the bone of his thigh, yet being the first that took up the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he came halting to present it with his own hand: this bold readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in his service so pleased the Grand Signior, that being cured, he was afterwards preferred to one of the most considerable Offices of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Thus was <hi>Morat</hi> revered in his Seraglio, as he was feared abroad, his Servants having the same awe of him, as <hi>Bagotes</hi> the Eunuch had of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, who holding the Pot of Incense and Perfumes whilst his Master slept, suffered his hands to burn to the bone, rather than to awaken him by moving out of his place. <hi>Q.

of <hi>Morat,</hi> and to return to the Wars in <hi>Persia;</hi> howsoever before the departure of the Grand Signior, it will be requisite to recount somewhat of the state of affairs in <hi>Europe.</hi> On the Frontiers of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Disturbances in <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Hungary.</hi>
                        </note> there wanted not Exercises and Skirmishes to employ and practise the Souldiery, and keep them in breath. The Poles heightned with their good successes, would not longer endure the Incursions of the Tartars, complaining against the Turk, that he had given Orders, and secretly abetted them in their Robberies and Invasions against the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the last Peace; and therefore to avenge themselves, the Poles appeared on the Frontiers with forty or fifty thousand Horse; but the Grand Signior not willing in this conjuncture to break with the Poles, absolutely disowned any such Order or permission given to the Tartars, and being willing to continue the League, that he might oblige the <note place="margin">The Turks confirm the Peace with <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
                        </note> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> gave liberty to all the people of that Nation, and to the Russians, who had been taken since the last Treaty, positively pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting all people from buying or keeping any of the Subjects of that Country for Slaves, during the continuance of this Peace. In <hi>Hungary,</hi> though the Ambassadour had but lately brought a Confirmation of tho Peace from <hi>Constantinople;</hi> yet the Turks pretending that the Articles were not complied with, continued to trouble and disturb those Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers; for four thousand of them being gotten into a Body burnt certain Villages, made divers Slaves, and battered the Castle of <hi>Raab;</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repulsed by that Garrison, and by that of <hi>Komorra,</hi> they again made Head, and encamped within three leagues of <hi>Presbourg:</hi> the which gave great trouble to the Emperour, both because he had lately declared a War against <hi>France;</hi> and because he apprehended, that those Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Turks were designed to no other end, than to engage him <note place="margin">Send Forces against <hi>Ragot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ski.</hi>
                        </note> to renounce all assistance and succour to be given unto <hi>Ragotski.</hi> We have already recounted in what manner the Turks had espoused the quarrel of <hi>Stephen Gabor,</hi> and resolved to establish him in the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality of <hi>Transylvania</hi> with the ruine of <hi>Ragotski;</hi> which now being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to be done by open Force, several Troops were sent to the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of <hi>Transylvania;</hi> which so alarmed the Hungarians, that they put themselves on their Guard, and obliged the Estates of <hi>Austria</hi> and <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> to contribute towards the succour of the Transylvanian Prince. The Emperour remained long in suspense what course to steer, until at length the perswasions of the Confederate Princes, the shame of abandoning a Friend and an Ally for a prey to the Turks, and the fear of displeasing his hereditary Dominions in <hi>Hungary,</hi> who considered <hi>Transylvania</hi> as the Bulwark of their Country, induced him to promise secretly and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand assistance to <hi>Ragotski.</hi> As to the Turks themselves, the effects did not correspond with their menaces; for though they had gathered an Army of twenty thousand men at <hi>Buda,</hi> they not only were disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their design upon <hi>Newhausel,</hi> but were openly repulsed, and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully expelled the Frontiers by the Palatine of <hi>Hungary:</hi> and <hi>Ragotski</hi> being recruited by Succours from the Emperour, and by an Alliance with <hi>Poland</hi> desied the Forces of the Turk, and contemned the reports of sixty thousand men, preparing to march against him.</p>
                     <p>For indeed the Grand Signior had too great an incumbrance on his shoulders by the War in <hi>Persia,</hi> to attend unto a perfect and studied re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge against <hi>Ragotski;</hi> for <hi>Revan</hi> being recovered by the Persian, (as we have already declared) was a matter of high moment, and what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98602:37"/>
all his counsels and weakened his hopes. When News came first of the Siege of <hi>Revan,</hi> Orders were given to the Vizier to besiege <hi>Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat,</hi> as a means to cause a diversion of Arms; but the Souldiery enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <note place="margin">Mutiny in the Turkish Army.</note> an aversion to this Enterprise, unanimously refused to march, or to proceed farther than <hi>Erzrum. Jambolat Ogli,</hi> who commanded the Army before the arrival of the Vizier, had strangled a Pasha, and taken his Estate to supply the wants of the Army, and had likewise put to death several Spahees and Janisaries for Mutiny, and because they had declared an unwillingness to this War. The Souldiery prepared to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress themselves to the Vizier for justice against these violent proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; but he not willing to hear them, endeavoured to divert their complaints, which caused a greater commotion and storm than before. And though <hi>Jambolat</hi> pleaded his Orders and positive Commission from the Grand Signior for what he had acted; yet that allegation not being accepted by the multitude as a justifiable plea, the Vizier was forced to condescend to their desire, and strangle <hi>Jambolat,</hi> as he had done the others, being the only means to quiet and compose this trouble of his Army. But as after some great storm there is always remaining for a while a swelling and fluctuation in the waters, so there still remained on the spirits of the Souldiery discontents and unquietness of mind: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Vizier fearing lest the Enemy taking advantage of the present Seditions, should charge them at a time of disorder, he retired at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from them into the Plains of <hi>Erzrum:</hi> but he was not able to continue long in those parts for want of fuel, and of wood and planks to secure them against the rains and snow; for it being Winter, which is rigorous and cold in that Country, their Tents were not sufficient proof to defend them against the extremity of the weather.</p>
                     <p>Whilst the Turkish Army remained at this place, advice came, that the Persians had besieged <hi>Van,</hi> which is a strong Fortress situate on an inaccessible Rock on the Frontiers of the Province of <hi>Diarbequir.</hi> And <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Van</hi> befieged by the Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> though the Persians were not able to take this place neither by storm nor famine; yet during this Siege they made use of their time to ruine all the Country of <hi>Diarbequir,</hi> which they left so desolate, that the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish Army could not quarter there, nor extract the least provision or subsistence from thence. To all these misfortunes a greater was added by the treachery of a certain <hi>Curd,</hi> one who pretending to be ill-satisfied with the Persian Party, voluntarily offered himself to the service of the Turks; and having done them some little services by being their guide through certain difficult passages, he gained a confidence so far with them, as that designing to surprise a quarter of the Enemy, they committed themselves to his guidance and conduct; who having brought them into <note place="margin">Fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Turks kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bush.</note> a narrow passage, where an Ambush of the Enemy lay, he then turned his Coat, and fought against the Turks, of whom fifteen thousand were killed and taken in this snare. In short, all matters of this War proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cross and unfortunate for the Turks; for besides their unlucky Fights with the Enemy, their own Seditions in the Camp were greater mischiefs; <note place="margin">Mutiny of the Souldiers.</note> for now enduring no longer these pungent miseries, under the pretence of wanting Pay, they cut in pieces the Treasurer of the Army, two Aga's of the Spahees, and the Chaousbashee of the Janisaries.</p>
                     <p>This News arriving at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> when <hi>Morat</hi> was asslicted with a grievous accession of the Gout, served to redouble his pains, in which raving against the conduct of his Officers, he immediately deprived the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98602:37"/>
Vizier of his Charge, and ordained <hi>Biram</hi> Pasha, late Chimacam, to succeed him in his Employment. The new Vizier immediately set forth the Horses Tail, which is a signal of departure, with sound of Drums <note place="margin">A new Vizier sent to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> and Trumpets, making Corban, which is a distribution of Mutton to the poor, in divers places: his Retinue was speedily equipped with such sumptuous Magnificence, that it looked rather like the Train of an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour, which intended to make Peace, than to the Troops of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, whose business was nothing but blood and destruction. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed matters seemed to be inclining that way, the Persians having far advanced in this Negotiation; for they wisely pondering the immense Force of the Ottoman Empire, with which they were now contending, judged it the most politick course to make Peace under the auspicious Planet of their good Fortune; for not knowing how long that might remain constant, they might so soon as the wheel turns on the other side, be forced to accept terms of less advantage, than at present they might promise to themselves under their happy Stars. Wherefore a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position being made of sending an Ambassadour to the Grand Signior, he accepted of it; and accordingly arrived at <hi>Constantinople</hi> in the <note place="margin">A Persian Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour sent to the Grand Signior.</note> month of <hi>August,</hi> when the Vizier was scarce in the middle of his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. The Grand Signior entertaining some real inclinations to Peace, laid aside something of his usual Grandeur and State, giving the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour Audience in a few days after his arrival: and as nothing mollifies the hard mettle of a Turks spirit, like a gentle shower of Gold, and the emulgent softness of rich Presents; so <hi>Morat</hi> understanding of Gifts with which he came accompanied, afsorded to the Ambassadour an easie ear and a pleasing countenance. The Presents for the Grand Signior, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides those for the Court, were these that follow.

                           <item>An hundred and fifty Meticals of Musk. As much Ambergriese made up in several Bags, all sealed up with the Kings own Seal.</item>
                           <item>Thirty Bundles of the best black Sables.</item>
                           <item>Eight large Carpets mixed with Gold and Silver, with divers others of Silk very rare and precious.</item>
                           <item>Many Pieces of the finest Linen to make Turbants.</item>
                           <item>A great number of the rarest Girdles. Porceline to a great value.</item>
                           <item>Divers Pieces of Satin and Velvet with golden Flowers.</item>
                           <item>Fifty Pieces of silken Stuffs.</item>
                           <item>Eight Bows of excellent work.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>These Presents so well disposed and prepared the mind of the Grand Signior towards an Accommodation, that he bestowed a kind aspect and gentle words on the Ambassadour, so that all the World expected that a Peace would have ensued.</p>
                     <p>And indeed one might well have believed his reality in this intention, since the ardent passion he had to be revenged of <hi>Ragotski,</hi> availed more with him than all other considerations in the world: his Honour also cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to give a stop to the progress of the Moscovites, who had taken <hi>Asac;</hi> and the Tartars and Cosacks gave some ground of jealousie, that before long they designed some Action on the Turkish Territories, the reasons whereof we shall discourse in this following Year.</p>
                     <p>We have already related some Years past, on what Terms the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars stood with the Turk, how they refused to accept that King which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1637"/>
                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:98602:38"/>
the Port recommended to them, though the eldest and first of the true Line; how they fought and overthrew the Forces which the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior sent to compel them to the Election he desired, and this last Year <note place="margin">Troubles in the lesser <hi>Tartary.</hi>
                        </note> upon pretence of a War with <hi>Cantemir</hi> they refused to send their Army against the Persian, as had always been accustomary to do against the Enemies of the Sultan, whensoever required. The Pasha, Muftee and Kadi of <hi>Caffa</hi> (which is the Grand Signior's Town in <hi>Tartary</hi>) urged the Tartar <hi>Han</hi> to prepare and forward his Forces according to the duty and obligation which was incumbent on him; and enlivening their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments with reproaches of cowardise and ingratitude, so far provoked the <hi>Han,</hi> that he caused them all three to be strangled. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this high provocation, the Grand Signior dissembled the injury, lest a due resentment should raise them into an open Rebellion; and dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling an approbation of the Fact, as done with reason and justice, sent to the Tartar <hi>Han</hi> a Sword and a Vest, as signals of his favour: and farther suspecting, lest in prosecution of so sensible a blow, the Tartar joyning in League with the Cosacks and Moscovites, should make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Master of <hi>Caffa,</hi> he prudently touched the wound with a gentle hand, offering to ordain such a Pasha, as should be warranted with his assent and approbation. The Tartar being overcome by such lenitives as these, protested that he never entertained other thoughts, than to maintain his Faith and Allegiance inviolable towards the Grand Signior, and that the Alliance he had made with the <hi>Nogay</hi> Tartars, and the Forces now raised were maintained with no other design, than to suppress the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion and insolence of <hi>Cantemir.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Cantemir</hi> being a person of a bold spirit, and daring in all his actions, did oftentimes, by virtue of his own Authority, lead a strong Party to the field, being followed by the bravest and stoutest Souldiers of <hi>Tartary;</hi> for which reason being hated by the Tartar <hi>Han,</hi> and his life often attempted, and his own spirit not supporting a subjection to <note place="margin">

In a short time divers chief Captains being desirous to follow the Ensigns of so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous a General came in to him, and multitudes of people forsaking the sands and barren rocks of <hi>Tartary,</hi> came crowding into this Country, that the Plains of <hi>Budziack</hi> not being capable to contain them, they passed into <hi>Moldavia,</hi> where incroaching on the Lands of the proper Inhabitants, gave a jealousie as if they intended to take possession of the whole Province. The Poles being jealous of these ill Neighbours which lay at the Gate of their Country ready to enter on all occasions, had made provision in their last Articles of Peace with the Grand Signior, that he should force them to return, and urged that point by the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour with all earnestness. The Tartar <hi>Han</hi> also finding his Countries depopulated and weakened by so large an evacuation, male also his complaints and addresses to the Port: but the Grand Signior looking on this Colony, as an increase of his Dominions, and to be composed of such people whom necessity must render obedient; and that they could easily at his command make irruptions into <hi>Poland, Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Transylvania,</hi> seemed deaf to all applications in this business; and as if they were a people in whom he had no part, shewed no concernment for them,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98602:38"/>
though secretly he promised them his protection. Hereupon <hi>Vladislaus</hi> King of <hi>Poland</hi> being wearied with delays, resolved by force of Arms to drive out this detestable Neighbourhood: but the Tartar <hi>Han</hi> whom this business more nearly concerned, being more speedy in execution <note place="margin">He is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by the Tartar <hi>Han.</hi>
                        </note> than the Poles, having raised an Army of thirty thousand men, encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <hi>Cantemir</hi> with twenty thousand, and charged him so furiously, that he killed seven thousand of them on the place, and put the rest to flight, pursuing them through the Plains of <hi>Dobruc</hi> on the other side of the <hi>Danubc.</hi> The Grand Signior who had all this time remained a Spectator of this success, began now to take the part of <hi>Cantemir,</hi> and severely to reprove the proceedings of the Tartar <hi>Han,</hi> for having disturbed <hi>Cantemir</hi> whilst he was preparing to serve him in the Wars of <hi>Persia.</hi> But the Tartar <hi>Han</hi> having shaken off much of his respect and reverence towards the Grand Signior, despised the menaces which he vented against him, and proceeded in his own business, compelling his people to return again to their Country, and to their ancient Habitations. <hi>Morat</hi> being forced to suffer what he could not remedy, summoned <hi>Cantemir</hi> with all diligence to render himself at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where being arrived, he was at first regarded with a favourable eye; but his Son soon after having in a private quarrel killed a Tartar near the Walls of the Seraglio, was for that fact justly strangled by Order of the Grand Signior; the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Cantemir</hi> was also imprisoned, and in a short time underwent the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Cantemir</hi> put to death.</note> like Fate with that of his Son.</p>
                     <p>During these troubles a Nephew of <hi>Cantemir</hi> feigning himself to be disgusted with his Uncle, revolted to the Party of the Tartar <hi>Han</hi> with no other than a treacherous design to take away the lives of the two Brothers; the which he compassed at a time of their Hunting, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing far remote from their Attendance, following their Game in untrod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den paths, he set upon them with an hundred Villains, and perfidiously <note place="margin">The King of <hi>Tartary</hi> killed.</note> took away their lives. The News hereof was highly applauded at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> and the Traitor extolled as a person of mighty courage and wonderful ingenuity, so that now different counsels and new measures were taken concerning the Affairs in <hi>Tartary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Beehir Gherey</hi> Brother to those Princes of <hi>Tartary</hi> which were killed, was then at <hi>Jamboli,</hi> a City in <hi>Thrace,</hi> retired thither under the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Grand Signior, for fear and jealousie of treachery from his <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Beehir Gherey</hi> ordained King of <hi>Tartary.</hi>

The bodies of the two dead Brothers were brought to <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> where fetulent or stinking, they were exposed to the sight of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi> who to gratifie his own humor of revenge, caused them to be thrown into the Sea.</p>
                     <p>This good News from <hi>Tartary</hi> was attempered with a worse from <hi>Asac.,</hi> which the Moscovites and Cosacks had besieged. This Town is situated <note place="margin">

Before it fell into the hands of the Turks, it was a famous Scale for all sorts of Merchandise, especially for Butter, Cheese, salt Fish, Leather, Slaves, and other Commodities brought hither by Turks, Tartars, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98602:39"/>
Moscovites. The Venetians when they addicted themselves more to Traffick and Commerce than they do at present, took this Scale for their way into <hi>Persia.</hi> This Town was fortified with ancient Walls flank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with capacious Towers, and with a Castle which being in the middle and on the side of the Water, divides the Town as it were into two equal parts. The Garrison consisted not of above three or four hundred men; for being a place remote from powerful Enemies, it fell not under any great jealousie, nor was it deemed worthy the charge of nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous defendants. The City being in this weak condition, the Cosacks soon made themselves Masters of it, which after they had sacked and pillaged to the utmost, they considered it as a place worthy of better Fortifications; and therefore applying themselves to raise new Works, and repair the old, they soon made it a Fortress of strength and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. <note place="margin">Is taken by the Cosacks.</note> This happening at a time, when the Turks were diverted by the Persian War, the Cosacks injoyed this new Conquest for the space of four years without molestation, until that in the Year 1641. it was recovered with much blood and slaughter by the Arms of Sultan <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,</hi> as we shall hereafter recount in the sequel of this History. And now because the taking of this place was the original from whence the Divisions and Civil Wars between the Poles and Cosacks derived their beginning, and was the occasion that the Cosacks revolted from their just Obedience, to the Protection of the Turks; the relation will not only be curious, but a digression necessary to the clearer light of the present History.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Uladislaus</hi> the Fourth King of <hi>Poland</hi> being wearied with constant <note place="margin">The cause of the Civil War between the Poles and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacks.</note> complaints of the Robberies and Incursions made by the Cosacks upon the Turks contrary to Articles and Treaties of Peace, was at length per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded by his Barons and Counsellors, that the only means to suppress the violence of this unruly people, was to disarm them; and taking away their Weapons of War to supply them in lieu thereof with the Shovel and Mattock, with Ploughs and Pruning-Hooks: by which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious diversion from a wicked life of blood and robbery, to honest Husbandry and lawful Arts of living, they might with time be rendred useful to their own Prince, and capable of faith and just communication with their Neighbours. It is not one Age past since these people were <note place="margin">The Cosacks Country de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</note> called Cosacks, derived, as is supposed, from <hi>Cosai,</hi> a word in their Language which signifies a Goat, perhaps because of their agility of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or because their garments are chiefly made of Goats skins.

At present the name of Cosacks and their Country also is of a far greater extent than it was formerly; for they call now all such in <hi>Poland</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacks that are light Horse armed with Bow and Arrow and Fire-arms: and their Country since the late Commotions is measured from the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest parts of the Palatinate of <hi>Chiovia</hi> for the space of an hundred and twenty leagues on one side, and the other of the <hi>Boristhenes,</hi> which comprehends likewise all the Country of <hi>Ukrania.</hi> This Country was always inhabited by the most warlike people of <hi>Russia;</hi> for that being subject to the frequent Incursions of the Tartars, necessary defence and constant practice in Arms endued them with a bold and Martial spirit. <hi>Ukrania</hi> is a Country so fertile, that it may compare with the most fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful soil in the World, producing such quantities of Corn with little la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, that the Husband-men being made negligent by their abundance, produced with little toil, have leisure to apply themselves to violence and rapine: they have no Wine, but use themselves much to Strong-waters: their houses are not built of wood or stone, but of Osiers inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven and daubed over with Earth and Lime; so that they use no nails or iron: they have no Merchants unless in <hi>Kiow:</hi> nor do they serve themselves of Physicians or Aporhecaries. Their learned Language or the Tongue wherein they write is the Sclavonian, anciently called the Illyrian: so that in all things this people is rude and barbarous; and though their manner of Government and Policy is not refined or metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically disposed, yet nevertheless it is solid and of deep foundation, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the nature and disposition of that people.</p>
                     <p>This honest design of King <hi>Uladislaus</hi> to reduce this people to a just and an industrious course of living, not agreeing with their temper and customs, they rather resolved to leave their Country, and betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to various fortunes; some of them passed into <hi>Moscovia</hi> to plant a Colony in those uninhabited parts: a Body of them to the number of six thousand joyning together, resolved to pass into <hi>Persia</hi> to offer their service unto that King; and being on their Journey as far as the <hi>Tanais,</hi> they encountred with a Party of Moscovite Cosacks, who inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited certain Islands of that River, with whom entertaining discourse, they understood that <hi>Asac</hi> might easily be surprised by them, if they could agree to unite Forces, which together might compose a Body of ten thousand men: the importance of the place being well considered, it was resolved, that the March into <hi>Persia</hi> should be shortned, and this City be ordained for the ultimate end of their travels and place of repose. According to this counsel <hi>Asac</hi> being assaulted and taken, (as we have already intimated) the Cosacks fortified it in the best manner that they were able, making an Arsenal for their Boats and Saiks, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by afterwards they did much more infest the Turks than before.</p>
                     <p>The other Cosacks who continued in their Country, being much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98602:40"/>
by the Polish Nobility, chose <hi>Kilminieschi</hi> for their General (the Son of a Noble Family in <hi>Lituània,</hi> but banished and degraded of his Honour for his criminal offences) and rebelled against the Government. At sirst not being able to resist the Force of <hi>Poland,</hi> they retired within the Woods; but joyning afterwards with other Cosacks, they issued forth at the beginning of the Spring, beat the Poles, and carried away a considerable Booty: afterwards joyning with the Tartars, they made their Incursions as far as <hi>Zamosca</hi> within twenty leagues of <hi>Warsaw;</hi> and so matters continued with various successes not appertaining to this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story. Only thus far it is pertinent to the matter discussed for us to have shewn, That the Counsels of <hi>Poland</hi> were in a great errour, when they resolved to change the life, and alter the humour of this warlike people, which being protected in their Priviledges, and encouraged in their Wars, would at all times, as occasion served, have been ready to have ejected great numbers of good Souldiers into the Ottoman Territories, and might still have been conserved to balance the Power of the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, which now daily infest and ruine the Borders of <hi>Poland.</hi> These people were like ill humors, which being vomited out into the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Turk, eased and made healthy the Body politick of <hi>Poland;</hi> but being conserved within the stomach, caused Syncopes, Convulsions, and such Commotions, as have of late years shaken the whole Body of the Polish Kingdom: and at length withdrawing themselves entirely from all Obedience, together with that large Province of <hi>Ukrania,</hi> as they have weakened that Government; so now of late years seeking protection from the Turk, have added to his Kingdom, and enfeebled that of <hi>Poland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the News arrived first at <hi>Constantinople</hi> that <hi>Asac</hi> was besieged, the Captain-Pasha going then to instate <hi>Bechir</hi> into his Kingdom of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi> received Orders to relieve <hi>Asac,</hi> and if possible, to raise the Siege; but the Succours coming too late, and the Town being taken, the loss thereof was not esteemed important enough to divert either thoughts or Forces from the Persian War.</p>
                     <p>For now <hi>Morat</hi> resolving to prosecute the War in <hi>Persia,</hi> which could not be successful without the united Power of his whole Empire, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by his own person, he resolved to make a second journey into <note place="margin">Preparations for the War in <hi>Persis.</hi>
                        </note> those parts, and with his own hand to knock at the Gates of <hi>Babylon.</hi> To prepare and dispose all matters in order hereunto, he in the first place countermanded his Decree, which prohibited a farther increase of the number of Janisaries; for now being desirous to augment his Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the account of ancient Registers, he opened the Janisaries door, (as they call it) and enrolled six thousand more into that Order. To conserve still the Order of this Militia, he appointed Officers strictly and severely to take the Decimation of the Christian children in <hi>Europe,</hi> and lest (as was usual) they should be corrupted by the parents, who often give Presents, whereby to blind the eyes of the Ministers, that so they may oversee their children, or in lieu of the comliest and most fit for service, accept of the sickly and impotent, or such as are unworthy of the bread and education given them by the Sultan, he most severely injoyned this service, and under a thousand menaces encharged the care hereof to be executed without favour or partiality to any. He carefully reviewed the Books of the Timjar-Spahees, counting the number exactly that every Country yields, and comparing them with those mustered in the Field,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98602:40"/>
he consiscated the Lands of those that wanted, being forfeited for non-appearance: he would admit of no excuse or delay to the matter in hand. The Superintendant of the Ordinance but making a seruple about the proportion of some Guns, as too weighty and unwieldy for so long a March, lost his life for doubting or making a difficulty in what the Grand Signior proposed or designed. And that no commotions at home might divert or call him back before his business was perfected, he encharged his Pasha's of the Frontiers to live quietly with their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and to be sure to give no occasions of complaint, or cause for War during his absence, recommending to the prudence of the Pasha of <hi>Silistria</hi> the care of composing certain differences between the Princes of <hi>Moldavia</hi> and <hi>Valachia.</hi> Having secured matters as well as he could at home, he ordered the Horse-tail to be set forth at the gate of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van, and all Pasha's and Officers of the Army did the like at their own doors. His Troops began now to grow numerous; the Spahees and Timariots appointed for the Guard of the Grand Signior's Tents, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with other Cavalry which hold their Lands under Service, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto two hundred thousand. From the hundred seventy two Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Janisaries he drew forth thirty thousand. From the Topgees or Gunners, whereof there are no more than twelve hundred in their Chambers at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> yet make up twelve thousand in other parts, he drew out three thousand for the present Service. The Shepherds and Plough-men of <hi>Dulgaria</hi> made up twenty thousand, which with Water-bearers, Smiths, Bakers, Butchers, and all other Tradesmen which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Camp, were in vast numbers; so that the whole Army with the Attendants belonging thereunto were at a moderate calculate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to amount unto near five hundred thousand men, whereof three hundred thousand were fighting men.</p>
                     <p>The Pestilence which is the Epidemical disease of <hi>Turkie,</hi> and which abates the numbers and pride of that people, raged this year greatly in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and in the parts of <hi>Romagnia;</hi> it entred into the Seraglio, and amongst others took-away the only Son of the Grand Signior of two or three years old. This caused <hi>Morat</hi> to pass most part of the Summer at a Palace on the <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> where he recreated himself with his drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Companion the Persian Traitor, and hereby he contradicted the Proverb, That Princes love the Treason, but not the Traitor; for <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat</hi> it seems loved them both, entertaining this Fellow in his bosom: his Cloaths, his Garb, his Horses, and Equipage might rival with that of the <note place="margin">The extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant pleasures and cruelties of <hi>Morat.</hi>

Amongst his pastimes nothing was more pleasing than some divertisement acted with blood; he shot the Son of a Pasha with his Gun, for daring to approach near the walls of his Seraglio, supposing that he came with curiosity to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his pleasures and manner of voluptuous recreations; for the same reason he would have sunk a Boat laden with women, as it glided slowly by the banks of his Garden. He would himself behold two Thieves im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paled, which were condemned to die for robbing something out of his Seraglio: he commanded the Head of the Treasurer of <hi>Cyprus</hi> to be cut off in his presence; as also the Master of his Musick, for daring to sing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

certain Air which seemed Persian, and to praise the Valour of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Pasha of <hi>Temiswar</hi> he put to death at a full Divan, for fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unfortunately against <hi>Ragotski.</hi> To these severe Acts of Cruelty, which he called Justice, he added one not unpleasant. A certain Greek called <hi>Stridia Bei</hi> or Lord <hi>Oysters,</hi> who had been Prince of <hi>Valachia,</hi> and one whom we have before mentioned, having by his oppression and harassing that people amassed a considerable Sum of money, essayed a second time by force thereof to obtain the Principality, and making his offer and request before the Grand Signior, he was heard with some rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery; at length the Grand Signior told him, that he was too proud and aspiring, and therefore ordered the tips of his nose and ears to be cut off, telling him, that that was to clip the wings of his ambition. But that before his departure for <hi>Persia</hi> he might consummate his Acts of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, he practised one upon his Brother, a Youth of twenty two years of age, of great hopes and good endowments. He was conducted to the presence of his Brother at the Biram to pay his respects, as is usual at that Festival; and having performed the Ceremony, he enlarged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in high praises and admiration of the Grand Signior's Generosity and Bravery, who for recovery of <hi>Bagdat,</hi> was contented to expose his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to the inconveniences of a long Journey, and the dangers of a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous War, and that therein he equalled, if not surpassed the Glory of his Ancestors: which courtly and rational manner of discourse did not please <hi>Morat,</hi> but rather administred subject of jealousie, fearing that he knew too much, and that as he could speak well, so he might act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; wherefore the same day he caused him to be strangled, to the great sorrow of the people, and detestation of his abominable Tyranny: but to amuse the minds of the multitude, and cease their murmurings, he caused it to be divulged abroad, that fourteen of his Women in the Seraglio were with child; which was all false, there remaining none of the Ottoman Race besides his Brother Sultan <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> who was weak as well in body as Understanding, and whose imperfections secured and compounded for his life; and to suppress the discourse about his Brothers Murder, he changed it into a talk about his Preparations for War, and his departure for <hi>Persia.</hi> Wherefore the Fore-runners and Harbingers of the Army being sent away with Labourers to repair Bridges, and to level the ways for the more easie passage of the Cannon, <hi>Morat</hi> passed over to his Tents at <hi>Scutari</hi> cloathed in a Coat of Mail, and with a Head-piece set with precious Stones, and his Sargoutch or Feathers cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sped to it with Buckles of Diamonds. As he landed at <hi>Scutari</hi> he was received by three Squadrons of Souldiers, each Squadron consisting of four thousand men well armed, and richly attired; the garments of one Squadron of which were provided at the expence of the Grand Signior, and of the other two at the charge of his Favourite and of the Captain-Pasha; the latter of which presented to the Grand Signior thirty Purses of Money, for bestowing on him the honour to command that Gally which transported him to the Asian Coast. The Ambassadour sent from <hi>Persia</hi> was detained at <hi>Constantinople</hi> until this time, and after the Turkish fashion not permitted to depart at his own liberty; but being now or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to follow the Camp, his Port and Quarters were assigned, that so he might be a Spectator of that Tragedy which was now to be acted. All things were now disposed in good posture with much Solemnity in order to a March; the Conacks or days Journies with their places of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98602:41"/>
Quarters were laid out in an hundred and twenty days of March from <hi>Scutari</hi> to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and seventy days of Otorack or of repose: the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies with the gross Body of such an Army could not be long, and the joyning with other Forces in the way required leisure and time.</p>
                     <p>In short, the Horse, after the Turkish manner, having eaten their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1638"/> grass and been soiled, this powerful Army decamped from <hi>Scutari</hi> about the end of <hi>May.</hi> The sirst day of Otorack or repose was appointed at <note place="margin">The March of the Turkish Army.</note> 
                        <hi>Ismit,</hi> where the Grand Signior made a review of his Army; such as were aged, and unable to endure the fatigues of a long March he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed, giving them half Pay for their lives with the name of Otoracks, which is the same with <hi>Milites Emeriti</hi> amongst the Romans: with exact Order therefore and severe Discipline, to which their fierce Monarch had reduced them, marched this numerous Army; no Villages were abused, nor Country-people plundered, and all things were purchased with ready money: and the Grand Signior himself being rendred more gentle and tractable in the Field than in his Seraglio, heard all complaints, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed Justice with an equal and an impartial hand.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time at <hi>Constantinople</hi> due care was taken to keep things quiet and in order; the Bostangibashee like Lord High Chamberlain, had the Charge committed to him of the Seraglio and the Moveables of it; he frequently made his Rounds both by Sea and Land, punished those whom he found in Taverns; nor would he suffer any Candles to be lighted after two hours in the night: the Chimacam and the Captain-Pasha likewise executed their Offices with all care and severity in their respective stations.</p>
                     <p>At this time, to the great dissatisfaction of the Greek Nation, <hi>Cyril</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Cyrillus</hi> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled.</note> the Patriarch, who had been in <hi>England,</hi> and greatly affected with the Discipline of our Church, was deposed, imprisoned in the Seven Towers, and strangled: in his place one <hi>Carsila</hi> was ordained Patriarch, and his Commission or Baratz obtained from the Grand Signior at the expence of fifty thousand Crowns, one moity whereof was paid from <hi>Rome,</hi> the whole design against <hi>Cyrillus</hi> being managed by the Jesuits and other Religious living at <hi>Galata,</hi> who accused him before the Turks of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a secret correspondence with the Moscovites and Cosacks; for which losing his life, <hi>Carsila</hi> a pretended Friend to the Roman Faction was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted Patriarch.</p>
                     <p>The Grand Signior marching with his potent and numerous Army, all the world remained at a gaze what the issue would be of this mighty Enterprise; yet most were of opinion, that the Honour and Riches of the Ottoman Empire being now at stake, the War could not otherwise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude than with the Conquest of <hi>Babylon.</hi> All that could be feared was some diversion by the Christian Princes, who taking hold of the present conjuncture, should enter the Frontiers with a powerful Army, and thereby force the Sultan to return; but as to <hi>Poland</hi> the jealousie soon vanished. When the News came of a Civil War between the Poles and the Cosacks, and that ten thousand of the latter were slain in a Battel, this Intelligence came most seasonable and grateful to the Port, expecting now a Meslage from the Cosacks, desiring succour in their extremity; for such accidents as these have nourished the Turkish Interest, which hath grown out of the Civil discords of Christian Princes.</p>
                     <p>By this means as the apprehensions of War by Land ceased, so there appeared some clouds of storm at Sea, which doubtless might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced

a War with <hi>Venice,</hi> had the Turks been at leisure to attend it; for sixteen Gallies belonging to <hi>Algier, Tunis,</hi> and <hi>Biserta</hi> well armed with Slaves and Souldiers, and provided sufficiently with Cannon, Powder, <note place="margin">The Pirates of <hi>Algier</hi> and <hi>Tunis</hi> insest the Gulf of <hi>Venice.</hi>
                        </note> and Bullet, commanded by <hi>Ali Picenin,</hi> united together and formed a small Fleet, with design to rove over the Adriatick Sea, and infest the Coast of <hi>Italy.</hi> Their intentions were to plunder the Riches of <hi>Loretto;</hi> but being hindred by contrary Winds from entring so high into the Gulf, they made a descent in <hi>Puglia,</hi> and sacked all the Country of <hi>Nicotra,</hi> carrying away a great Booty, with Slaves, and amongst them several Nuns which they prostituted to their lust; thence they passed over to the side of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and in sight of <hi>Cataro</hi> took a Vessel, and made Prize of all Ships which they met in those Seas, the rumour of which made great noise over all <hi>Italy,</hi> the people exclaiming against their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for suffering their lives and Estates to remain subject to the petty Force of a few Pirates. For the Vessels of <hi>Malta</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi> were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, and roving after purchase in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> took little notice of what was acted in the Gulf. The Spaniards after their fashion were slow in arming, and spent the Summer in preparations, till the Pirates laden with Booty, were departed towards the Winter; so that none remained to take care of <hi>Italy</hi> and the Venetians Gulf, but <hi>Venice</hi> only, to whom the Dominion of those Seas are rightly appropriated. To sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press therefore the insolence of these Pirates, the Republick set forth a Fleet consisting of twenty eight Gallies and two Galleasses under the Command of <hi>Marin Capello,</hi> with Instructions to sink, burn, and destroy those Pirates, either in the open Seas, or in Harbour of the Turks; for that by the Articles of Peace between the Grand Signior and the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, it was agreed, That no Port or Harbour of his should be privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to afford entertainment or protection to any Free-booter or Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate of that nature. It happened about that time, that the Malteses and Florentines crusing in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> had done great mischief to the Turks in those Seas; to revenge which, and to prevent farther da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, the Captain-Pasha sent Orders to these Vessels of <hi>Barbary</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to come to his assistance; to which they were now more easily perswaded; for being already laden with Booty and Spoils, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented themselves with a change of their station: but to give a farewel to those parts, they first resolved to spoil and plunder <hi>Lissa aliàs Lesina,</hi> an Island belonging to the Republick; but being overtaken by the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian Fleet in their Voyage thither, near to <hi>Valona,</hi> a Port and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour belonging to the Turks, they put themselves under the defence of the Town and Castle, which received them willingly to their protection, notwithstanding all Articles and Agreements to the contrary. The Venetian Fleet saluted the Castle without a shot, desiring, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Capitulations of Peace the Pirates might be rejected, and <note place="margin">

                        </note> commanded to abandon their Port: in answer hereunto the Turks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with a shot, making known their intentions to defend their friends: wherefore the Venetians retiring at some distance came to an Anchor, designing to block up the Port. Many days had not passed before the Pirates endeavoured by help of their Oars and a gentle gale to make their escape; and being with the gray of the morning, advanced without the Port, they were espyed by the watchful Venetians, who dividing their Fleet into two Squadrons charged them with high courage; the Fight continued for the space of two hours, during all which time the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98602:42"/>
Castle of <hi>Valona</hi> fired at the Venetians, and shot down a Mast of one of the Galleasses, a splinter of which wounded <hi>Lorenzo Marcello</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander; at length five of the Gallies of the Pirates being disabled, and many of their people killed, they began to fly and retire again under the protection of the Town; as also did the Venetians to their place of Anchorage. A distinct Advice of all Particulars being dispatched to <hi>Venice,</hi> the Senate wrote to <hi>Capello,</hi> That since the respect which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick owes to the Ottoman Court was not unknown to him, he should by no means make any attempt against those Pirates upon the Land, but meeting them fairly at Sea, he ought then to make use of all the valour and force he was able. In the mean time the Duke of <hi>Medina las Torres</hi> Vice-King of <hi>Naples</hi> dispatched an Express to <hi>Capello,</hi> with Letters ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding the generosity of the design, wherein he was now engaged for the Glory of his Republick, and the common good of all Christendom, proffering to supply him with refreshments and Ammunition, and what else might supply his occasions; expecting that by such encouragement as this, he might be induced to assault the Enemies in <hi>Valona,</hi> without respect to the Grand Signior, or any inconveniences which might arise thereby. On the contrary the Governour of the Castle and Kadi of the Town wrote a Letter to <hi>Capello,</hi> putting him in mind, that he was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Grand Signior's Dominions, and that he should be careful how he offered any violence to those places, which would certainly prove a violation of the Peace, and be the Original of an inevitable War.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Capello</hi> had now lain a whole month before the Port, having all the time injoyed fair weather and a smooth Sea, against the hope and desire of the Turks, who expected, that by means of some storm the Enemy would be forced to remove their Quarters to some secure Harbour, and thereby afford them an opportunity to escape. But <hi>Capello</hi> growing weary of such tedious attendance, resolved to expect no longer, nor <note place="margin">He assaults them in the Port.</note> yet to lose the present advantage of rendring himself Master of the Vessels of the Enemy: wherefore dividing his Fleet into several Squadrons, he advanced near the Port, firing several shot at the Tents of the Pirates, of which one from a Galleass struck a Mosch; and arming with store of men the Galeotes and Brigantines they entred the Port, and to the asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment and vexation of the Turks possessed all the sixteen Vessels, and brought them to their Admiral: which though they had disfurnished of all their chief Booty, yet their Cannon and Arms remained, of which there were twelve Pieces of great Brass Guns, besides others of Iron, with divers Falcons and lesser Arms.</p>
                     <p>The Intelligence hereof being carried to <hi>Venice,</hi> Orders were given, that all the Vessels should be sunk in the Port of <hi>Corfu,</hi> excepting only the Admiral of <hi>Algier,</hi> which was to be brought to the Arsenal of <hi>Venice,</hi> there to remain as a Trophy of Victory, and for a perpetual Memory of this glorious Atchievement. Howsoever this Exploit was variously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted at <hi>Venice,</hi> and approved or disproved according to the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of humors. The younger men applauded it as an action of great Gallantry, excusing his transgression of the Senates Orders by a transport of passion and zeal towards his Country, and desire of Glory. But the Senators and men of mature Judgments highly resented this breach of their Orders, which as they are strictly enjoyned, so they expected that they should be punctually obeyed. That this action was a sufficient and just cause alone to kindle a War, and that it was a matter intolerable,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98602:43"/>
that a single Citizen should of his own head and humor presume to act such things, as must necessarily involve the Publick in a War contrary to their pleasure, and in opposition to their express commands. For which crime and other subsequent defaults <hi>Capello</hi> was afterwards forced to justifie himself, as will be signified in the sequel of this History.</p>
                     <p>The Particulars of this Advice were by an express Messenger dispatched to <hi>Luigi Contarini</hi> the Bailo or Ambassadour for the Venetians at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> a Person of great reputation and esteem, having been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant in the principal Courts of Christendom, and employed for the space of seven years at <hi>Munster,</hi> where he was assistant with the Nuntio <hi>Chigi</hi> afterwards <hi>Alexander</hi> VII. in the general Peace of <hi>Europe.</hi> The Turks also receiving this News aggravated to them with all the foul circumstances imaginable, the Chimacam immediately summoned the Bailo to Audience, and with an angry countenance began to exclaim: <q>That taking advantage of the Grand Signior's absence in remote parts, the Venetians had in a perfidious and hostile manner assaulted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed the Fleet of <hi>Barbary,</hi> which were his Subjects, and such as he had called to his assistance against the Corsaires of <hi>Malta</hi> and <hi>Ligorne.</hi> That being accidentally compelled by storm to enter into the Port of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona,</hi> they were forcibly taken thence, and violence offered to the Grand Signior's Port and Castle by way of a manifest and open breach. If this presumption were grounded on the long distance of the Grand Signior from these parts, the Venetians would do well to consider, how that they provoke an angry Prince, and one who esteems neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, hazards, nor labours to compleat his revenge. If this were a design to divert the Grand Signior's Arms from <hi>Persia,</hi> they would do well to consider, that the Sultan was not so far advanced, but that he could turn a currant, if he pleased, sufficient to drown, and in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant to overwhelm the Dominions of <hi>Venice;</hi> or could at least collect Forces from nearer parts able to revenge his quarrel, and vindicate his Honour from the disdain and scorn of such petty Neighbours.</q> 
                        <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Bailo or Ambassadour made this Reply:</hi> 
                        <q>That this Piratical peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was the same which the year before had landed in <hi>Candia,</hi> and made spoil of the Estates of the Inhabitants, and carried many of them into slavery; and not contented with this Booty they entred the Gulph, and penetrated into the very bowels of <hi>Italy,</hi> with design to sack and plunder the Island of <hi>Lissa,</hi> which was under the Dominion of the Republick. That the Venetian General friendly saluted the Castle of <hi>Valona,</hi> which was returned with several shots from thence; that had it been his intention to have attempted the Port in the beginning, he would not have lain thirty seven days in expectation of the forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming of those Pirates, it being only respect to the Grand Signior, which obliged him to that attendance. At length being wearied, and provoked by the insolence of that people, he forcibly entred the Port, knowing that by Capitulations with the Grand Signior, it was agreed, that all Ports should be forbidden, and that to these Pirates, unless they first gave security and caution not to injure and make Prize of the Subjects of the Republick. <hi>The Chimacam replied hereunto,</hi> That there were ten thousand Souldiers and Slaves belonging to those Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, which had taken their refuge in <hi>Valona;</hi> and therefore he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Venetians to permit them free passage into their own Country, and to restore their Gallies, unless they intended to come to an open Rupture with the Grand Signior.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:98602:43"/>
The Chimacam also pressed more urgently for restitution of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, in regard that having advised the Grand Signior of this disaster, he had at the same time given him hopes and almost assurance to believe, that by his Negotiations he should recover them out of their hands: but the Senate was of a different opinion; and therefore gave express Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to their Officers of the Marine Affairs immediately to sink all those Vessels, that so the expectation of the Turks being disappointed by an impossibility of recovery, might not by the rude instances and threats of <hi>Morat</hi> oblige them to a dishonourable and an undecent restitution.</p>
                     <p>The News of this misfortune made greater noise and disturbance in the Divan of <hi>Algier</hi> than at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that rude rabble raved and <note place="margin">The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> angry at this News.</note> railed and threatned, laying the blame sometimes on one, then on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, being ready to come to blows amongst themselves; but that being obliged by order of their Divan to keep their thumbs within their gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, they durst only express their anger by punches and thrusts of their elbows. At length coming to cooler Terms, they charged all the fault on their Admiral <hi>Ali,</hi> and resolved to make applications to the Grand Signior for redress, and reparations on the Estates of the Venetians in his Dominions.</p>
                     <p>The News also hereof overtaking <hi>Morat</hi> in his March into <hi>Persia</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred <note place="margin">The Grand Signiors anger against the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians.</note> him to the heart, and transported him to that heat of indignation, that he immediately ordered, that the Venetian Bailo with all his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Ottoman Dominions should without exception be cut to pieces; but the Great Vizier and his Favourite suffering him for some time to vent the impetuosity of his fume and rage without contradiction, gave a stop for thirteen days to the dispatch of these fatal Orders; until taking him in a more gentle mood, they perswaded him to change this sentence of death, to the imprisonment only of the Bailo; and such care was taken, lest the News of a War with <hi>Venice</hi> should fly into <hi>Persia,</hi> and thereby prejudice the Terms of Peace, that this accident was kept as a secret and communicated to none, but such as were nearly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Government. The Command for the Bailo's Imprisonment being arrived at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> he was summoned to Audience by the Chimacam; and though at that time he was exceedingly afflicted with the Gout, yet the Turkish obedience to Imperial Commands admitting of no excuse, he was forced to an attendance; and being brought in his Sedan, he was carried to the Chamber of Audience, where he expected some time until the Chimacam came to him; in the interim being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by some Aga's, whom the Chimacam had employed to sound him touching the restitution of the Vessels; who finding by his discourse that they were sunk, without possibility of recovery, and that there could be no compensation made for them, they returned with this answer to the Chimacam; of which being now informed he came in, and having no farther to expostulate on this matter, produced the Grand Signior's Command for his Imprisonment, and kissing it first caused it to be read <note place="margin">The Venetians Bailo impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> The Bailo replied, that he was ready to submit, being not only willing to suffer Imprisonment, but also Martyrdom, accompanied with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest pains, for the sake of his Prince and his Country.</p>
                     <p>To soften and mitigate matters, the other Christian Ambassadours then resident at the Port, had made Arz to the Grand Signior, wherein with all reverence and respect they offered themselves for Mediators in this difference, engaging themselves but not the parole of their Princes, for
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:98602:44"/>
the person of the Bailo, that he should not fly from the Port, nor yet refuse any reasonable Terms by way of Accommodation. This Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ambassadours seconded with some Presents from the Bailo to the Turkish Ministers, so facilitated matters, that the Bailo at first was conducted to the <note n="*" place="margin">

There was now no other rumour or discourse in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but of a War with <hi>Venice,</hi> so soon as that with <hi>Persia</hi> was concluded; and in the mean time the Grand Signior gave Orders, that ten Gallies should be built in his own Arsenal at his charge, and presented to the Barbarouses, with condition that they should stay until the Spring, and accompany his Fleet to Sea. But <hi>Ali Picenin</hi> the Admiral suspecting that this was only a snare to engage him and his men for ever in the Grand Signior's service, refused the obligation, and set two Gallies on the stocks for his own account.</p>
                     <p>Advice of the Bailo's Confinement being come to <hi>Venice,</hi> with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the passion and rage of the Sultan, they expected nothing more than a War with the Turk, which they communicated to all Christian Princes, requesting their succours and assistance against the common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. These addresses produced rather compassion of their case, than substantial Contributions, Pope <hi>Urban</hi> himself giving them great assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of some help from the Ecclesiastical Revenues, besides Processions, Masses, and Benedictions for their good success, in as great a number as they could desire: notwithstanding which due care was taken to make ready and provide against all Encounters. Letters were wrote to the Captain-General in the Levant to make due Preparations against the Enemy: sixteen Gallies were armed out of <hi>Candia,</hi> to which were joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed other Galleasses under the Command of <hi>Antonio Pisani</hi> and <hi>Sebastiano Veniero:</hi> Souldiers were levied in every place, and all Garrisons provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Ammunition and Victuals, and reinforced with numbers of an auxiliary Militia. Howsoever it was not the business nor advantage of the Venetians to make a War with the Turks, but rather whilst they feared the worst, and made provisions against the utmost extremities, they endeavoured to enter into Treaties of Peace, and to qualifie the hot Spirit of the Grand Signior with the gentle lenitives of fair words, and proffers of making attonement with the Sacrifice of Gold and other Presents: in order unto which they wrote a Letter to the Grand Signior to this effect. <hi>That being provoked by the insolence and frequent robberies of the Pirates of</hi> Barbary, <hi>who did not esteem faith or obedience to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, nor the Commands which he had often sent to restrain them, they were induced out of natural defence of themselves, to chastise and correct them; but as this was acted without intention to disoblige his Majesty, so they were ready to maintain and cultivate that ancient friendship and correspondence which was ingrasted on the firm root of his glorious Progenitors. Morat,</hi> though he received this Letter in a huff, and gave an Answer to it with disdain, which breathed nothing but threats of revenge and total de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; yet he sent it by an Express of his own to <hi>Venice,</hi> couching something within the terrour of his words, as if there was place left for an Accommodation, if the Venetians knew what salve was to be applied to obduct the skin of this bleeding wound. The Venetians quickly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, that Gold was the only remedy, of which they were ready to contribute freely; since they could make no better a purchase with
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98602:44"/>
their money than Peace, nor could make a better bargain than with such a Sum as would serve only to make the first Preparations of War, to evade all hazards, troubles, and calamities by a happy and safe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of Peace. The which notwithstanding took no effect, until the return of <hi>Morat</hi> from <hi>Persia;</hi> and therefore we shall defer discourse thereof to its proper place. <hi>Amurat</hi> marched now at the Head of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable <note place="margin">

In this March he was overtaken by one who rode hard to demand <hi>Mostaluck,</hi> which is the reward of good News for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The Great Vizier met his Master at <hi>Iconium</hi> with a moderate Equipage to give more room for the Quarters of the Army; and rendring himself more gracious in his eyes by a Present of fifty thousand Dollars, he was again remunerated with a Cemiter and a Vest of Sables, which are the usual signals of the Sultan's favour. All <hi>Asia</hi> was now in Arms, and the Princes and Great men came in to perform their duty, accompanied with their Forces and Attendance: only complaints were made of a certain Shegh, Santone or Preacher belonging to the Mountains of <hi>Anatolia,</hi> who <note place="margin">A Shegh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels.</note> had refused to do Homage, or serve in the War; he was one, who by a feigned Sanctity had acquired a great reputation amongst his people; and having declared himself to be the <hi>Mehedy</hi> or the Mediator, which according to the Mahometan Doctrine is to fore-run Antichrist, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing all the World to one Unity of Faith: he had perswaded his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that he and they under him were by Priviledge of his Office exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted from all Taxes, Contributions, or Impositions by any Secular Power whatsoever. The Grand Signior who could not understand or believe this Doctrine, presently detached a strong Body with some Cannon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Command of the Captain-Pasha (who, as we have said, was to accompany the Grand Signior in the War) to confute the Principles of this Rebel, and to reduce him to obedience. These Forces being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred on his Dominions, Proclamation was made to the people, that they should deliver up their Impostor into the hands of Justice; which if <note place="margin">He is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</note> they refused to do, then Fire and Sword was to be their portion, and destruction to extend even unto their children of seven years of age. This terrible denuntiation of the Sultan's Sentence struck all the people with cold fear and amazement; howsoever the Shegh availing himself on certain Prophecies, which he interpreted in his own favour, adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to stand a shock with the Grand Signior's Forces; but being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by them, the Shegh was taken alive and carried to the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior; who having given a stop to his March at <hi>Iconium,</hi> until the end of this business, he condemned him to be flead alive; and in this guise being a horrid Spectacle to all Beholders, he was carried upon an Ass to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98602:45"/>
the Wheel, on which he seemed to endure the remainder of his punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without any sensible touches or pangs in the torments.</p>
                     <p>This success being attained, <hi>Morat</hi> proceeded in his March, and passing through <hi>Alexandretta</hi> or <hi>Scanderone,</hi> he was there saluted by the Guns of all the English and Dutch Ships then in Port, and presented by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Consuls, especially by the Venetian called <hi>Marco Foscolo,</hi> whose Presents were computed to amount unto the value of ten thousand Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. Thence he proceeded to <hi>Antioch,</hi> where he refreshed his Army for a few days, observing the Antiquities of that place. At <hi>Aleppo</hi> he was met by the Pasha of Grand <hi>Cairo,</hi> who brought with him a rich Tribute, accompanied with an Army of twenty four thousand Souldiers, all choice men well armed and well cloathed; at the same place also the Forces of <hi>Palestine</hi> joyned with him, so that his Army was now increased to a vast number. Proceeding forward new Sangiacks came in daily belonging to the Countries through which they marched, and a strong Party of Tartars despairing of being able to act any considerable matter against <hi>Asac,</hi> offered themselves to the service of the Grand Signior.</p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Persia</hi> entred the Field at the Head of an hundred and twenty thousand Horse; but being inferiour in force, made only use of them to reinforce his Garrison of <hi>Bagdat</hi> with an addition of thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <note place="margin">The Persian Army dares not give battel to the Turk.</note> men; which now being well provided, he judged that the Force within and the strength of the place would be able to endure a long Siege, and with time weaken, if not destroy the vast numbers of the Turks, of which there were former examples: with the rest of his Forces he returned to encounter the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> who (as we have said) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised <hi>Morat</hi> to assist him in this War, and attack the Persian on the other side of his Dominions, which served for an advantageous diversion to the Turk. This was the reason that no memorable Battels succeeded in the Field, there being none of greater note than a Fight which <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi> Pasha had with two thousand Persians belonging to <hi>Revan,</hi> with whom accidentally encountring, he killed fifteen hundred of them on the place, and took the rest Prisoners, which being five hundred in number were brought before <hi>Morat,</hi> and all barbarously put to death by him.</p>
                     <p>During the time of this March <hi>Morat</hi> often exercised himself in Feats of Arms, to shew his strength of body and dexterity of hand; amongst other things wonderful to the Souldiers, he pierced a Suit of Arms of Musket-proof with a Dart, called by them a <hi>Gerit,</hi> thrown from his hand; for evidence of which the Armour is placed on one of the Gates of <hi>Aleppo</hi> with an Inscription under it.</p>
                     <p>About the beginning of the month of <hi>August</hi> the Turkish Army passed the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> by means of a Bridge, which was not so well built, <note place="margin">The Turks pass the River <hi>Ell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phratis.</hi>
                        </note> but that it sunk under the weight of Horses, Camels, and Baggage, by which disaster many perished in the water, which great rains had swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led above the bounds of its Banks. As this numerous Army proceeded, so all petty Princes applied themselves to perform their Homage; amongst which one <hi>Tarpos</hi> a King of the Arabs came with his Wife, Mother, and Son to prostrate himself before the Sultan: he was entertained in the Tent of the Favourite, who being always in company with <hi>Morat,</hi> was never suffered to separate from him, and his Tent more for ostentation than to serve his occasion. <hi>Tarpos</hi> being admitted to Audience, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with respect and a favourable countenance, and presented with a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98602:45"/>
Vest of Cloth of Gold lined with Sables and a small Purse of Gold: in recompence whereof the Arab Prince returned certain choice Horses and two Leopards. In like manner the Georgians and Mengrelians, who are Tributaries to Turk and Persian, and commonly incline to the strongest side, whose Nations we have described <hi>in the present State of the Ottoman Empire,</hi> would not be wanting at this time to bring their Tribute of eighty thousand yards of Linen-cloth, which they pay every three year, with some Children of both Sexes chosen out of the comeliest and most healthful amongst them.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Mosul</hi> the Army lay encamped for some time, where was a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rendezvous and confluence of people from all parts, and every thing <note place="margin">The Turkish Army at <hi>Mosa.</hi>
                        </note> ordered and modelized for a War. Severe Discipline was kept amongst all, Offenders were impaled, flead alive, their bowels ript out, and thrown into the publick ways: nor did Takers of Tabaco escape with less punishment than the rest. In the mean time Wine was forbid to his whole Camp, unless to himself and his Favourite, being a Royal drink; and when the chief Physician commended the admirable virtue of Opium, advising <hi>Morat</hi> to use it in the place of Wine, he enjoyned him to make his words good by his own example and thereby forced him to take so much, that he was overcome, and died by swallowing too great a quantity.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Mosul</hi> the Army marched in due order to <hi>Babylon,</hi> where the Great Vizier arrived with thirty thousand men about the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:</hi>

                        </note> but by reason of the great weight of Artillery, and the many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments which attend such vast numbers, the Grand Signior came not thither till the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> and on the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the whole Turkish Army presented it self before the Walls of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Babylon</hi> the ancientest City of the World, reported to be built by <hi>Nimrod</hi> on the Banks of the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and afterwards beautified and enlarged by <hi>Semiramis</hi> the Wife of <hi>Ninus,</hi> is recorded in History for the vastness thereof to be one of the seven Miracles of the World. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the furious Inundations of the River, and the Iron teeth of devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time, and the subjection thereof to the Macedonian Empire, did much eclipse the glory of that City, and caused <hi>Seleucus Nicanor,</hi> one of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander's</hi> Captains, to build a new one where the <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates</hi> meet, forty miles more Northwards than the old <hi>Babylon,</hi> which he therefore called <hi>Seleucia</hi> after his own Name. In the year of our Lord 753. <hi>Abugiafer Almansor</hi> an Arab King enlarged this City to the Eastern side of the <hi>Tigris,</hi> as being less subject to the Inundations of the River, giving it the Name of <hi>Bagdat,</hi> or the place of Gardens; but his Son <hi>Almolied</hi> being more pleased with the Western side, encouraged people to build the stateliest Palaces and best Fabricks near the place where he delighted to keep his Court, so that the River <hi>Tigris</hi> divided the City. The which with the Country thereabouts was subdued by <hi>Solyman</hi> the Magnificent; and afterwards in the Year 1625. it was recovered by <hi>Abas</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> until at length in this of 1638. it was vanquished by the mighty force and prowess of this Magnanimous Sultan, as we shall now understand.</p>
                     <p>The numerous Troops of the Ottoman Army covering all the Plains, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Bagdat</hi> desieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> a general Council of War was called of the chief Commanders of the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisaries and Spahees, especially of such who had been practised in the Sieges of the strong Fortresses in <hi>Hungary.</hi> After some debate and long
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98602:46"/>
consideration, it was agreed, That the City should be battered in three places. One Battery of twelve Pieces of Cannon commanded by the Great Vizier was to be erected against the Bright Gate: the second against the Dark Gate of ten Pieces of Cannon, under the Command of the Captain-Pasha: and a third of eight Pieces directed against the Gate of <hi>Persia,</hi> under the Government of <hi>Chusaein</hi> Pasha Beglerbei of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolia.</hi> The Grand Signior in the mean time habited like an ordinary Souldier, that he might be the less exposed to danger, visited all Posts and places, encouraging them with his words and presence, protesting that he would not change his Cloaths for ever in any place but within the Walls of <hi>Bagdat.</hi> In the space of three days the Trenches were ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the Batteries raised, and the Cannon planted; and <hi>Morat</hi> having made Korban, gave fire to the first Cannon with his own hand, as he had brought the first Basket of Earth to raise the Works. The Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants within consisted of eighty thousand fighting men, with which they made frequent Sallies of four and five thousand men at a time, who being retired were again seconded by another of the like number, which put the Turkish Camp into much confusion, and into danger of having their Trenches levelled, and their Cannon spiked; but the Turks valiantly fighting, the slaughter proved bloody on both sides: and being guided rather by the bravery of their courage, than by Art or Experience in War, they carried their Works forward to the very brink of the Ditch, having an Italian and a Candiot for their chief Enginiers; who though they were not persons of that ability, as our modern times have produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, yet they were such, as for want of better, served the presented occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, where force and numbers, with small additions of Art, were the most available. For in this Siege the Sword was more exercised than the Spade or Matock, and there was more need of Arms than Works; for the constant Sallies kept the Turks always watchful and imployed, and perpetually disturbed them, until at length they were forced with great labour to raise a high Circumvallation with a very deep Ditch defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by several Redoubts; whereby the Besieged being kept in, their numbers decreased by former Sallies, and their courages abated by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair of Relief, they began to grow cold in the Acts of Bravery, and to reserve their men for the ultimate and last efforts of defence. In the mean time the Turks plied their Batteries so hotly, that in a few days the Walls were laid open almost fifty paces wide. In this condition the Defendants having no other refuge than some small Retrenchments, which they had made during the Siege, were exposed to the open force of the Enemy. For now the Turks having filled up the first and second Ditches with Sacks of Wool, Faggots, and other Rubbish, crowded in vast numbers to enter the Breach, which the Persians defended as stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Stones, Bullets, artificial Fires, and all Instruments of death, which fell like showers of Hail on the heads of the Enemy. The Great Vizier signalizing himself above all by his undaunted courage, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his hand and voice, was unhappily shot by a Musket-bullet, and fell on the heaps of the dead, amongst whom there is no distinction between the common Souldier and the bravest Captain. This Fight within the Breach continued for five days, where both sides fighting like men in despair, the dead bodies lay in heaps, and blood was stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated like a Pool to wade thorough. At length the numbers of the Turks prevailing, commanded now by <hi>Mustapha</hi> the Captain-Pasha,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98602:46"/>
entred the Town by force of Arms on the 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>December</hi> about the time of Sun-set, when the Royal Standard of the Turks was planted in this City. Howsoever twenty four thousand of the Persians remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still alive, and united in a Body capitulated for Quarter, otherwise threatning not to die unrevenged: Pardon and Quarter for their lives was readily granted, on confidence of which the Persians threw down their Arms, and submitted to the publick faith or the Sultan's clemency. But the Grand Signior afterwards considering, that the granting Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Bagdat</hi> taken.</note> at <hi>Revan</hi> had been the cause of the loss of the City, he repented him of his promise, and gave Order to the Janisaries most inhumanely to open a torrent of blood, and make a barbarous Massacre of those who had newly thrown down their Arms at his feet, not sparing either wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or child, either sex or age; the which slaughter, like a work of darkness, was acted in the night by the light of Torches and Lanthorns, and appeared a horrid spectacle to all, especially to the Persian Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, who being conducted like a Prisoner in the Camp, was a sad Spectator of his Countries destruction on the horrid Theatre of its capital City.</p>
                     <p>So soon as <hi>Bagdat</hi> was taken, <hi>Morat</hi> dispatched away Posts imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately with the News into all parts, and wrote a Letter with his own hand to the Chimacam, ordering a <hi>Dunalma</hi> or Feast of Thanksgiving, and rejoicing for the space of twenty days; during which time no busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was to be acted, the Houses were to be adorned both without and within with the best Furniture, and every House was to set forth Lights, Torches, and Fire-works agreeable to the condition and ability of the person. The people exclaimed hereat as too great an expence, and the vacation from business seemed too long for those who lived by their daily labour. The chief Ministers and Grandees evidenced external actions of joy, but inwardly feared and trembled, suspecting that the fierce and cruel humour of their Sultan would be elated, and rendred more tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical, and untractable by success and a favourable Fortune. The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Princes received this Intelligence like bad News, and as an Alarm to awaken them from the easiness of Peace, to expectations of War: for War with <hi>Persia</hi> was like an Ulcer in the Bowels of the Turkish Empire, which gangrened and consumed the strength and marrow of their Power; which now being cured, and the Body politick rendred healthy by such a seasonable success, would convert it self to Enterprises pernicious and dangerous to the neighbouring States.</p>
                     <p>After the Conquest of this City <hi>Morat</hi> gave out, That he resolved to proceed with his Army into <hi>Persia,</hi> and to enter the Walls of <hi>Spahan;</hi> but having some indispositions of health upon him, and recalled by the charming Letters of a Favourite Mistress, whom he had left at <hi>Diarbechir,</hi> he inclined to return again to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> Wherefore mustering first his Army, he found that it was abated near an hundred thousand men, two thirds whereof being killed in the War, the rest perished by the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence, and other diseases and maladies incident to Camps; a great part of the slaughter fell on the most veterane Souldiers of the Janisaries and Spahees, of which many of the Chief being slain, their Lands and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues returned to the Grand Signior, and gave him both opportunity and ability to reward many with such Offices and Gifts as came by the death and fall of other Commanders. Thus the Captain-Pasha, whose Valour had rendred him famous, was made Great Vizier in the place of him that was
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98602:47"/>
slain, and the Persian Favourite was constituted Captain-Pasha; and though many repined at this advancement, as conferred on a Stranger, and a Person without Merit, yet the Grand Signior considered him as one whose Experience in that Country, and the Information he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him of the situation and strength of <hi>Babylon,</hi> had made abundant compensation for the favour and honour he had bestowed upon him.</p>
                     <p>The Grand Signior having left a Garrison of thirty thousand men in <hi>Bagdat,</hi> dispeeded the Great Vizier with a considerable Army to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1639"/> far into the Country of <hi>Persia.</hi> And having now released the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian Ambassadour, giving him liberty to return to his Master, wrote by him this braving Letter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> That am Lord of Lords, and Conquerour in the parts of <hi>Arabia, Persia,</hi> and <hi>Greece:</hi> King that commands with eminent Rule in the World, exalted by Divine assistance to the Empire of the Vniverse; the most Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Possessor of the White and Black Seas, and of all the Cities and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses which encompass them. Lord of the Divine and Prophetick Temple, that is, of <hi>Mecha</hi> and <hi>Medina,</hi> as also of <hi>Jerusalem, Aleppo, Damascus,</hi> and of all those Holy and Venerable Countries, of Grand <hi>Cairo,</hi> Salutiferous <hi>Babylon,</hi> and of <hi>Van,</hi> of <hi>Ethiopia, Balsora,</hi> and the Lesser <hi>Asia;</hi> of all the Countries of the Curds, Georgians, and Tartars; of <hi>Moldavia, Valachia,</hi> and universally of all the Provinces and Regions of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Anatolia.</hi> And in summ, Supreme Lord of the Seven Climates, the Victorious and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant King in the Service of God Sultan <hi>Amurat Han,</hi> to the Valiant <hi>Sofi,</hi> to whom may God give peace, if he deserve it. This Imperial Letter worthy of Obedience being come to thee, Be it known unto thee, That the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour which Thou didst send to my happy Port with desires of Peace, I have detained until this time in which I have subdued <hi>Bagdat,</hi> by means of the keen edge of my Invincible Cemiter. If thou desirest Peace, surrender those Provinces which belong to the Dominions of my Victorious Predecessors, into the hands of my Beglerbeys, who are now marching at the head of my Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and Inexpugnable Army: otherwise expect me next Spring with my Troops more numerous than the sands of the Sea, within the bowels of thy Dominions; where I will appear on Horse-back to unkennel thee from the Caverns wherein thou now lurkest, not daring to manage those Arms, which are unworthily girt to thy side. That afterwards shall succeed, which was determined from all Eternity. Peace be to him who directs his ways aright.</p>
                     <p>This Letter being dispatched, the Grand Signior recalled the forty thousand men which he had lent, from the Service of the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> which he quartered about <hi>Bagdat</hi> to hinder the attempts of the Persians, in case they should design to pursue him in the Rear, and disturb his return into <hi>Europe.</hi> By reason of the rigour and extremity of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and a certain defluxion which falling on his Nerves, made him some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing paralytical, the Grand Signior departed not from <hi>Bagdat</hi> until the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> and then for recovery of his health, and to soil the Horses <note place="margin">The Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior returns to <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
                        </note> by the way with convenience of grass, short days journies were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Grand Signior's indisposition increasing with some cold and shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering sits, gave the first Symptoms of a Feaver; but afterwards it plainly appearing to be a paralytical distemper, suspected by the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians to end in an Apoplexy, it was rumoured abroad, that <hi>Morat</hi> was dead; but it was whispered with such caution, as if they had feared lest
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98602:47"/>
the Grand Signior would have over-heard them, and risen from his grave to punish their secret and inward joy. Being somewhat recovered from the last accession of his Palsie, the humour fell into his legs, and swelle so much, that he could scarce sit upon his Horse; howsoever he hastened us fast as he could to <hi>Constantinople</hi> to disprove and confute the falsity of that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> concerning his death. In the mean time it is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed with what sear and terrour the Chimacam and other great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of State expected the return of their formidable Prince, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where the Thunderbolt of his cruel disposition would strike, until at length it fell on the head of the poor Sultan <hi>Mustapha,</hi> whose weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as it rendred him unable for Government and Command, so it made him stupid and insensible of death.</p>
                     <p>At length on the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> the Grand Signior arrived at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirople:</hi> the Favourite <hi>Soltana,</hi> which had accompanied him to the War, passed by water from <hi>Ismit</hi> attended with six Gallies, and took her <note place="margin">The Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors Entry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
                        </note> Lodging the first night of her arrival at a small Chiosk or House of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure under the Wall, so as to make a magnificent Entry the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Her Coach was covered with Cloth of Gold, and the Spokes of the Wheels were gilded, and the Wheels shod with Silver; she was followed by twelve Coaches, and the Mufti, Pasha's, Kadees, and other Officers went before to conduct her to the Seraglio. The Grand Signior, who arrived the same day attended with fifty six Gallies, made not his solemn Entry until two days after, being performed with all the Ceremony, State, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> which could be contrived. The Grand Signior in his own Person appeared in the Persian Habit, with a Leopards skin thrown over his shoulders, after the manner of a Kausee (as they call them) or a brave husting Champion, having his Stirrup attended with twenty two of the chiefest Nobles, whom he had reserved at <hi>Bagdat</hi> purposely to lead in Triumph when he made this Entry. The Treasure brought to <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> was landed at the Seraglio out of ten Gallies, and calculated to amount to a greater Sum than that which was carried from thence; for besides the Riches taken in the Plunder of <hi>Babylon,</hi> seisure was made in divers places of the Estates of Pasha's and other Great men, which by death, or for crimes escheated to the Grand Signior.</p>
                     <p>After the Grand Signior's departure out of <hi>Persia,</hi> little of action suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, as if by mutual agreement, a Truce or Cessation of Arms had been contrived. The Persians desired a Peace, because they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled and tired with the War: The Turks had regained their Honour by the Conquest of <hi>Bagdat;</hi> and being unwilling to lose it by change of unconstant Fortune, and longer consume their riches and men in a tedious and remote March, were attending to receive Propositions of Peace first offered by the Persian. To effect which the Great Vizier, who was left at <hi>Bagdat</hi> to command the Army, intimated to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of the Frontiers, that a proffer of Peace should be accepted; <note place="margin">An Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour sent from <hi>Persia</hi> to the Grand Signior.</note> which being made known to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> he immediately dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched an Ambassadour to the Grand Signior to propose Terms of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation. The Ambassadour being arrived at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> was grateful and acceptable to all, and his day of Audience appointed after the usual manner on the Pay-day of the Janisaries, when the floor of the Divan is covered with Sacks of Money: before the door of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Audience stood the Persian Captives all cloathed in rich Vests. The Ambassadour being conducted to the Royal Presence with the usual
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98602:48"/>
Ceremonies (of which we have given an account in another place) was received by the Sultan sitting upon a Saffaw covered with Crimson Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet embroidered with Pearl; his Turbant was encompassed with a Chain of Diamonds, cloathed with a rich Vest lined with Sables; he cast no pleasantness of aspect on the Ambassadour, but beholding him with a fierce and scornful look, received the Letter in a kind of careless disclain, behaving himself in every motion, as if he neither esteemed the King, nor his Ambassadour; or as if the Persian had been wholly conquered by him, had sent to beg Peace, and pardon for his life: The Ambassadour was soon dismissed from his Presence; and matters being referred to the Negotiation of the Chimacam, no other difficulty arose besides the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute concerning <hi>Revan,</hi> which at length was agreed by another Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour <note place="margin">A Peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</note> sent to the Vizier on the Frontiers to remain unto the Persian, as <hi>Bagdat</hi> was consirmed to the Turk: and so Peace was without long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate clapt up; the Grand Signior, by reason of his indisposition which increased upon him, being not inclinable to trouble his head with the burden of business.</p>
                     <p>Peace being thus concluded with <hi>Persia,</hi> there appeared a perfect Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine and fair weather in the Ottoman Court, neither dissentions at home, nor Wars abroad troubling the quiet and repose of the Sultan; until some differences happening between the Princes of <hi>Moldavia</hi> and <hi>Valachia</hi> exhaled the first cloud of disturbance. At that time <hi>Lupulo</hi> was Prince of <hi>Moldavia,</hi> a Person of evil Principles, covetous and unjust. <hi>Matthew</hi> was Prince of <hi>Valachia,</hi> a good man, zealous for the Christian Religion, and one who administred equal Justice to his people. <hi>Lupulo</hi> not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting himself with his own, but desirous also of his Neighbours pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, made instances to the Port to have the Principality of <hi>Moldavia</hi> conferred upon his Son, alledging that thereby he should be better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled <note place="margin">Troubles in <hi>Moldavia</hi> and <hi>Valachia.</hi>
                        </note> to balance the power of <hi>Ragotski</hi> in <hi>Transylvania,</hi> and on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions be rendred more serviceble to the Grand Signior's designs and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest: and seconding this Proposition with a Present of fifty thousand Dollars to the Chimacam, and promise to increase the annual Tribute, he obtained the Chimacam's friendship, at whose instance the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior was perswaded to write unto <hi>Matthew</hi> to surrender up his Province into the hands of the Son of <hi>Lupulo;</hi> declaring, That it having been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customary to change the Princes of those Countries every three years, he ought after an injoyment of above seven years to content himself with a quiet and voluntary resignation, unless he would desire to draw upon himself a ruine by the anger and displeasure of the Sultan. <hi>Matthew</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no posterity, resolved not to surrender his Government but with his life; and having a particular animosity against <hi>Lupulo,</hi> could by no means incline his mind to make his Enemy happy with the Spoils of his Estate. Wherefore having obtained assistance from <hi>Ragotski,</hi> he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to withstand the Forces of young <hi>Lupulo,</hi> and engage with them: and being ready to mount on Horse-back and begin the Battel, he first dispatched an humble Message to the Grand Signior, acquainting him, <q>That he was ready at his Command to resign his Principality into the hands of the meanest Greek his Majesty would appoint; who being the source of all Equity and Justice, he hoped that he would not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him to such Terms as would raise his mortal Enemy upon his ruine; a man so intent to his own interests, and so unconscionable to compass them, that all late Revolutions, Wars, and Commotions have
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98602:48"/>
been raised either by him, or by his Instruments.</q> This Letter being received and read by the Grand Signior, was seconded in a few hours after, with News of the total defeat of young <hi>Lupulo;</hi> which put the Grand Signior so much into choler, that he immediately committed the Chimacam to the Seven Towers, for being the Projector and Author of this Counsel. It was supposed however, that <hi>Morat's</hi> anger would not proceed to that degree, as to extend to his life; but being informed, that he was rich, and that he was possessed of two millions of Dollars, which lay by him in ready Money, it was concluded, that so vast a wealth could not in a short time be honestly gained; which appearing as an undeniable evidence and testimony of his violence and oppression, the Grand Signior made no difficulty to pass the Sentence of death a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <note place="margin">The Chimacam put to death.</note> him, nor to condemn the Money to his own Exchequer. His Office was given to <hi>Sinan</hi> Pasha, and the Principality confirmed unto <hi>Matthew.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>During all this time, the quarrel which the Turks conceived against the Venetians for violating their Port of <hi>Valona,</hi> was not yet composed; but now having time to peruse and consider old accounts, the Venetian Bailo was called by the Chimacam to Audience, and to a Conference with him concerning this matter. In the first place therefore the Bailo alledged, <q>That the Pirates of <hi>Barbary</hi> had for the space of twenty years roved in the Venetian Gulf, and made Prize in that time of so many Ships and Goods belonging to Merchants, that the Republick had been prejudiced by them in several millions; which also did in some man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner prejudice the Customs of the Grand Signior, to whom the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Merchants pay for the most part yearly the Sum of an hundred thousand Dollars in Custom for their Goods, besides the benefit which the Ottoman Dominions receive by so profitable a Commerce.</q> 
                        <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Chimacam replied:</hi> 
                        <q>That the damages which the Turks recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Corsaires or Free-booters at Sea under the Colours of <hi>Malta, Ligorn, Majorca,</hi> and other places were greater and more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable to the Majesty of the Ottoman Grandeur, than the depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the other side were to <hi>Venice:</hi> and therefore it would be necessary for the good of the World, that such violences were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented in all places; and that men of such wicked profession should be esteemed for universal Enemies, and to have no other Quarter, nor Articles granted them, than what we give to wild and hurtful beasts, whom we destroy by snares and gins, and all advantages. The which also was never denied to the Venetians, whilst they encountred and took them in the open Seas; but to enter into priviledged places, and violate a Sanctuary of the Grand Signior's, without respect to the mighty Power of so dreadful a Monarch, was an act so insolent, as could never obtain pardon without a due compensation for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; which could not be done, but either by a restitution of the Vessels, or else of a like number in the places of them.</q> 
                        <hi>Hereunto the Bailo replied:</hi> 
                        <q>That if an Accommodation could not be made on other Terms, nor Peace maintained, but by a submission to Pirates, and supportation of all their injuries and robberies, a War must inevitably ensue; for the good success of which they depended on the Blessing of God Almighty, and the general assistance of all Christendom, which will esteem it self universally concerned in this Cause, and obliged as well to make good this quarrel against Pirates, as to preserve <hi>Venice</hi> for
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98602:49"/>
their main Bulwark and defence against the Ottoman Force.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>You make me smile (answered the Chimacam) when you tell me of the power of Christendom, which contains nothing more of terrour than the name. Do not I know, who have been Pasha of <hi>Buda;</hi> that the Emperour hath no money; and that when the Swedes, a small and inconsiderable people, have made War upon him, they have almost over-run his Country? As for <hi>France,</hi> if they understand their own Politicks, they will scarce be perswaded to lend assistance to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, when we make war against it. The Spaniards have so much to do at home, and to conserve themselves from the incroachments of their powerful Neighbour the French, that they are wholly unable to lend Forces to wage a war at such a distance from their Dominions. Wherefore considering the advantage we have upon you, which we well know and understand; you must either have war on these ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous terms, or else purchase your peace with a considerable Sum of money. In making of which bargain you must consider, that you have to deal with a mighty Prince, and not with a Merchant; and therefore your offer ought to be large at first, so as it may gain credit, and be received with a favourable ear; for a small Sum to him is like a little morsel given to an hungry stomach, which serves only to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the appetite. And you know, that we our selves are often forced to sacrifice to the avarice of our Prince, by effusions of vast Sums of money, which are always best compounded for, when they are done readily, and at first, before we give our Master time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult with his pillow, and to make up our accounts according to the calculate of his own reckoning. Let me therefore exhort you to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the like example, and immediately make an offer of three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand Zechins of Gold, which if you will do, and employ my interest to make this composition for you, I hope, though with some difficulty, to gain its acceptance. To talk and reason of things past is but to beat the air, because the time is vanished and gone; but you may consider of the present, that you may secure the future. We sell you peace at this price, if it be worth your money take it; if not, refuse it, as you judge the purchase most agreeable to your interest.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>At this time Christendom was embroiled in its usual combustions, so that assistance from other Princes was not only uncertain, but without all foundation; so that the Venetians could have no sure trust to any other than their own Force. In regard that many were desirous at that time to see the Venetians engaged with the Turk, that so they might not be able to concern themselves in the War of <hi>Italy,</hi> which then grew hot by the Wars of <hi>Savoy, Modena,</hi> and <hi>Matona,</hi> favoured by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Spaniards, by whose means all the differences arose about the Valtoline. Considering which, the wise Senate being willing to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase so great a blessing to their Country by a moderate price, gave li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to their Bailo to compound for it at what rate and terms that he was able; which by the Bailo's dexterity in the management was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the Sum of two hundred and fifty thousand Zechins, which was esteemed for a great service, and redounded much to the reputation of the Bailo: after which conclusion, the former Articles were ratified, and these which follow added thereunto.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>That the Ambassadour or Bailo should be set at liberty, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to return to his own habitation: That Commerce be renewed
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98602:49"/>
as formerly between the Subjects of both Countries. That all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie about the matters happened at <hi>Valona,</hi> for ever be silenced and forgotten. When at any time the Pirates of <hi>Barbary</hi> shall happen to enter within the Ports of the Grand Signior, they shall give security, that they will commit no damage or spoil on the Subjects of <hi>Venice.</hi> And in case they shall have taken any Prizes belonging to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said State, they shall not be admitted nor protected in the Ports be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Grand Signior. Wherefore in virtue hereof all Aga's, Captains of Castles, and other Ministers who shall not obey and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve this Capitulation, shall be deprived of their Office; and if the Venetians shall then enter violently into the Port, where such Enemies have taken refuge, it shall not be imputed to them for a crime, or esteemed a breach of the Capitulations. And farther, if the Venetians shall at any time encounter the aforesaid people of <hi>Barbary</hi> in the open Sea, it shall be lawful for them to assault, take, and destroy them without notice, or exceptions of the Ottoman Port. And lastly, the new Bailo lately elected shall pay unto the Grand Signior five hundred thousand Pieces of Eight, which make two hundred and fifty thousand Zechins of Gold. This Writing was firmed and ratified about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Moon <hi>Rebiul</hi> in the <hi>Hegeira</hi> or Year of <hi>Mahomet</hi> 1049.</q> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <note place="margin">
                           <hi>September</hi> 1639.</note> authentick Copies were immediately dispatched to the Beglerbeys, Sangiacks, and Kadi's on the Coasts of the Mediterranean Sea, and to the Pasha of <hi>Bosna,</hi> for better publication of the Peace, and free Traffick and Commerce between the Subjects of both people.</p>
                     <p>The Baron <hi>Chinski</hi> arrived at that time from the Emperour in quality of Envoyé Extraordinary to congratulate the Grand Signior's success in <note place="margin">An Envoyé sent from the Emperour to the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior.</note> taking <hi>Bagdat,</hi> and making a Peace with <hi>Persia;</hi> but not bringing with him Presents to that value, which on this occasion were expected, he was not looked on, nor considered with that favour and respect, as was agreeable to his Character and Quality. And there happening a dispute between this Envoyé and the English Ambassadour concerning prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of place; the Turks yielded it to the English, being made to understand the difference which Christian Princes make between the Title of an Ambassadour and that of an Envoyé, though the Turks use but that one word of <hi>Elchi</hi> to express both. And though the Baron <hi>Chinski</hi> laboured to diminish the Dignity of an English Ambassadour at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> by alledging, that he was elected by the Company of Merchants for conservation of their Trade only, and afterwards confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and honoured by the King: yet this Argument was in no wise preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent with the Turks, who esteeming the Commission of the Prince, and the charge of an Office the only qualification to ennoble a person, made no difficulty to determine the point in behalf of the English. And though some Italian Writers say, that the English Ambassadour gave fifteen Purses of Money or seven thousand five hundred Dollars to the Chima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam for this favour; yet those who understand how unwillingly the <hi>Turkie</hi>-Merchants part with their money on defence of such punctillios and niceties, especially where the Ambassadour might have avoided the bringing them into dispute, will more readily believe, that the Turks from free motives of their own Justice and Reason judged this Honour due to the Ambassadour, than that he should purchase this indisputable point by the disgraceful means of money.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1640"/> All matters being now determined between the Turks and <hi>Persia,</hi> and the black clouds blown over from the Venetians, the Grand Signior stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died how and where he might turn his Arms with most advantage: he <note place="margin">The Turkish Counsels un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain about a War.</note> had conceived an irreconcileable pique against <hi>Ragotski</hi> and <hi>Matthew</hi> for the causes before related; but having an intention to make use of their Force against <hi>Poland</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> or against them both together, he dissembled the passion he conceived against them, and rather deferred his revenge, than pardoned the liberty which they had exercised without his licence or assent. Sometimes he resolved to recover <hi>Asac</hi> out of the hands of the Cosacks; sometimes he thought of making War upon <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> judging himself much affronted by that King, for not sending an Ambassadour to congratulate his late successes: then he supposed, that a War in <hi>Germany</hi> would be more easie, and the Conquest more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by reason of the richess of the people, and the fertility of the soil, to which pretences could never be wanting on the score of those differences which always arise amongst the people of the Frontiers. During these debates and counsels, preparations were made for War both by Sea and Land, as yet uncertain where they should be employed: to command them the Great Vizier was ordered to hasten his journey from <hi>Persia,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The Vizier re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns from <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia.</hi>
                        </note> whose arrival was celebrated at <hi>Constantinople</hi> with a solemn Entry; and for a particular and distinguishing Honour, the Grand Signior sent him a Vest from his own Back to wear on the day of his Triumph. This Vizier was a person very austere in his behaviour, bold and valiant, as he evidenced by his actions in taking <hi>Bagdat,</hi> zealous for his Master's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest; and what is rare in a Turk, not much addicted to his own: he had acquired a great share in the esteem of his Master, and his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity increased, as the daily decay of the Grand Signior's health rendred him less able for Government. For now the strong complexion of <hi>Morat</hi> began to grow feeble by excesses of frequent debauchery, his stomach was become cold and weak, not able to digest the lightest meats, his hand shook, and a paralytical distemper seized him in every part: so that his Mother and the Physicians perswaded him to forsake the use of Wine, as poison and destruction to his health: and he, whilst he was sensible of his languishing condition, like a true Penitent, made many protestations and vows against it, forbidding the accursed poison to be received within the Walls of the Seraglio: howsoever his kind heart could not possibly withstand the temptation of a Banquet, to which his Pot-companions did sometimes invite him: amongst which the Great Vizier would not be wanting also to please and cajol the humor of his Master with the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor that he loved. But his chief and constant Camerades in drinking were his Persian Favourite and <hi>Mustapha</hi> Pasha of <hi>Bosna,</hi> one educated in the Seraglio, promoted to the place of Selictar Aga, to whom he gave the stately Palace of <hi>Ibrahim</hi> Pasha on the <hi>Hippodrome,</hi> together with his eldest Daughter in Marriage. These two stout Sons of <hi>Bacchus</hi> perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Grand Signior to appoint one solemn Drinking-day in time of the Biram, which is the great Festival of the Year, and introduced by their Prophet in imitation of our <hi>Easter. Morat</hi> being at this time pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with the spirit of debauchery, accepted the motion, and invited the two Drunkards to dinner with him. The Persian provoked his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98602:50"/>
of drinking by salt Meats, and by peppered and spiced Dishes; the sort of Wine they most used was a sweet Malvoisia, sometimes twisted, and encouraged with the strong Waters, called <hi>Rosa Solis,</hi> of which they sucked so long, and with such excess, that falling under the force of it, they were insensibly carried away to their several beds. This dissolute repast became fatal to the Grand Signior; for a fire being kindled in his veins and bowels, he fell into a violent and continued Feaver. The Physicians being called, were fearful to administer Remedies, lest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <note place="margin">The death of Sultan <hi>Morat.</hi>
                        </note> unsuccessful, their lives should pay for the ineffectual operation: at length they agreed to let him blood, but this hastened his death. For he died the fourth day of his Feaver, being the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> in the seventeenth year of his Reign, and the one and thirtieth of his Age, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ruled in the height of all disorders and irregular excesses, which his youthful years enabled him to support. With his death all his thoughts and designs of making War against Christendom perished, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sworn after his return from <hi>Persia</hi> to reduce all his neighbouring Countries to the Mahometan Law. He was of a most cruel and impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable disposition, having amongst his other Acts of Tyranny imbrued his <note place="margin">His Character.</note> hands in the blood of his two Brothers, <hi>Orchan</hi> and <hi>Bajazet;</hi> as also strangled his Uncle <hi>Mustapha,</hi> whose innocent weakness had been suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to secure his life against any, but the most horrid Monster of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Tyranny. He left no Son; for though he had divers, they died in their infancy, notwithstanding which his Kindred were so detested by him, that he envied the descendence of Monarchy on his Brother <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,</hi> who was preserved by a strange providence from his fury: often saying, that he wished that he might be the last of the Ottoman Line, that the Empire of that Family might end with him, and devolve unto the Tartar. He was certainly the most absolute Prince that ever swayed the Ottoman Empire: but of no Religion, seldom fasting in the month of <hi>Ramasan,</hi> contemning and laughing at the Santones, and others of their Religious Orders. He was very inquisitive into all Actions of the City, for which he maintained his Spies, and oftentimes took his rules and measures from discourses of people concerning his Government. He was a great Dissembler, ready, active, and revengeful, covetous to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, having left fifteen millions of Gold in his Treasury, which was empty when he entred upon the Soveraignty. In short, he was so bad, that he had scarce any allay of Vertue; being so great a Tyrant, that at length he became his own Assasinate, and fell unlamented by all but the two Companions of his bestial excess.</p>

State.</note> and was the sole Surviver, and undoubted Heir of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family; to whose Succession, that She might make the more facile, and undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed Entrance, She consulted with all the Viziers; requesting their consent and assistance in the lawful promotion of her remaining Son to the Throne of his Ancestors: For She had understood, that <hi>Morat,</hi> who always abhorred the ill-shaped Body, and weaker mind of his Brother, envied him the Dignity of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Scepter, and therefore had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed the Succession to the <hi>Tartar,</hi> having, in the heat of a Debauch, and fumes of his Wine, compelled his Pashas to swear to the performance of his Testament. Wherefore the Queen, assembling them together, with gentle words desired them to remember, That <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Heir, and their true Emperour; that the Tartar <hi>Han</hi> was a Stranger, odious to the Souldiery, and not beloved by the People; that an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this nature could never be contrived and executed without danger to the Actors, and that they to whom She assured the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the same Honours and Offices in reward of their constant Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98602:53"/>
would be in hazard of losing all, by the coming of a Foreign Prince, who having Confidents of his own to prefer, and grand ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities to satisfie, would make bold even with Estates and Provinces to prefer his Favourites, his Kindred, and Country-men; and establish the firmness of his Government on their ruine: Yet, setting aside those considerations, touching their own safety and interest, She promised, That if they would reach out their hands unto her Son, for to lift him unto the Throne, he should acknowledge his Empire from them, and accordingly love, tender, and esteem such faithful Subjects. The Viziers, after some reflections on the tye and obligation which <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Morat</hi> had caused them to make to him, declared, and publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to be unlawful, and void; protesting, that they were resolved to maintain inviolable the Allegiance they owed unto <hi>Sultan Ibrahim,</hi> descended from the <hi>Ottoman</hi>-bloud, which they reverenced and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with an awe equal to the religious esteem which their Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had of it; and therefore with one voice they cryed out, Let <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Ibrahim</hi> live. Herewith the Council breaking up, the Viziers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with all the Officers and Attendants of the Seraglio, went with Shouts and loud Acclamations to the Prison of <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute him Emperour; for he, poor Prince, had now for four years remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a sad Recluse in a dark room, where he had received neither light, nor Air, but what came from a little Window, which sometimes in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour was opened to him, from above; and what was worse, the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual expectations, and fear of Death, without Friends, Conversation, or Hope, rendred those apprehensions worse than Death it self, which daily were represented to him in that solemnity, as might terrific a mind more constant and firm than his: So soon as he heard the Shouts and Voices of a Multitude near his Door, he immediately conceived, that the Fate was now come which he had so long expected, and therefore he barred his Door, and denied to give entrance; and when the Viziers proclaimed him Emperour (fearing it might be some artifice of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to see with what joy he would entertain the News) he answered, that he did not so much as think of the Empire, nor desire it, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prayed, that <hi>Sultan Morat</hi> might live, to whom he pretended not to be a Brother, but a Slave; and when he perceived that they began to force the Door, though with terms of Respect and Observance, he still endeavoured to keep it close; for Nature had taught him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a Life, however miserable, and void of consolation. He conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing thus resolute not to open, Reverence to his Person commanded them to forbear any ruder violence, until the Queen Mother over-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this stir, descended her self in Person, and first causing the dead Corps of <hi>Sultan Morat</hi> to be extended before his Door, with gentle Compellations, and confident Assurances, averred the Death of his Brother. The voice of his Mother began to dissipate his fears, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in part already convinced by his Ears, he adventured to peep at the Door, and giving then entire Credence to his Eyes, his heart and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits consented to revive, and so retiring back into his Chamber, he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly received the Congratulations of the Ministers and Souldiers; which being past, he readily applied his Shoulders to the Coffin of his dead Brother, and having bore his share of that dear burden to the Gate of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> he there resigned it to his Domestick Officers, who buried him in the Sepulchre of <hi>Sultan Achmet.</hi> From thence he took Boat, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98602:53"/>
passed to the Mosch of <hi>Jubs Seraglio,</hi> where in the space of eight days, he compleated all the Ceremonies of his Coronation, and afterwards, according to the custom of his Ancestors, he rode through the City to his great Palace; but whether it were for want of practice, or by reason of a posture natural unto Fools, he sate so ridiculously on his Saddle, as moved rather the Laughter than the Acclamation of the People. In fine, being entred the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> he began to breathe, and enjoy the Air of Liberty with so much contentment and satisfaction, that he unwillingly would empair the least Particle of his late acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Freedom, by thinking, or attending to business, and as if he enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed sufficient, committed all to the management of his Mother; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, being desirous to handle something of the Government, he did it with so little grace and dexterity, that it plainly appeared, that that Soul animated a Body not fit to sway or wield a Scepter.</p>
                  <p>The Queen-Mother, to maintain the word She had given to the Vizi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, continued them all in their respective Offices, so that, though there was great disproportion in the mind of the two Princes; yet the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters being the same, there seemed to be little or no alteration in the Government. The Great Vizier remembring well the thoughts of War which <hi>Sultan Morat</hi> meditated against the Cossacks, and being desirous of Glory, and continuance of his Power, resolved to prosecute the same design, hoping to meet a spirit in <hi>Ibrahim</hi> equal to the generosity of his Brother: To this War many and various were the motives, as first, a natural desire of revenge on the Cossacks, for having infested the BlackSeas, that they might thereby provoke <hi>Poland</hi> to a War, which when <note place="margin">Reasons for a War with the <hi>Cossacks.</hi>
                     </note> they had reduced to some extremity, the Emperour would consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall in to their assistance, and thereby create quarrels, which must necessarily open a large Field of troubles, which being sown with the seed of discord, could not fail to produce causes, and pretensions for a War. It being thus resolved, to which the Vizier neither wanted Eloquence nor Reasons to perswade; Great preparations were made for a War, which was intended to be maintained for many years: during which time, God, who disposes all things at his pleasure, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a false report to fly, that the Persians were providing a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to besiege <hi>Bagdat,</hi> to which the Turks giving entire credence, it was resolved in the <hi>Divan,</hi> that those preparations against <hi>Christendom,</hi> should be diverted towards the Parts of the Eastern Countries. By this vain rumour only were all these grand designs disappointed, and all farther thoughts vanished for the present, of molesting the Christians. From whence it is observable, how necessary are the foreign Residences of Ministers, and how absurdly the Turks erre, who, by reason of their pride, vouchsafe not to entertain Ambassadours in the Court of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, being beholding to the Jews, or Armenian-Merchants for all their intelligence they receive touching the Affairs of Neighbouring King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</p>
                  <p>The Wars being thus suspended, the Great Vizier had time to cast his Eyes about him, and contrive the ruine of such whom he suspected most dangerous to his Condition. Amongst the rest, none appeared more formidable than <hi>Mustapha</hi> Pasha, Captain Pasha; a young brisk Person, and Favourite of the Queen-Mother, whom to remove was difficult and dangerous, being a Vizier as well as he, and in one of the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent degrees of dignity in the whole Empire: and therefore that he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98602:54"/>
might touch him with smooth and gentle terms, he practised upon him the ordinary decoy of Preferment, proffering him the Government of <hi>Buda;</hi> which whilst the one seemed out of modesty to refuse, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the greater force of Complement, and obliging expressions of friendship pressed him to accept. At length, overcome with importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and kindness, <hi>Mustapha</hi> received the proffer, whereby being divested of the Queens Protection, he was soon after overtaken in his Journey towards his Principality, and by another Mandate required to take his way to the Province of <hi>Silistria,</hi> the smallest, and most inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the Empire: in which he was no sooner invested, than a second Edict took off his head.</p>
                  <p>But another <hi>Mustapha,</hi> more fortunate, was sent Pasha to <hi>Grand Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> in <hi>AEgypt;</hi> he was a mortal Enemy to the <hi>Crim Tartar,</hi> of whom he shewed his hatred at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> by putting his Son to death, for having said, that <hi>Sultan Morat,</hi> and <hi>Sultan Ibrahim</hi> dying without Issue, the Empire was to descend to his Family: This Son of the Tartar was then at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> it being a custome always to have one of them as a Hostage for the Fathers obedient Comportment towards the Turks, their place of Residence being either at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> or some Town on the Black Sea, as we have elsewhere declared.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sultan</hi> in this Interim had little regard unto the Government, both for want of Capacity, and by reason of his luxurious and wanton Appetite, to which he indulged in the highest excess of sensuality; for having been accustomed to a Prison, and restraint, he knew not how to enjoy that freedome he had recovered, but by subjecting it to the imperious servitude of his Lusts. This humour the Vizier and great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters cherished in him, by continual Banquets, Feasts, and Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in which he always took high contentment and satisfaction. His other Recreations were, Horse-races, and Shooting with the Bow, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding the most dexterous Archers. Business was a stranger to him, he knew not what it meant, nor thought there was other employment for an Emperour than to study those pastimes, which most corresponded with his Youth and Nature: only the Vizier would sometimes in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of high importance demand his Assent, which was either out of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, or else to secure himself with the Name and Authority of his Master.</p>
                  <p>The News of <hi>Sultan Ibrahim's</hi> promotion to the Throne being arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at <hi>Venice,</hi> the most Serene Republick dispatched <hi>Pietro Foscarini</hi> as their Ambassadour extraordinary to complement the <hi>Sultan:</hi> The Prince of <hi>Transilvania</hi> in like manner, sent his Tribute, which was some Hawks, <note place="margin">Ambassadours sent to comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Sultan I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahim.</hi>
                     </note> and twelve Vessels of Gilded Plate, as feudatary acknowledgments for the Lands held, and for his Confirmation in the Principality.</p>
                  <p>The Ministers of other Princes having passed the like addresses, which were customary, The Ambassadours of <hi>Poland</hi> made Complaints of the Tartars, whose incursions against them, the Turks by Conditions of Peace were obliged to restrain; but in this, as in other occasions since that time, the Poles could obtain no redress from the Turks, who willing to have the Christians oppressed or ruined, either seemed not to give credit to the subject of Complaints, or else to find out excuses to acquit the Tartar; which being so known and common a Practice with the Turk, it is to be wondred, why the Poles have sent so many late Messages of this nature, which in former, as well as in this present
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98602:54"/>
Age have proved fruitless; a pregnant example of which, we shall find <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1641"/> in the Reign of <hi>Sultan Mahomet,</hi> Son of this <hi>Ibrahim.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Amongst other Corruptions of these Times, Aspers were so cut and clipt, that the Dollar rose from 80 to 120 Aspers; which irregularity being complained of in the <hi>Divan,</hi> all monies were reduced to their intrinsick value, and the Aspers called in to be coyned in the Mint, to the great damage of the people. But this matter will not appear strange, if it be compared to the Vellion of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to the permission in <hi>Turkey,</hi> of the base alloy of Temins, by which never any Nation before was ever so cheated and abused. And now the storms of War, which threatned from <hi>Persia,</hi> being blown over, it was judged seasonable to reassume the thoughts of War so long mediated against the Cossacks; in order unto which, Gallies were commanded to be built, which should draw little Water, and purposely made to pass the shoals of the Black Sea, near <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sac,</hi> for the recovery of that place out of the hands of the Enemy: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Squadron also of Gallies was designed for the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> to oppose the Gallies of <hi>Malta</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> which much infested those Seas. To the first enterprize the Tartar much excited the Turk, by reason that <hi>Asac</hi> did not only hinder his Incursions by Land, but rendered his Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in the Black Seas, very unsecure. To the second, The Gallies of <hi>Malta</hi> much provoked them, under the Command of <hi>Frederick</hi> the Landgrave of <hi>Hesse;</hi> who by the perswasions of the Cardinals of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Barberini,</hi> from a Protestant was become a Roman Catholick, and had obtained the great Cross of <hi>Malta;</hi> and with several Gallies and Ships, performed some exploits at <hi>Biserta,</hi> and at the <hi>Golleta</hi> near <hi>Tunis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Year 1641. being now entered, the Sultan passed a most Luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Life in his Seraglio, consuming an immense Treasure on his Women; and whilest these two Fleets were preparing to proceed on their respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Expeditions, that intended for <hi>Asac</hi> had almost been diverted by the rumours and disturbances on the Frontiers of <hi>Hungary;</hi> but they were soon afterwards appeased by an appearance of an Envoy from the Emperour, and return of a Chiaus to <hi>Vienna,</hi> with Ratification of all the former Articles and conditions of Peace: Howsoever the German Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntio was braved at the Port, for not appearing sooner with his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents and Complements of congratulation, for the happy Entrance of <hi>Sultan Ibrahim</hi> to the Ottoman Throne; so apt are the Turks to believe Acts of Civility, or Ceremony to be parts of Obedience and Submission; and what Christians have once given them voluntarily, is afterwards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted as a matter of Debt or Duty.</p>
                  <p>And being thus freed from a suspicion of Troubles in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the fears of waging two Wars at once, (which the Turks always studiously avoid) they dispatched a Letter into <hi>Poland,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand passage for their Army, through that Country to the Siege of <hi>Asac;</hi> but that not being consented unto, the Turks prepared to open their way by Force, and the Poles to defend the passage. In which interim, many disasters concurred, sufficient to discourage the Turks in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign; who are a people, that superstitiously calculate the success of their Enterprises, by the difficulty or smooth success of their first beginnings: For when the Vizier was ready to depart, a dreadful Fire happened in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to the quenching of which, applying not only his Orders, but his own Person; he adventured so far, that he burned both his hands, and sindged his Beard in that manner, that he was forced to take his Bed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98602:55"/>
for several Days, where he was honoured with a Visit of the Sultan. News also came at the same time, that <hi>Tauris,</hi> or <hi>Ecbatan,</hi> on the Borders of <hi>Persia,</hi> was miserably ruin'd by an Earthquake; and what was worse, the Sultan himself was seized with an Apoplexy, which turned to a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytical Distemper, the cause whereof was attributed to his excessive use of Women; to whom he was so immoderately addicted, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed his Days and Nights in their Apartments. This Disease, which is rarely or never Cured, being joined to a report given out by his Ladies, that notwithstanding his Venereal heat, he was yet impotent as to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; created a belief, or at least a strong probability, that he might die without Issue, which caused high confusion in the Counsels of the Grandees, that no design could make any chearful progress, until provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was first made for supply of the Ottoman House; for the Succession of the Tartar was in no manner convenient or secure; but rather that the Throne should be furnished with the Son of a Sister, or of a Niece, than to subject themselves to the Rule and Passions of a Foreign Prince: And though the Sultan did afterwards recover his health, yet all suspected and feared, that by the immoderate heat of his Venereal Inclination, he would dye without Children; every one discoursing, as moved by his Passion, or his Interest.</p>
                  <p>About this time arrived an Ambassadour at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> from the <hi>Sofiá</hi> of <hi>Persia,</hi> bringing a Ratification of the Peace; who was so much the more welcome, by how much more the present Conjuncture ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it advantagious; and being ushered in with exceeding rich pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, ravished the hearts of the Turks, whose good nature melts and dissolves with the sight or hopes of Gifts.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> near the Confines of <hi>Zara,</hi> the Turks made Incursions on the <hi>Venetian</hi> Territories, and caused some disturbances: but being chastised by an Ambush laid for them, whereby about 200. of them pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished; all matters were again reconciled, and the Peace renewed.</p>
                  <p>And now one would imagine, that the design against <hi>Asac,</hi> by such diversity of obstructions, were absolutely laid aside; which though they were of that importance, and especially the fear of <hi>Ibrahims</hi> Death, to detain the Vizier at home; yet he thought fit to prosecute the design un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of the Pasha of <hi>Silistria,</hi> to whom he had committed the Conduct of this War. The Pasha proud of his Charge, rejoiced to <note place="margin">The Siege of <hi>Asac.</hi>
                     </note> be employed in a War, wherein he apprehended so little difficulty, and prognosticated to himself nothing but Glory and Victory; esteemed the Defendants for no other than Fishermen, and better experienced to sail their Boats, and govern their Sayks in the Black Seas, than to draw up an Army in the Field, or defend their Walls. This confidence was farther increased by an Embassy at the same time from the Moscovite, who not only renounced all assistance, or concernment for that Town, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed with them his Friendship, and Articles of antient Agreement. The Ottoman Army, besides Janizaries, and other Turks, consisted of Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davians, and Valachians, and a great number of Tartars, which at first entered into their Trenches, and besieged the Town; but here they rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not securely, by reason of the frequentSallies the Besieged made upon them; and more especially by the Mines which they sprang to the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and damage of their Enemies. The Turks moved hereat, made fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Assaults, but were as valiantly repulsed by the Defendants; who threw scalding Water, and Pitch, and burning Sulphur, upon the Assail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98602:55"/>
so that not being able to take the Town by force, they retired to their Trenches, and deliberated in what manner, by fair promises, and mony, they might invite them to surrender: Hereupon the Captain Pasha, the Tartar <hi>Han,</hi> and others, tryed the efficacy of large Proffers of Priviledges to the Town, their Country, and Inhabitants; with a gratuity of twelve thousand Hungers of Gold: but these promises could make no more entrance into their hearts, than the Turks could do into their Walls, which they seemed resolute to defend, wanting neither Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, nor Amunition, nor Courage for the War; but on the contrary side, all these were wanting in the Turkish Camp; so that 15 days passed without any action, until they were supplyed by the arrival of certain Brigantines, and light Vessels, dispatched with all expedition with the necessaries of War; At the coming of which, the Turks prepared for another Assault, which they continued uncessantly for the space of seven days, but were received with that vigour by the Besieged, that they could not gain one palm, or inch of ground, so that at length with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and discouragement, they were forced to give over their attempt, despairing to gain the Town in the time, and with the Force which was allotted for this enterprize. With this ill success, extremity and Famine pinched the Turks in their Trenches so much, that an Oxe was sold for 15 Zaichins, a Lamb for three, and a Measure of Barley which served a Horse for one time, for a Dollar, so that at length they were forced to raise the Siege; and the Captain Pasha by tempestuous weather was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to shelter his Fleet in the Port of <hi>Caffa.</hi> In their return home, the General was fearful of having forfeited his head; the Commanders were silent, and ashamed of their success, and the Souldiers discouraged, famished, and poor; for they had lost 3000. Spahees, 7000 Janizaries, and 800 other Souldiers, besides Moldavians, Valachians, and Tartars; those that survived of the Foot were naked, and many sick; the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hees were without Horses, with which they were supplyed by the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars; and in fine, so unsuccessful were all matters, that the Veterane Souldiery avouched, that they never endured a more cruel, nor a more miserable War.</p>
                  <p>And now we shall end this Year 1641. with the ruin of <hi>Emir Gumir,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The just pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of a Persian Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</note> a Persian by Birth, a Favourite, and yet Traytor to his natural Prince. This <hi>Emir</hi> in the last Wars which <hi>Sultan Morat</hi> waged against <hi>Persia,</hi> was entrusted with an Embassy, and with Conduct of part of his Army, but he betrayed both to the Turk, under whose protection he took Sanctuary, and obtained great Gifts and Preferments, for a reward and price of his Treachery. <hi>Sultan Morat</hi> afterwards bestowed a magnificent Seraglio upon him, situated on the <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> enriched him with a vast Treasure, and what is more, with his Favour; making him his Companion in his Pastimes, and his Confident in his serious Counsels; it was he, that first perswaded the <hi>Sultan</hi> to drink Wine, in which both of them were beastly intemperate, and mighty and valiant to bear, until the heat thereof having extinguished the natural heat of their Stomachs, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came too cold and crude, unless corrected, or fortified with Rach, or distilled Spirits. The fumes of such strong Drinks, were the cause of the extravagant actions, which <hi>Morat</hi> practised in his Life, and afterwards became the means to hasten his Death; whose days being ended, it was time also for prosperous wickedness to expire, and to meet a punishment equal to its demerit. Wherefore one day, (having desired Licence of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98602:56"/>
Vizier to return to his own Country, where it is believed, he had by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1642"/> mony purchased his Pardon) he was called to the Viziers presence, and there without any Impeachment, Process, or Accusation, had the string applyed to his Throat, and strangled on the place; the reason hereof some give, to be the immense Riches which <hi>Sultan Morat</hi> had bestowed upon him, though there wanted not many causes to render him suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and obnoxious to the present Government; first, because he was too well acquainted with the Secrets of the Seraglio, and of that State, to live in any other Country than the Turkish Dominions; then it was feared that the Persian Ambassadour might make use of this person to act what Treason he pleased on the remainder of the Ottoman Family, on promise that such an attempt should expiate his former Villany, and regain the favour of his natural Prince. But such signal actions as these are commonly wrote in such large Characters of Divine Justice, which never left Treason unpunished, either in this Life or the other; that we need not to search or enquire for a further cause, or occasion of this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</p>
                  <p>The Year 1642. being now entered, and the Turks desirous to repair their last Years disgrace, resolved again with better preparation and Conduct, to attempt <hi>Asac;</hi> but before they would engage, according to their usual Custom, they determined to conclude all Ombrages, and matters of dispute arisen on the Confines of <hi>Hungary.</hi> To which end, the Emperour deputed the Baron of <hi>Questemberg,</hi> with other Barons; and the Turks on their side commissionated the Pashaws of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines, with instructions not to insist too strictly on the Conditions, lest it should retard the Peace, and obstruct the other design of War: Wherefore the Turks condescending to matters reasonable, and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up part of their Usurpation, a Peace was concluded for twenty Years, much to the Advantage and Favour of the Christians.</p>
                  <p>And now to give farther courage to the Prosecution of higher At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, <note place="margin">The Birth of <hi>Sultan Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.</hi>
                     </note> the whole Turkish Empire was replenished with joy, for the Birth of a young Prince <hi>Sultan Mahomet,</hi> that now reigns; so that the supposed impotency of the Father (whereby the Ottoman-Family might have been extinguished) was proved otherwise by plain Effect; and the fear of those that ruled the Empire vanishing by the Rising of this new Star, all places were filled with Joy and Triumphs; only the Tartar <hi>Han</hi> sinding himself thus disappointed, was supposed not willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre heartily in this common Joy. In this manner vanished the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Civil Dissention in that Family, which now flourishes and encreases every day, and insensibly creeps forward to the design (which they hope) of an Universal Monarchy. Pardon me, O Christian Kings, if I say insensibly, for methinks you are sensible of the least touch you receive from one and the other, but feel not the gripes and pinches of your Common Enemy, who like a Hectick Feaver hath mingled with your Blood, and stolen into the Marrow of your strength, where he will lurk until he hath dissolved the Fabrick of your Christian World, unless expelled by Concord amongst your selves, and the Divine Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance favouring your united Forces.</p>

the Pasha of <hi>Silistria,</hi> was constituted <hi>Mustapha</hi> Pasha of <hi>AEgypt;</hi> which Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, though much inferiour to his former, yet was received without sense of disgrace, it not being the Riches or Power of any Office that confers Honour, but favour and good will of the <hi>Sultan.</hi> Nor did only the miscarriage of the late War tend to the disrepute of the former Pasha of <hi>Silistria,</hi> but the report of his having poisoned the Tartar <hi>Han</hi> encreased the difficulty of reconcilement with his Superiours, which being a matter rather suspected than proved, excused him from farther punishment than only a deprivation of his Office.</p>
                  <p>The new Pasha of <hi>Silistria</hi> thus taking upon himself the Command of the Army, and Conduct of this War, assembled a Force of <hi>Turks, Tartars, Moldavians,</hi> and <hi>Valachians,</hi> far exceeding the number of the last Year. At the News of which, and of the Fleet of Gallies designed to besiege them by Sea, they apprehended their danger so great, that without the assistance of the Moscovite, they concluded it impossible to defend their City; to him therefore they made applications for succour, representing unto him the extremity their affairs were in, by reason of that powerful Enemy which threatned them; and that having always acknowledged him for their Protector, there was no refuge lest them but under the defence of his Arms. But hereunto the Moscovite gave a brief reply, That he had lately concluded Peace with the Turk; since which, having received from him no occasion of breach, he could not with any Justice engage so soon against him in a War. The Cossacks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants abandon <hi>Asac.</hi>
                     </note> thus disappointed of their principal hopes, resolved to abandon their City; but to make the best advantage of their flight, they carried with them all their Moveables; and demolished their Walls, and ruined their Houses, leaving the place a notorious spectacle of despair and ruine; and no other possession to their Enemies, than the compass of so much ground pestered with Rubbish, and rude heaps of Stones: The Pasha howsoever abundantly contented, that his very name was sufficient to affright his Enemies, entered the City with Triumph, where he began to repair the Walls, and invite the Inhabitants to return, with all assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of security, and protection. This gentle treatment recalled many back to their homes, so hardly are men weaned from their Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and in a short time the City beginning to sill, all matters seemed to return to their pristine state and condition.</p>
                  <p>About this time the Persian by his Ambassadour renewed his League <note place="margin">The Persian renews his League.</note> with the Turk, and confirmed it in the name of the new King, which was performed on condition, that the <hi>Softi</hi> should demolish the Fortress of <hi>Fortrina,</hi> which he had contrary to Articles built on the Frontiers, not far from the Caspian Sea; which that it might assuredly be performed, a Capugibathee was dispatched to see it effected.</p>
                  <p>And in this manner, <hi>Asac</hi> being subdued, and a Peace secured with the Persian; The Turks who can neither live in quiet with their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, nor observe Capitulations longer than they turn to their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; contrived to take <hi>Giavarine, aliàs Rab,</hi> a strong Fortress on the Confines of <hi>Hungary,</hi> by a Stratagem which they designed in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Certain Souldiers habited like Peasants, were crouded into several <note place="margin">The Turks seek to take <hi>Rab</hi> by a Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem.</note> Carts, covered with Hay, which being entered within the Walls, were immediately to leap forth, and surprize the Centinels and Guards at the Gates (which might easily be Executed on men, whom 20 Years before of Peace had made secure) these were to be seconded by 4000 Souldiers,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98602:57"/>
which lay ready in a Neighbouring Vally; but it happened, That an Officer of the Garrison returning from Hunting, had by chance disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered this strong party of Turks, which caused him to quicken his pace towards the Town, and overtaking in his way certain Carts of Straw, which appearing to be laden in a form different to what was usual, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased in him a farther suspicion of Treachery; howsoever, he proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forward with the more haste, yet without any appearance of Jealousy: until being entered into the Town, he declared what he had seen, at which the Garrison was immediately in Armes; and having permitted the Carts to enter, the Bridge was drawn up, and the Carts being searched, the whole fraud and treachery was discovered; and having made the Turks Prisoners, and Armed the Walls with Souldiers, the whole design was disappointed; so that those who lay in Ambush returned to their own Cities. The Emperour hereupon resolved to send an Ambassadour to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to complain of this Treachery; whereof the Turks being ashamed, and the more because it did not succeed; refused to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Ambassadour, unless the Emperour would first agree to pay a Yearly Charge of a hundred thousand Rix-Dollars to the Port; not by way of Tribute, but of Present; in which unreasonable demand, they took more confidence, in regard they perceived that the Emperour was engaged in a War against the <hi>Smede.</hi> Upon this dishonourable demand, the Emperour deferred the Embassy intended, supposing it less perilous to adventure a War in <hi>Hungary,</hi> than dishonourable to condescend unto a Proposition, so derogatory to the Majesty of his Cesarean Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <p>The Year 1643. being now entered, the Prince of <hi>Transilvania</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1643"/> his Annual Tribute, being 10 thousand Zaichins, to the Port; which when the Agents of that Prince Presented before the Vizier; he seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly refused it; protending that the compleat Tribute was to be 15 Thousand; according to Agreement; but the Agents replyed, that five thousand had been remitted unto <hi>Bethlem Gabor;</hi> not by way of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity or Recompence for his Services, but in Exchange, or as the price of two Cities, which the Prince had yielded to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> out of his own proper Estate in <hi>Hungary;</hi> with which Answer the Vizier remained satisfied, being Jealous of the Turbulent and Active Spirit of that Prince.</p>
                  <p>During all these Wars and Revolutions in Kingdoms and States, <hi>Sultan Ibrahim</hi> contained, and contented himself within the Precincts of his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio; where becoming a Faithful and Valiant Souldier of <hi>Venus,</hi> he consumed more Treasure in that War, than his Brother <hi>Morat</hi> did in his Foreign Conquests; and being as it were entered into the Mahometane Paradise, where the Company of fair Women is the chiefest felicity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, he laboured to increase the Ottoman Family, and to acquit his people of the apprehension they had of wanting an Heir to succeed in the Throne; so that on the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> he had a second Born, and a third Son on the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> following; which absolutely took away the reproach of his frigidity or impotence, proving afterwards the most lascivious, and devout Sultan, that ever aspired to the Mahometan Heaven.</p>
                  <p>This Year the Turks Armed out 20 Gallies more than usual, besides 30 Sail of Ships, and Gally Grosses; in the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> riding at the Seraglio point (where the Commanders in Chief came to take their

leave of <hi>Sultan Ibrahim</hi>) they divided into two Squadrons; one of which consisting of 20 Gallies, under the Command of <hi>Beker</hi> Basha, took their Voyage into the Black Sea; the remainder under the Captain Pasha, sailed for <hi>Cyprus,</hi> with intention to do Justice on the Pasha of that Island, whose Riches gained by Oppression, had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> him from due Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience towards his Prince; and being arrived there, without rumour or noise, giving signs of good will and respects towards the Pasha, one day he sent to invite him aboard to banquet with him; where the Pasha fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishly coming, and having well eaten and drank with him, his entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had not time to digest, before he breathed his last; for being on his departure, the Slaves assaulted him, and strangled him by Order of the Captain Pasha. No other matters remarkable did the Turkish Fleet perform this Year at Sea, before they returned again to their Winter Quarters. Howsoever this Year proved favourable to many poor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in Slavery; for there happening a most miserable Plague in <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> which relaxed the spirits of men, and rendered every one so neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in his Office, that about 4000 Slaves taking advantage of such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missness in their Guardians, seized a Ship in Port, and crouding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves therein, set Sail, and landed some of their people at <hi>Candia,</hi> others at <hi>Malta,</hi> the rest at <hi>Marseillia,</hi> by which means they happily regained their liberty: on which incouragement 800 more adventuring to perform the like, and fighting in a body at the Gate of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> 300 of them were slain, the rest leaped into a Gally, which though without Oars, had yet her Sails to the Yard, and having the fortune of a favourable wind, arrived safe at <hi>Candia;</hi> in like manner they became free, taking conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient passage from thence to divers parts of Christendom; these Slaves were all redemanded by the Grand Signior from the Venetians; in which no satisfaction being given, was one cause, and original of that War which afterwards ensued.</p>
                  <p>And now the Year 1644. being begun, <hi>Ragotski</hi> who was never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1644"/> but in combustions, and never at case but when he was proving new projects, made demands of certain places on the Confines of <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> scituated within the Mountains which he challenged as the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of his Son, besides other pretences, which he made in right of <hi>Bethlem Gabor.</hi> To forward which designs, moved with an inveterate enmity to the Austrian Family, he endeavoured to win the hearts of the Commonalty with a plausible Declaration for Liberty, and to throw off the Yoke which had so long gauled the neck of <hi>Hungary;</hi> whereby having raised an Army of 20000 Horse, and 30000 Foot, he entred, and spoiled the Country of his old Enemy and Neighbour the Count of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manay</hi> an Hungarian, took <hi>Solnock</hi> by Force, and Besieged <hi>Filek,</hi> and <hi>Cassovia;</hi> for suppression of which Insurrection, and Rebellion of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotski,</hi> the Emperour was forced to a War, and having Rendezvoused his Army at <hi>Presburg,</hi> the Conduct thereof was committed to the Charge of Count <hi>Puecaim.</hi> The Turks having intelligence of these Preparations for War, Commanded 20 thousand men to march into those parts, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose these Combustions on the Frontiers; with 6000 of which the Count <hi>Puecaim</hi> Encountering furiously, Assaulted and routed them. And in the mean time <hi>Ragotski</hi> laying aside all care for the War in <hi>Hungary,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed himself to Relieve <hi>Olimz</hi> in <hi>Moravia,</hi> but in his March thither he was recalled by the Inhabitants of <hi>Sendar,</hi> which is a Castle erected on a Hill near <hi>Cassovia,</hi> offering to surrender unto him; but the Governour

                     <hi>Forgatz,</hi> and the German Garrison opposing this Mutiny of the People; a Civil War began amongst themselves, but at length the advantage falling unto <hi>Ragotski,</hi> the Gates were opened unto the Transilvanians; with which success their spirits being raised to higher matters, they proceeded forward, until General <hi>Getz</hi> with a strong Body, gave a stop unto their progress. And thus was the Fire of War rekindled again in <hi>Hungary,</hi> by means of <hi>Ragotski,</hi> to whom notwithstanding the Turks would never adhere, being well acquainted with his turbulent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steady humour. In the mean time the Emperour dispatched his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour, with rich Presents to the Sultan, desiring him to forbear gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving farther assistance unto <hi>Ragotski;</hi> but what between skirmishes, propositions, and treaties, matters were not composed until the fourteenth of <hi>August,</hi> 1645. at which time all Articles were concluded, and signed between the Emperour and <hi>Ragotski.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to return now to the Affairs of <hi>Constantinople; Sultan Ibrahim</hi> having the Fortune of active and prudent Ministers, attended entirely to his Pastimes and Pleasures without prejudice to his interest, and the state of his Empire; for the first Vizier being faithful and vigilant, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately cut off those Members with the Sword which he suspected in the least manner inclinable to Sedition; amongst which were the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaws of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and <hi>Caffa.</hi> For by this kind of seasonable and speedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, the Plethory of the Ottoman Empire is commonly evacuated, and the Body Politick thereof restored to its pristine state of health and safety.</p>
                  <p>In like manner the <hi>Valede Sultana,</hi> being a Woman of great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and abilities, attended carefully to the welfare of her Son, whom She sometimes decked up, and set forth as a property of Majestick Gravity to the People, whilst She her self assumed the Authority, and carried all things with a high and imperious spirit; and being ambitious to be feared as well as honoured, She laid violent hands on the first Vizier, called <hi>Mustapha,</hi> and strangled him; for though he was an active and faithful Minister, yet because he passed something on her which She imagined did favour of Neglect, and because she apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his power, which was greatly confirmed by the interest and favour he had with the Janisaries, and their Favourers, she resolved to make him an example, as well of her revenge, as of her Power; after whose death the charge of first Vizier was conferred on <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Pasha of <hi>Damascus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The same Fate befel the Captain Pasha, who was likewise strangled for having over boldly, or peremptorily made answer to some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies of the Grand Signior; and his Office was afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on <hi>Beker</hi> Pasha of <hi>Rhodes.</hi> With such rigour as this, do the Sultans govern, who resolve to be obeyed, and to have their Commands executed without delay or contradiction.</p>
                  <p>Whilst these matters were in agitation, the Tartars forgetful of their <note place="margin">The Tartars make incursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into <hi>Poland</hi> notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Peace.</note> late Peace, made another incursion with thirty thousand Men into <hi>Russia,</hi> against whom <hi>Konispolski</hi> having made head with twenty thousand Men only, overthrew them, and killed twelve thousand, and took three thousand Prisoners, pursuing the rest to the Borders of <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachia.</hi> In like manner <hi>Wisnowick,</hi> a noble Polander, happily encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred another Party of Tartars, as they were on their return from spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Countries of <hi>Moscovia,</hi> of whom, having killed ten thousand
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98602:58"/>
Men, he recovered their Booty, and sent the rest home naked and empty. This was the true and most effectual means for the Polanders to avenge, and right their injuries, and more prevalent than Ambassies, and Messages of Complaint unto the Port, which we have experienced since, and in the present Reign of the Son of <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> to have been so far from producing matter worthy so much as the Charge of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour, that they have been retorted with ignominy, and affronts. But here <hi>Ibrahim</hi> perceiving how the Poles had avenged themselves with their own Sword, would seem to approve of the action, which he could not hinder; and to appear a sincere observer of the peace, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the Tartar <hi>Han</hi> for his unlawful incursions, which was such a satisfaction to the Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> as they never could obtain by force of Justice, Complaints, and Vertue of passive Valour, until their active fortitude took their cause in hand, and pleaded for them.</p>
                  <p>On the 19th. of <hi>March</hi> of this year a fourth Son was born to <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Ibrahim,</hi> and on the 19th. of <hi>February</hi> following, being in the year 1645, notwithstanding all the Reports of his impotency, was born a fifth Son, named <hi>Solyman,</hi> to the Great Contentment of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>The Turks Gallies this Year under the Command of <hi>Beker</hi> their new Captain Pasha made an attempt on the Coast of <hi>Calabria,</hi> bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from thence two hundred Slaves; and attempting the like near <hi>Corton</hi> paid for their former Booty, with the loss of five hundred Men.</p>
                  <p>Howsoever, the Gallies of <hi>Malta</hi> being six in number, had better suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess as to themselves, though the consequences thereof proved fatal to the Venetians, having given the first occasion of that long War, which afterwards ensued between the Turk and them. The truth of which Story is this, free of all Romance or Fable, which the Knights of St. <hi>John</hi> or <hi>Malta</hi> would mix therewith: It happened that the Kuzlir Aga, <note place="margin">The story of the Kuzlir A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga, his Slave and Son taken by the Malte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> or Chief Eunuch which governs the Women in the Signiors Seraglio, having cast his Eye on a fair Slave, then set to sale by a Persian Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, became so enamoured of her that he purchased her for himself, under the notion of a Virgin, at the price of 450. Dollars; but the Eunuch had not long entertained this Lady in his service, before she proved with Child, not by him (you may conceive) if you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand how the Eunuchs of this Country are disarm'd of their virility: at which he was so greatly offended, that he banished her from his Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and confined her to the house of his Steward. The time being come for her to be delivered of her great Belly, it proved a Son, and some months after, the Aga being desirous to see the Babe, was so pleased with the Aspect of it, that he resolved to adopt it for his own, ordering it Cloaths, and other necessaries agreeable to its Condition. It happened that about that time <hi>Sultan Mahomet</hi> (which now reigns) was then born, and there wanting a Nurse for the Child, this beautiful Slave was preferred to the honour; so that she was entertained near two years in the Seraglio: during which time <hi>Sultan Ibrahim</hi> took such an affection to the Nurses Boy, that he loved him better than his own eldest Son, who was of a bad Complexion, and of no better air in his Face than his Father, and took great delight to play and sport with him, at which the Mother of <hi>Sultan Mahomet</hi> was so displeased, that She could not longer endure either Nurse or her Boy, and for her sake took so much displeasure against the Kuzlir Aga, who preferred her, that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98602:59"/>
neither his presence nor service were acceptable; and so violent she was in her passion, that one day, when <hi>Sultan Ibrahim</hi> was playing with his Women and Children in the Garden, according to his usual Custom, throwing them one on the other into the Water, the Queen grew so fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, that she could not contain longer from venting her Anger in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hansome terms, and Jealousy against the Nurse and her Son. At which the Sultan being much displeased, and being ill natured (if we may speak boldly of an Emperour) took her Son which is now <hi>Sultan Mahomet,</hi> out of her Arms, and with some few Curses swung him into a Cistern, where he had been certainly drowned, had not every one in that instance ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied themselves to saye him; at which time he received the mark or scar he wears at this day in his Forehead. All these matters served for far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fuel to nourish the implacable Spirit of the Queen, which the Kuzlir Aga well observing, judged it prudence to give way to her Fury, and so begged his Dismission from the Court, together with his Slave and Son, and that having visited <hi>Mecha,</hi> according to his Law, he might enjoy a retirement in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which is the Portion of banished Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs.</p>
                  <p>The Queen easily consented hereunto, nor was it difficult to procure the Licence of the Sultan, who was as easily perswaded to any by those who were about him; wherefore the Eunuch having provided to be gone, Shipped himself with his great Treasure, on the Fleet which was now designed, and ready to depart for <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which consisted of three Ships; one a great Gallion, and two others of lesser burthen, and 7 Saiks; these having at the beginning of their Voyage found contrary Winds, put into <hi>Rhodes;</hi> from whence loosing with more favourable weather, they unfortunately met with 6 <hi>Malta</hi> Gallies, excellently well <note place="margin">The Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Turkish, with the <hi>Malta</hi> Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</note> Manned, and provided. The Admiral Gally immediately Boarded one of the Saiks, and took her, Manned only by Greeks; by whom they were informed of the condition, quality, and Cargo, of the greater Ship, which gave heat, and resolution to the Souldiery. In like manner, with little Opposition, the Gallies called the <hi>St. John,</hi> and <hi>Joseph,</hi> pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed themselves of one of the lesser Ships, which being laden only with Timber, brought from the Black Sea, to build Ships at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> was of little value, having 40 Turks aboard, 8 Women, and a Child which sucked at the Mothers Breast. In the mean time, the three other Gallies, called the <hi>St. Mary, St. Lorenzo,</hi> and <hi>Victory,</hi> attacked the great Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and having cast their Iron Graples into the Ship, with the motion of the Ship, the Irons gave way and broke, only that of the <hi>St. Lorenzo</hi> held fast, so that the whole force of the Ship, both of small and great Shot, was poured in upon the Gally, to their damage and loss of men. In the mean time the Admiral Gally came in to their assistance, and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulting the Ship on the other Quarter, made a Diversion of their men, and having thrown in their Graples, they scaled the sides of the Gallion, as if it had been a Fortress; where being entred, they remained for some time at handy-blows with the Turks; but at length, all the Gallies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their help, having made an end of subduing the other Ships, the Turks were forced to retire under Covert of their Decks, which they defended still with singular valour, wounding the Christians with their half Pikes through the Gratings. But in fine, the Captains of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, perceiving that this was not the way to compel them to a speedy Surrender, ordered several Musquetiers out of every Gally, to fire in at
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98602:59"/>
the Windows, and loop-holes of the Ship; by which having killed their Commander in Chief, their Valour and Constancy began to fail, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to save their lives with loss of Liberty and Estates, they cast down their Armes, and begged mercy.</p>
                  <p>In this Engagement were killed the Captain of the <hi>St. Mary,</hi> and seven Gavaliers, of which five were French, one Italian, and one German; the Admiral himself and the Captain of his Gally were both wounded; 79 Souldiers and Mariners killed, and 132 wounded; of the Turks it is not certain how many fell, in regard as they were killed, according to Custom they cast them over-Board; the Eunuch himself though always educated in the softness of the Seraglio, and in the Conversation of the Female Court, yet in the end concluded his days like one of the Mascu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Sex, fighting valiantly with his Sword, until over-whelmed by his Enemies: by which it is observable, that those persons loss not their Courage with their virile parts; for it hath been known in former days, how that Eunuchs have been Generals in the Turkish and other Armies, and Conducted their affairs with admirable Courage and Success.</p>
                  <p>The prize which the Christians had gained in this manner, was very considerable; for besides the Gold, Silver, and Jewels, which were theTreasure this Eunuch had amassed in the Reign of three several Sultans; they gained 350 Slaves, besides 30 Women, some of which were young and Virgins; so that there was not a Souldier or Seaman who had not a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble share of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

With this Fortune, towing their prizes, they in a short time came to an Anchor in the Port of <hi>Calismene,</hi> in the Island of <hi>Candia,</hi> called antiently <hi>Phenice,</hi> on the South-side of the Island, remote from all Venetian Garrisons; and where (as it is reported) they were supplyed with no Provisions, excepting a small quantity of Biskot, which was furnished by a Country Fellow, who for that very cause was shot to death: Front hence the Gallies departing, arrived in <hi>Malta</hi> with their Prizes, where they were received in great Triumph. The young Son of the Eunuch (for so we call him) was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to be a Son of the Grand Signior, sent into <hi>Egypt</hi> to be Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and was accordingly saluted, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>The news hereof arriving at the Ottoman Court, <hi>Sultan Ibrahim</hi> was transported with Anger, threatning Destruction and Ruin unto <hi>Malta;</hi> besides he shewed a most inveterate Passion against the Venetians, for not guarding the Seas from his Enemies, and for relieving them in their Ports. In which Rage and Fury, he put his own Captain Pasha to death, and Summoned the Christian Ambassadours, braving them all for the little respect was shown to his proper Shipping; and in short, was angry with all, but reserved the effect of his wrath to be poured on the Venetians, to which this accident administred the first original, and will afford us am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple matter of discourse in this ensuing History.</p>
                  <p>For the Grand Signior first made his Complaints against <hi>Venice,</hi> to their Minister, or Bailo, then residont at <hi>Constantinople</hi> called <hi>Soranço;</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging,

that contrary to the Articles of Peace, they had afforded Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions and Entertainment to his Enemies in <hi>Candia,</hi> and at a time when having made prize of his own Ship, and Domestiques of his Seraglio, they seemed with more extraordinary demonstrations of Hospitality than usual, to receive them into their Harbours. To which the Bailo made Answer, That his Majesty was ill informed of the true state of those mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; for that the Port to which the Malteses came, had neither Castle nor Fortress belonging to it; but was an open, wide, and unfortified place; for if the Grand Signior is not able to defend those Ships from ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reening as they have often done, before <hi>Rhodes</hi> it self, how was it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the Venetians to drive them from the Seas, and deny them the use of that Salt Water, which hath neither Fort nor Castle to reach and Command them? With which Answer <hi>Ibrahim</hi> seemed to remain satisfied; and matters appeared so appeased on the side of the Venetians, that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranço,</hi> though a person of a most acute and penetrating judgment, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined nothing less than a War: and though he was assured otherwise, by something that the English Ambassadour had discovered in that matter; yet because it came not first from the report of one of his own Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he would not seem to believe, or give credit thereunto, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the strong probabilities that might perswade it. Indeed Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Ministers must necessarily, with much difficulties, and less inspection govern, and penetrate affairs in the Turkish Court than in any other; because access to the great Ministers is seldom privately, or familiarly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, from whence wise men most commonly take their measures, and observations; but on the contrary, are forced to act all by the Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Druggermen or Interpreters; and as they hear with their Ears, so are they often-times beholding to their reflexions; which how subject they may be to errour, is best known to those Ministers, who have practised much, and long in that Court.</p>
                  <p>And in this manner <hi>Ibrahim</hi> covered his design against <hi>Candia,</hi> by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of making War upon <hi>Malta,</hi> to which he had lately received so just a provocation. To this enterprize none instigated him more, than a certain Hagia, or Tutor, which had accompanied him in the time of his solitude, and had instructed him in the first Principles of the Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Doctrine; he was a subtle, and understanding Man, and one who kept a secret correspondence in the Christian Courts; for being Master of what Gold he pleased, he paid for his intelligence with liberality and secrecy; and though he was no Prophet, yet he pretended to be a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician, or Conjurer, or one that had a Command or Soveraignty over familiar Spirits; an excellency greatly admired, and reverenced by the Turks. This man had for a long Season attended an opportunity to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a War against <hi>Venice;</hi> esteeming their Territories very convenient to be laid to the Turkish Dominions, and their force an under-Match for the puissance of the Ottoman Empire. And now this accident provoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the desire of the Turks to this War, and the opportunity appearing commodious to cover the design, under pretence of Assailing <hi>Malta,</hi> it was secretly resolved to attempt the Island of <hi>Candia;</hi> for as its strength and situation made it the Key to all the other Isles of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> so it would be the Bullwark of the Maritime Countries, from whence the passage would be short and easy into <hi>Africa;</hi> from whence the Gallies might advantagiously relieve <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and guard the Fleet from <hi>Egypt,</hi> and from thence might be opened a Door to invade <hi>Sicily,</hi> and the other
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98602:60"/>
Parts of <hi>Italy.</hi> On these Considerations War being resolved against <hi>Candia,</hi> reports divulged the design only against <hi>Malta,</hi> and for that end, orders were issued for building and fitting a hundred Gallies, and as many Ships of War; and Commands sent into <hi>Barbary</hi> for assistance of all their Naval Forces, and the day appointed for Rendezvous, and departure, all which time the enterprize was kept secret, and by no more symptoms suspected, unless by the unusual caresses the Turks at that time over-acted in their officious kindness towards the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Bailo.</p>
                  <p>The report of these great preparations slying over all Parts of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> was entertained at <hi>Malta,</hi> with some apprehensions, as being the Place on which all the storm was to refund its fury. Whereupon the Cavaliers or Knights of that Place summoning a Council, resolved to cite all the Fraternity to repair to the defence of their Capital Seat, and of their order and patrimony: Likewise Letters were directed to the several Officers, to prepare and send Powder, Match, and Lead, iron Buckets, Timber to make Carriages for Cannon, and for other uses, as also Corn, Bisket, Salt, Flesh and Fish, Vinegar, Wine, and all other sorts of Ammunition. They likewise instituted some Officers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the waters, to see that the Fountains and Conduits should be made clear, which were to serve the City, and that those without, that were to remain in the possession of the Enemy, should be carefully and artisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially poisoned, all the Mills remaining in the Fields were transported into the Town, the Doors and Windows of Wood belonging to the Peasants houses were taken down, and carried into the City, with all their Utensils, and what else was portable, so that nothing remained but the wide Fields, and an open Air to breathe in.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the Venetians being a wise and jealous State, sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the worst of all Events, and feared what their Minister at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> could not discover, which caused them to make some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations; but yet with that dexterity and secresy, as not to render them diffident of the Turks proceedings. For to be jealous of a Friend, is sometimes to make him an Enemy, and distrust always argues disaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which Prudence teaches to conceal from those who are more powerful than our selves. Some were notwithstanding of opinion, that the Complaints of <hi>Ibrahim</hi> were only artisices to extract the Blood of Gold, which they judged sit to administer, if it were possible to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Appetite of those Leaches. Others were of a contrary sense, and would by no means admit it for good counsel, or policy, to buy their Peace of the Turk; for besides that it was disagreeable to the Crandear of <hi>Venice,</hi> it was but a shadow that they purchased, since their Enemies could on every slight occasion reassume what they had sold, and make the menaces of War, and the Sale of Peace serve them for a perpetual Fountain, and Mine of Gold and Treasure; and that since it was necessary at one time or other to cast off this yoke of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, the sooner it was done, the advantage would be the greater, and the honour more apparent to the World, seeming to make War ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their choice than their last remedy. Howsoever, orders were given to the Bailo, with all Prudence and Art to touch gently the Pulse of the Turks, to discover if money would redeem the present quiet of their State. But the resentment that the Turks had conceived was grown apparent in the comportment towards the Bailo; for having
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98602:61"/>
one day demanded Audience, he attended several hours without admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; yet when the Ambassadour of <hi>Ragotski</hi> come to the Vizier, he no sooner entred the house than he was received: and at the same time it was told the Bailo, that he might retire, for that there was no place nor season at present to afford him Audience. In the mean time, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> himself walked often to the Arsenal, to forward and hasten his prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, laying an Embargo on all Strangers Vessels in all Ports of the Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman Dominions. Orders were likewise dispatched to <hi>Thebes, Negro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pont,</hi> and other Parts of <hi>Greece</hi> for making Bisket, and to <hi>Morca</hi> for cutting and squaring Timbers, and sacking Wools to fill up Trenches; in all which rumour and stir there was no other discourse but of <hi>Malta,</hi> and of throwing that Island into the Sea with the Shovel and Mattock, and rendring it the most dreadful example in the World of the Ottoman Rage and Greatness.</p>
                  <p>With such preludes as these began a War of long continuance, maintained with various successes for divers Years, the fatal issue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we our selves have seen and heard. But it is strange to consider, that an Exploit so Martial as this should commence in the Reign of a Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan wholly given up to his Pleasures, and so swallowed in sensuality, that all those luxurious and wanton actions which are recounted of <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> and <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> are flat and faint Similitudes of that prodigious effeminacy, in which this Sultan outdid all other examples of former Ages.</p>
                  <p>Amber was the common perfumes which burned perpetually in the Womens Apartments, and the common Sauce to most of his Viands; not perhaps because it so much pleased his Palate, as that it was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocative, and incitement to his Lusts. And this puts me in mind of a story I have heard of an English Merchant, living then at <hi>Galata,</hi> who was master of a rare piece of Ambergriese, which was in form like a Pyramid; the News whereof was told to the Grand Signior late at Night, when the smoak of the Perfumes began to abate: Which so soon as he heard, though it was near Midnight, he dispatched a Messenger to call the Merchant with his Ambergriese; who being knocked out of his Bed in haste, by the importunity of the Officer, came to the Seraglio Gate two hours before day, where he attended until it was broad light, and then without more words found a Market for his Amber, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his departure received thirteen thousand Dollars. The Female Court was then extreamly rich and splendid, all <hi>Italy</hi> was scarce able to supply it with Silks, and Cloath of Gold; so that the Trade was in those days flourishing above other times, and gave great employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to English Shipping; and so impatient were the Women for their Gay Cloaths, that so soon as the news of a Ship from <hi>Italy</hi> came, and that she was arrived within the Castles of the Hellespont, but there detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by contrary winds, Gallies were immediately dispatched to bring up their Silks, which they oftentimes forced away without any account or price made with the Merchant; of which that worthy Gentleman, Sir <hi>Thomas Bendysh,</hi> then Ambassadour, complaining to the Vizier, and finding no other relief than good words, resolved on an expedient of making known his cause to the Grand Signior, which was this. In <hi>Turkie</hi> they have a Custom, that when any one receives a notable inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or injustice from the Chief and great Ministers of State, they put fire on their heads, and running to the Grand Signior, no man can hinder
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98602:61"/>
or deny them access to his presence. In like manner the English Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour not being able to obtain satisfaction from the Vizier, in return to his many Complaints, drew out all the English Ships in <hi>Galata,</hi> which were then 13 in number, and drawing in their Guns, and shutting the Ports, put fire on every Yard Arm of their Ships, and came to an Anchor just before the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> The Customer being the first that espyed this unusual sight, immediately apprehended the reason, and sent to acquaint the Vizier thereof in all haste; the Vizier likewise fearful lest the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints should by this means come to the Grand Signiors Ear, sent the Customer aboard with a considerable part of the money, and desired that the Fires might be extinguished, promising faithfully to comply in payment of the rest; hereupon Consultation being had between the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour and the Merchants, the Ships returned to their Stations, not seeming to have been taken notice of by those in the Seraglio.</p>
                  <p>And notwithstanding the great number of Women within the Serag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio, all which were at the Devotion of the Sultan; yet <hi>Ibrahim</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contented herewith, passing one day to <hi>Scutari,</hi> had by chance cast his eye on an object which much pleased him: what it was, becomes not the modesty of my Pen to relate; but being returned to his Seraglio, he sent Orders to the Vizier, to seek out for him the biggest, and best pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned Woman which was to be found in all <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and the parts thereabouts. Hereupon Emissaries were dispatched into all Quarters of the City; at length they happily procured a huge tall Armenian Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, well proportioned according to her height, and a Giantess for her Stature; which being found, she was presently washed and perfumed in the Bath, and as richly Clothed and Adorned as the shortness of time would permit: There was no great difficulty to perswade her to become Turk, having so high preferment in her prospect. So that being introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the Grand Signiors presence, he became immediately Enamoured, and was so pleased with her Society, that he preferred her before all the Women of his Court; an Evidence whereof he gave, in that he could not deny her in any request she could make, and particularly about that time the Pashaluck of <hi>Damascus</hi> being void, this Woman begged it for her self, substituting another in the Office, who was accountable to her for all the profits and emoluments thereof: By these particulars of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Queen Mother becoming jealous, one day inviting her to Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, caused her to be Strangled, and perswaded <hi>Ibrahim</hi> that she died suddenly of a violent Sickness, at which he poor Man was greatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.</p>
                  <p>But not to insist long on these luxurious pastimes, we shall return again to matters of higher concernment: <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had now understood, that the Venetians growing jealous of his Preparations, began likewise to Arm, and provide for the worst; which being in no wise pleasing to the Turks, who were apprehensive that their Marine Forces consisted most in surprize, caused <hi>Ibrahim</hi> to complain of the defensive posture, in which they Arrayed themselves, alledging that suspicions of this nature argued no hearty disposition towards their Friends, nor was any thing more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to a good correspondence, or more disobliging than such like Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies, which oft times beget that enmity which was never designed; and farther it was judged necessary if possible, to disswade the Bailo from a belief of any Hostility designed against his Republick; to inculcate which none was esteemed so proper an instrument as the old cheating
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98602:62"/>
                     <hi>Hogia,</hi> who was the first motive to the War; a Preacher who imagined that the excellency of his Religion afforded him a priviledge to falsifie, lye and commit any act for advantage thereof, though never so contrary to truth and Morality. This <hi>Santone</hi> with the testimony of one or two more grand Professors, with many Asseverations and Vows, endeavoured to perswade the Bailo, of the Grand Signiors good intentions towards <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> and his fixed resolutions to destroy <hi>Malta.</hi> And though the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment which those godly Elders showed, and the earnestness they used, whereby to inculcate a credence to what they affirmed, were enough to discover their contrary intentions; and though it is said, that the Venetians could not heartily believe what they so strongly suspected; yet hereby, and by the common vogue of the people, they abated much of their caution and heat, which they otherwise had used in due prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and provisions against an evil so fatal and destructive in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel. The first Act of Hostility was committed by <hi>Giacomo da Riva,</hi> who <note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the War.</note> being sent for Sopraveditor to <hi>Tino,</hi> was in his way to touch at <hi>Candia,</hi> there to deliver Ammunition and Provisions for War; but being encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by some barbarous Vessels, who assailed him for a Merchants Ship of small force, were received so warmly that he sunk one of them, with which the rest left him and fled, relating at <hi>Constantinople</hi> that they had been ill treated by the Venetians, and that they gave the first Assault upon them, because that they were called to the assistance and service of the Grand Signior.</p>
                  <p>The Fleet and Land Forces being already put to Sea, the report and opinion still continued, that the War was designed against <hi>Malta;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such as apprehended the hazard, and were acquainted with the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of such an enterprize, began to inform the Grand Signior how impossible it was, that this action should be accompanied with good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess. To which arguments he made no other reply than by a seeming ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy, resolved with the Ottoman Sword to cut all those knots and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties which opposed him in the work. At length one <hi>Salee Efendi,</hi> a Preacher, who had obtained some more than ordinary esteem with the Grand Signior, advised him, that before he commenced a work of that importance, he should inform himself of the true state of that place, from a certain Aga, who was lately returned from <hi>Malta.</hi> The Grand Signior being very willing to hear any thing of this nature, called the Aga, who related to him how impregnable both the City and Castle were; how the Knights were provided against all Assaults; that the Island it self is only a Rock, not containing Earth enough for an Army to intrench; that the approaches must be made by the Pick-Axe and Mattock, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Stone. In short, it was not a place to be taken in one Summer, and the Winter coming on, it affording no shelter, nor provisions of it self, was not capable of relief in Seas so stormy, and from Countries so remote, without hazards, losses, and frequent Shipwracks. <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> who had designed all along to make War upon <hi>Candia,</hi> seemed little concerned or moved at this Discourse. The Gallies and Ships which were now all in a readiness, being come forth to the Seraglio point, the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior entered his Grand Chiosk, situated on the Bank of the Sea; where the Selictar Aga, General, and all the Chief Commanders, came to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the usual Ceremonies of Obedience and Duty before their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. At this solemn Assembly the Grand Signior declared, that his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions were to make War upon the Infidels, according as every one
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98602:62"/>
should understand by his respective Commissions, which should now be delivered unto them: That he expected the highest demonstrations of Courage in them imaginable, and what was agreeable to the Conductors of the Ottoman Armies: That reward and punishment were in his hands, and that he resolved to dispense them according to their merits: That they should not doubt of all due assistance and succours; for he had so well contrived, and so justly fitted all his measures, that he was all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready provided of Men, Timber, Ammunition, and money sufficient to maintain and carry on this War for seven Years. At which they all gave a shout, and declared, that they were ready to spend their Bloud and Lives in Execution of his Commands. Whereupon every one received a rich Coftan, or Vest, and the General a Scimitar set with Diamonds; who being a young Man of about 26. or 27. Years of Age, had a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of six graver Pasha's allowed him, and then the Commission for the War was brought forth sealed, with Orders not to open it, until they were past the <hi>Dardanelli.</hi> Hereat the noise of great and small shot from the Gallies and Ships, resounded through all <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders repairing to their Vessels, the Assembly broke up, and every thing was put in a posture to make Sail.</p>
                  <p>It was now the last day of <hi>April,</hi> 1645. old style, when the Fleet first <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1645"/> broke ground, which consisted of 73. Gallies, besides the 8. Gallies of <hi>Barbary,</hi> 2. Mahons, or Galleasses, one great Gallion called the <hi>Sultana,</hi> 10. Ships of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> 2. of <hi>Tunis,</hi> and 10. of English and Dutch Ships, which coming to <hi>Constantinople</hi> for Trade, were there pressed into the Service, with about 300. Saiks, and Caramussals, which carried Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Provisions, Ammunitions, and Utensils for War. Their Militia con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted of 7000. Janisaries, 14000. Spahees, and about 50000. Timariots, and other Souldiers, with about 3000. Pioniers; these all were to Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous at <hi>Scio;</hi> where they arrived the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>May.</hi> But before their departure from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the Bailo <hi>Soranço,</hi> or the Venetian Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour, thought fit in Complement, and for discovery, to make a visit to the Captain Pasha, by whom he was received with frank courtesy and assurance of Friendship; so that though he suspected the worst, yet could he collect no certain assurances of Peace, or War; however he advised Signior <hi>Cornaro,</hi> then Governour of <hi>Candia,</hi> that though he could not certainly penetrate into the bottom of the Turks design, yet he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended that the storm might fall on that Kingdom, understanding that the Captain Pasha was not well inclined towards the most Serene Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick: wherefore, he ought to be watchful and circumspect, yet with as little demonstration of jealousy as was possible; so that if the Turks should there arrive, he should afford them all conveniencies of Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Provisions, and other refreshments.</p>
                  <p>The Fleet being departed from <hi>Scio,</hi> for <hi>Napoli di Romagnia,</hi> the Northern Wind so freshned, and blew so hard, that the Gallies were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, and forced to put into divers Ports, and the Saiks and Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mussals to Anchor at <hi>Micono,</hi> and <hi>Tino.</hi> At the latter of which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Venetians, they had licence to Water, and were refreshed with such Provisions as the Island afforded; and now after this slurry of Wind, the Fleet being again united, they were seen off at Sea from <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigo,</hi> an Island of the Venetians at the Mouth of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> and sailing towards the Channel of <hi>Braccio de Maina;</hi> and the next day 9. Gallies, a Gallion, and a Brigantine, made towards the Isle of <hi>Cerigo,</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:98602:63"/>
and sent a Letter ashore by a Boat to the Proveditor, from the Pasha of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> demanding their usual present of Coffee and Sugar, which was given them, they assuring all friendship, and real good intentions towards the People, and Dominions of <hi>Venice.</hi> But in the mean time a Satia laden with Armes and Ammunition from <hi>Venice,</hi> bound for <hi>Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> unhappily falling into the Turkish Fleet was intercepted by them, and taken, which unmasked all the design, and made the Turks appear in their true colours, notwithstanding all their religious Protestations, and outwardly fair Comportment, the usual disguise of the Mahometan sincerity.</p>
                  <p>Towards the end of <hi>May</hi> the Turkish Fleet was discovered from <hi>Carabuso,</hi> a small Fortress of the Venetians, some distance off at Sea, standing to the Westward, which gave some jealousie to them at <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia;</hi> and being compared with some precedent Acts, as that of sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the depth of water about St. <hi>Theodoro</hi> with a Brigantine, (which is a small Rock lying off of <hi>Canea</hi>) which pretended to come from <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta Maura</hi> with Turky Merchants, afforded undeniable grounds of assurance to those in <hi>Candia,</hi> that the War was designed against them; howsoever, the Ottoman Fleet rendezvousing again at <hi>Navarino,</hi> a place far distant from <hi>Candia,</hi> altered their apprehensions at <hi>Venice,</hi> and elsewhere of this War, deeming it now certain, that this design had no other aim or mark but that of <hi>Malta.</hi> But this opinion was no sooner entertain'd, than it was confuted by open acts of hostility; for the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Pasha being arrived at Cape <hi>Colonna,</hi> by some called <hi>Sunio,</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately dispatched a Brigantine to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> with advice of his proceedings and intentions to pass directly for <hi>Candia;</hi> whereupon it was thought seasonable to publish the War against <hi>Venice,</hi> which was performed with committing the Ambassadour <hi>Soranço</hi> to Prison, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving orders through all the <hi>Archipelago</hi> to destroy or enslave all the Subjects of that Republick. And here the Turk practised his usual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of War with more than ordinary caution; for though with other Princes, whose Territories border on him by Land, he usually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to strike at the same time when he gives the salutations of Peace; Yet here being to contend at Sea, where he is conscious his Forces are inferiour to those of <hi>Venice,</hi> he practised all those feigned ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisices, confirmed with as many holy Vows and Protestations, as their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion hallows, and makes lawful, when they can bring advantage and encrease to the Mahometan Faith.</p>
                  <p>But though the Venetian Republick was so politick as outwardly to demonstrate a religious confidence of their potent Neighbour, whom they were conscious not to have provoked by any breach of Capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; yet were not so secure of his Faith, and so easie to believe his fair dissimulations, as not prudently to provide against the utmost effects of his power and treachery. Wherefore, whilst the Turk prepared, they armed likewise secretly, made considerable Levies without noise, commissionated thirty extraordinary Commanders of Gallies, took up seventeen English, and Dutch ships into their service, armed out two Galliasses extraordinary, and when the Turk had unmasked his design, they then imparted their condition to all the Christian Princes, craving their succour and assistance to maintain the common Bulwark of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom</hi> against the common Enemy. The Galleasses were commanded by <hi>Girolamo Morosini;</hi> the Gallies, of which fifteen were made ready, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98602:63"/>
afterwards put to Sea, all commanded by Noblemen, were under the Conduct of <hi>Antonio Capello. Francesco Molino</hi> was made Proveditor Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, a Person of untainted Justice and Honour, and extraordinary zealous and vigilant in the Publick Interest, whose undefatigable labours and care of his Countrey promoted him afterwards to be Doge of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</hi> By his order and counsel extraordinary Proveditours were sent to <hi>Candia, Cerigo,</hi> and <hi>Tino,</hi> as Places most feared, and in danger, and orders were dispatched to <hi>Andrea Cornaro,</hi> then General and Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in <hi>Candia,</hi> to arme out twenty Gallies from the Arsenal of <hi>Canea;</hi> and to promote this design the better, he hired two English, and one Dutch Ship, then in Port of <hi>Malomocco,</hi> to carry unto <hi>Candia</hi> Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers sitted, and already squared at <hi>Venice,</hi> for building Gallies; besides which he sent Cannon, Corn, and all Ammunition of War, with fifty thousand Zecchins in Gold for encouragement of the Militia, with a recruit of two and twenty Companies of Foot, formed and collected out of divers Nations. Intelligence being come of the imprisonment of the Bailo at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the Senate by a common and unanimous suffrage elected <hi>Francesco Erizzo,</hi> then Doge General of the Sea, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that their Armes would prosper under his Command, which had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been successful under the auspicious Conduct of his Ancestors; and he, though a person of seventy four years, worn out with Age and Cares of the Publick, did yet chearfully consecrate the remainder of his days to the service of his Country. But whilst he prepared to crown the end of his Life with the Glory of this important and generous enterprize, Death terminated all his intentions, leaving him with the honourable memory of his past actions, and with a Lawrel hanging over his head, which had his Life continued, had been planted on his Brows. But that this accident might not give interruption to the weighty Affairs now in hand, <hi>Molino</hi> took his place, and proceeded in his Voyage and designs, and arrived with the Venetian Fleet at the Island of <hi>Corfu.</hi> In the mean time the Turkish Fleet careened and fitted themselves at <hi>Navarine</hi> with all necessaries to assault <hi>Candia;</hi> in which interim advice came to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea,</hi> that the Bailo was imprisoned at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> by a Letter from <hi>Soranço</hi> himself; which he had dropped from the Window of his close restraint, and dispatched by one of his Confidents with a Vessel, express; which was not sooner arrived than it was that Night confirmed by all the Beacons or Watch-Towers of the Countrey; who having disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Turkish Fleet far distant at Sea, gave a general Alarm by the Fires they made. The next Morning being the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> of <hi>June,</hi> they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the whole Fleet, near Cape <hi>Spada,</hi> which being drawn up in the form of a half Moon, took up a vast tract of Sea; and sailing slowly with fair Weather, and a smooth Sea, displayed themselves with the greatest terrour imaginable to the Islanders. At length the lighter Vessels began to edge in with the Bank of <hi>Gogna,</hi> (which is a place distant about eighteen miles from <hi>Canea</hi>) and were followed by the grosser and heavier part of the Armata. And now before I proceed farther I should make a pause, and describe the antiquity, the Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy, and the present state of this famous and renowned Island, but that is already performed so distinctly and elegantly by other Pens, that it shall be sufficient for me to declare here in brief terms, how this Kingdome became the Patrimony or Possession of <hi>Venice.</hi> In the year 1204. a Sale thereof was made to this Republick, by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98602:64"/>
                     <hi>Bonifaccio</hi> of <hi>Mont serratto,</hi> by an Instrument sealed the 12<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust</hi> at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and signed, and delivered, in the presence of <hi>Marco Sanudo,</hi> and <hi>Ravano, du Verona,</hi> Ambassadours in the time of <hi>Enrigo Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dola</hi> Doge; but the people of this Island not consenting unto the sale, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed themselves against it, until the Venetians by force of Armes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured their Obedience, and confirmed their purchase by a double Title. Hereupon such noble Citizens as adventured their Lives in this acquisition, obtained the Estates of the Rebellious Greeks, being obliged in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Lands they held, to maintain Men and Horse at their own charge, and are therefore called the Feudatary Cavalry. So that the whole Country is divided into three parts; <hi>viz.</hi> the noble Venetians or Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; secondly, the noble Candiots, or Colony, which were Infantry that came to inhabit from <hi>Venice;</hi> and thirdly, the Greeks or Natives of the Country which never rebelled, but took part with the Venetian State: the first two speak Italian, and are of the Roman Church; the others speak Greek, and conserve the right of that Religion.</p>
                  <p>The Ottoman Fleet now touching the shoar at <hi>Gogna,</hi> took Livery and seizin quietly of that flourishing Isle of <hi>Candia,</hi> where they En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped a while to refresh their Forces, and prepare all things in order to their Conquest. In the mean time, the news hereof Alarmed all <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> and not only hastened them in the expedition of their Fleet, but warmed their applications to all Christian Princes, from whom they cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved help in the general defence of Christendom: which some at first imagined would have been granted as it was once in the time of the holy War; or that those whom the Declaration of a common Crusada, or Devotion, or sense of Religion could not move, yet at least the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of their Countries defence, or the maintenance of a Bulwark of Christendom, might perswade to wage Arms against the Turk, as a Common Enemy: but what cold apprehensions the Christian Princes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained hereof, both the faint supplies and assistances they administred, and their bloody and vigorous Wars one against another, have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly testified, to the fatal loss and ruine of that Country. And though in the beginning there were better hopes, by means of the Popes earnest intercession with all the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> to whom he showed a fair Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, by uniting his own Gallies with the Venetian Fleet, and amongst the rest prevailed also with the Republick of <hi>Genoua,</hi> to employ their Gallies in this noble enterprize, which tended to the Glory of God, and the common safety and preservation of <hi>Italy:</hi> yet that leaven of vain punctilio's, which hath so often betrayed the Christian Cause to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Turk, gave a stop for some time to these proceedings. For before they would enter into Armes, they desired the Genoeses, that the right of bearing the Flag should first be determined in favour of their Admiral, before that of <hi>Toscany,</hi> or <hi>Malta:</hi> and though the Pope to take away this occasion of dispute, proposed to have no other Flag worn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his own, under which all Italian Princes without impeachment of their honour, as Auxiliaries, and Military Adventurers might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseuously wage War; yet this could not appear satisfactory to the Geno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eses, who not only took this occasion to demand the precedency before <hi>Toscany</hi> and <hi>Malta;</hi> to which the G. Duke (who was not inferiour in State, and superiour in Title) and the Malteses (who time out of mind, and by Decree of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, claimed Precedency on the Seas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them) would never assent; but also thought sit to avail themselves
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98602:64"/>
in this Conjuncture, to obtain from the Pope the Grant of a Royal Court; and that treatment which is given to Kings, or Crowned Heads. But because these demands seemed to contain those difficulties in them, which could not be granted without the manifest displeasure of other Princes; the Pope resolved to afford what assistance he could from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and therefore granted a Leavy of a thousand Foot out of his own Dominions, with free liberty to buy what Ammunition, and Provisions were to be found in the Ecclesiastical State, with imposition of a double tith or tenth on the goods and Dominions of the Clergy; so that these succours of the Pope, and the Auxiliary Forces of <hi>Naples, Toscany,</hi> and <hi>Malta,</hi> under the Command of Prince <hi>Ludovisio,</hi> General of the Church, being united to the Venetian Fleet, did speedily compose a most puissant and formidable Force; however by reason of dissentions amongst the Commanders, and other misfortunes derived from thence, to the Christian Arms, nothing succeeded fortunately this Year. For the Turks having gained their landing at first without opposition, overthrew the Christians in several small Skirmishes, and afterwards forced <hi>Canea,</hi> the second City of that Island, which they took with much blood and slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Christians.</p>
                  <p>The Turks having made so successful a progress this first Year, as to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1646"/> possess themselves of one of the most considerable Cities, took Courage to proceed in their Conquests; in which they had the fortune to make themselves Masters in the next place of <hi>Retimo;</hi> in defence of which, the General <hi>Andrea Cornaro,</hi> lost his Life by a Musket shot. Nor more successful were the Venetians this Year at Sea; for what with quarrels amongst the Commanders, and with their coldness, and negligence in their business, they suffered the Turkish Vessels to pass freely, without giving them that interruption which was very facil to men resolute and concerned: Nor was the opportunity which presented to ruine the Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Fleet made use of, then lying half disarmed, and ill provided, at the Isle of <hi>St. Theodoro,</hi> (which is a Rock opposite to <hi>Canea</hi>) where at that time it is believed they might all have been burned, had the occasion been improved, agreeable to that advantage which then offered: so that towards the latter end of the Year, the General <hi>Molino</hi> returning home, either by reason of some distemper, or by revocation from the Senate, which seemed to be ill satisfied with his ill fortune, or his ill manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the publick Affairs; he was dismissed from his high Charge. And <hi>Gio. Cipello,</hi> Procurator of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> was constituted in his place.</p>
                  <p>This new General early in the Year departed from <hi>Venice,</hi> having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1647"/> his Command, 50. Gallies, 6. Galleasses, and 40. Ship of War, and 4. Fireships, besides other Vessels which are necessary Attendants on so great an Armata; which grand preparations raised the minds of the Christian World to expect the abatement of the Ottoman Pride, and other effects equal to the magnificent ostentation, and triumphing glory of this mighty power: but God who gives not always success to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, nor the Battel to the strong, was not, it seems, so well satisfied for the sins of Christendom, as to judge it worthy to be delivered from the scourges of its Grand Oppressor.</p>
                  <p>Whilst <hi>Capello</hi> remained with the best part of the Fleet at <hi>Candia, Tomaso Morosini,</hi> Admiral of the Ships, shewed himself in a Bravado <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Moro ini</hi> braves the Turkish Fleet.</note> with 22 Sail before the Castles of the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> called the <hi>Dardanelli,</hi>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:98602:65"/>
defying the whole Turkish Power, with Colours flying, and Drums beating; nor did they dare to answer the bold Challenge, until in a dead Calm, some few light Gallies presented themselves in a seeming Battel, with whom for want of Wind, the ships were on the disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and rather received prejudice than gave it; so that both sides were contented with the action. <hi>Morosini</hi> withdrew from that station and returned to his General at <hi>Candia,</hi> to whom having joyned his Forces, he earnestly perswaded him, together with the Proveditor <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mani,</hi> to engage the Turkish Fleet, which they assured him was much inferiour to them, both in number of Vessels, and in Skill, and Courage of the Combatants; and that the success of this Year consisted in the cutting off the Enemies succours, which was their sole relief and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, without which they could not longer maintain the ground they possessed, but must deliver up that and themselves to their pleasure. But the cautions General would not assent to this resolution, judging it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rash and precipitate; for that the fortune of <hi>Candia,</hi> and other Isles of the <hi>Archipelago</hi> was not to be hazarded on the success of one Battel. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which dispute, and irresolution of affairs, the Turkish Fleet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of 300. Sail, arrived at <hi>Canea,</hi> where they landed 40000. fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, which turned the scale of the War, and rendered the Turks so powerful, as not ever more to be expelled, or their off-spring extirpated from the Confines of that Island. By this time the Pope's and <hi>Malta</hi> Gallies were come to their assistance, and united with the Venetians; so that <hi>Capello</hi> setting Sail from the Port of <hi>Suda,</hi> resolved to engage the Enemy at St. <hi>Theodoro,</hi> which was effected accordingly, though with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle success; for the Turks had fortified themselves, and secured their Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies with that advantage, that they could not be assaulted without great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of the Christians; and when they endeavoured to burn them, their 4. Fireships took fire too soon, and proved of more fear and astonishment to the Turks (to whom this invention was as yet unknown) than of real dammage. After this the Venetians returned again to <hi>Suda,</hi> where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving intelligence that 30. Turkish Gallies, with men and Provision (which they had collected in several parts of the <hi>Archipelago</hi>) were on their Voyage to <hi>Canea, Capello</hi> preparing to intercept them with a force of Galleasses and Gallies, and leaving <hi>Grimani</hi> and <hi>Morosini</hi> to Gommand the main body of the Fleet, he in person bent his course towards <hi>Cerigo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Mustapha</hi> Pasha departed from <hi>Canea,</hi> in order to his return to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> with 57. light Gallies, 2. Ships, 2. Galleasses, and many Saiks; but meeting in his passage with a hard storm of Northerly Winds, he lost 7. of his Gallies, and several other Vessels, so that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to divide his Fleet, and send part of them to <hi>Scio,</hi> and himself with the other part to make for <hi>Negropont.</hi> This Fleet was followed by some other Vessels under the Command of <hi>Mahomet Celebee,</hi> Brother of the Pasha of <hi>Algier,</hi> who being as far in his way, as the narrow Streights of <hi>Andra;</hi> he was there stopped by the fury of the Northern Winds (which are the Master Winds of those Seas) and by the impetuous rage thereof, was carried to the Island of <hi>Zia;</hi> where having given Licence to the greatest part of his Souldiery to Land, they carelesly strayed abroad, and without suspicion of surprize, merrily passed their time in eating and drinking. In the interim, advice hereof being carried to <hi>Tomaso Morosini,</hi> then with some Ships in the Port of <hi>Milo;</hi> he immediately without loss of time applied himself to assault the Turks, and being followed by the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98602:65"/>
Proveditor <hi>Grimani;</hi> he took two of their Ships, whilst <hi>Mehmet Celebce</hi> with about 200. of his men, betook themselves to the weak shelter of an old demolished Fort, and afterwards surrendred themselves to the discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Conquerour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Morosini</hi> and <hi>Grimani,</hi> encouraged with this success, resolved to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue the Enemies Fleet; in order unto which, <hi>Morosini</hi> first putting out to Sea, was instantly carried away by a sierce gale of Wind towards <hi>Ambro,</hi> and separated from the rest of his Fleet, and thence again was tossed by the impetuosity of the storms unto <hi>Rafti,</hi> of which <hi>Mustapha</hi> Pasha having intelligence, made haste to attack this single Vessel, with 40. Gallies; giving order to the Bey of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> to lay him aboard with 15. Gallies, the strongest and best armed of all their Squadron: <hi>Morosini</hi> nothing dismayed, bearing the same constancy of mind in the midst of his Enemies, as at a distance, boldly showed himself on the Quarter Deck, encouraging his men with his words, and by his example, to acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons worthy their Religion, Faith, and Country, for which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. The Turks continued for some time to batter the Ship at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance with their Cannon, but with little dammage to the Christians; who returned their shot to better advantage. Hereby the Turks perceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that blows given so far off did little Execution, resolved to Board the Vessel, and subdue her by force of Armes, and being come to the side of the Ship, the Souldiers were fearful to enter, suspecting some trains of Powder to blow them up, until <hi>Emurat</hi> one of the Captains struck off the Head of one or two of his own men, whom he perceived backward in the Assault, which affrighted the rest into the greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and forced them to enter the Ship, who were soon followed by the Gallies of the Bey of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> of <hi>Milo,</hi> of <hi>Mehmet</hi> Bey, and others; so that now 200. of the Enemy were Combating with Swords and Half Pikes upon the Deck; in which storm, <hi>Morosini</hi> sighting amongst the thickest, was shot through the Head with a Musket Bullet, and so glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously finished his days in the service and defence of his Country; gaining to himself a Laurel, and an Immortal name of Glory and Renown. The Christian Souldiers little regarding all this time the fall of their General, stoutly maintained their Fight, in which they received encouragement from the prospect they had of 2. Galeasses making haste to their succour; at whose nearer approach, the Turks desisted from their farther attempt; being unwilling to purchase a Victory at the dear rate it would cost them. The Body of <hi>Morosini</hi> was transported to <hi>Venice,</hi> and his Obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Morosini</hi> slain.</note> Celebrated in a manner more Triumphant than Funebrous; the Proveditor <hi>Grimani</hi> was likewise declared Captain General in the place of <hi>Capello;</hi> who having as it were Besieged the Castles at the Mouth of the <hi>Dardanelli,</hi> taken several places in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> and put the Enemies Fleet often unto flight; he thereby, and by other acts of Valour, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him justly renowned through all Christendom.</p>
                  <p>These were the chief and most memorable actions by Sea, performed this Year; Those by Land were acted chiefly in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> where the Turks poured in their Forces on the Venetian Dominions, but were bravely repulsed by <hi>Leonardo Foscolo,</hi> who took <hi>Ali</hi> Bey Prisoner, the Commander in Chief of the Sangiac of <hi>Licca,</hi> and slew his Son; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides which, he took <hi>Saccovar, Polissano, Islan,</hi> and other Fortresses and Castles, full of Armes and Ammunition, which were the Magazines of the Country; he also recovered <hi>Novegrade</hi> out of the hands of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98602:66"/>
Turks, which was afterwards demolished by Order from the Senate; which Victories were followed with other successes; nothing being able to oppose the Valiant and Prosperous Armes of <hi>Foscolo;</hi> for besides the taking and sacking of several other Forts and Castles in <hi>Dalmatia, Obra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ozzo, Carino, Ottissina, Velino, Nadino, Urana, Tino,</hi> and <hi>Salona,</hi> in the Confines of <hi>Croatia,</hi> and <hi>Bosna,</hi> became a prey to the Venetian Armes.</p>
                  <p>But to this successful Progress of the War, a stop was given for some time by the sickness of <hi>Fosiolo;</hi> in which interim, the new Pasha of <hi>Bosna,</hi> called <hi>Mahomet Techli,</hi> a Circassian born, a person both Generous and Valiant, with an Army of 4c. thousand men, besieged the strong <note place="margin">Sebenico Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged.</note> Fortress of <hi>Sebenico;</hi> but was bravely repulsed by the Valour of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, the very Women exceeding the imbecillity of their Sex; and Children and old Men, with the weakness of their Age, strengthened themselves with resolution against their Enemies, and so valiantly beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themselves in defence of their City, that the Turk was sorced to raise his Siege, having gained nothing but the loss and slaughter of many of his people, and the best of his Souldiery; whereby he gained an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the invincible strength of that place, and the valour of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. <hi>Foscolo</hi> in like manner recovering his health, continued the un-interrupted course of his Victories, and thereunto added the taking of <hi>Scardona;</hi> so that in <hi>Dalmatia</hi> the Venetian affairs ran so prosperously, that nothing could be desired to render them more happy and glorious. For the Turks not only were expelled from the Confines of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> but likewise that Province became more quiet and secure than ever it had been in the times of Peace.</p>
                  <p>But the joy of these successes was very much allayed by the unhappy fate of a great part of the Venetian Fleet, at the Island of <hi>Psara;</hi> which <note place="margin">The ruine of the Venetian Armata at <hi>Psara.</hi>
                     </note> being lanched from <hi>Candia</hi> with intention to assault the Turks within the <hi>Dardanelli,</hi> unfortunately were driven by contrary Winds to that unse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure shore; where contending with a most furious storm, a great part of the Fleet was cast away, and the General <hi>Grimani</hi> himself drowned. About which time, the Turks for the greater terrour of the Christians, laid close Siege to the City of <hi>Candia,</hi> and made many and various at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts thereupon, carrying on their Assaults with the height of bravery and resolution, the particulars of which require a distinct History; but by the invincible Fortitude and Courage of the Christians, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed with that slaughter, and with the loss of so many men, by sallies and other stratagems of War, that the Turks were at length constrained to raise their Siege with dishonour and confusion; during which time many of the Nobility and persons of Quality lost their Lives; amongst which, the principal were, <hi>Vicenzo della Marra,</hi> Governour General of the Armes of <hi>Candia,</hi> and Count <hi>Remorantino,</hi> natural Son of the Duke of <hi>Loraine,</hi> Commander in Chief of the Forces that came from beyond the <hi>Alpes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>General <hi>Foscolo</hi> encouraged by the many glorious Enterprises that he had obtained, resolved to consummate all by taking the strong and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Fortress of <hi>Clissa,</hi> scituate in the Confines of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and Borders <note place="margin">
                        <hi>clissa</hi> taken.</note> of <hi>Bosna,</hi> on the top of a sharp and craggy Mountain, invironed with Rocks and unaccessible passages; the difficulty of the attempt rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed than abated the Courage of <hi>Foscolo,</hi> so that he Valiantly Besieged and Assaulted that place; during which time, the Priest <hi>D. Stesano Sorich,</hi>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:98602:66"/>
Captain of the Morlachs, intercepted the succours which were sent thither, and <hi>Georgio</hi> the Proveditor, overthrew <hi>Teccheli</hi> Pasha in a Field Battel; so that the Inhabitants despairing of relief, surrendered up themselves to the mercy of the Venetians; and thus <hi>Clissa</hi> being taken, the Senate Commanded that it should be more regularly Fortified.</p>
                  <p>And here the Christian Armes met some interruption. For the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachs desirous to cast off the Turkish Yoke, and return to the protection of the Venetians, designed to surprize <hi>Scutari;</hi> and at the same time the Archbishop of <hi>Durazzo,</hi> with 7000. Albanians, was to seize upon <hi>Croia,</hi> and <hi>Allessio;</hi> but the design being discovered by the traiterous practices of some false Brethren, before matters were maturely grown, or the time of Execution, it had certainly cost the Life of all the Morlachs, and 700. Venetian Souldiers joined with them, had not the increase of the Waters hindered the speedy March of the Turks, who resolved to cut them all off without mercy, or regard to any; so that having time to disperse themselves, and take refuge in the Mountains, the most of them preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their lives from the Cruelty of their Enemies; only some certain Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Persons falling into their hands, they imputed unto them the cause of the Rebellion, and in a barbarous manner impaled them on Stakes.</p>
                  <p>The Turks enraged for the loss of <hi>Clissa,</hi> dispatched <hi>Dervis</hi> Pasha into the parts of <hi>Bosna,</hi> with a potent Army threatning to Assault <hi>Spalatro;</hi> whom to divert, <hi>Foscolo,</hi> together with Priest <hi>Sorich,</hi> Captain of the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachs, entered into the Enemies Country; spoiling, burning, and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wheresoever they came. The Morlachs more greedy of prey than ambitious of glory, divided themselves into small parties to rob and pillage; in which interim they were assaulted by the Turks, but being scattered, were so far from making a stout resistance, that they commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themselves to a shameful flight, in which great numbers of them were miserably Butchered; nor could the valour of <hi>Sorich,</hi> nor of the Governour <hi>Possidaria,</hi> reduce them by their Examples into any Order; whilst together with some few valiant Dalmatians, and Morlach Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, they endured the shock of all the Enemies Fury; in which Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish the Turks lost 7. Agas, and about 70. Souldiers: On the Christians side were killed 400. some few Slaves, and about 70. Ensigns taken; amongst the rest the good Priest <hi>Sorich</hi> scorning to turn his back, had the misfortune to fall into the Enemies hands, whom they flead alive, and afterwards impaled; and though they subdued his Body, yet he was still master of his mind; bearing the same constancy in his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as he had showed Magnanimity and Courage in the Face of his Enemy.</p>
                  <p>Whilst these Martial Affairs were transacting with the bloud and life of many thousands on both sides, <hi>Sultan Ibrahim,</hi> like a stout Souldier of <hi>Venus,</hi> waged another War in the Elysiums of <hi>Cupid;</hi> and casting aside all thoughts of <hi>Candia,</hi> remitted the sole care and management thereof to the Vizier and Pashas of the Divan; following a life so lascivious and sensual, as can neither be imagined with a chast fancy, or described by a modest Pen. A principal instrument of his delights, and Engine to compass his Amorous Designs, was a certain cast Wench of his, which he named <hi>Shecher Para,</hi> which signifies a little piece of Sugar; for it seems she was so complaisant and dulcid in her humour and discourse, as merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that apt name to express the sweetness of her Conversation; this
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98602:67"/>
Woman having the convenience to visit all the Baths in Town, took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of every Woman which she saw of more than ordinary Features and proportion, and having enquired her condition and dwelling, presently reported the same with all advantage to her Sultan, who having heard the beauty described, became passionately Enamoured, and could find no repose in his fancy, until his instruments, either by fair words or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, had seduced her, or forced her to his Bed. But growing now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant and over-wanton in his Amours, he fell in love with the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana, or Widdow of his Brother <hi>Sultan Morat:</hi> To win her affections he had recourse to his Dear <hi>Shecher Para;</hi> who used all her Arts in this service: but her pretty wheedling terms could prevail nothing on this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, who answered her in short, that at the Death of her Lord <hi>Sultan Morat,</hi> she had resolved upon a perpetual Widdowhood, for that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of him was still so lively in her, that she could not entertain the thoughts of admitting any new Embraces. This repugnancy and opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion inflamed the heat of <hi>Ibrahim</hi> like a Feaver, so that he resolved to assault her himself one day by force, and took his time just as she came out of the Bath; but she being a bold Woman, and disdaining the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring loves of <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> laid her hand upon her Dagger, (which Sultana's and great Ladies usually wear) threatning to wound him in her own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; the noise and brawling hereof being over-heard by the Queen Mother, called her from her Retirements, and concerned her in the Quarrel; who whilst she reproved her Son, for the rape he intended on his Brothers Wife, gave opportunity to the Sultana to escape; and so delivered her out of the hands of this Satyr. But <hi>Ibrahim</hi> mad with love, and fuming with disdain to be checked and opposed by his Mother, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded her immediately to the old Seraglio, where he confined her to several days Imprisonment, during which time he understood in what manner she had treated his large-sized Armenian, of whom we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready spoken; whereof the Queen Mother being conscious, submitted her self with all humility to her Son, begging his favour and pardon; and so well acted her part by those who carried her Addresses, that she overcame quickly his easy nature, and was again restored to his Grace, and her Lodgings in the new Seraglio.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Shecher Para</hi> travelling over all the Baths in Town, to discover new delights for her Master, at length had the fortune to cast her Eyes on a Daughter of the Mufti, a Maid of Incomparable Beauty and features of Countenance, and proportion of Body, which she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to <hi>Ibrahim</hi> so sensibly, as if she her self had been in love; and after she had praised every part and member of her, she concluded in sum, that she was the most Excellent and admirable piece that ever Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture framed. The Sultan had no sooner heard the story, but according to his usual custom, fell most desperately in love, and had immediately without farther consideration or counsel, dispatched his Emissaries; or without other preamble, ceremony, or Courtship, to have fetched her to him; had not the sense of the late rebuff he had received from his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Wife, made some impression of fear in him; and the apprehension he had of the power of the Mufti, created in him a certain caution and respect in the treatment of his Daughter: wherefore he rather resolved to send for the Mufti, with whom he treated of honourable terms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Marriage; promising to take her into his Bosom, and prefer her in honour equal to any other of his Sultana's.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:98602:67"/>
The old Man who was tender of, and doated on his Daughter, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well the wandring humour of the Sultan in his Amours, intended ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to marry her to some great Personage, with whom she might be more happy, than in being a Soltana: for he considered, that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> having already other Sons, her Issue would either be Sacrificed for secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their Brothers, or else spend their days in a Prison, and become Grey-headed, whilst they breath in a <hi>medium</hi> between Life and Death, and are sad Recluses in the Grave of their unhappiness. These conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations were well imprinted in the mind of the Mufti: but because he durst not deny his proposal, he dealt with him as Inferiours usually do with their Lords and Superiours; that is, he returned him thanks, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing insinite Obligations, that he would vouchsafe to cast his Princely Eyes on the unworthiness of his Family: however he advised him, that according to the Canons of their Law, of which he was the Expositor, and obliged to be a severe and precise Observer; it was great Impiety in a Father to impose on the affections of his Child; so that though he could heartily wish that his Daughter would embrace this honour, to which he would exhort her with all the earnest perswasions of a Father; yet if she proved refractory thereunto, it would not be becoming his power to force her; and therefore hoped his Majesty would believe, that in proceeding thus far, he had performed that duty which became him, both as a Father, and a Loyal Subject. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> supposing that by this Concession he had gained his design, thanked and imbraced the old Man, whom dismissing with plenary satisfaction, he remained now with an impatient expectation and hopes of enjoyment. Next Morning the Mufti returned early to the Grand Signior, and having sirst sufficiently instructed his Daughter to refuse the Sultans proffers, told him plainly, that he had used all his paternal authority and interest with his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that he might induce her to accept this mighty Fortune, which cast it self upon her; but that it found not that ready acceptance with her as he expected; what could be the reason he knew not how to conjecture, since Women are commonly irregular, and unreasonable in their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ibrahim</hi> being in this manner disappointed, and more angry to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any boundary or restraint to the imperious violence of his Lusts, than opposition against the puissance of his Armes; dismist the Mufti with some neglect and disdain, whom he resolved to treat with rigour, and his Daughter with Courtship. In order to the first, he banished him the Court, and forbad him his presence in any other place; grew sullen and unsatisfied at all his administrations of Justice, intending thereby to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to a resignation of his Office, there being nothing more irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to an ingenuous spirit, than to serve and not to please. On the other side he dealt with the young Lady in a different manner, by the crafty and flattering insinuations of his trusty <hi>Shecher Para,</hi> who so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly mannaged her tongue full of curious words mixed with threats, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting the storms and fury of the Sultans rage, and again the glory, splendour, and happiness of the Seraglio; where she should Reign as Empress and Soveraign of the World: all which she expressed with that passion, and lascivious enticement, as would have shaken a firmer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, than the Vertue of a Turkish Maid: but she being well admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by her Father, remained obstinate in her denial: but to quiet the importunity of this Seducer, she begged her not to sollicite her Father
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98602:68"/>
in this request, but rather that she would intercede in her behalf with the Sultan; supplicating him with all humility to pardon her Childish refusal, and to leave her unto her own liberty and choice, and a single Life: to obtain which favour from her, she produced a Diamond of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable value, desiring her to accept of that from her, and to become her Friend, her Assistant, and Protectress. <hi>Shecher Para</hi> being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by her Maiden Modesty, could no longer resist such forcible en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties; and having her Eyes obscured with the lustre of the Jewel, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to change her note, and excuse her refusal with all the advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and compassionate terms possible; and so taking her leave with a courteous farewel, repaired to the Sultan, to give an account of her Negotiations. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> having with more doubtful fear attended the Issue of this last Conference, than he did the success of his War with <hi>Venice;</hi> received his <hi>Shecher Para</hi> with exceeding joy, who being come in, began to recount all the particulars that had passed: but the sum of all was, that this silly Maid was sufficiently sensible of the honour of being a Soltana, of being Courted by his Majesty, of the joyes, delights, and glory of the Seraglio; but that when she reflected, how that she was to bring forth Children to die by untimely Deaths, and to end their Days by poison, or the Bow-string, or at least to live miserable lives se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from Mankind, and immured within Walls, and Intombed whilst they breathed; she could not but tremble with some horrour, and judge that all the blandishments of Worldly Fortune were but a transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Paradise; which could not possibly recompence, or out-weigh the sense and tenderness she conceived for the misery of her unfortunate Off-spring. Howsoever she so couched her Discourse, that she gave <hi>Ibrahim</hi> some hopes to overcome at length; by which she appeased a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle his fury and despair, and extracted some Jewels and Gifts in reward of her past labour, and encouragement for her future service. In this manner <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had patience awhile, expecting something farther from the industry of <hi>Shecher Para;</hi> but finding no effect of all his expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and gentleness, at length resolved to break through all considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of respect, either to the Father as the Mouth and Oracle of the Law, or to the simple and foolish innocence of the Maid; and therefore or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Great Vizier to cause a Watch to be set on the Girl, either going in or coming out of the Bath, and without farther Ceremony to bring her unto him. This Order being executed accordingly, and the Maid hurried to the Seraglio; <hi>Ibrahim</hi> possessed and enjoyed her for some days, but with those tears, reluctancy, and sullenness, as took off from the edge and appetite of enjoyment; so that he returned her back again with scorn and contempt unto her Father; who at first dissembled the injury with the same Countenance as he did before, when he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicted the Sultan's presence; suppressing his revenge like a concealed fire, which bursts out afterwards with more violent Flames. But though the sense of obedience and duty towards his Prince allayed much of the choler he conceived against him for the Rape of his Daughter; yet he knew not how to pardon the Great Vizier, whom he termed no other than a Ruffian or Pandor; the Minister of his Masters Lusts, and not of his Laws, and of Justice. Thus full of indignation he applyed himself, and made his complaint unto one <hi>Mahomet</hi> Pasha, a principal Member of the Divan; one of great wisdom and practice in the conduct of affairs, and one with whom he had a particular Friendship and intimacy. Nor
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98602:68"/>
less interest had he with Janisar. Aga, or General of the Janizaries; to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1648"/> both whom, with tears in his Eyes, and with such words as the sense of his injuries suggested, he railed at the Vizier, and aggravated the Ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Daughter with all the circumstances of Villany and Violence. These two Friends heard the story with a sensible remorse, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately concluded that for the honour and security of the Empire, it was necessary to depose Sultan <hi>Ibrahim;</hi> and for the same reason to cut off the first Vizier; agreeing amongst themselves that <hi>Mahomet</hi> Pasha should receive the Seal, and the Office. To effect which, they deemed it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to draw the Queen Mother into the Conspiracy, being a Woman of great Authority, and having as it were the Reins of Government in her hands, by reason of the weak judgment of her Son. But because it was difficult to perswade the tenderness of a Mother to the ruine of her Son; the Wise Mufti resolved first to sound her inclinations and disposition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this design: and being well informed of her fierce Circassian na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the jealousy and anger she conceived against <hi>Shecher Para,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Licence to be heard by her, as if he would beg her intercession with her Son in his behalf; and being admitted to discourse with her, he thereby plainly discovered her most inverterate hatred and displeasure against her Son; not only for this, but for many other actions of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This discovery which the Queen had made, gave him the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to propose the confinement again of <hi>Ibrahim</hi> to his old Prison; not that he should be absolutely laid aside and deposed, but only corrected awhile, and being put in remembrance of his past condition, might be taught wisdom, and instructed for the future, what moderation and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice Sultans are obliged to exercise in the administration of Government; and so subtlely did he insinuate his discourse, that the Queen Mother as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the proposal, and that the Seal should be conferred on <hi>Mahomet</hi> Pasha; for she had conceived an irreconcileable hatred against <hi>Achmet</hi> the G. Vizier, by whose counsel she was sent to the old Seraglio, and was united in Confederacy with the detested <hi>Shecher Para.</hi> The Mufti greatly satisfied to have gained so considerable a Conspirator to the party, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the whole business, with the Progress of it, to the two Kadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leschers, or Lord Chief Justices of <hi>Romelia</hi> and <hi>Anatolia;</hi> who approve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, and promising their utmost assistance, the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>August</hi> was the Day appointed for the Insurrection of the Janizaries, who being all in a readiness on that day, went in a tumultuary way to call the Mufti, the Kadileschers, and other Officers and Ministers of the Law, whom they seemingly forced to accompany them to the presence of the G. Signior, of whom they demanded, that the present Vizier <hi>Achmet</hi> should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of his Office, and that <hi>Mahomet</hi> Pasha should be constituted in his place. The G. Signior at first refused their demand, but being perswaded by his Mother that it was necessary to content the Militia in that tumult; he consented thereunto, and having called <hi>Achmet,</hi> he took from him the Seal, and conferred it on <hi>Mahomet</hi> Pasha, and therewith the Office of G. Vizier. <hi>Achmet</hi> trembling at the consequences hereof, resolved to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himself to the mercy of the Mufti, and therefore hastned to his House to attend his return, hoping to find him his Protector, under whose shadow and roof he fled for Sanctuary. The Souldiery having thus obtained the first-fruits of their Insurrection, accompanied the Mufti unto his home, where finding the deposed Vizier <hi>Achmet,</hi> the Janisar. Aga immediately Commanded him out of Doors, from whence he had no
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98602:69"/>
sooner drawn his Foot, than that he was seized upon and strangled, and his Body thrown before the Gate of the new Mosch.</p>
                  <p>The next day being the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> 1648. the Janizaries again ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in the like tumult as before, came to demand of the Mufti, whether that according to their Law, <hi>Sultan Ibrahim</hi> as a Fool, and a Tyrant, and unsit for Government, ought not to be deposed? To which the Mufti giving answer in the affirmative, sent to cite <hi>Sultan Ibrahim</hi> the day following to appear in the Divan, to administer Justice to his Souldiers and Subjects, who expected it from him. But <hi>Ibrahim</hi> supposing that he had sufficiently satisfied the Souldiery, by putting the Vizier out of Office, laughed at the summons which the Mufti made him; which being secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a Fetfa, which is a point of Law resolved by the Mufti, who is the Mouth or Oracle thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> That the G. Signior being called to account, is obliged to appear before the Justice; the Sultan in high dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain tore the Paper, threatning the Head of the Mufti: but it was now too late, he having already sufficiently fortified himself with the power and strength of his Rebellious Companions. This Fetfa was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately seconded by another of a higher nature, which declared, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever obeyed not the Law of God, was not a true Mussulman or Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and though that person were the Emperour himself, yet being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by his filthy actions a Kafir or Infidel, was <hi>ipso facto,</hi> fallen from his Throne, and no farther capable of Authority and Government. This Fetfa being seen by <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> he tore it in pieces, Commanding the G. Vizier instantly to put the Mufti to Death, as guilty of Treason against his Prince: but having now lost his Authority, his Commands were not longer regarded, nor any reverence had of his person: For the Janiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries being again assembled about five a Clock in the Afternoon, came with their usual tumult to the Gates of the Seraglio. And now <hi>Sultan Ibrahim</hi> losing all Courage at this third attempt, fled into the Armes of his Mother, begging her assistance and protection. She being a bold and subtle Woman, employed all her Rhetorick and Eloquence to perswade the Souldiery not to offer violence to the person of their Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster; promising that he should relinquish the Government, and retire himself with a Guard into his old Lodgings. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> comforted a little, that he should save his Life, shrunk himself willingly into his old Shell, wherein he had so long conserved his Life. In the mean time the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators taking forth his eldest Son <hi>Sultan Mahomet,</hi> set him on the Throne of his Father, and planting the Sargouch, or Imperial Feathers on his Head, saluted him for Emperour with loud Acclamations. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> continued his Imprisonment for some days with great patience, but at length growing desperate and furious, often beat his Head against the Wall, until at length, he was on the <hi>17th</hi> strangled by four Mutes.</p>
                  <p>In this manner <hi>Sultan Ibrahim</hi> ended his Days, which puts me in mind of the saying of a wiser and a better King than he, <hi>That there is little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance between the Prisons and the Graves of Princes.</hi> And this Example made a great Officer understand how King <hi>Charles</hi> the Glorious Martyr was put to Death. For he, I think it was the Great Vizier, falling into discourse with the Chief English Interpreter at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> not then calling to mind the Fate of <hi>Sultan Ibrahim;</hi> demanded, How, and when King <hi>Charles</hi> was put to Death? Sure, said he, Your King must have no Power, or your People must be more Rebellious and Mutinous than other Nations of the World, who durst commit an act so horrid and vile as
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98602:69"/>
this. See, said he, How our Emperour is revered and observed; and how submissive and obedient half the World is to the nod of our Great Monarch. To which the Interpreter replyed, that to recount unto him the History and occasion of this prodigious fact, would be too long and tedious for him to hear: but that the time it happened, was some Months after the Death or Murder of <hi>Sultan Ibrahim;</hi> which was an <hi>Item</hi> suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to give him a perfect understanding of what he required.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sultan Ibrahim</hi> having in this manner ended his Dayes, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was committed into the hands of the G. Vizier, and the old Queen Mother (which is she whom we call <hi>Kiosem</hi> in the Ottoman State) and of 12. Pashaws; who were to manage all Affairs with supream Power, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Minority of <hi>Sultan Mahomet,</hi> who now Reigns.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was the sifth Son of <hi>Sultan Achmet,</hi> born of the same Mother with <hi>Sultan Morat,</hi> Educated like the other younger Sons of the Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Family, within the Walls of an obscure and unhappy Prison; so that 'tis no wonder, if wanting the advantages of seeing and practising in the World, he should neither have studied Men, nor been experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Art of Government. Nor less strange is it, being natural to humane insirmity; for men who have lived under restraint, afsliction, and fear of Death, to become licentious and immoderate in all kind of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, whensoever they pass on a sudden from the depth of misery to some transcendent degree of happiness and prosperity; which as I say all men are naturally subject unto; so more especially those, whose Religion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulges them all kind of sensual Carnality in this Life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was in his own nature of a gentle and easy temper, of a large Forehead, of a quick and lively Eye, and ruddy Complexion, and of a good proportion in the Features of his Face; but yet had something in the air of his Countenance, that promised no great abilities of mind. And giving himself up to all kind of Effeminacy and softness, attended not unto the Government of his Affairs; and therefore it was his greatest mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to be served by wicked and faithless Officers to whom he trusted, and to whom he gave credence, wanting in himself the talents of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and discretion to discern their malice. The continual apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that he entertained of Death during his Imprisonment, had so fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen his constitution with a strange frigidity towards Women, that all the dalliance and warm embraces of the most inflaming Ladies in the Serag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio, could not in a whole Years time thaw his coldness; which was the occasion at sirst of that report, which spoke him to be impotent towards Women: during which time he attended to his Ministers of Justice, and to a management of the affairs of his Empire, which in the beginning of his Reign gained him a credit and reputation, and raised a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of his goodness and care of his Subjects welfare; an evidence of which, he gave in his Charge to the Great Vizier, that he should put no Man to Death unless for Capital and enormous Crimes. But at length losing himself in Lusts and Sensualities, he forsook the Helm of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, committing the guidance of his Empire to other hands: and as he was ignorant of War, so he foolishly sported in the calms of Peace; and suffering himself to be guided only by Fortune, felt the stroke thereof in his last Unhappy Fate.</p>

                        <hi>SUltan Ibrahim</hi> perishing in this manner, by the mutinous violence of the Souldiery, his Son <hi>Mehmet,</hi> or <hi>Mahomet,</hi> being a Child of seven years of Age, succeeded in the Throne: During whose Minority, (which was to continue for the space of ten years longer) his Mother, who was the first <hi>Sultana,</hi> assisted with the Counsel of twelve Pashaws, took upon her self the Regency, and in the first place resolved to continue the War against the Venetians, which <hi>Ibrahim</hi> intended to conclude, having engaged himself far in a Treaty of Peace with the Bailo or Ambassadour, which resided at the Port for that Republick.</p>
                     <p>Whilst these matters were transacting, and preparations making to prosecute the War; the malignant humours of the Empire began to fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98602:71"/>
unto that degree, as affected the Body Politick at first with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1649"/> heats, which soon afterwards proceeded to a Feaver, and then to a dangerous Convulsion. The ill-affected Part was the Militia, which is the heart and principal of the life of that Government. For the Spahees and the Janisaries, being the Horse and Foot, entred into a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate controversie. The first judged it their Duty to revenge the Death of their Soveraign, <hi>Sultan Ibrahim;</hi> and in order thereunto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Head of the Great Vizier, as the Chief Authour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triver of the death of his Lord and Master. The others being conscious to themselves of having by their Armes carried on the Conspiracy, not only declared their resolutions to defend the Vizier, but owned that what he had acted was by their order, and at their request and insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. The Spahees being highly provoked with this declaration, swelled with anger and malice against the Janisaries; and both sides be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equally proud and rich could not bear each others reproaches. The Spahees being Men of Estates in Land, looked on themselves as the Gentry, and to have the greatest share in the concernment of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. The Janisaries living regularly in their Chambers, or Martial Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, looked on themselves as the better Souldiers, and the more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Party; and the truth is, both of them were proceeded to that height of Command and Authority in Government, that had they not been suppressed by the cruel hand, and bloody disposition of <hi>Kuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee,</hi> as shall be more largely related hereafter, this Empire was then in danger of falling into as many Divisions, as there were at that time Pashaws, or great Captains. The cause hereof proceeded from the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like disposition of <hi>Sultan Morat,</hi> who being the most Martial Man of his Age, preferred none but Men of great courage, and such as had signalized their valour by undoubted proofs; And such Men as these he loaded with honour, and raised them to the highest, and most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent charges in the Government. But <hi>Morat</hi> dying soon afterwards, these Great Men had time to enrich themselves during the gentle and easie Reign of <hi>Sultan Ibrahim;</hi> which being seconded by the Minority of this Young Sultan, their pride knew no bounds, either of Modesty towards their Commanders, or Reverence towards their Sultan. Hence it was that the Souldiery dividing, so great a Sedition arose amongst them, that at last they came to blows, resolving to decide the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie by the Sword. But the Quarrels of Turks amongst themselves not being commonly of long durance, the Care and Vigilance of the Magistrates prevented all open defiance in the Field; but yet could not so pacifie their Animosities, but that several Skirmishes, or Rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters passed between them in the Streets, wherein the Spahees were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways worsted, and at length were forced to abandon the City, scarce daring for some time to owne the name of Spahee within the Walls of <hi>Constantinople.</hi>

                     <p>These disturbances gave the Venetians some hopes to accomodate their Peace with better advantage; but the Reply to this Proposition was more fierce and positive than ever, and so ill resented that the Bailo going from his Audience, was on the <hi>27th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> seized on, and with all his Retinue clapped into Prison and Chains; being sent to those Castles which are scituate on the <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> in the middle way between <hi>Constantinople</hi> and the Black Sea. But this furious severity by the intercession of other Christian Ministers continued not long, before
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98602:71"/>
the Bailo received more gentle Treatment, by the Sacrisice which the Turks made unto themselves of <hi>Grillo,</hi> his Interpreter, who being called down from the presence of the Bailo, was immediately by two Officers strangled, and his Body thrown out at the Window of the Castle; the which act, though it may seem unjust and barbarous to us, hath yet been frequently practised amongst the Turks, being to this day their common use to threaten the Druggermen or Interpreters; which is the cause that they often mince, or wholly alter the sense or meaning of their Masters, on those occasions when words are spoken by them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to the Turks.</p>
                     <p>The Turks bearing this disdain to the Venetians, laboured to re-enforce their Armies in <hi>Candia,</hi> and supply them with Ammunition and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; and though the Venetians lay before the Mouth of the <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danelles</hi> to intercept all succours which might be carried thither; yet the Turks notwithstanding their Divisions, having recruited their Fleet with forty Gallies, and ten Great Ships, broke through the Venetians, and in despight of them, convoyed five Gallies laden with Souldiers and Ammunition, and landed them safe at <hi>Canea;</hi> and about the same time six Gallies, and ten Ships of <hi>Barbary,</hi> entered into the Port of <hi>Suda.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The General which commanded in chief was named <hi>Chusaein</hi> Pasha, a Person of great courage and experience; he had for some time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged the City of <hi>Candia,</hi> but for want of Men and Ammunition was forced to rise from that place, and retire to <hi>Canea</hi> and <hi>Retimo,</hi> whilst in the mean time the <hi>Candiots</hi> received recruits of Men, and supply of Provisions, improving their leisure time to fortifie their Town with such works as rendred it almost impregnable, and made it become the Wonder and Discourse of the World after some years succeeding.</p>
                     <p>Nor was the War only carried on in <hi>Candia,</hi> but also in <hi>Dalmatia, Morea, Bosna,</hi> and <hi>Albania.</hi> For <hi>Foscolo,</hi> the General of <hi>Venice,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing to force some Corn from the Parts of <hi>Castel-nuovo,</hi> he landed some Men there, but was so ill received by the Turks, that he was forced to retreat unto his Vessels with great disorder, and no less dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour. But he had better fortune in the Parts of <hi>Bosna,</hi> where he repulsed the Enemy to the very Gates of <hi>Sarsay,</hi> the Capital City of that Province, and took upon composition the Fortress of <hi>Risano,</hi> which is scituate between <hi>Cataro</hi> and <hi>Castel-nuovo;</hi> but at length the Turks receiving an additional aid of fifteen or sixteen thousand men, the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians were forced to quit their new Conquests, and retire into their own Country.</p>
                     <p>During the time that these Affairs were in agitation, the young Emperour was proclaimed, and his Inauguration celebrated with the usual Ceremonies, but with rejoycings, and hopes extraordinary; who being yet scarcely arrived to eight years of Age, many mutinies and troubles arose in divers Parts of the Empire, as in <hi>Damascus, Syria, Anatolia,</hi> and other Countries, where the Pashaws refused to pay in the customary Taxes and Tribute, declaring that they would keep the money in their hands during the minority of the Grand Signior; and that when he came to Age of Government they would be accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him both for the principal and for the improvement.</p>
                     <p>The Turks in <hi>Hungary</hi> making incursions into the Territories of the Emperour were overthrown by the Count <hi>Forgatz,</hi> near <hi>Buda,</hi> where
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98602:72"/>
the Pasha was taken Prisoner, and his Son slain. Nor better fortune had they in the Assault they made on the Fortress of <hi>Clissa,</hi> where having lost five thousand Men, they were forced to retire with great dishonour.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cossacks</hi> also in this conjuncture grew more bold, so that they covered the Black Sea with their Boats, doing great damage to the Saicks, and other Vessels, which traded in that Sea, and at length came up the <hi>Bosphorus</hi> above <hi>Therapea;</hi> giving a great Alarm with much fear and confusion to all <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Amidst these misfortunes, intestine troubles and new disorders arose in the Ottoman-Empire; For as commonly all the blame of miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages and ill successes in <hi>Turkie,</hi> are cast upon the head of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief; so the Enemies of the Great Vizier took the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in this conjuncture to reproach his ill Government, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the accusation so far, as to depose him from his Charge and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; in whose place the Aga, or General of the Janisaries succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>The Spahees in <hi>Asia,</hi> being displeased with this Election, assembled in a Body of seven or eight thousand, and marched towards <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> pretending to revenge the death of <hi>Sultan Ibrahim;</hi> their numbers daily encreasing, the Divan very much feared lest the Party which favoured the Spahees in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> should join themselves to the Asian Mutineers; to prevent which it was judged good reason and policy, to anticipate the Justice they demanded, by taking away the Life of the deposed Vizier; which being easily assented unto, and without much hesitation performed, gave some little stop to the fury and heats of the Spahees. Notwithstanding all which, as the Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which the Turks entertain amongst themselves were never so great as to afford the Christians any advantage thereby; so the Venetians did not reap any benefit from these Quarrels; but on the contrary, the Turks studiously attended to their Affairs in <hi>Candia,</hi> passing thither with sixty Gallies, thirty great Ships, and twenty five other smaller Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, laden with Men, and all sorts of Provisions and Ammunition for War; so that in this year 1649. the Affairs of the Turks remained in that Island in this happy and hopeful posture. Amongst these Ships were thirteen English, which the Turks took up at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and forced into their service. For though the Ambassadour, Sir <hi>Thomas Bendysh,</hi> then resident at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> opposed the engagement of these Ships what was possible, and also the Commanders and Seamen were very unwilling and dissatisfied to undertake the design; yet the Turks with menaces, and promises of reward forced them to carry Men and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition to <hi>Candia,</hi> so that, making a Vertue of Necessity, they comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that which they could not resist.</p>

                        <hi>CHusaein</hi> Pasha, Governour of the Island of <hi>Candia,</hi> having received these succours and recruits, resolved to besiege the Chief City of <hi>Candia;</hi> to which intent, drawing out from the Ships, and Garisons of <hi>Retimo</hi> and <hi>Canea</hi> what men he was able, he formed an Army of thirty thousand Men, with which he marched, and pitched before the Town. He was provided also with twelve pieces of Cannon, four thousand
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98602:72"/>
Sacks of Wooll, three thousand Ladders, and with a good quantity of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1650"/> Granadoes; with this force he attaqued the City in two places, <hi>viz.</hi> on the Forts of <hi>Martinengo,</hi> and <hi>Mocenigo;</hi> and pressed so hard on the latter, that notwithstanding the generous resistance of the Defendants, he won the Fort, and there planted the Ottoman Colours; fortifying it with more Cannon, and a good number of Men.</p>
                     <p>Count <hi>Coloredo,</hi> Governour of that place, was then sick, the Garrison very weak, and things reduced to the last terms of extremity; when General <hi>Balbiani,</hi> Admiral of <hi>Malta,</hi> arrived with six Gallies, and there landed 600. Men, and 60. Knights; which with great Courage mounted the Guard of the Fort <hi>Martinengo,</hi> which was the place of most danger and honour. The Turks excited with a desire to welcome the new Guests, made three desperate and furious assaults on this Fort, but were with equal valour repulsed by the Defendants; at which disgrace and foil being highly enraged, they resolved on a fourth attempt, which they pursued with that Courage and Success, that the Venetians were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to give way to their violence, with the slaughter almost of all those which defended this Fort; until the Cavaliers of <hi>Malta,</hi> who having no greater glory, nor readier will, than to spill their bloud for the Christian Cause, rallied all the force they were able, and made so prosperous an Attaque upon the Fort, that they recovered it again with the bloud and destruction of all those who defended it; but they enjoyed it not long, before the Turks regained it with the like success and slaughter; which variety of Fortune the Venetians being sensible of, and that they could not bear such costly interchanges with the Turk, had recourse to their ultimate remedy of Mines, which succeeded so happily, that the whole Fort was carried into the Air, and therewith 2000. good Souldiers of the Turks; with which destruction, and other repulses in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they were so weakned and discouraged, that they raised the Siege on the sifth of <hi>October,</hi> new Stile.</p>
                     <p>In this Interim, the Tartar <hi>Han,</hi> called the <hi>Krim,</hi> demanded the Guardianship of the young Sultan, as of right belonging unto him; but the Council answered hereunto, that their Master was already in better hands than those into which they desired to transfer him; and that his Grandmother, and the Divan, wanted neither wisdom nor fidelity to direct his affairs: with which answer the Tartar being forced to remain satisfied, was able to revenge himself no farther, than by exciting the Cossacks to infest the Seas; which gave some diversion to those Armes, which otherwise had all been employed against the Venetians.</p>
                     <p>But these designs from <hi>Tartary</hi> did little trouble the Council, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of that spirit of Discord which was arisen between the Spahees and the Janisaries; for both parties being emulous of each others great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, endeavoured on all occasions to elevate their Chief Commanders to the highest and most profitable places of the Empire: which dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion touching the principal Ministers of State, who were all ongaged on one side or the other; administred great troubles, and retarded the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and success of all the grand designs of the Empire. Nor was it of less importance and dishonour to the Divan, that their Fleet was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered passage by the Venetians, who blocked up the Mouth of the <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danelles;</hi> whereby all intercourse with <hi>Candia</hi> was interrupted: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing resolved to remove this obstacle, they commanded the Captain Pasha to force his passage; which he accordingly performing, was so warmly
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98602:73"/>
received, that he quickly lost two Gallies, and after much bloud, and loss on both sides, was forced at length to retire again within the Streights. But what was of worse consequence to the Turks, was the inveterate discord between the Spahees, and Janisaries; who having been unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly embarked promiscuously together, came oftentimes to words, and then to blows; which ended not without the bloud and death of divers of each party. These mischiefs increased the rage which the Turks at <hi>Constantinople</hi> conceived against the Venetians; who were all thereupon (not excepting the Bailo <hi>Soranzo,</hi> nor his Secretary <hi>Ballarino</hi>) inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted the Territories of the G. Signior; and sent back into their own Country.</p>
                     <p>The Captain Pasha, that he might be in a capacity to make a second attempt to force his passage, sent to <hi>Constantinople</hi> for new recruits: when News came that the Siege of <hi>Candia</hi> was raised, and that the Turks had lost the Fort of St. <hi>Theodoro;</hi> which so angred the spirit of the Queen Mother against the Vizier, that she immediately deposed him from his Charge, and therewith had taken away his Life, had not the Faction of the Janisaries protected him in this extremity.</p>
                     <p>The Pasha of <hi>Buda</hi> was introduced into his place, a person of a tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent and ambitious spirit, who to increase his savour with his Mistress the Sultana, evidenced his heat and zeal against the Venetians, and to that end sent immediately express Orders to the Pasha of <hi>Bosna,</hi> to invest <hi>Clissa</hi> with all the power he was able; and therewith he presented him with a Cimeter, and a Halter; the former to be his reward in case of good success, and the latter to be his punishment in case of misfortune. But this furious Vizier continued not so long, as to experience the Issue of this Command; for he was in a few days laid aside, and <hi>Chusaein</hi> Pasha, the General of <hi>Candia,</hi> was placed in his stead; howsoever his Orders were to remain with the Army, by which means, much emulation and contest was prevented, which might otherwise have happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Spahees, and Janisaries, at the Election of a new Vizier; and thereby all excuses taken from the Souldiery of absence from the War, who could now pretend nothing of reason to withdraw themselves, on score of attendance on the Viziers person; and to supply his Authority at the Regal Court, a Chinacam was substituted to administer Justice in place of the Vizier, which is usual on such occasions.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding all which, affairs succeeded not extraordinary well for the Turks in <hi>Candia;</hi> for being straitned for provisions in <hi>Canea,</hi> by the near approach of the Christians, the Turks were forced to make a diversion, by appearing in great Troops before <hi>Candia;</hi> which they were enabled to do, by the supplies they had lately received, with the arrival of their Fleet of Gallies; for the Winter season approaching, the Venetians were constrained to abandon their station before the <hi>Darda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelles,</hi> and to leave the passage open for the Enemy. And so this Year ended rather with advantage than disgrace to the Christians.</p>

                     <p>WIth these great succours and supplies sent to <hi>Candia</hi> by the Turks, affairs must necessarily have succeeded prosperously to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, had not intestine discords at home interrupted their proceedings, which arose from a Jealousy and Emulation between the Grand-mother,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98602:73"/>
and Mother of the young Sultan. For each of them pretending to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1651"/> tuition or guardianship of the Emperour, during his minority, divers Parties and Factions formed at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> from whence all that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and combustion arose, which we have at large related in the third Chapter of the Present State of the Ottoman Empire. So that now it was no time to talk to the Souldiers or People of a War in <hi>Candia;</hi> For the first thought themselves engaged to contrive a settlement and determination of Disputes at home, and the latter being irritated with a new Tax laid on them, for want of money in the Treasury, exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and talked loud, and at length, instead of paying, broke out into open Rebellion, which by assistance of the Souldiery, was appeased, under no less terms than the death of several principal Ministers of State.</p>
                     <p>During these Divisions, the Venetians had time to arme out a very considerable Fleet for defence of <hi>Candia; Foscolo,</hi> who had been Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> being sent thither with title of Generalissimo in the place of <hi>Mocenigo:</hi> But these Dissentions amongst the Turks, according to their usual custom, lasting not long before they came to a Conclusion, by the entire destruction of one of the Parties; the Chief Ministers began to reassume again the thoughts of prosecuting the War in <hi>Candia,</hi> and to send Recruits to reinforce the Army under the Command of <hi>Chusaein</hi> Pasha, who was returned with new Forces and courage to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault the City of <hi>Candia.</hi> At this time a certain Greek, pretending to be a Person of Quality, and discontented with the Turks, fled from them to the Christians, where being received with all kind and obliging entertainment, he had thereby liberty of seeing and visiting all the Fortifications of the Place. After he had observed and discovered as much as he desired, this traiterous Fugitive fled again to the Turkish Camp, where he revealed what places were most strong, or best fortified, and where the Town was weakest, and most easily to be assaulted. The Venetian General being awakened at this discovery, and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the numbers of his People to be few, in respect of the Enemy, and that the Outworks could not be maintained without a more numerous Garison, he resolved to destroy some of those Forts; and accordingly blew up with Mines four Bastions, which being at a distance could not be relieved without much danger. The Turks hereby making conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of the weakness of the besieged, cheerfully assaulted the Fort of St. <hi>Demetrio,</hi> thinking to carry it without much trouble, but contrary to their expectation, they encountred so bold a resistance, that they lost three thousand men on the place.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Constantinople</hi> they were still so intent to carry on this War, that having prepared, and laden on the Fleet great quantities of Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, Bomboes, and Mortar-pieces, with other Fire-works, the Captain Pasha, with hopes agreeable to his Force, set forth to Sea, with eleven hundred Sail, consisting of Gallies, Ships, Galleasses, Saiques, Brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, and smaller Vessels, with resolution to engage the Venetian Fleet, whose. Commanders also were equally desirous and ready to consent with them to a Battel. On the <hi>7th.</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> the Venetians being at an Anchor in the Port of St. <hi>Ermina</hi> discovered the Turkish Fleet, to which as they were much inferiour in number, so they were superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to them in the agreement and experience of their Commanders. The Turks having passed forward on their way, the Venetians pursued them, and the better to draw them to a Battol, <hi>Mocenigo</hi> ordered two
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98602:74"/>
Ships, commanded by <hi>Barbaro</hi> and <hi>Dolphino</hi> to cross the Turks at the point of the Island; and his Vice-Admiral, <hi>Bataggio,</hi> with four Ships to engage the main Body of the Turkish Fleet; to whose assistance many other Vessels coming in, he so rudely treated several Gallies, that they were forced to seek harbour in the Port of <hi>Chios,</hi> now <hi>Scio,</hi> with the loss of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> Pasha of <hi>Anatolia,</hi> who was sent to succeed in the Office of <hi>Chusaein</hi> Pasha, the General of <hi>Candia;</hi> but Night coming on, the rest of the Fleet retreated to the Isles of <hi>Naxia</hi> and <hi>Paros.</hi> On the tenth day the Turks having watered their Fleet, gave a signal of desiance to the Venetians, by discharge of two pieces of Cannon; and the Venetians accepting the challenge, both Fleets gave a furious charge one to the other; but the Turks were not able to withstand the courage and skilfulness of the Venetians; for the Captain Pasha having lost many of his men, and the poop of his Gally being carried away with a Cannon shot, the whole Fleet was put into disorder, and then unto flight, so that the Gallies began to employ themselves in toaing the Ships. But one of their Mahones being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the rest, was assaulted by two Galleasses, and some Ships, and finding none to come in for succour, the Captain was killed, with four hundred Souldiers, and two hundred were taken Prisoners.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Mocenigo,</hi> the General, gave chase to the Gallies, which two to a Ship were toaing the heavier Vessels as fast as they could; but being hardly pursued, were forced to cast off the Hauser, <note place="margin">A great Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obtained by the Venetians over the Turk.</note> and shist for themselves as well as they were able. The Turkish Ships see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves thus abandoned, fired whole Broadsides upon the Enemy; but the Venetian Gallies leaving their own Ships astern, that they might pursue their advantage, <hi>Querini</hi> boarded a Great Galleass, called the <hi>Soltana,</hi> upon which were three hundred Souldiers, who offered to surrender upon promise of Quarter for their Lives. But the Christian Souldiers heated with fight, and not then understanding any thing of Conditions, desperately boarded the Vessel, whereby the Turks being reduced to an extremity of despair, gave fire to the Powder, and therewith carried as well the Vanquishers as the Vanquished into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World. According to this example four other Vessels burnt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, one of 60 brass Guns, and three others of 40 to 44. Fifteen Vessels of the starboard wing saved themselves by good sailing. Of the larboard wing, Captain <hi>Nicolo,</hi> a Renegado, with his ship was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Admiral of the Galleasses, likewise another Great Vessel by <hi>Lazaro Mocenigo,</hi> and another by Proveditor <hi>Melino.</hi> In short, there was not one Vessel which remained in sight of the Venetians, which was not either taken, sunk, or burnt. Notwithstanding all which, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the Vessels which were escaped, and the three thousand men which the Turks had landed at <hi>Naxia,</hi> in order to their being trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported unto <hi>Candia,</hi> the Victory seemed to be very imperfect; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Venetians attending another encounter with the Turkish Fleet, did happily meet them in a few days after; and being encouraged with the late success, as the Enemy was low in their spirits and resolution, they bravely attaqued the Turk, and took 39 Gallies, 23 Ships, three Galleasses, together with the three thousand Souldiers, which were then embarked from <hi>Naxia:</hi> Those which escaped took Refuge in the Port of <hi>Rhodes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this great loss, the Turks entertained no great designs of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98602:74"/>
Conquest of <hi>Candia;</hi> but only to conserve <hi>Canea,</hi> and the footing that they had won in that Island: nor did ever the Turks after this, dare to stand a formal Battel with the Venetians at Sea, but rather contriving to escape than to fight, did ever after build light Gallies, for transporting of Men and Ammunition, with intention to wage their War only at Land, and not at Sea; it being a saying ever after common in their Mouths; <hi>That God had given the Sea to Christians, and the Earth to the Turks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To these ill successes abroad, were added great dissentions at home; for the mutinous Spahees in <hi>Asia,</hi> having united into a strong Body, marched towards <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to join with their other Brethren in those parts. The Janisaries on the other side not less diligent to oppose their Enemy, to revenge the outrages committed on their Brethren, whom the Spahees had ill treated, having cut off the Noses and Ears of several of them; besides all which, they proceeded to that height of Insolence, as to demand the Heads of the Great Vizier, and of the Aga of the Janisaries; and being now by their numbers rendered formidable to the Court, it was judged agreeable to the present Conjuncture, to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy in some measure these Mutiniers, by discharging these two Officers of their employment, which did in some degree for the present qualify and appease these Tumults.</p>

                     <p>The Venetian Fleet being Victorious at Sea, made it their work to keep the Mouth of the <hi>Dardanelloes</hi> always blocked up, whereby they hindered all succours from <hi>Candia:</hi> notwithstanding which diligence, the Venetians being sometimes forced for the sake of water and provision, to abandon that Station; the Turks took hold of the opportunity to escape forth; but being eagerly pursued by the Venetians, they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to take Sanctuary in <hi>Rhodes,</hi> where being again blocked up, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in <hi>Candia</hi> suffered much, and the complaints from thence were loud at the Court. So that Orders were sent, and often repeated unto the Captain Pasha, that he should spend no longer time in <hi>Rhodes,</hi> but that in despight of all difficulties, he should immediately proceed to <hi>Candia,</hi> and fight through the Venetians in case they remained in the way to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt his passage; but theCaptain Pasha notwithstanding these Orders, and Menaces which accompanied them, could not perswade himself to the hazard of a Battel; till at length the season of the year spending, and being wearied in the Port of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> he resolved to adventure abroad; but instead of going to <hi>Candia,</hi> he plundered the Islands as he passed, and returned to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> with 40. Gallies, where he hoped with the booty he had plundered to appease the anger of the Divan against him; but this Sacrifice did not much avail, for he was not sooner arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, than his person was seized, and Goods sealed up for the use of the G. Signior; the which Seal his Sons broke open, and taking with them the richest and most considerable part of their Fathers Estate, laded it on one of the Gallies, and fled therewith into Foreign Parts, little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding that danger in which they had left their Father to perish. During which time the Venetians still maintained their Guards on the Coasts of <hi>Candia,</hi> not suffering any Recruits of Men, or Provisions for War, to be transported thither; so that if the Turks designed to prosecute this War, it must be by new Forces, and such as were able to encounter the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine Power of the Enemy; the which being resolved upon by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, a heavy Tax was laid on the people to carry on the design, which they not willingly supporting, made a publick Insurrection in the City; and at the same time also the antient quarrel between the Spahees and Janisaries, began again to ferment; which troubles being added to a Rebellion raised by the Pasha of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> who increasing in strength and number, came marching towards <hi>Constantinople,</hi> put that great City into a horrible fear and confusion.</p>

                     <p>THE Venetians judged that these troubles would naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce some advantage to them, and much facilitate the Peace which they had long desired; but as Seditions among the Turks are always too violent to continue, so these discontents evaporated in a short time, and new resolutions were taken to prosecute the War in <hi>Candia;</hi> for not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that <hi>Monsteur de Ventelay,</hi> Son to the French Ambassadour, mediated with agreeable prudence to compose matters in order to a Peace, yet his endeavours were all insignificant; for neither had Signior <hi>Capello</hi> Audience granted him, nor that liberty which was promised be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

his Arrival; the Turks still insisting on the surrender of <hi>Candia,</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1654"/> would not understand any terms which did not entirely invest them in that Conquest.</p>
                     <p>To effect which by force, which could not be performed by composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the Pasha of <hi>Buda</hi> was Elected for Captain-Pasha, or Commander in Chief of the Seas; and Orders given to equippe a new Fleet of Ships, and Gallies, for transporting the succours of Men and Provisions to <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia:</hi> where <hi>Chusaien</hi> Pasha the General, being wearied with his long Siege of the Town, withdrew his Men at some farther distance for their better refreshment; for they wanting all conveniencies in their Trenches, began to Mutiny, and to refuse the performance of their duty, until the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral satisfying their pay, and dispensing liberally Largesles to the Officers, gave them new encouragement and satisfaction; with which, being a little enlivened, <hi>Chusaein</hi> sent a Herald, with a defiance to those in the City, challenging them to sight a pitcht Battel with him; but the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans refused the offer, thinking it more prudence not to accept, than loss of honour to deny an Answer to the Challenge. Then the Turks sought some means to effect their design by treachery; to which end, they treated with a certain Captain for delivery of one of the Gates of the City, which he promised to do unto the Turks, but gave Advertisement unto the Governour. The Pasha the night following advanced with some Troops, hoping to find one of the Gates opened to him; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead thereof, the Defendants having prepared a Mine to receive them, sprang the same so opportunely, that it carried away the most of those who were engaged in the design, and therewith their hopes of becoming Masters speedily of that impregnable Fortress. Wherefore they resolved for a while to repose, and attend those succours which were now preparing at <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Fleet being put into a readiness, the Souldiery departed with their usual hopes of success; but meeting with their Enemy again at the Mouth of the <hi>Dardanelli,</hi> the Fight was furious and hot for a long time between them, but concluded to the disadvantage of the Turks, who there lost 6000. Men, two Gallies, three Ships, and a Mahone: howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they broke through the Venetians, and landed 12000. Men in the Isle of <hi>Candia.</hi> The News of this defeat, and the confirmation thereof, by the wounded Men which were landed at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> made a great noise amongst the people. Howsoever the Turks persisting constant to their intentions of prosecuting the War, sent Orders to the Captain-Pasha again to sight the Venetians so soon as the Fleet was resitted, and resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a condition to engage in another Battel; but the Venetians scarce gave them the leisure to repair, before they attacked them again, whereby they put them to such disorder, that they were forced to take refuge in the first convenient Port; where having attended a favourable Wind, they hastned to <hi>Constantinople;</hi> and from thence were dispeeded into the Black Sea against the Cossacks, who very much infested those parts.</p>
                     <p>The Captain Pasha being arrived, extolled his own great services and adventures, and on the contrary vilified the Great Vizier, disparaging all his actions, as mixed with weak counsels, and prosecuted with cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice, or want of true resolution; the which took such deep impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his absence, having none to answer for him; that all being given for granted which was alledged against him, orders were dispatched to <hi>Candia</hi> by an Officer, to take off his head, in whose place this Captain Pasha succeeded.</p>

Amidst of all these combustions of War, the mediation of Peace was carried on by the French Ambassadour: For though Signior <hi>Capello</hi> was actually Resident on the place, qualified with the Character of Bailo for the Republick of <hi>Venice;</hi> yet the Turks would scarce vouchsafe to treat personally with him; and indeed his sufferings by imprisonment, and other barbarous usages had affected him with such a melancholy, as rendred him uncapable for some time of administring publick Affairs; for having lost his reason by giving way to sad and black thoughts, he laid violent hands on himself, by wounding himself in two or three pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Belly; but the Wounds proving not mortal, he was in a short time restored again to a sound estate both in Mind and Body; as I shall some few years after have occasion to relate from the words of his own mouth, which he was pleased to utter to me on his death-bed, and the day before he departed this life.</p>

                     <p>THE Great Vizier after all his evil insinuations against <hi>Chusaein</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sha, fell very sick and insirm; so that the Court considering him as a person uncapable of farther service, cast their eyes on the Pasha of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> who being a daring Martial Man, was esteemed to be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chief in such a hazardous War, which for being on the Sea, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual and displeasing to the Turks. Against him nothing could be object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed besides his rebellions and contrariety to the Government; but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto it was presently answered, that the extravagance of his humour proceeded only from his Ambition of being Great Vizier; which when he had attained, that thirsty desire of Glory, which he exercis'd for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring this office, would be busied in thoughts to advance and improve his honour in actions beyond his Predecessours. Letters being arrived at this Pasha's hands, which called him to Court to accept this charge, did secretly please the humour of his haughty spirit; howsoever, he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a while in some suspence and irresolution, not being assured whether some deceit might not be concealed under this specious appearance of Preferment: But considering, that the way unto gains and advantage was by daring adventures, he resolutely accepted the proffer, and put himself in his March towards <hi>Constantinople</hi> with a glorious Equipage of forty thousand Men, thinking therewith to make good his retreat, and secure his person in case that deceit were discovered which he ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally suspected. Being arrived near unto <hi>Constantinople,</hi> he received from the Great Signior several messages of kindness, and a good welcome; and was accordingly received into the City, and invested in the office, with all the circumstances of favour and honour imaginable.</p>
                     <p>Having thus taken possession of his charge, he promised the Grand Signior that he would employ all his endeavours to restore the decayed Estate of Affairs, and reform the Government. And as an earnest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he began to remove such Ministers from the Court which were sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by him; and to render himself the more absolute, he cut off se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others, whom he imagined might in any wise disturb or controul him in the management of his Affairs.</p>
                     <p>After which he dispatched his orders to all Maritime Towns of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, to sit and make ready what Gallies and Ships were possible to be provided; intending thereby to set out the greatest Fleet that ever was
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98602:76"/>
seen in the <hi>Levant;</hi> but to compleat this work, two great difficulties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose. The first was, to find a wise and well experienced Commander, and the next was, in what manner to perswade the Spahees and Janisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to embark; for they having heard and seen in what manner their Companions had perished in this miserable War, absolutely refused to go, and though the Animosities of these two orders of Souldiers were irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable one to the other, yet in this common Cause being united, they raised so horrible a Sedition, that they assaulted the Mufti in his very house, and pursued him within the Gates of the Seraglio with a thousand reproaches and injuries, as an Author of evil Counsels, and a Disturber of the common Peace and quiet of the Empire. Nor was it possible to appease this Tumult, but by anticipating to them four months Pay; with which their minds being made more pliable, they gently yielded to Obedience, and suffered themselves to be embarked for <hi>Candia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Zarnozau Mustapha</hi> was made Captain Pasha, or General of the Fleet, which was very numerous, and well equipped, consisting of sixty Gallies, eight Mahones, thirty great Ships of War, and sixty one Gallies, belonging to the Beys. After having remained three days at the mouth of the <hi>Dardanelles</hi> near the Castles, they went out in this order; The Beys Gallies were the first, then followed the Ships, next the Mahones, and the Rear consisted wholly of the Grand Signiors Gallies. The Van of the Fleet being the Beys Gallies, which are always the best manned, and provided, were ordered to attack the main Body of the Christian Fleet, for that being seconded with the Ships they would be able to sustain the shock until the Mahones could come up, which were directed against the starboard Wing of the Enemy, composed of Galleasses. The Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians, though much inferiour in number, yet as great in courage, gave evident signs of their desire to fight, with hopes, by Gods Blessing, to obtain a Victory. The Venetians whilst the Turks passed, remained still with their Anchors apique, which the Turks interpreting as a token of their courage and boldness, were so daunted that they began to ply towards the Coast of <hi>Greece;</hi> but being forced to pass under the Guns of the Venetian Admiral, they were so ill treated by his Broadsides, that they were discouraged from making a second charge. The Ships, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vessels fared little better, being forced to pass under the Guns of the Enemies Fleet. The Captain Pasha attempted to pass on the Coast of <hi>Anatolia,</hi> with his lighter Gallies, but being hindred by a strong party of the Enemy, he was forced to follow the rest of the Fleet, taking his Course with them by the Coast of <hi>Greece.</hi> In this Charge one of the Turks Mahones was sunk, and two disabled: But the greatest Fight hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened between a Squadron of the Turks Ships, and four of the Venetians, which had been hard put to it, had not the Captain <hi>Mocenigo</hi> come in to their assistance; howsoever, the Venetian Captain of the Ship, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Crown,</hi> was slain by a Musket shot. In short, the Christians boarded the Turks with so much vigour and resolution, that they took several of their Ships, and mixing with the thickest of their other Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, they put many ashore, and others escaping in their Boats, left their Slaves and Gallies to the disposal of the Enemy; so that the Venetians obtained that day a hundred brass Guns, with a signal Victory, having had no other important Loss, unless the Ship called the <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Goliah,</hi> which being overpowered, was burnt by the Turks.</p>

The People of the Turks, who were in daily expectation to receive <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1655"/> intelligence of a success agreeable to so great preparations, were much troubled to hear the news of the Defeat given to their naval Forces; of which miscarriage the World dividing it self into different conjectures, the most part, especially those of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> attributed the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of all to the ill Government, and want of experience in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. Wherefore to appease the People, especially the Merchants, who were weary of this marine War; from whence they reaped nothing but losses of their Ships and Goods; It was thought fit to enter into a Treaty with Signior <hi>Capello,</hi> the Venetian Bailo, concerning a Peace; but he having his Commission taken from him, for the reason beforerelated, his Secretary <hi>Ballarino</hi> supplyed his office; and in order to an accommodation, had two Audiences with the Great Vizier, to whom, and to others of the Divan, he made Presents of rich pieces of Cloth of Gold, in the name of the Republick. Howsoever the Turks thinking it disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to accord unto other terms, than the intire resignation of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> proceeded in their preparations as formerly; at which the Merchants and Tradesmen at <hi>Constantinople</hi> received such matter of discontentment, that in tumults they cryed out for Peace at the Gates of the very Seraglio; and behaved themselves with that insolence, that the Janisaries were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to drive them from thence by force of Armes; howsoever this Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult and Riot of the People ended not without the Life of the Great Vizier, to whose fury he was made a Sacrifice. And though his Son ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at the Gates of the City with forty thousand men, to demand Justice on the Murderers of his Father, yet the People were so far from being dismayed thereat, that their fury and rage encreased to a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er height, and required the Authority of the Divan to keep things from running into the inconveniences of a Civil War.</p>

                     <p>THese disorders induced the chief Ministers to enter into another Treaty with <hi>Ballarino,</hi> proposing to withdraw their Forces from <hi>Candia,</hi> and make a peace, upon the payment of ten millions for the charge of the War; and to incline the Venetians hereunto, the Turks gave severe orders to their people living about <hi>Corfou,</hi> to molest the Inhabitants of that Island with all acts of Hostility imaginable; and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther published, that their intentions were to set out a more numerous and stronger Fleet than any which from the beginning of this War had failed on the Seas; and in order thereunto, great numbers of Slaves, consisting of <hi>Cossacks</hi> and <hi>Moscovites,</hi> were bought of the Tartars, and transported to <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Venetians were not in the least affrighted at these boastings of the Turk, but on the contrary, knowing that their Affairs in <hi>Candia</hi> were well secured and provided, gave orders to <hi>Ballarino</hi> to desist from farther Treaties, and to procure his Licence to depart. And the Turks to evidence their intentions to prosecute the War, entered into <hi>Canea</hi> with twenty eight sail laden with Armes and Provisions, on which also were fifteen hundred men. By this conveyance was sent a Janisar. Aga with Orders from the Grand Signior to constitute <hi>Chusaein</hi> Pasha, in the place of Captain Pasha, or Admiral of the Seas; but he judging this to be a design, or lure to draw him from his Post, or Office, wherein
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98602:77"/>
he was more strong and secure, acknowledged the honour of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1656"/> but framed excuses to continue his Seat and place of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence, which the Chief Ministers were forced to accept; it being a conjucture more seasonable to dissemble, than to resent his refusal.</p>
                     <p>Whilst new preparations were making against <hi>Candia,</hi> so horrible a storm of Mutiny and Sedition arose at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as constrained the Grandees of the Council to quit for the present all thoughts of providing for the War against the Enemy, that they might defend and save themselves from the fury of their own People; For the Spahees and Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisaries joining together, pretended to reform the abuses of the State; to perform which, in a furious tumult, putting themselves in Arms, they ran to the Divan, where they deposed the Great Vizier, and discharged divers other Officers of their employment; The Mufti was constrained to fly <note place="margin">A Rebellion at <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
                        </note> to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and the Queen Mother scarce remained secure in her old Seraglio. And to so great a height their Rebellion proceeded, that they proposed even to dethrone the Grand Signior himself. And having thus cast off all respect and duty to their Prince, they entred the Imperial Palace, and forcing the Guards, broke up the Treasury, and carried two millions from thence. Amidst of this horrid and affrighting Confusion, Merchants and well-meaning Citizens remained in the most astonishing apprehensions imaginable; for all Laws being broken, and Justice unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, the whole City laid open to be pillaged and sacked by the licentiousness of an unbridled Souldiery. For several days the Offices both of the Mufti, and Great Vizier remained vacant, by reason that the two Factions of Janisaries and Spahees could not agree upon the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. At length the most seditious amongst them wearying out the others with Quarrels and Contests, advanced a Fellow of no understanding or reputation to the eminent degree of Great Vizier; in which condition he remained not long. For the fire of the multitude being with time quenched, and the popular heat abated, this new Vizier was displaced, all things returning to their usual Channel, and Authority to its Fountain. And that matters might more easily be restored to their ancient order, the Grand Signior called for the Pasha of <hi>Damascus</hi> to receive the Dignity of Great Vizier, for he being a Person of eighty years of Age, and of long experience in Affairs, having managed the most weighty Charges of the Empire, was looked on by all as the most proper person to compose, and heal these great distempers in the State; and this was that famous <hi>Kuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee,</hi> who was Father to him who succeeded him in this Office. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sha of <hi>Silistria</hi> was also constituted Captain Pasha, and <hi>Chusaein</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in his Government of <hi>Candia.</hi> And now the bright Beams of Justice and Government having dissipated the storms and fury of popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar sollevations; the Grand Signior in Person mounting his horse, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with his principal Ministers of State, visited all the Parts of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> where making Inquisition for the principal Leaders and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters of this Rebellion, he seized on some, and without further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, boldly executed them in the face of the People. But before things were reduced to this condition, four Months were spent in this horrid Confusion; and what is most strange, this Great Empire for so long time remained without a Pilot, tossed on the Waves of popular Commotions; all which served to give ease, and respite to the Venetians in their War, but not to operate towards a Peace; so resolute were the Turks in their design of making an entire Conquest of <hi>Candia.</hi>

For having again Equipped a most formidable Fleet, consisting of 60. light Gallies, 28. Ships, and 9.

Gallies, and some Boats, or Brigantines; howsoever the Turks were not so confident in their numbers, but that they judged it requisite to fortify themselves with two Batteries; one on the Coast of <hi>Anatolia,</hi> and the other on the European shore; whereby they imagined, that they might cause the Venetians to give way, and open a passage to their Fleet: But notwithstanding the continual shot <note place="margin">Engagement between the Turks and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians.</note> which the Turks made upon them, they still kept their Station from the <hi>23th</hi> to the <hi>26th</hi> of <hi>June;</hi> when the Wind coming about to the North, which was favourable for the Turks to Sail out, and to bring them nearer to their Enemies, they began gently to approach; and the like the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians endeavoured, being desirous to join Battel; at which firmness of resolution, the Turks being a little startled, became willing to avoid the sight, and to creep under the shelter of the point of <hi>Babiers,</hi> which locks in one of the Bayes between the Castles and the Mouth of the <hi>Darda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelli.</hi> But the Wind on a sudden turning favourable for the Venetians, the Prior of <hi>Rochelle</hi> with his Squadron, and <hi>Mocenigo</hi> with three Ships under his Command, made up towards the Castles, with design to cut the Turks off from their Retreat; the others valiantly assailed the Turks, who defending themselves like those, whose chief security con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in their Arms, there ensued a most miserable slaughter on one side, and the other; at length the success of Victory happened to the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who were animated by the couragious Example of their General <hi>Marcello,</hi> though he having Boarded, and become Master of a great Ship called a <hi>Soltana,</hi> with the Gally which attended her, was shot in the thigh with a Cannon Bullet, and thereby gained the glory to die Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Triumphant. After whose Death the Proveditor taking upon him the Command of the Fleet, prosecuted the Victory so close, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting 14. Gallies which escaped with the Captain Pasha, and 4. Gallies of the Beyes; all the whole Fleet was either taken, sunk, or burnt. The Venetians not being able to Man all the Vessels that they had taken, <note place="margin">The Venetians obtain the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</note> set many of them on fire in the Night, excepting only 12. Gallies, 4. Ships, and 2. Galleasses, which they reserved for a demonstration, or evidence of their Victory. With this glorious success 5000. poor Christians ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their freedom, and had their Chains and Shackles knocked off. What number the Turks might have lost is uncertain; but as to the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians, it is reported, that besides their General, there were not above 300. Men in all killed and wounded.</p>
                     <p>The Venetians being encouraged by this success, attacked the Island of <hi>Tenedos,</hi> and in the space of four days became Masters of it; as also in a short time afterwards of <hi>Stalimene,</hi> antiently called <hi>Lemnos;</hi> the which shameful losses, and overthrow, so irritated the mind of the G.

Signiors March into <hi>Dalmatia</hi> was suspended; his presence and authority being esteemed most requisite in such a Conjuncture of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles at the heart and center of his Empire. After which, the appearance of the G. Signior in publick was less frequent; for that he might hasten the departure of the Spahees and Janisaries for <hi>Candia,</hi> he deferred his Journy to <hi>Adrianople</hi> for some time; but they being averse to this War, refused to march, until first they had received all Arrears, which were due to them; the which audacious proposal so inconsed the G. Signior, that he caused the heads of two of the most forward Mutineers to be cut off in his presence.</p>
                     <p>This unseasonable rigour rather provoked the spirits of discontented men, than abated them; and the continual prizes which the Venetians made on the Turks, and stoppage of provisions, which did usually sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <hi>Constantinople</hi> from the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> raised the price of Bread, and of all Victuals in that populous City, so that the people murmured and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, as if they had been reduced to their last extremity. The G. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier considering that the loss of <hi>Tenedos</hi> was the cause of all these incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences; promised the Inhabitants of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain it in a short time; in order to which, he set forth a very numerous Fleet, to besiege that Fortress; but contrary Winds, and bad weather, forced them into a Neighbouring Port, where they attended the Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Beyes Gallies with them. The General of the Venetians having received advice hereof, put to Sea, that he might hinder these two Fleets from joining; and was no sooner in the Channel of <hi>Scio,</hi> than that he met with 10. Sail of <hi>Barbary</hi> men of War, convoying a great number of Saiques, and other Vessels, of which 14. were laden with provisions, carrying also with them 200 thousand Crowns, which was the Tribute of <hi>Rhodes:</hi> these the Venetians assailed with such Courage and success, that they burnt the ten Ships, and many of the Saiques; killed a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Turks, took 400. Prisoners, delivered 300. Christians; with the loss only of 100. killed, and 300. wounded.</p>
                     <p>This and other losses augmented the discontents at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> so that the G. Vizier to hold up the spirits of the people, resolved to go in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98602:79"/>
person to <hi>Tencdos;</hi> and accordingly Equipped a Fleet of 18. Ships, 30. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1657"/> Gallies, 10. Galleasses, with an innumerable Company of Saiques, and other Vessels; whereon he Embarked 20. thousand Horse, and 80. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Foot; with which Army the Vizier sailed out of the <hi>Dardanelli,</hi> on the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> having first received intelligence, that <hi>Mocenigo</hi> was not returned from the <hi>Morea,</hi> where he had been for some time in chase of certain Ships; Howsoever the Turks found not the passage so clear, but that they encountred with a Squadron of 18. Sail of Men of War, under the Command of Signior <hi>Bembo;</hi> the which seeming an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable number to the Turks, they assailed them with undoubted hopes of Victory. The Admiral and Vice-Admiral of the Turks, with five other great Ships, charged the Venetian Admiral, who defended himself so bravely, that for three hours they lay Board and Board; the rest of the Turkish Fleet assailed the other part of their Enemies Fleet so close, that the Fight became terrible and bloody, both for one and the other, until at length the Turks being worsted were put to flight, and in the pursuit a great Turkish Sultana was put ashore near <hi>Troy;</hi> one of their Galleasses was disabled, two of their Ships sunk, and the rest were cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed as far as <hi>Metylene,</hi> being put by the Island of <hi>Tenedos.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this Interim, the General <hi>Mocenigo</hi> was on his Voyage towards the <hi>Dardanelli,</hi> and being come within the noise of the Cannon, he hastened with more diligence; and arrived so seasonably to the assistance of <hi>Bem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo,</hi> that at his appearance most of the Turkish Gallies began to turn their sterns, and make towards the shore of <hi>Anatolia</hi> with such disorder, that of twenty eight Gallies, and two Galleasses, there were but five only which kept company with the Bastard Gally of the Captain Pasha, and entred with him under the defence of the Castles. The rest of the Fleet was chased by <hi>Mocenigo,</hi> but the Turks being to windward, the Christians were not able that day to come up with them. The next day the Wind being more favourable, a Council of War was held aboard the Venetian General; during which consultation, they espied five Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies making towards the Point <hi>Baba,</hi> there to secure themselves under the Shore; and thereupon resolved, that whilst the Captain General with the Squadron of <hi>Malta,</hi> attempted those 5. Gallies, and others which had taken the same place of refuge; the rest of the Fleet should keep siring at those without. Accordingly the Captain General made towards the Point <hi>Baba,</hi> where passing within Musket-shot, and under the reach of five Batteries, an unfortunate Shot in the powder-room blew up the Ship, and therewith ended the days of this valiant <hi>Mocenigo,</hi> who died full of honour and glory; his brave actions continuing his Memory in all the Histories of <hi>Venice.</hi> The Proveditor succeeding in his Command prosecuted the same design, and as if he would imitate the antient funeral piles, he celebrated the Obsequies of his General, by burning the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Gally of the Turks, and thence retired towards <hi>Tenedos.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After the Turks had refitted their Vessels, and put their Fleet in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable posture, they departed from <hi>Metylene</hi> the <hi>28th.</hi> of <hi>July</hi> at night, and on the <hi>30th.</hi> were on the Coast of <hi>Tenedos,</hi> where immediately <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Tenedos</hi> retaken by the Turks.</note> landing five thousand Men, and great numbers approaching ready to set their Foot on shore, the Defendants of the Fortress summoned a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of War, at which all agreeing that the Island was not tenable against so great a force, embarked their Men, Ammunition, and Artillery, and resigned their place to the Disposal and Command of the Enemy. After
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98602:79"/>
which success the Turks in like manner landed ten thousand men on the Island of <hi>Lemnos,</hi> where, having laid a formal Siege to the Castle, they made a general assault, but were repulsed with the loss of five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, leaving their sealing Ladders to the Besieged. They made afterwards divers attempts, but in all were beaten off with considerable loss; so that they had abandoned the Enterprize, had not the greater fear and apprehension of the Divan at home confirmed their courage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Enemy; until at length the Christians being wearied with two <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Lemnos</hi> reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> months Siege, without hopes of relief, were forced to a surrender, which was performed on Articles, That they should depart with Armes, and Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, and have free liberty to embark themselves for <hi>Candia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These two important places being regained by the Turks, were the subject of great joy to the Court, and of courage and satisfaction to the Inhabitants of <hi>Constantinople:</hi> So that the Grand Signior apprehending that by these successes, the Seditions and Mutinies of the City were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased, he took his Journey to <hi>Adrianople;</hi> where to evidence his Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur to the Bailo <hi>Capello,</hi> and the Secretary <hi>Ballarino,</hi> he made his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with an Army of twenty thousand men, besides the ordinary atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Court, and usual Concomitants of the Ottoman Train. After which Ostentation, the Grand Signior encharged <hi>Ballarino</hi> to write to the Senate, That though he was able to over-run all their Country, and take from them their Capital City, yet such was his clemency, that he was contented to grant them peace, on conditions that they surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to him all the Island of <hi>Candia,</hi> with the Fortress of <hi>Clissia</hi> in <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia,</hi> and payment of three millions of Gold for the dammages of the War. But these seemed to the Senate to be such unreasonable proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and so prejudicial to their honour, that they resolved to maintain the War, and to defend themselves more vigourously than ever.</p>

                     <head>ANNO 1658.</head>
                     <p>NOtwithstanding the designs of the Turks against <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> they were not less intent to their Affairs in <hi>Candia,</hi> designing to try their fortune once again in the Siege of the principal City of that name, for that that falling into their hands, the whole Island would quickly be reduced, and with that Conquest an end would be put unto the War. The Venetians on the other side, attended to their business with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, not neglecting any provisions which might secure their interest in that Country; and that they might regain what they had lost, they held intelligence with some persons in <hi>Canea,</hi> hoping by their means to surprise the Town; but the Turkish Governour, being very vigilant, reinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his Garison with five hundred men; and <hi>Chusaein</hi> Pasha coming to his assistance with thirty Gallies, disappointed the Venetians of landing at that place.</p>
                     <p>The Rendezvous of the Army which was to march into <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> was ordered to be at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> where the Brother in Law of the Pasha of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> who was Commander of the Forces of that place, arriving later than the day presixed, was for that reason put do death by the Great Vizier. This severity so enraged the Pasha, that immediately he raised <note place="margin">The Rebellion of the Pasha of <hi>Aleppo.</hi>
                        </note> an Army of forty thousand men, and marched towards <hi>Scutari,</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Constantinople</hi> it self, unless the head of the Great Vizier were given him by way of reprizal for that of his Brothers. The Divan being start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98602:80"/>
hereat, returned him a gentle message, neither denying nor granting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1658"/> his demand, as if they intended to amuse him with hopes: but he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting this delay for a refusal, did not only persist in requiring the head of the Vizier, but of four other principal Councellours, whom he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have concurred in the Sentence for his Brothers death; and in far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prosecution hereof, he burnt and spoiled all the Country about <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople;</hi> and the Plague raging at the same time in the City, affected the Inhabitants with such sadness and discontent, that the chief Ministers apprehended more evil from thence than from the Enemy without. The Army of the Pasha daily increasing, and being grown from forty to sixty thousand men, caused the Vizier to abandon all other thoughts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs but those which tended to the destruction of the Pasha, and his Complices; so that there necessarily followed a revulsion of the Forces from <hi>Dalmatia;</hi> the Vizier himself diverting them from thence and <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silvania,</hi> marched with the whole Army towards <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet before the Great Vizier departed from <hi>Adrianople,</hi> he perswaded the Grand Signior to set the Bailo <hi>Capello,</hi> and the Secretary <hi>Ballarino</hi> at liberty, that thereby he might give some jealousie to the Rebels, as if he designed to make a Peace with <hi>Venice,</hi> to have more power, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter leisure to make his War against them. This Counsel, though prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given, had yet little influence on the humour of the Pasha, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his March, fortifying himself in the most advantageous Passes of the Country: But what was most bold of all his actions, and rendred his pardon beyond the clemency of his Soveraign, was the proclaiming a Youth of twenty years of Age, then with him in his Army, to be the Son of <hi>Sultan Morat,</hi> and consequently the lawful Heir of the Crown; and that in right of him, he had taken possession of a great part of <hi>Asia,</hi> and was marching towards <hi>Constantinople,</hi> with resolution to dispossess <hi>Sultan Mehmet,</hi> and exalt this lawful and undoubted Heir on the Throne of his Ancestors.</p>
                     <p>This and other rumours from <hi>Persia,</hi> that that King taking the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of these disorders, was making preparations to regain <hi>Bagdat,</hi> or <hi>Babylon,</hi> and revenge himself of all those cruelties which the Turks had inflicted on his Subjects and Country, increased the fears and cares of the chief Ministers of State. Notwithstanding which, <hi>Chusaein</hi> Pasha prosecuted his business no less in <hi>Candia</hi> than formerly, in hopes to put an end to the War there, before the end of the Summer; and in order thereunto, he received a Recruit of five and twenty thousand men, from the <hi>Morea.</hi> But the daily increase of the Pasha's Forces, and his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach towards <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as it was a matter of the highest conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, so it required the most prudence and caution in the management. In the first place therefore by <hi>Fetfa,</hi> or Resolve from the Mufti, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sha was declared a Rebel, and guilty of High Treason against the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> notwithstanding which, a Chaous was dispatched with Letters of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, if now repenting of his fault, he would disband his Army, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his former obedience, he should be received into grace and favour. The Pasha received the Chaous with the same Ceremony and honour, as if he had been an Ambassadour, being willing to consider him under that Character, rather than under the notion of a Pursuivant, or Officer sent to affright him into his Duty; and in answer to the message replyed, That it was not in his power to condescend to any conditions, for that since he had assumed the Cause of this Youth, who was the Son of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98602:80"/>
Morat,</hi> concealed to that Age by his Mother, for fear of the power of his Uncle, he could not assent to any terms or conditions less than the Exaltation of him to the Ottoman Throne: and so carrying this Young Man with him, as a property, whereby to cover his Rebellion with the Guise of Justice and Duty; he maintained a Court for him after the Ottoman fashion; and causing the <hi>Tagho,</hi> or Standards to be carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, he permitted him to give Audiences, send Dispatches, and to take on him all the royal marks of Empire. The Army of the Pasha was by this time encreased to seventy thousand Men, one Part of which he sent towards <hi>Scutari,</hi> and another towards <hi>Smyrna,</hi> which alarm'd all the Countries round about, and gave the Grand Signior such cause of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, that he tryed divers means, and made many propositions of honours and benefits to the Pasha, whereby to allure him to obedience; One while he offered to him the Government of G. <hi>Cairo,</hi> but that being rejected, he endeavoured to raise men in <hi>Asia</hi> to oppose the progress of his Armes; of which some numbers being got into a Body, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the formidable Force of the Pasha, revolted, and joined themselves to his Party. This extremity of Affairs caused the Grand Signior not only again to proclaim the Pasha a Rebel, but to give liberty to his people to destroy him and his Souldiers in any parts where they should encounter them. In pursuance of which Licence, a Village in <hi>Asia</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving killed twenty five or thirty of the Pasha's men, which came thither to refresh themselves; the Pasha was so enraged thereat, that he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his Souldiers to put Man, Woman, and Child to the sword through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Village. And in this manner the Affairs of the Turks remained in the greatest Confusion imaginable through the whole course of this year 1658.</p>

                  <div type="year">

                     <p>NOR did this Year begin with better Omens of success, for to the other dangers was added a report, that the Persian had taken the Field with two hundred thousand Men, for recovery of <hi>Bagdat,</hi> or <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> which was the Ancient Patrimony of his Forefathers; so that the Grand Signior being rendred thereby more willing to agree and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate Affairs with the Pasha, proffered to him the Government of the Province of <hi>Soria</hi> for ever, paying only a yearly homage of a hundred thousand Sultanees, in lieu of three hundred thousand, which that Country always yielded. But the Pride of the Pasha scorned a proffer of so mean a consideration, having nothing less in his thoughts than the entire en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the Empire, or at least to partake an equal share thereof with the Sultan. Forthe hopesof the Pasha encreasing with his Army, which was now grown to eighty thousand men; he took up for some days his head-Quarters near the Fortress of <hi>Tocacaia,</hi> within ten days March of <hi>Smyrna;</hi> and thence approaching towards <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters concluded that there was no other safety but in their Armes, and that the Pasha was not to be reduced to any terms of gentleness or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. Accordingly the Great Vizier passed into <hi>Asia</hi> with a numerous Army, and speedily joined Battel with the Pasha, which continued for some hours with great slaughter on one side and the other; but at length the fortune of the day turned in favour of the Pasha, and the Viziers Army being routed, he lost all his Cannon and Baggage, and he himself
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98602:81"/>
was forced to save himself in the neighbouring Countries; where not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1659"/> being pursued by the Pasha, he had time again to collect his torn and scattered Troops. The news hereof multiplied the disorders and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to which being added the motion of the Persians, and that they were to join with the Pasha, as also some troubles in <hi>Transilvania</hi> caused by the unquiet spirit of <hi>Ragotski,</hi> together with the ill humour of the male-contents in the City, made all things appear with equal, or greater danger at home than abroad.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, as the ultimate remedy of these imminent dangers, it was resolved, that the Grand Signior should go in person to the War, on supposition that Reverence to his Royal Person would produce that awe on the spirits of his Subjects, which was not to be effected by violence, or force of Armes. According to this resolution the Grand Signior pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into <hi>Asia,</hi> and joining his Forces with those of the Vizier, compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed an Army of seventy thousand Foot, and thirty thousand Horse, with which marching boldly towards the Enemy, the heart of the Pasha be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fail him; so that calling a Council of his Officers, he proposed his inclinations towards terms of agreement, rather than to hazard all on the uncertainties of a Battel; the spirits of the Souldiery being now become tractable by the appearance of so great a Force, assented to the proposition; and thereupon Articles being speedily drawn up, were sent to the Grand Signior for his approbation, who, though he would not seem to refuse any thing therein contained, yet declined a personal Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as being a matter too mean for his Imperial Person to capitulate with his Vassals; and therefore ordered, that <hi>Mortaza</hi> Pasha should treat in his behalf, promising to confirm whatsoever Act <hi>Mortaza</hi> Pasha should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in this matter. <hi>Mortaza</hi> being thus made Plenipotentiary, refused to treat with the Pasha, until such time as he had retreated with his Army at a distance of some days March from the Grand Signior's Camp; which being performed near a Town called <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he foolishly suffered himself to be separated in a private place from his Army, on pretence that Peace was more aptly concluded in a free retirement, than under the constraint and force of the Souldiery. Here <hi>Mortaza</hi> meeting the Pasha forcibly strangled him with 17. of his Complices, whom he had brought with him for Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to his Capitulations with the Grand Signior. With the news hereof the Army of the Pasha soon disbanded, every one with shame and silence shift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for himself, retired to his own Country and home. And herewith easily ended this Civil War almost in a moment, which but now threatned the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of the Ottoman Race. The cruel Vizier retained his thoughts of revenge, which we shall shortly hear in what manner he vented on the great Spahees and rich Men in <hi>Asia,</hi> who had joined themselves with the Pasha in this Rebellion. This good service promoted <hi>Mortaza,</hi> and rendred him more considerable to the Grand Signior; so that he was employed in the assistance of the Tartars, against <hi>Ragotski</hi> in <hi>Transilvania,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards preferred to the important Charge of <hi>Bagdat,</hi> or <hi>Babylon,</hi> of whose success, and Fate we shall hear in the Sequel of a few years.</p>
                     <p>But as yet the Commotions of <hi>Asia</hi> were not so wholly extinguished, but that the Nephew of the Pasha of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> in revenge of the treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous death of his Uncle, took up Armes, and was followed by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Territories depending on <hi>Aleppo.</hi> To his assistance came in also the Son of <hi>Chusaein</hi> Pasha, late General in <hi>Candia,</hi> whom the cruel Vizier had put to death, notwithstanding the merit of his late services,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98602:81"/>
which might seem to attone for his former misfortunes, and make satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for non-compliance with instructions; but this Vizier, who never pardoned any Person, would not begin with an Act of clemency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one who was none of his Creatures, or Confidents depending on him. To these joined the Bey of <hi>Torgue,</hi> who casting off his Obedience to the Pasha of <hi>Cairo,</hi> entered into the Cabal with ten thousand Horse; so that a formidable Army being composed by this Union, gave a new subject of fear and apprechension at <hi>Constantinople.</hi> But the Great Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier so dextrously managed his Affair, by sowing Dissention between the Chiefs, and bestowing Largesses to the Souldiery, that the Army un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly mouldred away, leaving their Generals, and Commanders to shift for themselves, and exposing them to the Justice of a Vizier, who was unacquainted with mercy, and never pardoned any who was either guilty of a fault, or suspected for it.</p>
                     <p>Towards the end of this Year the Vizier built the lower Forts, which are scituated at the entrance into the <hi>Dardanelles,</hi> commonly called by the name of the Queen Mothers Castles. And dispatched a Chaous to the Pasha of <hi>Canea,</hi> to put all things in a readiness for the Siege of <hi>Candia:</hi> Orders were also given to the Pashaws of the Inland Countries to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themselves for the Wars against <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and <hi>Transilvania.</hi>

                     <p>THE Rendezvous of the Army being appointed at <hi>Belgrade,</hi> the Vizier hastened thither in Person to quicken the preparations, and March of the Souldiers, which were flocking thither from all parts. This Vizier <hi>Kuperlee,</hi> though aged, was yet very active and vigorous, by which he created so much confidence of himself in his Master, that he acted nothing in all the Government but by his counsel and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which being always jealous and bloody towards those who had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny power in the Empire; he for that reason cut off the Casir of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macus,</hi> who though he was a good Governour, and a faithful Servant, yet because he was a Favourite of the Queen Mother, and conserved the. State of his Affairs in a laudable posture, he grew jealous of his power, and therefore sacrificed his blood to his own security and bloudy dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. The which act of unjust cruelty so enraged the Queen Mother, that she for ever after bore a mortal harted to this Vizier, and continued the same to his Son, which was the famous <hi>Kuperlee;</hi> but his moderation and discretion was so well tempered with respect towards her, that She at length not only pardoned the sin of his Father in him, but became his Friend, and relished the services which he performed for his Master.</p>
                     <p>The Venetians having about this time received considerable succours, namely 4000. French Foot, which his most Christian Majesty after the Conclusion of Peace at the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Treaty, had most generously spared to that Republick, were enabled to attempt some notable enterprize; and thereby so hardly pressed the Pasha of <hi>Canea,</hi> that he earnestly wrote to the G. Signior for succours; assuring him that without present re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, he should be forced to surrender his Town to the mercy of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. The G. Signior promised him speedy relief, and for his better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement sent him the Present of a Sword and a Vest of Sables; in the mean time the Venetians took three Forts, <hi>viz. Calamo, Calegro,</hi> and <hi>Epicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> and proceeded to lay Siege to <hi>Canea;</hi> but the Enemy having received a

supply of 3000. men into the Town, the Christians quitted this enterprize <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1660"/> in hopes of beating the Turks out of new <hi>Candia;</hi> which was lately built near to the old <hi>Candia,</hi> with design to keep that Town straitned by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Alarms, and by the vicinity of so bad a Neighbourhood.</p>
                     <p>The G.

The Vizier following the advice of his Physicians, returned to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> where having in a good measure recovered his health, he sent Orders to <hi>Hali</hi> Pasha, then General of the Forces in <hi>Hungary,</hi> to hasten the Siege of <hi>Varadin,</hi> being esteemed by the Turks an advantagious For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress for carrying on their Conquests in that Country; of the taking of which Town, and of all the troubles in <hi>Transilvania,</hi> caused by the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious humour of <hi>Ragotzki,</hi> we shall treat at large in the following Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story. For being come to that time, in which Providence allotted me a charge at <hi>Constantinople;</hi> I was thereby somewhat elevated on a rising ground, whereby I could with my own Eyes survey the Transactions of that great Empire; and for that reason I call them my Memoirs; which for being matters transacted in my own time, I have thought fit to introduce them with a short Advertisement to the Reader.</p>

                  <p>THis following History is some part of those fruits arising from my vacant hours of eighteen Years residence in <hi>Turky,</hi> seven whereof I compleated at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> in quality of Secretary to the Lord Ambassadour, and for eleven Years I exercised the Office of Consul at <hi>Smyrna.</hi> In the first times of which, I had great advantages to observe, and make my Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; having for the most part been acquainted with the persons as well as with the affairs of those concerning whom I write; and indeed the incumbence which was then upon me, obliged me to a knowledge both of persons and business. My latter time, which was that of being Consul, constrained me to an attendance on matters relating to the government of our <hi>Trade;</hi> and therefore it is not to be expected, that at that distance from the Court, I should lay down Transactions so positive, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, as in the preceeding Years; yet the acquaintance, and correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence I afterwards continued at Court, and the care I took to inform my self of what occurred, qualified me in some measure for an Historian; at least put me into a condition to make a Breviate, or Collection of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Observations occurring in the Turkish Court.</p>
                  <p>When I first entered on this work, I was carried with a certain emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of French and Italian Writers, of whose Ministers few there were employed in the parts of <hi>Turky,</hi> but who carried with them from thence, Memoirs, Giornals, or Historical Observations of their times. In which our Nation hath been so defective, that besides some scattered and abrupt Papers, without coherence, or method, adjoined to the end of <hi>Knoll's</hi> History of the Turks (which is an excellent collection from divers Authours) one shall scarce find five sheets of Paper wrote by our Countrymen in way of History. At which omission having often won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, I resolved from my first entrance in those Countries, to note down in a blank Book what occurred in that Empire, either as to civil, or mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary affairs; with what Casualties and Changes befel our Trade, that so both one and the other might serve for Examples and Precedents to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Ages; the which after some years afforded me materials to compose and frame this following Discourse. In which, having by Gods assistance
<pb facs="tcp:98602:84"/>
thus far proceeded; As it may be an Example to my Successours, to spin and draw out the thread of this History through Ages to come; so it will be a good part, and office, of those who reside there at present, by a more diligent enquiry to correct, and amend what I have mistaken, or misunderstood.</p>
                  <p>For next to the immediate attendance to the Charge and Trust imposed upon me, I judged it a chief duty towards my Country, to denote and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord certain Transactions relating to Trade, which is the grand Interest that bath engaged <hi>England</hi> to a Communication, and Correspondence, with these remote Parts: nor doth the World perhaps expect much less from me, than that I should add something to the History of the Turks in our time, which howsoever imperfectly I may perform it; yet the Of. fices which I have exercised, and the impartiality with which it is wrote, may gain it some credit and reputation in the World. For in the writing hereof, I cannot be taxed with animosity to any person; nor am I to be esteemed as possessed with affection, or partiality to any side; which is a point of sobriety, and good temper, necessary for all Historians: For we who lived in those parts, were little concerned for the House of <hi>Ku<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlee,</hi> or for the Favourites of the Court; nor was it of any moment to us, whether the Faction of the Spahees, or Janizaries prevailed; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Courtiers, or the Souldiers, ruled the Empire: only we esteemed it our duty, to speak best of that Government under which our Trade thrived most. And though the times of <hi>Sultan Ibrahim</hi> were the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den days for Merchants, which employed our Navigation beyond the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of any times, either before, or since; and consumed of our Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factories (though not in greater quantities) yet perhaps with better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and profit to our Nation: Yet I ought not to be so injurious, or ungrateful to <hi>Sultan Mahomet</hi> the Fourth, as to accuse his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Oppression, or Violence towards us, or of any breach of Articles, and Priviledges, which he had granted to his Majesties Subjects; but shall rather applaud, and be ready to own that Justice which our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints have found, and met at the Ottoman Court, under the protection of those worthy Ambassadours sent by his Majesty to stand Centinel on the Guard of their Country.</p>
                  <p>For whereas in the time of <hi>Sultan Morat,</hi> when the Military men bore the sway; Injustice and Violence, which mingled in all the actions of Rule, had an influence also on the English affairs: And when in the time of <hi>Sultan Ibrahim,</hi> that the Female Court had gained the predominancy; and that vast Treasures were expended in Riot and Luxury; the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of great persons made it necessary to be rapacious and unjust: But in these more moderate times of this present Sultan, when neither excessive Wars abroad, nor Luxury nor immoderate expences at home, exhausted the Coffers.
<pb facs="tcp:98602:84"/>
We may easily imagine, that the disorders of State did not drive the Rulers to a necessity of exercising unjust Arts, which are always most certain Sym ptoms, either of a bad Government, or a vitious inclination in the Prince.</p>
                  <p>The English Trade according to the Chronicles of Sir <hi>Richard Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> was first introduced into the Country of the Turks, in the Year 1579. but <hi>Sagredo</hi> an Italian Writer, accounts only from the Year 1583. perhaps before that time Overtures were only made for a Trade, which might be so inconsiderable, as that until then it was not esteemed worthy to be adorned with an Ambassadour, or to be opposed by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Foreign Princes. For so soon as an Ambassadour from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> appeared at the Ottoman Court, with Credential Letters from Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the French and Venetian Ministers took the Alarm, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed his reception, especially the French, who (as <hi>Sagredo</hi> reports in his History of the Turks) represented unto the G. Vizier, how much this new Friendship with the English would obstruct that antient Alliance which was made with his King, and would impeach and lessen the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and Trade which they enjoyed in those parts: To which the Vizi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er answered, according to their usai phrase and stile; that the happy Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Seat where his Master resided, was called the Port, because it was free and open to all such who desired to take refuge and Sanctuary therein, and therefore the English without just reason ought not to be excluded. That the Sultan ought not to be denied that freedom of love and hatred, which was common to all Mankind; and that he was as well resolved to chuse and cherish his Friends, as to prosecute and destroy his Enemies. Whereunto the French Ambassadour urged, that since it was the pleasure of the Grand Signior to admit the English; that at least they should be obliged to enter <hi>Constantinople</hi> under the French Colours. But the English Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour replyed, that his Mistress who was so potent, scorned all Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies on other Nations, and would rather abandon the Friendship of the Sultan, than admit the least diminution of her own honour: and embellish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Discourses (as <hi>Sagredo</hi> proceeds) with the representation of that advantage and profit, which the English Trade would bring to the Ottoman Empire; he so ensnared the hearts of the Turks, that they preferred the admittance of new Guests, before the Alliance of antient Friends. Since which time our Commerce and Trade with the Turk hath been in its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, and being governed by a Wise and Grave Company of Experienced Merchants, hath by Gods blessing brought an inestimable Treasure and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the English Nation, which that it may still continue, increase, and flourish in all Ages and times to come, is the hearty desire, and Prayer of him, who is a true, and faithful Servant to that worthy Society, and a sincere Wellwisher to his Country.</p>

                  <head>THE HISTORY OF Sultan Mahomet IV. THE XIII. EMPEROUR OF THE TURKS, Beginning in the NINTH YEAR OF HIS REIGN.</head>

                     <p>IT was now the beginning of this Year, when the Earl of <hi>Winchel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sea</hi> arrived at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the first Embassadour sent abroad from His Majesty of <hi>Great Britain, Charles</hi> the Second, after his happy Return to the Glorious Throne of his Ancestors, to <hi>Sultan Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> the Thirteenth Emperour of the Turks; it being judged fit, that amongst other Alliances which were to be contracted with Foreign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98602:86"/>
and States, this of <hi>Turkey</hi> should not be omitted, but rather in the first <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1661"/> place considered: In regard, that as the flourishing Estate and prosperity of <hi>England's</hi> richesse depends absolutely on her Foreign Trade, so on none more particularly than on that of <hi>Turkey,</hi> which consumes great quantities of her most staple and substantial Manufactures, and makes returns in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Employes, and gives Bread to the poor and industrious of the Nation.</p>
                     <p>At the arrival of this Embassadour, the important affairs of this vast and still growing Empire, were governed by the Great Vizier <hi>Kuperlee;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The Vizier <hi>Kuperlee.</hi>
                        </note> a person decrepit and infirm in body, by reason of his great Age, but of a solid and subtle judgment; by Nature cruel, and by Years froward; which disposition was singularly well fitted to do service to his Master, against the impetuous storms of the Faction of those times, in which the Pashaws, and Chiefs of the Souldiery (as often it happens in Empires, whose Body is grown too vast to be ruled by a weak Head) became rich and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, and by the long Vacations of Peace, insolent and wanton; for as then the Wars with <hi>Venice</hi> were carried on faintly, only by sending forth an Armata of Gallies in the Spring; and the preparations became rather accustomary, returning with the Year, and made for exercise of the Arsenal, and amusement of the people, than designed with any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable expectation of success or Victory, proportionable to that Treasure and trouble which maintained them. So that to encounter so many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and predominancy of Ambition and Avarice, the Prince himself being young, the Fortune of his Empire had more than urgent necessity of such a rough and cruel disposition as was found in <hi>Kuperlee;</hi> who so seasonably made use of it, to the destruction of all such, who might ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther endanger his Prince, or himself; that in two or three Years time he became Master of the Lives, and Estates, of the Grand Mutiniers; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscating their richesse and fortunes to the use and security of his Master; having in his time put to Death, thirty six thousand persons, whom he proscribed in several Countries; and privately strangled in the City, by vertue of his absolute and uncontroulable Authority, without giving the Offenders liberty of Processes, or Pleas for their Lives, or the solemnity of Scaffolds, or applause of a Funeral Oration at the Gallows, whereby to win the affections and compassions of the vulgar, but went through with his bloody and tragical business, without noise, or rumour, or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge almost of all the Souldiery, or the people; whilst the great Persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, whose rapine and pride had contracted them envy and hatred from their inferiours, stood confused and amased, not having power to rebel, nor Sanctuary to fly unto.</p>
                     <p>Such is the effect of an absolute, and arbitrary power, which is Master of times and affairs, and rather fits and squares Enterprizes to Counsels, than Counsels to Enterprizes. <hi>Reges Hercule non liberi solum impedimentis omnibus, sed Domini rerum, temporum<expan>
                              <am>

Liv. lib. 9.</hi> The Grand Signior in the mean time applauded the diligence and circumspection of his Minister; and though yet trembling with the memory of late sollevations amongst the Janizaries; yet being young, and active, addicted himself wholly to the delight of Hunting, and to follow the Chace of fearful, and flying Beasts; whilst his Vizier so closely followed his game of bloud, that he left no person considerable in the Empire, who was not a Creature made by, or depending on him; unless the Kahyabei, or Lieutenant General of the Janizaries; <hi>Mortaza</hi>

Pasha of <hi>Babylon,</hi> now called by the Turks <hi>Bagdat,</hi> and the Pasha of <hi>Magnatia;</hi> Men, whose bravery, and generous Justice, or else their Guards, or Fortune, had only seated beyond the reach and Sword of this Tyrant. This was then the State of the Turkish Affairs amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: As to Foreign, and Christian Princes; The Emperour, the King of <hi>England,</hi> the French King, and the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> had their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours and Residents at the Ottoman Court, with whom as yet passed a fair and amicable correspondence, excepting with the French; whose Embassadour had then lately obtained his release from Imprisonment, to which he was confined contrary to the Law of Nations, and the Custom of the wisest, and most generous people of former Ages; and compelled to return into <hi>France;</hi> an Agent being there setled by the Merchants, to Negotiate their Affairs; the occasions and grounds whereof we have at large signified in another place: which unlawful treatment of a person sacred, none will much admire, who considers the humour of supream Ministers that judge themselves under no restraint or limits of Law; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Civil, or National. The Venetians notwithstanding the War, had two Ministers there resident; the Ecc<hi rend="sup">mo</hi> 
                        <hi>Capello,</hi> Procurator of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> a right worthy and noble person; and Signior <hi>Ballarino,</hi> a person vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, and subtle, who omitted no opportunities to advance his own For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and with that the benefit of his Republick. The Emperours Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident, called <hi>Simon Renninghen,</hi> a person sincere, free, and open heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, agreeable to the nature of the Germans; had for some Years, though with some difficulty, continued the Peace, or rather matters from break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out into an open War; the Incursions on the Frontiers, and other accidents, always administring occasions of discontent, and complaints to both parties.</p>
                     <p>But that the series of this History may be continued with an even thread, and clear light to the Reader, we must cast back our Eyes to the Year 1657. when the Ambition of <hi>George Ragotzki,</hi> Prince of <hi>Transilva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>

                        </note> began new troubles in his own Principality, and laid the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a future War between the Emperour and the Turks. For now <hi>Poland</hi> was so wearied with the incessant Wars of <hi>Moscovy</hi> (the invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Enemy of that Crown) with the frequent Rebellions of the Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacks, and the invasion of the Swedes; whom the traiterous Vice-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, and his Adherents, had invited to the spoils of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; that King <hi>Casimirus</hi> was reduced to the ultimate extremity of his Affairs; the publick Exchequer, and private Treasuries were exhausted, the Villages dispeopled, the Fields uncultivated, Traffick, and Commerce ceased; nothing but Wars, Robberies, and confusion filled the Diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals with News, and the hearts of the Inhabitants with Sorrow and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities: wherefore <hi>Casimir</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> vexed on all sides, and not knowing where or how to apply a remedy, dispatched his Great Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour <hi>Albertus Pravesmoski,</hi> in Quality of Embassadour, to demand assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from <hi>Ragotzki,</hi> promising in recompence thereof, to adopt his Son to succeed him in that Kingdom. No Message could arrive more grateful to ambitious <hi>Ragotzki,</hi> who by so desired a proffer, seemed to arrive the Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith of his Prosperity; which like the Land of Promise, being only shewed to his Father in a long Prospective, seemed now as it were, by Inheritance, to devolve upon his Son; in order unto which, many days of Treaty and Conferences were held between <hi>Ragotzki,</hi> and the Polish Ministers; but <hi>Ragotzki</hi> insisting on certain particulars, which were not in the Power
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98602:87"/>
of the King or his Commissioners to grant without the approbation of a Diet, the Treaty was dissolved, and <hi>Ragotski</hi> remained displeased, and angry; pretending himself to have been deluded and slighted, resolved to avenge the Affront, and by his Armes gain to himself the Crown of that Kingdom; so that raising a strong Army, and joining himself in a Confederate League with <hi>Sweden,</hi> he invaded <hi>Poland,</hi> wasting all the Frontiers with Fire and Sword. The Ottoman Port growing jealous of <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ragotski</hi> joins with the <hi>Swedes</hi> against <hi>Poland.</hi>
                        </note> the successes of these Affairs, and not so much of the Advance of <hi>Ragotski,</hi> as of the growing greatness of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> with whom unwillingly they would be Borderers, issued an express Command, That without contradiction or delay, he should immediately give a stop to his March, and return with his Army into <hi>Transilvania.</hi> And though the Emperor of Germany, and the <hi>Krim</hi> Tartar declared their dislike of his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, threatning to invade his Principality at home, unless he retracted himself, and desisted from this enterprize; yet <hi>Ragotski</hi> having his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding blinded with Ambition, and the lust of Rule and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, stopped his ears to the menaces of his Enemies, and the counsel of his Friends. This <hi>Ragotski</hi> enjoyed a State most happy, large, fertile, and populous, in Power inferiour to few, superiour to many; so that he might have passed peaceably and honourably with all, could his great spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit have bowed to, and complied with his Potent Neighbours. For on <note place="margin">The difficulty of <hi>Ragotski's</hi> Affairs.</note> the one side the Puissant power of the Turk threatned him, to whom the least Ombrages of displeasure administer occasion of War; On the side of <hi>Hungary</hi> the Emperour over-awed him; On the side of <hi>Valachia,</hi> and <hi>Moldavia</hi> he lay open to the incursion of the Tartars: So that a man might rationally expect, That this Prince should have esteemed it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour enough to have conserved his own without rendring himself obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious to the jealousie and suspicion of his Neighbours. But his great spirit was so enamoured of a Crown, and so bewitched with the hopes of obtaining it, that nothing seemed difficult or improbable to the acquisition of his longing desires, which were the occasion of all those calamities and miseries in <hi>Hungary,</hi> which afterwards ensued.</p>
                     <p>In contemplation of all which foreseen evils, his Cesarean Majesty sent a Message to the Ottoman Port, declaring against the temerity and audaciousness of <hi>Ragotski;</hi> who in the mean time subdued the Fort of <hi>Bristia,</hi> invaded with Fire and Sword the Province of <hi>Russia,</hi> plunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Podolia,</hi> and advanced as far as <hi>Camonitz,</hi> a Fortress strong by Art and Nature; and joining afterwards with the <hi>Swedes,</hi> assisted them in the subjection of <hi>Cracovia.</hi> About this time the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the third began to send succours into <hi>Poland,</hi> and to protest against the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of <hi>Ragotski,</hi> but being surprised by sickness, soon after passed to a better life; which for some time, giving a stop to the assistance of <hi>Poland,</hi> was interpreted by <hi>Ragotski,</hi> as a happy Omen of his good Fortune.</p>
                     <p>But how vain and deceitful are humane hopes, whose foundations are Ambition and Violence! For <hi>Leopold</hi> succeeding in the place of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Hungary,</hi> and the Empire, immediately prosecuted the design in favour of <hi>Poland,</hi> and in the first place besieging <hi>Turone,</hi> one of the chief Cities of <hi>Prussia,</hi> taken by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> forced it to a Surrender. The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> also growing jealous of the encreasing greatness of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> nourished by antient grudges, and National Emulations, took up Armes in defence of <hi>Poland,</hi> and being at first, flush of money,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98602:87"/>
gave constant pay and large donatives to mercenary Souldiers, which encreased his Army, drawing great numbers from the Swedish Colours; so that being stoutly recruited, he entered into the Enemies Countries, possessed himself of the important Fort of <hi>Olme</hi> in <hi>Norway;</hi> overthrew the Swedish Army at <hi>Vorgast,</hi> and obtained a victory over their Flect in the Baltick Sea. The Poles also themselves, who at first revolted from their Prince, and favoured the Swedish proceedings, perceiving the Wind change, and become contrary to that Party, began to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the interest they prosessed, and by degrees to return to the due o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of their King. <hi>Zerneski</hi> also the General, and <hi>Lubomiski</hi> the Great Chancellour of <hi>Poland</hi> met the Swedish Forces near <hi>Cracovia,</hi> where giving them Battel, discomfited the whole Army, killed fourteen thousand upon the place, took all the Cannon and Baggage, and won that day a most signal Victory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ragotski</hi> perceiving the face of things thus changed, and being by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Ottoman Port abandoned by his Moldavian and Walachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Forces, began to turn his face towards <hi>Transilvania,</hi> where now he wished himself and Army lodged in safety.

Nor did these misfortunes end here; but the Tartars commanded by the Turks, in revenge and chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Ragotski's</hi> Enterprize without their consent, entered into his Principality with considerable Bodies of Horse, against whose sudden Invasion, an Army under the Conduct of his General <hi>Kemenius</hi> could not be so soon collected and disciplined, as to be able to resist that fury of Tartars, who at their pleasure, burned the Towns and Villages, and carried away multitudes of people of both Sexes, and all Ages for Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives into their own Country, amongst which some were of Quality and Condition. Amidst which troubles came Letters from the Ottoman Port, directed to the Nobles of <hi>Transilvania,</hi> declaring <hi>Ragotski</hi> a Rebel, and <note place="margin">The Turks threaten <hi>Ragot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ski.</hi>

                        <hi>Ragotski</hi> being well informed what was designing against him at the Ottoman Port; and knowing that his power was not able to oppose so much puissance, resolved to give way to necessity, and voluntarily depose himself, before he should be engaged thereunto by the Imperial <note place="margin">He deposes himself.</note> Decree; so that he calmly receded from his Principality, hoping that his humility and submission might procure his pardon at the Court. The No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of <hi>Transilvania</hi> being as well desirous to evidence their affection to their old Prince, as their obedience to the Grand Signior, did immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately

appoint a day for Election, but with Proviso, that a general Petition should be made in behalf of <hi>Ragotski,</hi> that he might be again resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto ancient Grace and Favour with the Port, who in the mean time swore to live peaceably in a quiet and private condition, without making disturbance, or innovation in the Government, and that when this Grace should accordingly be obtained, then that the new Prince should recede, and suffer things to return to their former and pristine Estate. For which purpose there was choice made of one <hi>Francis Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deius,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Redeius</hi> made Prince of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silvania.</hi>

                     <p>These extravagances so exasperated the minds of the Turks, that whereas before they began to entertain tender thoughts towards <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silvania,</hi> they now meditated its entire Ruine and Conquest; and so laying aside Arguments and Treaties, they made Levies of Horse and Foot both in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Asia. Ragotski</hi> foreseeing how unable he was to resist a Force so unequal as the puissance of the Ottoman Empire, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the succour of Foreign Force, resolved, like the Prodigal Son, to throw himself into the compassionate Arms of the Emperour, as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, earnestly supplicating, That whereas before, his disorderly and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient Life had rather merited punishment than favour; yet in this Cause, wherein the interest of <hi>Christendome</hi> was concerned, he would compassionate the common Good of the Christian Church, rather than chastise his particular misdemeanours. With this message <hi>Michel Misces,</hi> his Chancellour, being dispatched, was graciously received by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and readily assured of powerful aid and protection.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ragotski</hi> elevated with this courteous Treatment and promises had his whole mind enflamed with hopes and desire of revenge; so that assembling such Forces as he could, he entered boldly into the Field a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Pasha of <hi>Buda,</hi> who with a considerable Army, was ordered to march before, and enter the Confines of <hi>Transilvania,</hi> and there unite with the Pasha of <hi>Temiswar.</hi>

But little did this advantage benesit poor <hi>Transilvania,</hi> for the Great Vizier soon after following with the gross of his Army, consisting of little less than an 100. thousand men, provided accordingly with Artillery, and all other Military Ammunition; seconded by the Tartars, and assisted by the Moldavians and Valachians, and a Rout of other barbarous Nations; laid Siege to the strong Fortrefs of <hi>Janoua;</hi>

The Nobles of <hi>Transilvania</hi> sensible of these imminent and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching mischiefs, dispeeded three persons of considerable Quality a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, in an Embassy to the Vizier; viz. <hi>Francis Daniel, John Lues,</hi> and <hi>Acatius Berclay,</hi> who greatly laboured by their Oratory to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the Vizier, that they were in no wise consenting to the disobedience of their Prince, but did always readily submit to the Ottoman servitude; imploring his Clemency and Commiseration of their distressed and ruined State. The Vizier inclining his Ear to their Petition, stopped the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of his Arms, but increased their Tribute to such an excessive rate, that the burden of it became insupportable; and appointed <hi>Berclay,</hi> one <note place="margin">

                        </note> of the Embassadours to be Prince; taking thereby from the People, the free priviledge of Election; Commanding them to accept him without farther dispute, or repugnancy. It is uncertain whether <hi>Berclay</hi> designed the Principality to himself by any instance he made to the Turks, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Election proceeded meerly from the Vizier himself; yet this is certain, that returning home <hi>Berclay</hi> applyed himself to establish his own Dominion, and to disappoint the designs of his Predecessour, and his party.</p>
                     <p>The Turks being satisfyed with this submission, with the subjection of several places of importance, with deposing of <hi>Ragotzki,</hi> and establishment of a new Prince, began to disband a great part of their Forces; and the Great Vizier, with the remainder, returned towards <hi>Constantinople;</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the fire of this War to be totally extinguished.</p>
                     <p>In this condition of repose, matters continued for about the space of two Years; when <hi>Ragotzki</hi> impatient of his losses, and of the exchange of his publick State to a private condition, inveterate in his hate towards his Rival and Competitor, resolved to tempt fortune once more, and make his ultimate Assay, either to establish himself in his Principality, or at least to render himself equal with other mortal Princes in the Grave; and so relying with much confidence on the zealous affection of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and the promise of powerful Adherents, he once again justled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <note place="margin">

The Turks immediately touched with the sense hereof, Issued out Orders to <hi>Ciddi Ahmet,</hi> the new Pasha of <hi>Buda;</hi> Commanding him without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, to gather what Forces he could to interrupt the designs of <hi>Transil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania;</hi> and to put matters unto a stand, until a greater Army could fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond him, under the Command of <hi>Ali</hi> Pasha, appointed General for this Expedition. The Pasha of <hi>Buda</hi> readily obeyed, and assembling what

Forces he could in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and joining with the Pasha of <hi>Temiswar,</hi> passed the <hi>Danube,</hi> and with a very considerable Army entered <hi>Transil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania. Ragotzki</hi> undaunted at the near approach of his Enemy, boldly entered the Field with his Forces, and joined Battel with them in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> 1660. between the Cities of <hi>Clansemburg,</hi> and <hi>Giulia Alba.</hi> At first the Christians endeavoured to have intercepted the Enemies pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, by some Ambuscado, or stratagem of War; but the Turks still ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing, were at length met by the Van-Guard of the Christians; to assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of which several Bodies following one after the other, it became a general Engagement of both Armies: in which Battel, <hi>Ragotzki</hi> gave his usual proofs of valour; declaring by his actions, that he was resolved to die, or. to Triumph. But being at length wounded in four parts of his Body, and his Army over-powered with numbers, he was forced to yield the Fortune of the Day to the Turks; leaving 8. pieces of Cannon, and his Standard in their hands; and the greatest part of his Army being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther killed or taken; he himself with a few of his Attendants, recovered <hi>Varadin;</hi> where after 18. Days distemper of his Wounds, he expired his <note place="margin">The Death of <hi>Ragotzki.</hi>
                        </note> unquiet and troubled Soul. This was the end of that vain <hi>Icarus,</hi> who attempted to fly with feigned Wings and borrowed Feathers; this is the fate of ambitious Spirits, whom Pride elevates and exhales like a vapour, unto that height, until it dissolves them into Showers, or precipitates them into the abysse of all Confusion. This <hi>George Ragotzki</hi> was of a <note place="margin">His Character.</note> tall and well proportioned Stature, black Hair, and a frisled Beard; his Eyes quick and lively, of an active Body, and healthy Constitution; his Spirit was high and great, which betrayed him to extravagancies; his Comportment was generous and courteous towards all, which rendered him exceedingly beloved and esteemed by his Nobility; he was free in his Speech, and eloquent in his Expressions, prudent in his Counsels and Enterprizes; had not the quickness and vivacity of his Soul made him something rash and violent in his Attempts; he was of the Protestant Religion, leaving behind him a Widow, and a Son of hopeful and happy endowments.</p>
                     <p>After the Death of <hi>Ragotzki,</hi> it might well be expected that these storms of War should be dispersed, and that <hi>Transilvania</hi> should at length enjoy the Sun-shine, and calmer Weather of Peace and Repose. But <hi>Ali</hi> Pasha, General of the Turkish Camp, being by this time arrived the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines with his powerful Army, resolved not to return empty or in vain, without advantaging the Ottoman Interest, and making some satisfaction towards the expence and trouble of so great an Army. Wherefore taking pretence against <hi>Varadin,</hi> for receiving <hi>Ragotzki</hi> after his Defeat, abetting his party, and following his Interest, designed to summon that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Fortress to surrender, which is situated at the foot of those Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains which open a passage into <hi>Transilvania.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Varadin</hi> terrified at the approach of this formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">The people of <hi>Varadin</hi> crave aid of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</note> enemy, dispatched a Messenger to the Emperour, imploring with most effectual Arguments his Sacred Protection and powerful Assistance against the Common Enemy to <hi>Christendome,</hi> representing to his Cesare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Majesty, how that the Turks in their Capitulations with him, had agreed to build or erect no new Fort on those Frontiers: and whereas it was the same thing to force and usurp a Fortress already made, as to form a new one; the taking of <hi>Varadin</hi> was to be esteemed a real violation of the Articles of Peace. That his Majesty would be pleased to reflect on
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98602:89"/>
the fatal consequences which the loss of <hi>Varadin</hi> might prove to <hi>Hungary</hi> as well as <hi>Transilvania;</hi> being that Gate, which obstructed, cuts off all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse between them and <hi>Germany.</hi> These considerations with seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others, were exceeding prevalent in the Imperial Council; so that it was resolved, that General <hi>Souches</hi> should prepare his Army, and put all things in readiness to afford the assistance which was desired; supposing that with the German Regiments, and Hungarian Forces, might be formed an Army of about 25. thousand fighting men. But in regard in those instructions given to <hi>Souches,</hi> there was a Clause, that he should be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful not to engage his Forces in any attempt, where the event might be doubtful, he assembled the principal persons of that Country, and the Militia, to consult whether succour and relief might be given to <hi>Varadin,</hi> without hazarding the Army in a doubtful and a dangerous adventure: in consideration of which point, a true computation being made of all the Imperial Forces, they were found much inferiour to that calculate which was made of them at <hi>Vienna;</hi> For that since <hi>Tockai, Zatmar, Kalo,</hi> and other places belonging to the State of <hi>Ragotzki,</hi> had been Garisoned by German Souldiers, there remained not of them above 4000. effective Men; the Hungarian Forces which were supposed to have consisted of 2000. Men, could not form 600.; the Haiduchs which were computed to be 6000. Men, did not appear in the person of one; being all dispersed and retired to their own homes. The additional Forces from the Princes of the Empire were as uncertain, as the expectation of them long and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious; <note place="margin">The difficulty of making war with the Turk.</note> for though the Imperial Forces united are of puissance sufficient to bid Battel, and defiance to the numerous Troops of the Ottoman Power; yet in regard the union of that Body depends on the Assembly of Diets, Treaties, and long Debates, which are subject to time and delays, caused by different Factions, (which are impossible to be avoided amongst dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent States) whose Disunions, Competitions, Emulations, and Pretences, always in such meetings abound, and prejudice the common cause and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Empire; the raising of such a formidable Army, becomes a matter always of time and difficulty. Howsoever the Emperour whose Hereditary and Elective Possessions bordering on the Consines of the Enemy, is necessarily engaged to be the standing Bulwark of the rest, and a Bank against the inundation of barbarous Nations; whilst other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whose Dominions are more remote and secure, apprehend not the premures and storms that the Emperour sustains, and is enforced to expel with the loss and diminution of his own people, and impoverishment of his peculiar Treasure: To these considerations, which rendered these pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous intentions towards <hi>Varadin</hi> almost impossible; there wanted Money, which is the Sinews of War, and the Soul of all Enterprizes: And that which farther retarded those succours and prosecution of the design in hand, was the departure of his Cesarean Majesty from his Court at <hi>Vienna,</hi> on occasion of a Progress as far as <hi>Trieste,</hi> to take Homage of his Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Stiria, Carinthia,</hi> and <hi>Cragno;</hi> which was an action much against the Counsel and advice of the Arch-Duke <hi>Leopold</hi> his Uncle; who fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw how great disorders would ensue by the Emperours absence in this Conjuncture from his Imperial Court. Upon which considerations, Count <hi>Souches</hi> sent a true List of all his Forces, with an account of the strength of his Enemy; remonstrating that it was impossible to convey Forces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Varadin,</hi> without hazarding a Battel with <hi>Ali</hi> Pasha, which would prove an absolute breach of the Peace; which in this Conjuncture, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:98602:90"/>
want of preparation, was neither honourable, nor safe for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Ali</hi> Pasha proceeded and encamped with his Army before <hi>Varadin,</hi> breaking first ground the 4th of <hi>July,</hi> 1660. and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a Formal Siege, he soon begirt the Town, and continually labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">

But the better to describe the Siege and Assaults on this famous City, it will be necessary first to explain the Condition and Scituation of the place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Varadin</hi> therefore is seated in a Plain, on the Banks of the River <hi>Chrysé;</hi> To the East it is environed with such craggy, and rough Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, as render it almost on that side unaccessible; To the South the Town extended it self most; To the North it is washed with the River, over which some small, yet fruitful, Hills raise themselves; it is encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed with a Wall filled with Earth, after the fashion of Modern Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, and strengthened with five main Bulwarks, and a very deep Ditch filled with the River Water: it was well provided both of Victuals and Ammunition, and armed with Ordnance both great and small, as was sufficient to have repulsed a puissant Enemy, and have sustained a long and strait Siege. But the Garison within consisted only of eight hundred and fifty Souldiers, an inconsiderable number, both in respect of the Circuit of the Fortress, and of that gross Army which emcompas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it.</p>
                     <p>The Enemy being now, as it is said before, under the Counterscarp of the Wall, they perceived that the Ditch was so deep, and filled with Water, that though their great Guns had made open Breaches in the Walls, yet there was no possibility to storm them, or bring the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery to sealing Ladders, or handy blows. The besieged also made such continued Sallies, with success and slaughter of the Enemy, that after three and twenty days of vain labour to few the Ditch, <hi>Ali</hi> Pasha was at length almost resolved to have raised his Siege, and given over the <note place="margin">Two ill acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents to the Garison.</note> Enterprize; upon which whilst he considered and ruminated (as ill For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune would have it) a certain Maid, which formerly had been a servant to the Governour of the Garison, then a Captive in the Turkish Camp, having observed how on occasion the Citizens used to empty and drain the Ditch, revealed the secret to the Turks, hoping thereby not only to purchase her Liberty, but with that also a Sum of Money for price of her treachery; so that discovering where another Ditch was to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, the course of the Water was soon diverted, and the Walls of the Town laid dry and open to the Assailants. As this happened with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, so another accident within, equally dangerous, befel the Besieged; for one day an Officer of the Ammunition going into the Stores with a lighted Candle, by chance dropped a spark of fire from his Lanthorn into the Powder, which taking fire, blew up the Powder, Granadoes, Fire-works, and all other military Stores, with the neighbouring houses, and above a hundred men; which loss alone was sufficient to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the minds of frail men; yet they so valiantly bore up their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, that they seemed not in the least abated, but rather animated with the height of anger and despair. The Turks having now free Access to the Walls, undermined some small Forts, which they blew up, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made so great a Breach that with facility hoping to gain the Town, if they made use of the occasion, they poured in such multitudes of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98602:90"/>
as the Besieged were scarce able to withstand; and the Turkish Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery being also weary of their sufferings, and irksomness of their tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous leagure, resolved now or never to put an end to their labours; so that advancing with their open Breasts to the top of the Battlements, without fear either of Cannon, or Musket shot, they entered within the Walls, and planted the Turkish Banners on the Works; but being afterwards received by a resolute Company of the Defendants, they were again thrown from the Walls, and tumbled back into the Ditch with an incredible Slaughter. It is impossible here to describe the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the courage, the despair which was apparent in the faces of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged, enflamed by the love of their own Country, and hatred of the Turks; so that three or four sustained sometimes the Assault of a Troop, and a small number united opposed a whole Sangiack of the Enemy. The Women also forgetting the imbecillity of their Sex, renewing in themselves the Courage and Vigour of the Ancient Amazons, exposed themselves without fear upon the Walls, throwing sealding Water, Stones, burning Pitch, and whatsoever came next to hand, upon the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailants; whom they so valiantly repulsed from the rising of the Sun till twelve at Noon, that after much slaughter on both sides, the Turks growing faint, retreated, and took breath a while within their Trenches. And now the Souldiery considering the Obstinacy of the Christians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to mutinie, and resolving not to cast away their lives in vain, moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to raise the Siege, and be gone; which when the General op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, they threatned to sacrifice his Life to the Ghosts of their depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Brethren. But see, how many times the Devil ruines the fortune of the Christians! for whilst they were in this deliberation to depart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, a certain Thracian one of the Garison Souldiers advised the Turks that there were not above three hundred sound men remaining in the <note place="margin">A Thracian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

This Advice retarded the hasty departure of the Camp; instead of which they again mustered themselves before the Walls, and prepared to assault the Breach, resolving to put all to a second extremity. The Christians within perceiving the resolution of their Enemy, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sensible how much they were infeebled by the last Convulsion, and loss of blood, and as yet sore of their Wounds, immediately spread a white Flag of Treaty, which was as readily accepted by the Turks, and <note place="margin">

Howsoever, the Emperour's Council seriously considering that <hi>Serini's</hi> State could not be engaged with the Turk without involving his Interest; and that the Princes of the Empire, though when assaulted, would willingly contribute their Forces in the defensive part, yet would <note place="margin">—is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</note> be backward to be the Aggressors, and engage their States in an offensive and provoking War, did therefore not only deny to second, or abett his designs with military succours, but positively commanded him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and desist from his resolution against <hi>Canisia;</hi> with which Answer, the Zeal and Spirit of <hi>Serini</hi> was so enflamed, that throwing in passion his Cemiter on the Ground, he raised his wellformed Siege, and retired to his proper Residence at <hi>Chiacaturno.</hi>

But as yet no effectual Forces came from the Emperour, nay rather the German Councils seemed willing to perswade the Turks that there was no design, but to maintain the ancient, friendly and amicable Correspondence; to which end it is said confidently, that the Prince <hi>Gonzaga</hi> wrote to the Pasha of <hi>Buda,</hi> That those Garisons sent to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess certain places of <hi>Transilvania</hi> were only in appearance, and not to <note place="margin">Prince <hi>Gonza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga's</hi> Letter to the Pasha of <hi>Buda.</hi>

But notwithstanding, these verbal assurances prevailed not so much with the Turks on one side, as the German Garisons administred jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie on the other; So that the Vizier raged furiously against the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, for encouraging <hi>Kemenius,</hi> who had treacherously murdered his two innocent Brothers in his Rebellion against <hi>Barclay,</hi> the only, true and lawful Possessour.

In like manner this work was an occasion of disgust at <hi>Vienna;</hi> for though the Turks were the first who had broken the Peace, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven just cause to the Christians to provide all cautions imaginable for their safety; Yet I know not why, nor wherefore, there wanted not certain persons in the Court either emulous of <hi>Serini's</hi> Glory, or zealous of the Emperours Interest, who interpreted the activeness, and forward heat of this Count to be like fire to enflame the Fuel of Controversie between the two Empires; yet certainly we cannot but meritoriously <note place="margin">The iust com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of Count <hi>Serini.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ali</hi> the Turkish General perceiving the strength and resolution of the Christians, thought it prudence for a while to detract from Engagement, and temper the usual mettle of the Ottoman fury with cooler Counsels of advantage, which delays and opportunities of time would administer: for observing that the Transilvanians were divided into Factions, he hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured the dissenting party, by constituting <hi>Michael Apafi</hi> their Prince; <note place="margin">The Turks Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy.</note> a person in the flower and strength of his Age, of great parts and abilities; and one who violently affected the Principality, having but lately pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased his freedom from slavery. In this manner <hi>Apasi</hi> passing from his Prison and Chains, to the glory and trouble of a Throne; poor <hi>Transil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi> remained divided, and taking Armes against her self, went daily working and contriving her own ruine. This hath always been the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-piece of the Turkish Policy, and this disunion amongst Christians hath availed the Ottoman Interest more than their Swords, and confirmed their obstinacy in Religion with a Miracle, as if the division of Christian Princes (which in late Ages have frustrated the holy designs against this common Enemy) had been an effect of their Prayers, and a Concession of Divine Providence to their daily Petitions. So now the Transilvani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans being divided, great numbers of them revolted from <hi>Kemenius</hi> to <hi>Apasi,</hi> which not only weakened, but discouraged the Christian Army <note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>Howsoever <hi>Kemenius</hi> could not here rest satisfied, but revolving in his mind certain ways to recover his Principality, obtained from <hi>Montecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi</hi> some German Troops; with which, and with his own scattered For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which at length he had collected into a Body; he resolved to try his Fortune once more with the Turks, and joining Battel with them, not far from <hi>Presburg,</hi> he fought with a resolution becoming the desperateness of his design; either that day to Die, or to Triumph. The Fortune of that days conflict remained a long time doubtful; so equal they seemed on both sides to be in their Courage, in their Force, and in their Conduct, until at length the advantage of the Turks number prevailing, <hi>Kemenius</hi>

the report of whose approach arriving the Turkish Camp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his person, or Army, and the common rumour and fear augmenting much their number; the Turks were so terrifyed hereat, that in haste and disorder they forsook their Siege after three Months continuance; leaving great quantities of Victuals behind for want of Carriages, and Beasts of burden. <hi>Schenidau</hi> having gained this success and honour with so much <note place="margin">The Siege rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</note> facility, he reinforced the Garison, and returned with Triumph home; carrying with him great Booties of Cattle and other spoils of the Enemy.

                        <hi>Claudiopolis</hi> being thus relieved, the Turks stomached inwardly the disgrace, and yet thought it prudence for the present to dissemble; and therefore upon some addresses made for Peace from <hi>Transilvania,</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Propositions tendered by the German Resident; the Vizier counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited his inclinations thereunto so far, that he prohibited all farther Acts of Hostility upon the Frontiers.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding which, the rumour at this time running, of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of all Christendom against the Turk, with Men or Money, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by the endeavours of the Pope, and the contrivances of <hi>Venice</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased the former jealousy, and caused the Skirmishes on the Frontiers to be more hot and frequent: and the Vizier being froward and cholerick, <note place="margin">The Turks jealousy.</note> and by nature jealous; matters had immediately proceeded to an open rupture, had not the German Resident, by his Moderation and Prudence, represented affairs in the smoothest guise of Peace, and delayed the War rather than composed it; so that this whole Summer was spent in disputes, messages, and debates on both sides.</p>
                     <p>The Vizier designing this War in his Eye, and desirous to comply with the vagrant humour of his Master, who was weary of his Seraglio at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> resolved to transfer the Turkish Court to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> so that <note place="margin">The Turkish Court removes to <hi>Adrianople.</hi>
                        </note> toward the end of <hi>June</hi> they entered their Tents without the City. But before they could dispose their affairs for to depart, the Plague which is the Epidemical Disease of this Country, and the common distemper of the Summer Season began to break forth and diffuse it self through all parts of the City; that in a short time the Keyes of many Houses were brought to the Grand Signior for want of Pretenders and Heirs surviving to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess them: in greater Houses of Pasha's and others, where have been a hundred and fifty persons, scarce five have remained alive for burial of the others; what the fury of that mortality might be, was best conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">A great Plague at <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98602:93"/>
to withdraw that heavy judgment. At which time the Greek and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian Patriarchs are likewise desired to offer up their Devotions, and intercede with God for mitigation of the Pestilence; and the same day in a Field called <hi>Okmaidan,</hi> do all assemble, though divided apart, to pray against the common Calamity, it not seeming vain to them, that every one should call upon his God. Nor did the Plague rage only in the City, but the Ships and Turks Saykes were infected in parts remote on the Black Sea, and the <hi>Propontis,</hi> so that above a hundred Sail were reported to be lodged at several Ports for want of Seamen to navigate them home. The Camp also where the Grand Signior, and Vizier remained, was not exempted from this common Contagion, for the necessary intercourse between that and the City communicated the evil equal unto both, strowing the ways with dead Bodies, in that manner as represented a passage conducting to a Coemetery, or Charnel house, rather than to a Martial Camp or Court of a Great Emperour. This mortality hastned the Grand Signior with his Army and Attendances into a better Air, the Vizier was to follow a few days after, but before his departure he setled and constituted his Son <hi>Chimacam,</hi> or Governour of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> Things in this confusion and haste not being well provided for, the Grand Signiors reception at <hi>Adrianople</hi> caused him to prolong his Journey by taking a compass round by the Castles at the mouth of the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> and from thence went to <hi>Dimotochum,</hi> where having lingered out eight or ten days more, he made a solemn entrance into <hi>Adrianople,</hi> which will for some years following be discoursed in this History as the Seat of the Ottoman Empire.</p>
                     <p>It was now towards the Winter, when this Vizier <hi>Kuperlee,</hi> finding <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Kuperlee</hi> sends for his Son.</note> himself mature with Age, and ready to fall like Autumn Fruit, sent for his Son from <hi>Constantinople</hi> to bear a share with him in the Burden of the Empire. This he did with the consent of the Grand Signior, for he alledged, that being now feeble and decayed, he could not make his personal Addresses as formerly, nor attend at the Court to render his Majesty an account of his Affairs; and therefore had need of so trusty a Messenger as his Son, to carry his advices and directions, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to communicate what he should encharge to his Relation; all others being on some consideration or other suspected, and at least Enemies to him, or to the Grand Signior. The Sultan accepting the proposition and the Person, had often occasions of discourse and familiarity with the Son, called <hi>Ahmet,</hi> who deported himself with that faith and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the management of all his Affairs, that the old Vizier had no great difficulty to procure a Grant of succession for him in that Office: For though there were many obstacles therein, as the abhorrency of the Turkish Policy from all hereditary succession in places of trust; and the Youth of his Person not exceeding 32 years of Age, and some emulous, powerful, and ancient Competitors, who hated the Father; Yet the old Fox had so ingratiated himself with his Master, for (to speak truly) he had been the only instrument that had preserved him and his Empire <note place="margin">Procures the Succession for his Son.</note> from falling into as many Divisions as there are Pashalicks, or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that the Grand Signior gave credit to him as to an infallible Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, assuring him that before any other, who might either pretend merit, Age, or Precedency, his Son should be preferred to the Succession. The old man acknowledged the favour with all humility and thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, declaring, that he had now served his Majesty faithfully for the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98602:93"/>
space of five years, a longer proportion than commonly Viziers had managed that Office, in such tempestuous and distracted times, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for their own offences, or want of Providence, or good Conduct have made shipwrack of their own lives, and the Charge they piloted: But he had lived in the worst of times, when the spirits of men with discontent were enflamed round about him, and threatned the ruine of their Prince and Empire; and yet had reduced things to composure, and to the obedience of the Ottoman Yoke, that now he that was the Sultan might incline his head to rest with security, and enjoy his pastimes and pleasures, without being interrupted by those Conspiracies, which destroyed his Father, and endangered him in his years of Infancy. And because the continuance of his Security and Glory depended on the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of certain Maximes, which he had framed to himself, he was chalking out to his Son such undoubted Rules and Doctrines of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as would certainly tend to the glory and prosperity of the Empire, being abundantly satisfied that his Son was faithful, prudent, and active. But three things he particularly recommended to his Majesty.

                     <p>The Body of <hi>Kuperlee</hi> was transported to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where in his life time he had erected a very stately and magnificent Structure, as his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument over the Grave, or Vault, where he designed to be interred.

                     <p>The Father being thus interred, <hi>Ahmet</hi> his Son began to contrive his own establishment, and to settle his Greatness on the foundation of his Fathers Rules of Policy, from whom not to degenerate in cruelty of Nature, or leave his Legacies unpaid to those he had proscribed, he in <note place="margin">Pasha of <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natia</hi> cut off.</note> the first place sacrificed the Blood of the Pasha of <hi>Magnatia</hi> to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Ghost, with some other petty attendances; so that the World perceived that they had changed the Vizier, but not his tyranny, or at least the same spirit of the Father seemed to be renewed, and transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted again into the Person of the Son.

decoying, and cutting off the head of the Grand Rebel <hi>Asan</hi> Pasha, who dared the Sultan at the Gates of his Seraglio; but understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ill will of the house of <hi>Kuperlee</hi> against him, stood always on his Guard, lodging without the Walls of the City, and under the protection of his Armes and Souldiers, who were greatly affected to the generosity of his Person; so that, though many attempts were made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and that Officers, or Executioners came from the Court, openly tendring from the Sultan the Present of a Sword, and Vest of Sables, the usual Signals of the Ottoman Grace, but privately bringing a Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string, or a Halter; yet they were all entertained at a distance, and returned again with the same dissimulation they had used in their feigned Addresses. In like manner the <hi>Kayah-begh,</hi> an ancient, prudent, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Commander, beloved by the Souldiery, and secured by the Priviledge of his Office, (for a <hi>Kayah-begh</hi> cannot be cut off during his Command, without infringement of the honour and order of the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisaries) preserved still his Station, and Command in despight of the Viziers hate and endeavours. But what could not be done by mere ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Absolute Power, was effected under the appearance of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and favour of the Sultan, who by his Royal Commission, having made him Pasha of <hi>Damascus,</hi> he was at the same instant deprived of his <note place="margin">

Nor could his prayers or tears incline the Grand Signiors mind to reverse his Order, who, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Vizier, rather inforced it with the specious pretext of Favour and Grace for his former merits, and with commendation of his Abilities agreeable to the importance of so considerable a Government encreased the just suspicion of <hi>Solyman,</hi> (for so the <hi>Kayah-begh</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) not being ignorant of the Turkish Proverb, A <hi>Kayah-begh</hi> is like a Fish in the Water, which out of its Element immediately dies. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, <hi>ut finis omnium cum dominante, grates agit,</hi> he acknowledges the <note place="margin">Tac. Lib. 14.

The Vizier now hasted <hi>Solyman</hi> Pasha to depart with all expedition, not allowing him above four or five days time to make pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for so long a Journey, which otherwise he would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed as one, like the rest of Mankind, desirous to protract the thread of Life, imagining that in his journey, at some distance, where his Death might be most obscure, and least noted, the Edict of the Grand Signior might overtake him, and find a Grave for him in some solitary Desert, or unfrequented Mountain. Wherefore he made one day an Address to the Vizier, under pretence of taking his last furewel, and freely acquainted him with his apprehension and his fears, desiring that he would deal as frankly with him, in letting him know the utmost of his Fate, for that now he was in his hand, and was so good a Proficient in the Mahometan Religion, as to oppose nothing which was his Destiny, or inconsistent with the Decree of the Sultan. The Vizier reverencing the Years, and pitying the Condition of so worthy a Commander abased solely by his Power, bid him be of good cheer, assuring him of his Life, so long as he acted nothing contrary unto his, which he confirmed by Vows, and all imaginable Protestations, encouraging him to proceed forward to his Government with those cheerful Words, and Assurances,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98602:94"/>
that <hi>Solyman</hi> Pasha taking his farewel with more ease of mind, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Life, departed <hi>Adrianople</hi> in three days after his delignment to the new Office: But not many days Journey had he advanced into <hi>Asia,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">He is sent away.</note> before the G. Signiors and Viziers Commands over-took him, altering his design for <hi>Damaseus,</hi> and instead thereof ordered him a Pilgrimage unto <hi>Mecha,</hi> and exile into the remote and desert parts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> until he should be thought worthy to be re-called by that power which banished him. In like manner some few days after, the Mufti being on a <hi>Friday</hi> seated in his place, in the Mosch of Sultan <hi>Selim</hi> (a very noble and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Fabrick) and attending there the G. Signiors entrance, that he might begin his Prayers, was unexpectedly whispered in the Ear, that he should retire and give place to another Mufti; which immediately he obeyed, and in four hours departed <hi>Adrianople,</hi> being banished to <hi>Gallipoli,</hi> for his Friendship (as was supposed) to <hi>Solyman</hi> Pasha, and for not passing the <hi>Fetfa</hi> for his Death, according to the will and desire of the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior.</p>
                     <p>During the Transaction of these affairs in divers parts, the Wars against the Venetians were carried on faintly; the Gallies had no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, or employment, than to transport recruits of Men, and Ammunition to <hi>Canea,</hi> that so the Turks might rather keep the ground that they had gained in that Island, than add thereunto by new Conquests, until such time, as that being freed from other Wars, they might have leisure and opportunity to attend unto that alone. Accordingly the Captain Pasha set forth at the usual Season from <hi>Constantinople;</hi> and arrived at <hi>Scio</hi> with 23. Gallies, besides his own called the Bastard-Gally, or Admiral; the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of which, coming to the Captain General of the Venetians, he hastned thither with all his Fleet to besiege him in the Port: but this seeming af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter some days a tedious work, and what might lose too much time; he resolved to depart from thence, and so leaving a sufficient Guard before the Port, he set Sail with two Galleasses, thirteen light Gallies, and seven Auxiliaries for the Coast of <hi>Rhodes;</hi> where his Brigantines advised, that the remainder of the Turkish Fleet were Anchored, and were taking aboard two thousand Souldiers for reinforcing <hi>Canea;</hi> but before the Venetians could arrive, intelligence was given them by the way, that the Turks were loosed from <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and were Anchored under the Island of <hi>Patmos,</hi> wherefore altering their course, they steered for <hi>Nio,</hi> and there watering their Vessels, sailed near to <hi>Nixia,</hi> where the Van-guard disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered five and thirty Gallies of the Enemy, which had made prize of a Tartana laden with Provisions designed for the Venetian Fleet, and having taken out her lading had set her on fire. The Venetians having their Enemy in their Eye, gave them chase until the Evening, when the Night coming on put an end to the pursuit: but keeping their course towards <hi>Candia,</hi> they had sight again of them the next Morning, and coming nearer, the Turkish Admiral put forth his Flag of Defiance, as if he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to come to a Battel; but the Wind blowing hard, and the Sea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing, both Fleets were separated until the Morning; when the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians discovered certain of the Enemies Gallies to Leeward of <hi>Milo,</hi> where bearing down before the Wind upon them, five of them ran ashoar; one was sunk, and four were taken by the Venetian and Maltese Gallies, three of which sighting with great Courage and Valour, killed divers brave Cavaliers of one and the other Country. The men which ran the Gallies ashoar at <hi>Milo,</hi> did it with design to secure themselves in that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98602:95"/>
small Fort which the Turks possessed in that Island; but they were not able to withstand the valour of the Venetians, who having first recovered the Cannon of the Gallies which were ran ashoar, with their rigging, and what else was useful, they set the Hulls on Fire; and immediately enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Port, the Captain General Landed two hundred select men, and veterane Souldiers to besiege the Fortress, giving Orders to one <hi>Mano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacchi Macchiotti,</hi> who was well acquainted with the Turkish Language, to summon them to a Treaty, the which they readily accepted, andwere received to quarter at discretion of the General; the next Morning they were brought down to the Sea-Coast to the number of about nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, amongst which there was a Janizar-Aga, a Bey of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and three of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> besides Captains, and other persons of condition and quality. These Prisoners being divided into several Gallies and Ships, the Venetians departed, and cruising about the Coast of <hi>Candia,</hi> to hinder the importation of all succours, they encountered with <hi>Antonio Priuli,</hi> with a good Squadron of Vessels under his Command.</p>

                     <p>AT the beginning of this Year the People of <hi>Algier</hi> sent Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers and Presents to the G. Signiors Court, then at <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> complaining against the actions his Majesties Fleet, under the Command of the Earl of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> had done against their Town and Castles, pretending those Forts to be the G. Signiors, and the Affront offered to him, as willing to interest him in their Quarrels and Piracies. And that their Addresses might be more graciously received, they brought with them certain Presents, which though in former times were Yearly, were now only as their Affairs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and on this occasion were doubled: for besides their Presents to the Ministers and Officers of State; they brought to the G. Signior a Ship made in Silver, beset with Emrods, Rubies, and other Stones; fourteen young and hansome Boys, and a Neger Eunuch for the Seraglio. But the Earl of <hi>Winchelsea,</hi> his Majesties Embassadour there Resident, being then at Court, had so well prepossessed the Vizier with the ground and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for the War, that the complaints of <hi>Algier</hi> were judged in no wise

touching the Ottoman Interest, or the breach of their Peace, any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1662"/> of the good correspondence and friendship which then inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened between the King of <hi>England</hi> and the Grand Signior. But their presumption to search English Ships, and take out Strangers goods, was objected as an argument of their disobedience and Rebellion, contrary to the G. Signiors Capitulations, which also was aggravated by their ill Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the G. Signiors Pasha, whom they had beaten, imprisoned, and cast out of all power and authority; which severe reprehensions so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyed and discouraged them, that they not only desisted from their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions against the English, but began to fear, lest the power and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of the Embassadour at Court, should contrive some mischief to their own persons.</p>
                     <p>Soon after this the Vizier esteeming it necessary towards his better esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment to gratify the City of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and the Grandees of the <note place="margin">The G. Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or perswaded to return to <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
                        </note> Empire, by the G. Signiors return to his Imperial Seat, prevailed with him, (as a matter wholly necessary) to adorn and comfort that place by his presence; for now he began to declare a kind of abhorrency to it, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the memory of those Rebellions which were nourished in that place, to the destruction of his Father, and to the great hazard and narrow escape afterwards of himself; had taken that impression on his fancy, that the Chambers of the Seraglio appeared melancholy and dismal, and the Walks of his Gardens solitary, and the noise of the Rooks and Daws amongst his Trees, were like the croakings of Ravens or unlucky Birds. Howsoever the Vizier had so far entered into his affection and esteem, that his perswasions were stronger than his own absolute Dominion; and prevailed so with him against the force of his own fancy, that about the Equinoctial he began his Journy towards <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to the great joy and satisfaction of his people: But by the way lingring out his time in Hunting and other Pastimes of the Woods and Fields; it was the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> before he made his Entry, for never was Prince so great a <hi>Nimrod,</hi> so unwearied a Huntsman as this; never was he at quiet, but continually in the Fields on Horseback, rising sometimes at Midnight, to ride up the Mountains, that he might more early discover the Sun in the Morning; by which extravagant course of life, he wearied out his Court and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, who began to believe the amorous humour of his Father more supportable, than the wandring Vagaries, and restless spirit of the Son. But <note place="margin">The Grand Signiors extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagantHunting.</note> not only were his Huntings tedious to his Court, but troublesome and expensive to the whole Country, which were all summoned in whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he came, and sometimes thirty or forty thousand men appointed to beat the Woods for three or four days, carrying before them the compass of a whole days Journey about, inclosing all the Game and wild Beasts within that Circuit, which on the day of the Hunt, the G. Signior kills and destroys with Dogs, Guns, or any other way, with abundance of noise and confusion: which pastime, though lawful in it self, and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough in so great a Prince, yet the frequent use of it, was a burden and an oppression to his people, whilest in the Winter they passed many cold Nights in the Woods, and being unused to that hardship, many of them paid for their Emperours Pastime with their own lives.</p>
                     <p>The G.

Eunuch of the Women of the Seraglio, who by means of the Valede, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Queen Mother was ill-affected to him, being both inclined to prefer some Favourites of their own, for the diminution, and Eclipse of the Viziers Power, one whereof was the <hi>Tefterdar</hi> Pasha, or Lord Treasurer, placed in Office against the Viziers Approbation, which the Vizier understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, made short Work with him, depriving him of his Office, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in a few hours to quit <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Queen Mother, and <hi>Kuzlir Aga</hi> resenting this Affront to their Favourite, resolved to even scores in a piece of the like nature: Wherefore they obtained for the Viziers <hi>Kahya,</hi> or Steward, the Pasha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick of <hi>Darbiquier,</hi> a rich and honourable Government, not for any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection or hatred they had unto him, but only to deprive the Vizier of the Counsel and Assistance of so knowing and faithful a Servant; for he was a Person, who by his own Estate, and Friends had raised the house of <hi>Kuperlee,</hi> having in the time of his poverty and meanness lent him that Sum of Money, which gave him the first Rise to his Richesse and Authority; for recompence and interest of which, old <hi>Kuperlee</hi> made him his Steward, and shared to him his honours and prosperity; in which deporting himself towards all people with the same modesty, and evenness of temper which he used in his former Condition, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured no Enemies to his own person, and such as hated the interest he served, only wished him disobliged from it, so as to be able to dispense their malice on the Vizier, without concerning him in his Masters ruin. This consideration moved the angry Lady, and the envious Eunuch to vex their Adversary by the removal of his most faithful Creature and Servant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mahomet Kahya</hi> now Pasha of <hi>Darbiquier,</hi> after a reasonable and convenient time allowed him for his preparations, being very rich, set forward towards his Government, with a very noble and numerous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, having amongst the rest five hundred persons young, well mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and well armed; which notwithstanding were not so strong, but before they were advanced many days Journey into <hi>Asia,</hi> were encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <note place="margin">A notable Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery.</note> by a greater force of bold and desperate Robbers, who engaging with him killed two hundred of his people on the place, rifled his Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, and constrained the Pasha himself to fly to the next City. This strange and audacious Robbery produced many Commands and Orders for seizure and suppression of Thieves in the lesser <hi>Asia.</hi> And because the custom is, that something must be done in compliance with the Imperial Commands, many poor innocent men were taken in the Fields, and Mountains, and perhaps without any other Crime against them, than that they were not masters of a thousand Aspers to bribethe Officers, were for want thereof sent as Thieves to the Port, where without further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction or Tryal they were executed.</p>
                     <p>The Vizier being thus weakned by the removal of his faithfullest friend, his condition was given over as desperate by the generality of the World, and several appearances of troubles arising from the Eastern and Western Parts, gave occasion to the Queen Mother, and her Party, to disparage his Abilities in the esteem of the Sultan: Wherefore they exhorted him to imitate the Example of his Renowned Predecessors, who made use of their Viziers only to ease them from the troublesom part of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but did not entirely throw off the knowledge and privity of the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98602:97"/>
important Transactions and State Affairs in the whole Empire. This Lesson awakened the Grand Signior a little, so that he declined some days his sports abroad, and exercise on horse-back, and instead thereof pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed much of his time in a Chiosk, or Garden-house on the Wall of the Seraglio, just opposite to the Viziers Gate, where his chief business and concernment was to observe such as went in, or came out; and when at any time he espied those enter, remarkable for their Attendance, or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of habit, he would send to know of the Vizier, what occasion drew those people thither, what their business was, and the like, by which he gave himself that satisfaction as to believe that he had now found the true way of inspecting his Affairs, and taking care of his Empire. The Vizier was not unsensible from whence this humour of the Grand Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or <note place="margin">The Queen Mothers enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Vizi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> proceeded, nor ignorant what ill consequences such petty matters might produce; wherefore he resolved, if possible, to reconcile the favour and good will of the Valede, or Queen Mother, but all his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses (it seems) were returned fruitless; so difficult was it to appease the malice of a feminine Spirit; and this malice She so ill concealed, that it was often said by Turks of Quality and Judgment, That the Great Viziers Mother, who entertained a Familiarity with Spirits, as they believed, had by her Enchantments procured the Office of Vizier for her Husband and Son successively, and prevailed still to preserve her Son in the favour of his Master, yet could not by force of Magick get power or dominion over the Valede; No Spells, it seems, had virtue enough to qualifie the spirit of that angry <hi>Juno.</hi> Some hereupon judged, that the Vizier might have thoughts to make Resignation of his Office, and to content himself with some Pashalick of a higher, and more eminent degree; but apprehensions and jealousies of their dangers, and his own natural Ambition, soon stitled those considerations, resolving to continue his Charge in opposition to all the difficulties, and dangers he might encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And perhaps he gave himself the same counsel which the Vitellian Souldiers did to their General. <hi>Nihil atrocius eventurum, quam in quod <note place="margin">Tacit. Lib. Hist. 3.</note> sponte ruant, moriendum vict is, moriendum deditis; id solum referre, novissimum spiritum, per ludibrium &amp; contumelias effundant, an per Virtutem.</hi> Men who must die, whether they yield or are conquered by force, have the same Fate; all the difference is, that the one dies with valour and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the other with reproach and cowardice. But to execute this stout counsel with prudence and wisdom, he conceived it necessary, if possible, to reconcile the sincere friendship of <hi>Samozade,</hi> the Reis Effendi, or Chief Secretary of State, a person the best practised of any, in the Affairs and Negotiations of the Ottoman Empire, and one much in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem and favour of the Queen Mother, and in order thereunto treats him with more familiarity and condescension than was ordinary, or by many judged agreeable to the Greatness of a Grand Vizier; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways when he came into his Presence, he arose up, calling him secretly Father, Tutor, and Companion, in supporting the Burden of the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Government, and such other Compellations, as the Grand Signior vouchsafed only to the Vizier: for though this Reis Effendi was of the greatest abilities, and this present Vizier the most youthful and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced of Latter Times, yet it may be accounted one special mark and token of his prudence, in knowing how to elect so useful a friend, and of his policy in procuring his sincere faithfulness towards him, and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98602:97"/>
making him really his own. To which end he conversed much with him, communicated all his thoughts, freely demanded his advice, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his private entertainments, and in fine, was wanting in no points of affable courtesie and compliance, whereby he might create him his own, contenting for some time himself with the name of Vizier, though the other as one, who best knew how to mannage it, enjoyed the power.</p>
                     <p>The Chief Officers of the Seraglio, instigated by the Queen Mother <note place="margin">That is, of the <hi>Hizoda,</hi> or Royal Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</note> to diminish something the power of the Vizier, put often the Grand Signior in mind, as a matter agreeable to his dignity, to have a regard to his Government, which caused him more frequently than his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour served, to betake himself to his Chiosk over against the Viziers Gate to make his usual observations; and perceiving some Christians to enter the Court with red Calpacks, or Caps, and yellow Shooes (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to Christians by orders of inferiour Magistrates but never until now thought worthy the Imperial Observance) immediately called for the Subashee or Constable of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and from the Window commanded him with great fury to enter the Viziers Court, and such Christians as he should find there with yellow Shooes and red Caps he should first beat, and then send uncovered, and bare-footed home. The Subashee armed with a power in this matter as high as the Viziers, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered his house without Complement or Licence, and encountring first the Kapikahya's or Agents of <hi>Moldavia</hi> and <hi>Valachia</hi> negotiating the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of their Prince and Country, he rudely layed them down, and without <note place="margin">The Grand Signiors <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

This inhumane treatment of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in a manner sacred, was seconded by publick Proclamations, strictly prohibiting all Christians from wearing red Caps, yellow Shooes, scarlet Vests, and the like; and Janisaries from the use of Hanjars or Daggers, and silk Turbants, upon pain of death: which Order was so strictly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, that the corners of every Street were furnished with Officers to observe, and punish such who were found to offend. The Grand Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or himself judged also the Execution of this order of that importance as to deserve his own proper care and inspection, wherefore walking abroad, as his manner was, in disguise, with his Executioner at hand, encountred in the Streets an unfortunate Bridegroom, an Armenian, who that day, on priviledge of his Espousals, had adventured to dress himself with yellow leathern Socks: nothing was, or could have time to be pleaded in his behalf, before the fatal Blow was struck, which sent him to his Grave instead of his Nuptial Bed. This fury continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed some few days with much rigour, and strict observation, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards growing cold again, all care was neglected, happening here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as commonly it doth in all things, which have no other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation than humour and fancy.</p>
                     <p>But this inspection into petty matters did not so much disturb the thoughts of the Vizier, as did the power and greatness of <hi>Mortaza</hi> the Pasha of <hi>Babylon,</hi> by the Turks called <hi>Bagdat,</hi> a person of an undaunted Courage and great Conduct, whom he had hitherto suffered to live, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the true knowledge of his interest, and the Rules his Father had left him: wherefore he resolved to renew his design and attempts against
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98602:98"/>
his Life; one I remember was in <hi>December</hi> of the past Year, when in our Journey to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> we met a Messenger on the way, who amongst other Discourses informed us, that he was then going to <hi>Babylon</hi> for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of <hi>Mortaza,</hi> and as a testimony of the G. Signiors favour and good will towards him, he carried him a Sword, and a Vest of Sables: we immediately, and that truly guessed, for what Present the Sword was sent; for in some Months after the Chaous-bashee, or chief of the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suivants, returned without delivery of his Present. For the wise <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taza</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The Vizier seeks to cut off Mortaza the Pasha of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</note> was so justly jealous, that he would not so much as admit him to his presence, but returned him again with his Sword and Sables, for those who were more easy and credulous, and who believe to die by Command of the Sultan to be Martyrdom, and the only Crown of all their merits and deserts: and knowing that he could not long subsist in opposition to so great an Enemy; he contracted an Alliance, by Marriage with a Daughter of one of the <hi>Gordean,</hi> or <hi>Curdean</hi> Princes, and in Dowry, had one of the strongest Forts of those Mountains delivered into his hands.</p>
                     <p>The Vizier finding himself thus foiled in his occult Artifices, began publickly to profess his enmity; and therefore in the first place perswaded the G. Signior, that the long continuance of <hi>Mortaza</hi> in that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, beyond the usual term, so opulent and powerful, and of a spirit so ambitious and rebellious, could not but prove dangerous to himself, and in time give him confidence of competition for the whole Empire: which hazard to prevent with most prudence and advantage, (there being a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent occasion of good Souldiers for relief of <hi>Candia</hi>) <hi>Mortaza</hi> and his Complices could not be better bestowed than upon that employment. The G. Signior readily consented to this Counsel, being naturally very apprehensive of danger, and in his place constituted the Aga, or General of the Janizaries, posting him away with all speed possible to hisGovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; who did not run so fast in his Journey, but that the advices of the coming of a new Pasha, arrived timely the Ears of <hi>Mortaza,</hi> who judging it an unequal match to contend with the whole Empire, gave way to his Successour, but withal, kept himself so on his Guard, that his adversary could not reach his Head, and send it as the first-fruits and Tribute of his new Office. For yielding up his Command as in an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable manner of retreat, he gave out, that with his Army (reported to consist of forty thousand men) he was on his March to <hi>Candia,</hi> but soon after his design was discovered to be otherwise; for believing his own Force unable to contend with his Masters, he retired with his richess, and some of those most faithful to him unto his Fort on the Mountains, and to the protection and Country of the King of the <hi>Curdi,</hi> whose Daughter he had Married, and remained in expectation of time and opportunity, to take his revenge on the Vizier, hoping that with time this storm would blow over, and that the beams of his Princes favour would again shine upon him. These <hi>Curdi</hi> are called by some Writers <hi>Cordiaei,</hi> from <note place="margin">Curdi.</note> whence the Province had the name of <hi>Gordiene,</hi> bordering on <hi>Assyria,</hi> the Kingdom once of <hi>Zabienus,</hi> who siding with <hi>Lucullus</hi> against <hi>Tigranes</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> was by <hi>Tigranes</hi> murdered with his Wife and Children. These people inhabit the Mountain <hi>Amanus,</hi> dividing <hi>Syria</hi> from <hi>Cilicia,</hi> which by reason of the difficult access thereunto, was never yet subjected to the Ottoman Yoke; they are said in former times to have worshipped a black Dog, and dare not speak ill of the Devil, not for love, but fear.

But some report that have lately been amongst them, that they have left off that Hellish superstition, and embrace a certain sort of Religion mixed with Christianity and Turcism; but yet without Baptism or Circumcision. In brief, they are a bad sort of gross people at the best, contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with little Religion, addicted to bloud and Robberies. These <hi>Curdi</hi> or Gordeenes, being a people retired, keep within their Mountains, are shy in their Conversation and Discourse, and afford us little subject, or opportunity of knowing with any satisfaction, their Religion or Manners: but from such of our Country-men, as have lately entertained So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety with them, we have this account. They are seated on those Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains as we have said before, which of old were called <hi>Cordiaei,</hi> or <hi>Gordiai,</hi> beginning near <hi>Aleppo,</hi> but running out as far as <hi>Persta;</hi> they make shew of the Turkish Religion for fear, but have in reality another of their own, which permits them to eat Swines flesh and drink Wine, as the Druses and Kalbeenes; Bacon being esteemed by them a particular Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial, or Restorative for the sick. The chief Country and City of those near <hi>Aleppo</hi> is called <hi>Jeumee,</hi> where they have a Convent of twelve Priests with a Superiour over them, and another of the like sort near <hi>Mosul,</hi> or <hi>Nineveth.</hi> The two Chiefs of these Monasteries meet at fixed times to consult for the good of the Common-weal. Their Devotions are private in a Cave; they tell us of but one Book, which contains both their Law and their Rituals; being asked what they thought of our Saviour, they answered, he was their breath, and their Soul; at the name of <hi>Mahomet</hi> they spit, and with <hi>Nicodemus</hi> his circumspection and assurance of secrecy, they declared themselves and Christians the same, which they would make appear so soon as they were delivered from their fear of bondage to the Turk. They say that they worship God, and will not curse the Devil, to which no force or power can compel them; partly, perhaps beeause they have heard of our Saviours Precept, <hi>Bless, and Curse not,</hi> but rather, because they hold, that the Devil and his Followers, shall one day be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to their former seats of blessedness and dignity. When their Priests are together, and Wine brought in amongst them, the Superiour makes a sign for silence, and afterwards a short Admonition, that Wine is the bloud of God. I have heard that a Capuchin Fryer was once invited amongst them, with promise to give him a sight of their Book of Ritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and being come to <hi>Jeumee,</hi> was detained a Day or two in a Cave, on pretence that the other Superiour of <hi>Mosul</hi> was then amongst them, who being a severe person, if he knew of his being there, would certainly put him to Death, as one who came to alter their Religion; upon which suspicion the Capuchin forgetting his Curiosity, fled for safety, with all speed possible. Their Priests are said to be grave, wearing black through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; their Garments plaited or quilted; the Vestures of the Commonalty are agreeable to Mountaniers, whose natures are rough and boisterous, addicted to bloud and Robbery, the common vice of those people. I have heard, that the Son of a Gourdeene Widow being killed by some of that Country, she assembled her nearest Kindred, and required them to bring her the Windpipe of the Murderer, which when they had done, she together with her Friends, eat it in revenge. In fine, their Religion may have some small Reliques of Christianity, but mixt with the dregs of other Religions. Tis possible they may be of the Manichee Race. Their opinion of the Devils Restoration, was once held in part by <hi>Origen:</hi> that of Wine (that it is the bloud of God) was the Heathenish conceit of the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98602:99"/>
Egyptian Priests. Their whole Nation if well united may compose an Army of thirty or forty thousand men.</p>
                     <p>But to return to our purpose. The news of the flight of <hi>Mortaza</hi> to this ignoble Prince troubled the G. Signior, who still retained some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of kindness to his person, remembring his generosity, valour, and former deserts, the memory of which was encreased also by the Friends of <hi>Mortaza,</hi> who wanted not in the Court to represent them with some compassion, arguing that his flight was not of contumacy, or contempt to his Masters protection, but an effect of natural preservation; which worked so far on the G. Signior, that he immediately sent for the Vizier to enquire of him the state and condition of <hi>Mortaza.</hi> The Vizier to defend himself, and make good what before he had counselled his Master, aggravated his Adversaries crimes, and his disobedience and flight to an inconsiderable King; with which, and some other light excuses and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions, that the removal of such a person was agreeable to the present state of affairs, and conducing to his own security, easily pacified the mind and affections of the G. Signior; but no sooner was he returned to his House, but advice was given him, that the Emaum of <hi>Mortaza,</hi> or his Priest or Chaplain was then at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> whom the Vizier imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately sent for, and without any Plea or Endictment, struck off his Head, and threw his Body into the Sea, on pretence that he was sent thither, as a Spy for his Master, and to give Intelligence, and a beginning to Rebellion: These were his colours and allegations for his deserved Death; for Governours though never so wicked and so absolute, and that have no need to render any other cause to the World of their actions, than their own will, yet esteem it necessary to act under the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious guise of justice, and in the good opinion of the multitude. The Aga of <hi>Babylon</hi> encountred the same Fortune; for <hi>Mortaza</hi> giving place, he thought it sit for himself to do the like; resolving for <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but being intercepted in his Journey by the new Pasha, his Head was struck off, and his Journey shortned.</p>
                     <p>But that which again renewed the trouble and fears of the Vizier, was a report that the late <hi>Kahya-begh</hi> degraded at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> was secretly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the City, and lived concealed, giving such Orders to the Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries as tended to Mutiny and Insurrection, and that the pretences and reports of his being gone to <hi>Damascus,</hi> and thence in his holy Pilgrimage to <hi>Mecha,</hi> were but all false stories to conceal his Residence at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople.</hi> This set the Vizier all on fire, and made him tremble with the thoughts of it; wherefore search was made for him day and night, but not found; for in reality he was gone on his designed Journey, only it was the misfortune of his Kahya, or Steward, as before it was of <hi>Mortaza's</hi> Emaum, to fall into the Viziers hands, who being beaten to confess where his Master was, died afterwards of the blows.</p>
                     <p>But notwithstanding that <hi>Mortaza</hi> was fled, yet the Vizier laid not aside his fears and thoughts concerning him, not knowing how soon he might be recalled home, and seated in his place; of which various Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are extant in Turkish History; And therefore he sent orders to <hi>Mahomet</hi> Pasha, his late Kahya, now Pasha of <hi>Darbiquier,</hi> as General (with the knowledge and consent of the Grand Signior) and to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaws of <hi>Aleppo, Erzirum</hi> and others near adjacent, to prepare and assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble what Force was necessary to constrain the King of the <hi>Curdi,</hi> to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render <hi>Mortaza</hi> into their hands: But whilst these matters were in agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98602:99"/>
some unexpected troubles in <hi>Georgia</hi> diverted their Armes, and held them for some time in suspense, not knowing what the issue might be. The Original and Ground thereof was this: After <hi>Sultan Solyman</hi> had taken <hi>Erzirum,</hi> it was agreed in the Capitulations between the <note place="margin">The Provinces of <hi>Georgia</hi> in disturbance.</note> Turks and Persians, that of the seven Provinces of <hi>Georgia</hi> (anciently cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Iberia,</hi> but now as supposed to have received the Denomination from St. <hi>George,</hi> the Cappadocian Martyr, there had in great esteem and reverence) three should be tributaries to the Turk, and three to the Persian, all governed by <hi>Achic-bash</hi> as head and supreme Prince, to whom the seventh should also be subjected, without acknowledgment to either; In payment of which tribute, they continued most willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, lest for default thereof, the importation of Salt, of which their Provinces afford none, should be hindred either from the Turkish, or Persian Dominion. And now it happened that <hi>Achic-bash</hi> dying, his Wife married again, who to gratifie her new Lover, was contented to have the eyes of her Son put out, who was the lawful Heir to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. This Fact was so hainously received by the Princes of the three Provinces under the Persian, that with common consent, they ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted one to succeed <hi>Achic-bash,</hi> and extorted the power out of the hands of the Amorous Traitour. The Princes of the three Provinces under the Turk alarm'd hereat, made insurrection, resolving rather than any Foreigner, to set up one of the Kindred of <hi>Achic-bash,</hi> which the Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Provinces better understanding, approved likewise, and for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and maintenance of their choice assembled an Army of threescore thousand men. The Pashaws tending towards <hi>Curdi;</hi> were surprized in their March with the news of these disturbances in <hi>Georgia,</hi> and not rightly apprehending the causes of these sudden commotions, gave an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest to the progress of their Armes, inclining towards the Parts of <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> to be in a readiness to suppress all designs against the Ottoman Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, so that the thoughts of War against the <hi>Curdi</hi> was for some time laid aside. The news of these troubles did also alarm the Port, with which also came a report, That six hundred Tents of the <hi>Kuzilbashees</hi> (which are the best sort of Persian Horsemen) were pitched nigh the Consines of the Grand Signiors Territories; so that Orders were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched to the aforesaid Pashaws to watch the motion and issue of those Affairs, but those storms blowing over by the establishment of <hi>Achic-bash,</hi> the Turkish Forces proceeded on their first design against <hi>Mortaza,</hi> marching to the pass of the Country of the <hi>Curdi,</hi> which is very steep, asperous and rough. The whole Kingdom being, as it were, one Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of dangerous and difficult access, hath hitherto preserved the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants from the Ottoman Subjection. The entrance thereunto being strong by Nature, is also fortified with several Castles, the chief of which, possessed by <hi>Mortaza,</hi> is called <hi>Zizri,</hi> and the people therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts <hi>Zezidi.</hi> The Turkish Army being arrived at this pass, <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the Pasha of <hi>Darbiquier,</hi> appointed General, as we have said before, ordered five hundred of his select men to enter within the pass, which the <hi>Curdi</hi> perceiving, with little opposition, put to slight, being so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the General; The unadvised <hi>Curdi</hi> cagerly pursuing the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, left the pass naked, and undefended, supposing their whole victory <note place="margin">The Turks <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98602:100"/>
surrender themselves, or else <hi>Mortaza</hi> and his Complices into their hands.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Curdi</hi> perceiving themselves thus hardly beset, and in a manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded, their Garison which possessed the pass without the Confines, the enemey gotten possession of the Gate which opened to their Countrey, their Castles besieged, and in danger to be gained, and an inlet made to an Inundation by their Enemies, caused them to request a three days truce for Consultation, which being granted, they began to consider, whether it were better to hazard the welfare of their Country in a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous War, of which the Turks having already compassed the passage, had made half the Conquest; or to surrender up <hi>Mortaza</hi> to his own King, one in whom they had no part, no interest, nor relation. The latter counsel was most generally pleasing, wherefore they seized <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taza,</hi> promising at first to conduct him through the Mountains to the Persians, but afterwards being on horse-back, and about a mile distant from the Camp, they bound his hands behind him, and with his Steward, <note place="margin">The Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> in the Turks hands, and his death.</note> the Master of his Horse, and a Page, delivered him into the hands of the Turks, who immediately struck off their heads, and sent them to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> where for three or four days they lay before the Door of the Divan, with Inscriptions on them whose they were, and afterwards were thrown into the Sea. And thus ended this famous <hi>Mortaza,</hi> who had in like cases, by order of this Viziers Father, been an active Executioner of other Pashaws, and now included in the same Fate, by means of the Son, being proscribed (as we have said before) by Testament, and the most likely of any Pasha in the Empire to stand in Competition for the Office of Vizier.</p>
                     <p>The Vizier upon this success began to shew a more cheerful Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance than formerly, suspecting less of danger upon removal of so sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious an Enemy. And truly it was now hard to say where in the whole Empire was a generous, bold, or ambitious spirit remaining, who had Reputation and Authority enough to attempt a priority, such ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock was made by this Viziers Father of all hopeful and daring dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and such an Addition made to the slaughter by this man in present Office, that whether mens spirits were vanquished, and cowed with former Examples, or that the Age really afforded not such Heroes, it is hard to say: None now appearing other than obsequious to this Vizier, and to fear, and court him.</p>
                     <p>The Vizier having thus successfully contrived his Establishment, and security at home, had time to confirm it by his Wars abroad, well judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Foreign Wars allay Civil Dissentions, and the prosperity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of doth both produce reputation and terrour of his person amongst his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, as well as reconcile affections, and increase Authority amongst his Subjects at home. Wherefore he mediated on a War against the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and was glad to embrace the occasion from the late Disturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces made in <hi>Transilvania</hi> by <hi>Kemenius,</hi> as we have related in the former Year. But yet like a crafty Politician, who looketh one way, and steers another, so the Vizier, that he might the better lull the Germans into a sleep, and apprehensions of security, he dissembled his inclinations to Peace, and to hearken to such propositions as were tendered him by the German Resident, namely, that the Fort of <hi>Serini</hi> should be demolished being built against the intention, and without the knowledge or consent of his Imperial Master, that the Garisons of <hi>

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98602:100"/>
other places should beremoved, with other overtures, and the fairest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions imaginable, which might give the Turks satisfaction, and by some means or other reconcile the differences, if possible. To which <note place="margin">The resolution of War uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</note> counsel the Emperour was the rather inclinable, in regard that a Treaty at that time was on foot between the French King, and the Duke of <hi>Lordin</hi> for <hi>Alsatia,</hi> and that the result might prove prejudicial to the Empire, should he at the same time be engaged in a War against the Turk, whilst as dangerous a friend as the other was an enemy, crept easily into a suspected Neighbourhood. But the other Christian Princes, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Allies, engaged in the Venetian Quarrel, perceiving the Emperour to detract from his resolutions of War, upon this suspicion endeavoured to clear him from all jealousie in reference to the French designs, and for better evidence thereof, had their own engagements se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by protestations from that King, not only not to molest the Empire during this War, but to afsord him considerableaid and assistance both in Men, and Money. These Negotiations and incitements to a War, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the Emperour, and the German Princes in that manner, that whilst the Turks expected the return of the Corrier from <hi>Vienna,</hi> as it were with an Olive Branch of Peace, and Confirmation of all Articles, which before were esteemed to be concluded, and agreed; the Scene was wholly changed, and the Letters contained new demands and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, and in fine, made all doubtful and unsatisfactory. The Turks penetrating rightly into this Affair, pressed hard to have a speedy Peace, or War, wherefore the Reis Essendi, or Secretary of State, did at a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Conference with the German Minister in the name of the Grand Signior, and in few words declare, that three months were allotted to demolish the Fort built by the Count <hi>Serini,</hi> and for coming of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Ambassadour to consirm the Articles: Notwithstanding which, the G. Signior unmindful of the time, and of the Conditions he had given, and prefixed for peace, ordered the Vizier immediately to prepare for the War, declaring that he would in Person accompany him in part of his March, and remove his Court to <hi>Adrianople;</hi> For this being a Country Champion, and plain, full of Game of all sorts, so drew the heart and delight of the Grand Signior, that his Seraglio at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> seemed as a Cage, or Prison in respect of those desired Plains of <hi>Thrace:</hi> His Women were no pastime or recreation to him, in whose Apartments he spent little time: For this excessive humour in Hunting made him daily to press the Vizier to depart for <hi>Adrianople,</hi> not that he had so real a desire to the War as he had to his Game; which gave occasion to that ordinary Saying amongst the Turks, <hi>That the Grand Signior had left some Hares behind him at</hi> Adrianople, <hi>and would return to seek them.</hi> At length the Vizier not longer able to resist his importunity without his displeasure, summoned a Council of all the Viziers of the Bench, where also the Janisar Aga was present, to consult concerning the time of their departure, at which they unanimously concluded, that for divers reasons, it was most necessary to deferr this expedition until the next Spring. First, Because that three months time were already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <note place="margin">The Reasons why the Turks deferred the War with the German.</note> to the Emperour for sending his Extraordinary Ambassadour. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Because in so short a time provisions could not be sent into those Parts for relief of the Camp. Thirdly, Because the Souldiers which were abroad could not have timely notice to repair to their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. Fourthly, Because many Souldiers had begun to rebuild their
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98602:101"/>
houses destroyed by the late Fires, which by the Spring they might see finished. And lastly, That the Summer being now almost spent, was not so fit for action, as the Spring, which gives new life and bloud to men, as well as sap and moisture unto Vegetables. These reasons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing represented with all humility to the Crand Signior, he seemed to rest satisfied, and his heat of visiting <hi>Adrianople</hi> for the present allayed. And in the mean time, that the design against <hi>Germany</hi> might be the more covertly carried, it was given out that the preparations were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended against the Venetian Territories in <hi>Dalmatia, (viz.) Zara, Sebeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> and <hi>Cataro,</hi> and Proclamation was made that all Souldiers should prepare themselves for the Wars against the next Spring. In which Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim no accident intervening which might bring matters to an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation and better understanding, the daily Skirmishes on the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers made the Controversie every day more difficult to be reconciled, and the breach the wider. The Count <hi>Serini</hi> also proceeded in sinishing the Fortification he had lately raised near <hi>Canisia;</hi> And the other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of the Cesarean Army seeing the great progress of the Turks in <hi>Transilvania</hi> secured <hi>Claudiopolis, Somoswar, Sechilhid, Clewar, aliàs Coloswar,</hi> and <hi>Betlem,</hi> with some other Towns and Fortresses.

                        </note> Turks on the other side, under the Command of <hi>Ali</hi> Pasha, penetrate into the very Center of <hi>Transilvania,</hi> and conceiving a jealousie of War from the passages before mentioned, lost no time to take their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, so that the Pasha of <hi>Varadin</hi> not contenting himself with that Country, and limits formerly prescribed for maintenance of his Fortress, adjoined to his Jurisdiction what Villages and Towns he thought fit, whilst the poor Prince, <hi>Michael Apafi,</hi> though made by the Turks, durst not lift a hand, or interpose the least Obstacle, or Impediment to his quiet progress, or peaceable possession, which so harrassed the people of the Country, and wrought that misery and destruction therein, that the Prince, deprived of his power in Government, and disabled by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression to pay his Annual Tribute, had no hopes of redress, but from the assistance of Divine Providence, governing the hearts of Christians and Turks to compassionate the misery of his Country. Wherefore he craved the assistance of the Emperour, and of the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting other Christian Princes more remote of the sad estate of the Christian Cause; He sent also his Ambassadours to the Port with most submissive Letters to the Vizier, complaining against the Pasha of <hi>Vara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din,</hi> and craving his Commands for retirement of his Army, within their due and ancient bounds. Letters were also directed to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Representatives of Christian Princes residing at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> one of which was directed to the Earl of <hi>Winchelsea,</hi> his Majesties Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, which being that which may conduce to the more full understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the present deplorable Condition of <hi>Transilvania,</hi> I thought fit to be here mentioned.

But to come nearer to our business. The Most Potent Emperour, by his own Ambassadours, and ours now lately returned, hath promised us his most Gracious Protection; yet notwithstanding, the Pasha of <hi>Varadin</hi> not content with the Towns and Villages appropriated unto his Castle, hath entered into the very middle of <hi>Transilvania,</hi> and hath compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, for fear of death, those Provinces entirely to yield themselves, which never before were belonging to his Fortresses, which being taken away, it is impossible for the Principality of <hi>Transilvania</hi> longer to subsist, and pay its annual Tribute; Wherefore we are constrained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to beseech the most Potent Emperour, and the Supreme Vizier, as also we confidently desire your Excellencie, in that manner which your Excellencie judges most convenient, to be assistant to our Agent, and with your Authority to countenance our Cause, in which your Excellencie will not only perform a matter beneficial to <hi>Transilvania,</hi> but to all <hi>Christendom,</hi> and oblige us for ever with the Bonds of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; and praying for all happiness of Life and Prosperity to your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, we remain your undoubted Friend.</p>

This Letter was received by his Majesties Ambassadour with that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity as was agreeable to his noble Nature, and with that sense of the Christian Cause as became a religious Minister of the Faiths Defendor, and an Answer returned thereunto full of affectionate Piety and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion. But it was feared that the time was elapsed, and the Disease proceeded too far to admit a gentle Cure; For it could not probably be expected, that the Vizier should, upon fair words, or perswasions, or by the force of passionate and Rhetorical expressions, be induced to let slip the fair opportunity of an intire and total subjection of <hi>Transilvania.</hi> And the truth is, herein lay the ground of the great Quarrel between these two Emperours; for ever since the Defeat of <hi>Chimianus</hi> (or as the Transilvanians call him <hi>Kemenius</hi>) the Turk swallowing in his thoughts the intire subjection of that Country, designed to reduce it to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a Pasha, rather than of a Christian Prince, though elected at the Ottoman Port; and in order thereunto, advanced beyond the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the ancient bounds, and pitched his Camp in the very Bowels of the Country. These proceedings giving matter of jealousie to all the Captains of the bordering Christians; the Count <hi>Serini</hi> first hastned the finishing of his Fort, as much as was possible, and next, according to his example, the Imperialists in all parts of the Borders fortified their Towns and Castles, and reinforced their Garisons; which was answered by the Turks in the like preparations. And thus mutual fears and jealousies ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected that ill Correspondence, in which the State of Affairs then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained.</p>
                     <p>And since <hi>Transilvania</hi> is the present Scene of Action, it will not be much from our purpose to digress a little in declaring the state of that miserable Principality, and by what ways and means the Turks encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their Tribute, and encroached on their Liberties; the which Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I received from one of the Transilvanian Agents to this effect.</p>
                     <p>In the time of <hi>Sultan Solyman, Transilvania</hi> was governed by her own <note place="margin">A History of Transilvanian Misery.</note> Laws, and her natural Prince, paying then only thirty thousand Dollars of yearly Tribute. After which <hi>Ali</hi> Pasha taking <hi>Varadin</hi> on the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, had some part of the Country allotted him for maintenance of his Garison, and at that time solemnly swore, That beyond those Limits al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to <hi>Varadin,</hi> the Turks should not farther enter into <hi>Transilvania,</hi> but that Oath being little regarded, they have since that time possessed themselves of six Provinces, <hi> (viz.) Bichar, Doboka, Halnock, Colos,</hi> in which is <hi>Claudiopolis,</hi> and of the best part of <hi>Zarand.</hi> Nor were the Turks satisfied herewith, but in the year 1658. the Vizier <hi>Kuperlee</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered <hi>Transilvania,</hi> and by force of Armes took the strong Town of <hi>Janova,</hi> and demanded the Surrender of <hi>Lugas</hi> and <hi>Karansebes</hi> into his hands. Nor could the allegations of the Oath of <hi>Sultan Solyman,</hi> or of <hi>Ali</hi> Pasha, or any other perswasions or submission induce him to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate any part of his severe demands, until first having miserably destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the whole Country, and satiated himself with bloud, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, upon the sad and humble supplication of the Ambassadour from that Prince, to withdraw his Army out of <hi>Transilvania,</hi> on condition, that fifty thousand Dollars of yearly tribute should be added to the former thirty thousand, and that <hi>Lugas,</hi> and <hi>Karansebes</hi> should be wholly aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by the native Inhabitants, and delivered into possession of the Turk: And as a mark of his absolute Dominion over that Country, he
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98602:102"/>
forced one <hi>Achacius Barcley,</hi> employed before as Ambassadour to him, to take on him the Government, threatning that if he accepted not of the Charge, he would invest a Carter in the Principality: Notwithstanding all this Treatment; and though the Transilvanians comply'd with all the propositions offered them by the Turk, yet not long after the Tartar <hi>Han</hi> passed twice through the Country, miserably harrassing, spoiling, and killing, or making Captives all he met, whose departure also from this Country was purchased with a considerable sum of money. And this was the state of the misery of <hi>Transilvania,</hi> when the troubles rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by <hi>Ragotzki</hi> and <hi>Kemenius</hi> added to the other discontents, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred farther occasion to the ensuing War.</p>
                     <p>But whilst the thoughts of the Ottoman Court were intent on their preparations for the next years War in <hi>Hungary,</hi> advice came that the Turkish Fleet, consisting of seventeen ships, and thirty seven Saiques, lately departed from <hi>Constantinople</hi> bound for <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>AEgypt,</hi> and <note place="margin">The Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian Fleet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred by the Venetians.</note> convoyed by six Gallies, which met them at <hi>Scio,</hi> very rich with mony, and other goods, (whose returns are yearly for the most part made in Sugar, Coffee, Rice, and other Commodities) were encountred near <hi>Rhodes</hi> by the Venetian Armata, and such ruine and prize made of them, that of the threescore Sail, twenty eight Saiques, and four Ships were sunk and taken: (<hi>viz.</hi>) eighteen Saiques taken, and ten burnt, three Ships taken, and one burnt, and thereon two hundred and seventy Slaves, amongst which there were of note, <hi>Arnout Asan Aga,</hi> Eunuch of the Seraglio, <hi>Mahomet Aga, Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut Agasey</hi> of <hi>Grand Cairo,</hi> and <hi>Emin Reis,</hi> Captain of a Ship. When this news arrived I happened to be at the Viziers Court, and perceived a strange disturbance and alteration in the faces of all then present; but more particularly the Grand Signior seemed to be heated with fury, and present resolution of revenge; so that he had almost forgotten his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs against the Emperour, and quitting his pastime in Hunting, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to talk of transporting his Armes into <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and thereupon sent Orders to one <hi>Beco</hi> a Begh of the <hi>Morea</hi> to cause a survey of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, Passages, and Bridges towards <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> as if he had intended im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to march, and either to deferr his Hungarian War, or wage both at the same time. But his graver, and more sober Council mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated his heat with reason, knowing that the designs of Princes, though never so absolute, must be subject to times and seasons, until their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers can extend to Omnipotency, which never yet could exceed the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of a mortal man, though some have affected Divine Honours, and by Flatterers have been ranked after death in the number of the Gods. The venetians lost seventy men only, or thereabouts, and amongst them <hi>Giaconto Semitecolo,</hi> a noble Venetian, with other Braves and Souldiers of Fortune. The Turks horribly touched with this loss and disgrace, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Grand Signior, who had an interest in the <hi>Caravana,</hi> had a mind to vent some of their fury on Signior <hi>Ballarino,</hi> the Venetian Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister to the Port, like those (as we say) who cannot beat the Horse will beat the Saddle; so that they intended to imprison him again in some dark Cell, or obscure retirement, of which, or of some other rigour Signior <hi>Ballarino</hi> was so sensible, that he wrote this ensuing Letter to the Senator <hi>Nicolo Contarini,</hi> which may serve to explain the anguith and sorrowful apprehensions of his Soul.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="102" facs="tcp:98602:103"/>
                        <hi>IF my mind were capable of Comfort, I could not in the midst of so much anguish entertain a more efficacious motive thereunto, than those obliging expressions which your Excellencie uses towards me, who like a Terrestrial De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity is pleased to protect me. But alas, I am too much overwhelmed with grief to discover any subject which may cause me to dry my tears. I find no shelter against that storm which I foresaw. Nor is it sufficient for me to discover the Tempest before it arrives: It is not sufficient in this darkness to lose my sleep, disturb my quiet, tire my Body, debilitate my health by a sten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Diet, whilst tossed in the Bosome of an inexorable Element, I am denied the enjoyment of a ray of Light. I hold the Helm of the Ship as direct as I can, but the adverse waves of my Fortune drive me into the midst of those storms where I apprehend the greatest dangers: I am here in the midst of a Sea, which is the Nest of Extravagancies, the grand belief of unthought of Accidents, the spacious Theatre of Tragedies, a fierce Giant, a horrible Monster, who with gentle</hi> Opiates <hi>endeavours to lull asleep, and lead those to destruction who have too great a confidence in their own strength. I reproach my self for not having been able to make it sufficiently understood, how one stroke of adverse Fortune is capable to put all into danger, who are imbarked in the same Vessel; And as little able am I to inculcate into the minds of men, that whilst the Waves of the vast Sea are smooth and calm, the nearer is the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Waters, and the fury of a Tempest. It was therefore necessary that there should have been some more skilful Pilot than my self to conduct this Vessel. I was long since acquainted with my imperfections, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called aloud for the assistance of an abler Pilot, to direct me in this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous Region; but since I was not heard, I gloried at least to be alone in this Gulf, that being swallowed up by a final ruine, my Martyrdom may be a means to save the rest. Rains and Lightnings do not affright me, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther serve to quench that fire of disdain which I conceive against my self, for not knowing how to perform better, and serve to enlighten me daily to find out that Compass or Cart which may direct me to a course or path of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. I fear Thunders and Tempests, because the violence of one, and the hardness of the other is able to render a cold sweat mixed with bloud alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unprofitable. This miserable School, though of eleven years continuance, constrains me to study the disposition of the Stars, the Signs in the Air, the ebbings and flowings of the waters, concealed Rocks, the dangers of along Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and the necessity of recovering a Port. I have studied indeed, but I fear I have not well learned this profound Discipline, for where there is the greatest urgency, there I have gathered the least fruit; for since the aspect of the Spheres are become more inauspicious, I am doubtful that I shall see the Ship beaten with swelling Surges, and being full of Water, it will be so far from being eased by those opportune remedies which I bring, that it will rather be encreased by my tears. God grant by his miraculous Providence, the Tranquillity which we desire, and which by humane means will be difficult to obtain. I had not the understanding to take Opportunity by the Foretop when She presented herself unto me with gentle and benign appearance, show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me the means to save this floating Vessel, and spare our insidious rewards. For this reason my dejected, but not conquered, mind makes my very Bowels feel an unusual anguish of an over-troubled estate. May it please the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine pity, that these my affictions may prove the Offspring of my own vileness, but not the means of my ruine. I trust therein, I confess, and yet frail hope, amidst this Gulf of Sin, induces me to expect doubtful successes; Yet
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98602:103"/>
certainly I will endeavour to avoid a shipwrack on those Rocks of Despair:, And so imploring the Patronage of your Excellencie here on Earth, I confirm my self. From</hi> Pera <hi>of</hi> Constantinople <hi>the</hi> 19 <hi>of</hi> December, 1662.</p>
                     <p>This Letter seems to be wrote in the style of a despairing person, yet if it be well considered, the meaning is no other than what the Issue of Affairs some years afterwards did evidence; and his intentions were no other than to describe the ill nature of the Turkish Ministers, and their obstinacy of continuing a War, until they had wearied out the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans into an humour of surrendring the whole Island of <hi>Candia</hi> unto them. I had the honour to be well acquainted with the Person of Signior <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larino,</hi> and I always esteemed him in his external Behaviour accomplished with the excesses of Italian Civility; he was endued with great fluency of Language, both in Discourse and Writing; he was jealous, acute, and wary; and in short, was a proper Minister for that Republick, well practised and versed in the manner of Treaty with the Turkish Court. He at first was sent from <hi>Venice</hi> to <hi>Constantinople</hi> in quality of Secretary to the Excellentissimo <hi>Capello,</hi> Procurator of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> a Person emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for his Office, and the several great employments which he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised in that State; he was sincere, and of a generous Soul, his come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looks, and grave habit spoke him to be a Gentleman and a Senator. In short, he was so well esteemed of at <hi>Venice,</hi> that he was thought worthy to be imployed in this Embassy to the Grand Signior, which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granted to persons after they have run through all services of the Commonwealth, as a Consummation of their Honours and Richesse. This Gentleman then had the misfortune to be invested in this honour in the worst of Times, when the War was broke forth, and being thereby exposed to their cruelty, he was put into Prison, where passing for some time a Life of sorrow and sadness, he fell into a melancholy, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented all things to him in the blackest manner; so that, I know not why, his fancy suggested to him, that he was not only miserable in his Imprisonment and Restraint amongst the Turks, but that he was fallen also into disgrace, and displeasure of his Prince at home. I will not say that Signior <hi>Ballarino</hi> did nourish the operation of this black humour in him; but I have heard that he did not administer that comfort to him, as might serve to dispel the thickness of that Vapour which obscured the generous temper of his Soul. In short, he gave such way to this melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, that he laid violent hands upon himself; (as we have said before) but afterwards by the Care of his Friends and Servants, being cured of his wounds, he lived some years after, by his sorrows, and repentance for it, to give satisfaction to God and the World. Howsoever, the Senate being informed thereof, and judging this Act to be the effect of a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Phrensie, appointed <hi>Ballarino</hi> to take on himself the intire manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Affairs, reserving only the Title and Honour to Signior <hi>Capello. Ballarino</hi> now managing all Affairs, <hi>Capello</hi> looked on himself as negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and laid aside, howsoever comported his condition with submission and gentleness, never openly resenting the Honours of <hi>Ballarino,</hi> or to see him preferred before himself; Howsoever, secretly nourishing an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward discontent, his robustious Nature, upwards of eighty years of Age, was forced to give way to its final dissolution; and falling sick he sent to the Earl of <hi>Winchelsea,</hi> then Ambassadour for his Majesty at <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> to acquaint him of his Distemper, desiring him to send me, who was
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98602:104"/>
then his Secretary, unto him. At these Summons I was easily perswaded to go, having always had his Person in great Reverence; and being come to his Bed-side, he raised himself upon his Pillows, and embracing me in his Arms, I fancied my self to receive the Benediction of one of the Ancient Patriarchs. He began with a weak voice to say to me, Sir, I am near my end, expecting every minute to render up my last Breath, and therefore as a dying man, I desire of your Master, the Ambassadour, that so soon as I am dead, he would be pleased to deliver this poor Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cass of mine from under the Covering of this accursed Roof. For Answer whereunto I did not stand to expostulate the reasons with him, well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cause of his discontent; but that I would communicate his desires to my Lord Ambassadour, and speedily return with my Answer to him. Accordingly I departed from him, and quickly brought from my Lord a promise to endeavour hisutmost to comply with his request; at which he seemed to be much satisfied, and commanded his Servants then present, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially one called Sig. <hi>Tomaso Gobbato,</hi> his great Confident, to be Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses thereof. The next day he expired his last Breath, and the day following his Body being embalmed, his Bowels were buried, and the Funeral Rites performed with such order and decency as was seemly in a Country where he lived rather like a Prisoner than an Ambassadour. All things being thus prepared, the Earl of <hi>Winchelsea,</hi> according to the Will of the Deceased, sent for his Body, already embalmed, which was immediately without opposition or scruple sent to his house; where it remained for some months, in expectation of a conveyance for <hi>Venice.</hi> At length a Dutch ship, being bound from <hi>Constantinople</hi> thither, it was designed that the Body should be thereon imbarked; but I know not for what reason, the Customer refused to suffer it to pass; though it may well and rationally be conjectured, That <hi>Ballarino,</hi> who was sensibly touched to have the care of the Body of his Master, his Countryman, and Colleague taken from him, did with Presents prevail with the Customer to put dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties in the way, which he supposed might vex those who were thought worthy of this employment. This opposition being made, and not to be overcome without much money, it was contrived that the ship departing should attend the Corps at <hi>Tenedos,</hi> which was without the Command of the Castles; and the Body being divided from the Legs, was packed up in a Butt of Cavear, and so sent down by a Boat with Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the Customer, as a parcel of Goods and Merchandice; and so safely arriving aboard, the Corps were separated from their adjuncts; and being laid decently in a Costin, covered with a Pall of Black Velvet, with Scutcheons, and other ornaments appertaining to the Funerals of such great Personages; it arrived safely at <hi>Venice,</hi> where it was interred with the usual Ceremonics, in the Tomb of the Ancestors of that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Family.</p>
                     <p>But the heads and thoughts of these Governours were not so employed in their preparations of War, but that the Vizier could lend an Ear to the suggestions of some malicious Pharisees, who, under pretence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, informed him, That the Christian Churches, burnt down in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> and <hi>Galata</hi> by those dreadful Fires in the year 1660, were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain re-edified against his Command, and the Law of the Turks, which allows the reparation of Churches, and continuance of such which were found standing when Mahometanism was introduced; but not to erect new, or rebuild what are either by time, fire, or other accidents fallen to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98602:104"/>
ruine. And being farther informed, that though those Churches were restored under the notion of Dwellings, or Ware-houses, yet secretly served for Celebration of Divine Service, and thereby his Deerees and <note place="margin">The Vizier de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Churches rebuilt after the Fire.</note> Edicts were frustrated and disappointed: Wherefore, furiously transported with a Mahometan Zeal, commanded immediately that the Authours of those Buildings should be imprisoned, the Churches themselves levelled to the Foundation, and the ground whereon they stood consiscated to the Grand Signior. This action, though naturally agreeable to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Vizier, who was a perfect Turk, zealous in execution of all points of the Mahometan Law, being educated after the severest sort of Professours, and one of those whom they called Softaes; yet he was chiefly prompted unto this, and to a greater abhorrency of Christianity, by one Vanni Esfendi, a Shegh, or Preacher, one who was as inveterate <note place="margin">The Zeal of a Turkish Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> and malicious to the Christian Religion, as any Enthusiast or Fanatick is to the Rites of our Church and Religion. And thus we may see how troublesome Hypocrisie and Puritanism are in all places where they gain a Superiority; For this Preacher not contented only to ruine the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Churches, but perswaded the Vizier that the terrible Fires in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> and <hi>Galata</hi> in the year 1660, and the last years unparalleled Pestilence, and the inconsiderable advance of the Turks on the Christians for some years, were so many parts of Divine Judgments thrown on the Mussulmen, or Believers, in vengeance of their too much Licence given to the Christian Religion, permitting Wine to be sold within the Walls of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which polluted the Imperial City, and ensnared the faithful by temptation to what was unlawful: Wherefore a Command was issued, That no Wine should be henceforth sold within the Walls of the City. And it was farther intended that Greeks and Armenians, and all other Christians, who had Dwellings or Possessions within the Walls of the City, should within forty days sell those habitations, and depart; which otherwise should be confiscated to the Grand Signior; but God who supports the Faithful in Tryals of Persecution, moderated this Decree, and reserved still his Church in the midst of Insidels; not suffering this City to lose the Name nor Religion of that Holy Emperor, who both erected, and christned it; as also to preserve most of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which though again uncovered, yet were redcemed for money from the possession of the Turks. Nor was the Mahometan Zeal satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Demolishment of the Churches themselves, unless it vented part of its fury against the poor Workmen, which for their hire and days Wages erected them; such as Greek Labourers, Masons, and Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who were all beaten and imprisoned. But it happening at that time that the Queen Mother building a sumptuous Mosch, and having occasion of many Labourers and Artists to forward so vast a Work, sent to the Maimarbashee (who is the Master work-man, or Cape, over all such who are employed in Building) to supply such a number of Carpenters, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and others, as were convenient to carry on that Fabrick with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition; who readily replyed, That he would provide all that was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, but could not promise a sufficient number, unless those Greeks were set at liberty, who were imprisoned by the Grand Vizier for building the Christian Churches; which answer being reported again to the Queen Mother, she interceeded with the Vizier in their behalf, who being glad of any occasion to gratifie so great a Lady, immediately released them, without any fine or reward, which he designed to obtain for their liberty.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98602:105"/>
Howsoever the Vizier not well brooking such an indignity (as he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) put upon him by so mean a Slave, as the Maimarbashee, dealt with some of the imprisoned Labourers to accuse him, as the Authour and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censer of building the Christian Churches. The Greeks easily enough perswaded to please so great a Personage, accused him accordingly, whose Evidence, though not passable against a Turk by the Mahometan Law, yet served the Viziers revenge for the present, who immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his head to be struck off, and his Estate confiscated; which was <note place="margin">The Viziers revenge on the Cape of the Builders.</note> reported to consist of two thousand purses of mony, every purse import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing five hundred Dollars, then found actually in his house, which, if true, is a strange Wealth for so ordinary a person. But by this, and by many other instances, we may perceive that there is no people in the World more covetous, and desirous to amass Wealth than the Turks, nor none more uncertain to enjoy it.</p>
                     <p>About this time the French Merchants in the <hi>Levant,</hi> having advised his most Christian Majesty that the Turks were sensible that the affront to the person of <hi>Monsteur la Haye,</hi> his Ambassadour, was contrary to the Law of Nations, and such an injury as could not but provoke the Choler of so puissant a Prince to a just revenge; and knowing that his Majesty being powerful at Sea, was able to extend his Armes to the utmost Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of his Empire, whilst the interposition of other Countries limited the Turks March by Land, and their ignorance and inability in marine Affairs rendred them uncapable to arrive those Banks of <hi>France,</hi> which the Sea washes: These Considerations the French Merchants having perswaded the King to be the thoughts of the Grand Signior, and that he desired the continuance of the Peace and Traffick with <hi>France,</hi> and as an evidence of his remorse and displeasure for the injury to Monsieur <hi>la Haye,</hi> the Father, his Majesty was contented in satisfaction thereof to redress this injurious transgression of the Law of Nations, by some extraordinary marks of favour and honour to the Person of Monsieur <hi>la Haye</hi> the Son; that so exceeding the usual method and rule of Ceremony towards this Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour at his arrival, the World might be convinced of the real affection, and hearty desire the Grand Signior had to renew his Peace, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his Commerce with <hi>France.</hi> This is supposed to be what the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of <hi>Marseille</hi> and <hi>Lyons</hi> governed by the Interest of their Trade, suggested to their King to induce him to send an Ambassadour to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople;</hi> For at this time Monsieur <hi>Roboli,</hi> a Merchant, remained on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Messengers from <hi>France</hi> to introduce a new Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour.</note> as Consul or Agent for the Affairs of Commerce. Things thus represented at the French Court, the King dispatched away two Gentlemen to <hi>Constantinople</hi> with Letters to the Grand Signior and Vizier, and one to the <hi>Sieur Roboli,</hi> the Agent, declaring that if the Turk would make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for the last Affront done to the Ambassadour, by some signal notes of Honour in the abused Person of Monsieur <hi>la Haye,</hi> the Son, he would then condescend to confirm the Ancient League and Amity.

In Answer to the Kings Letter the Grand Signior made no reply, but only by his Vizier, by reason that in all the Ancient Turkish Registers and Archives, there was no example found, that the Grand Signior ever wrote to any King, who had not an Ambassadour actually resident at his Port. But this Negotiation about a French Ambassadour took not effect, until some time after, in which other Letters and Messages inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened, as will appear by the following Sequel of this History.</p>
                     <p>It was now towards the beginning of Winter, when the Season of the Year compelled the Turkish Fleet of Gallies to return according to cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, to the Port of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> The whole Summer before, they <note place="margin">The returns of the Turkish Armata to win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople.</hi>

In their return home, near <hi>Constantinople</hi> they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred a sierce storm, so that three Gallies were cast away at <hi>Ponte Piccolo,</hi> (by the Turks called <hi>Cuchuccheckmage,</hi> about four Leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from <hi>Constantinople.</hi>) Howsoever the Weather clearing, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Fleet got into Port, entring with joy, with vollies of great and small Shot, with Streamers flying, Pipes sounding, and all other sorts of their Country Musick, bringing with great Ostentation a small Flyboat, which had been a Ligornese Man of War, taken by them as she was cruising singly in the Arches of <hi>Pelago;</hi> which was brought in with so much Ceremony used in toaing her into Port, decking her with Streamers and Pendants, with such signs of Victory and Triumph, as if they had led Captive the whole Venetian Armata. But I must not omit the relation of what befel one of the Beghs Gallies, designed, with the rest, <note place="margin">The Slaves make an Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in one of the Beghs Gallies.</note> to rendezvous at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> whilst she loitered amongst small Isles in the Gulf of <hi>Nicomedia.</hi> It was a Gally, the Commander of which had newly received as the Portion of his Wife, being a Young man lately married, who entertained great thoughts of raising his Fortunes by the spoils and prize he was to make. At these Isles several of the Officers, and <note n="*" place="margin">The Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at Sea cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by that name.</note> Levents went on shore; where whilst they entertained themselves with Wine and merriment; the Slaves made an insurrection in the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, seized the Captain, cut off his Head, and threw his Body into the Sea; and so becoming Masters of the Vessel, weighed Anchor, and set sail. Those on the shore admiring at the unexpected departure of the Gally, accompanied her with their eyes and wonder as far as they could perceive her in sight, but observing her to steer a different course from the Port, to which they were designed, suspected much of the truth of what had succeeded; wherefore taking their Boat immediately, they hastned to <hi>Constantinople</hi> to give advice of what had passed, that (if possible) Orders might timely arrive the Castles on the Hellespont, which might obstruct their farther passage. But alas! the poor Slaves were so dismayed with their own action, and so transported with a slavish fear and apprehension of what might succeed should their escape not be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; that they knew not what course to steer: all things seemed to contradict their liberty, the Wind proved contrary, their Spirits deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

their understandings void of counsel and contrivance; so that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring three or four days in the <hi>Propontis,</hi> at last ran their Gally ashoar on the Asian side, near <hi>Palormo;</hi> from whence they were brought back to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and there, by sentence of the Captain Pasha, fourteen of them had their Legs and Arms broken, and so suffered to dye in that tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and afterwards their Bodies were thrown into the Sea, to the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of all other Slaves, who prefer a miserable Life at the Oar, before the torments of some hours in dying.</p>
                     <p>Though the Turks have their Affairs but ill managed at Sea, and their success accordingly fortunate; yet their preparations for Land services are more expedite, and executed with that secrecy and speed, that oftentimes Armies are brought into the Field, before it is so much as rumoured by common mouths that any designs are in agitation: For though it was now Winter, yet the design against <hi>Germany</hi> went forward, Forces were daily sent to the Frontiers, Cannon, and Ammunition for War, transported by way of the Black Sea, and the <hi>Danube.</hi> Orders issued <note place="margin">The Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the German War.</note> out to the Princes of <hi>Moldavia,</hi> and <hi>Valachia</hi> to repair their Wharfs and Keys along the River, for the more convenient landing of Men and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, and to rebuild their Bridges for the more commodious passage of the Tartars; That Horses should be provided against the next Spring, for drawing all Carriages of Ammunition, and Provisions; their Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines stored with quantities of Bread, and Rice, their Fields well stocked with Sheep, and other Cattel, and that no necessaries be wanting which concern the victualling, or sustenance of a Camp. The Tartars were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to have in a readiness a hundred thousand Horsemen, to make Incursions on the Frontiers; Likewise the Pashaws of <hi>Darbiquier, Aleppo, Caramania,</hi> and <hi>Anatolia</hi> received their orders; and seven and twenty Letters, accompanied with as many Vests, after the Turkish manner, were sent to as many Pashaws of the Empire, to dispose the strength of their Countries in a Warlike posture, so as to march when the Grand Signiors Commands should require them to attend his designs: And that the occasion of the War might appear the more justifiable, it was resolved, That no Acts of Hostility, or other Breaches of Peace should be pretended, than the Fort built by the Count <hi>Serini,</hi> being a matter really against the Articles of the last Peace; the Demolishment whereof, the Ottoman Force intended to make the principal end of their first En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, in which if they encountred any opposition from the Emperor, the Cause of their War would be then the more plausible; for as yet the Emperour had not fully declared his approbation of that Work, raised by <hi>Serini,</hi> as agreeable to his Assent, or Pleasure. On the other side with no less caution and labour did the Christians endeavour to secure their Frontiers, by raising their Militia, and reinforcing their Garisons, and especially to perfect the new Fort near <hi>Canista,</hi> which, as it was thought so considerable, as to countervail the inconveniences and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of a War, so the Turk thought it neither honourable, nor secure, until he had seen it razed, and levelled with the ground.</p>
                     <p>All things thus growing black and stormy round about, that nothing <note place="margin">An Accident disposing the Christian Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs to a peace with the Turk.</note> seemed less probable, and it may be said, less possible, than an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Behold, on a sudden, an Accident fell out at <hi>Rome,</hi> from whence this War with the Turks received its life and heat, which becalmed much of the fury and storm on the Christian Consines, and inclined matters in <hi>Germany</hi> towards propositions of Peace, fearing that <hi>Italy,</hi> who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98602:108"/>
this War, was not able (as things stood) to contribute towards its maintenance and support. The occasion was this. It happened that in the streets of <hi>Rome</hi> the French Ambassadours Coach was assaulted by the <hi>Corsi</hi> Natives of the Ifle of <hi>Corsica,</hi> which are of the Popes Guard, the Page killed at the Boot of the Coach, and the Ambassadours Lady wounded; whether this barbarous act was designed against the Person of the Ambassadour by any Persons of Eminency, or malice of the People, is little to the purpose I have now in hand; only the King took this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front so heinously, that for the present no acknowledgments or satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Pope could make, could allay his just resentment, or any thing be imagined possible to expiate this indignity, besides a War. The News of this Division between the Son, and the spiritual Father, filled all the Ministers of <hi>Constantinople</hi> with much Joy, and with subject of Laughter, and expectation of the Event, judging now that their daily Prayers for the Discord of the Christian Princes amongst themselves, were heard and granted, since they had so far availed, as to disunite the very Oeconomy of Christendome. And now they imagined that this difference would have a forcible influence on their Affairs in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and either incline the Emperour speedily to a Peace, or otherwise to undertake a War on disadvantageous terms. Things had an issue accordingly, for in a few Weeks after, advice came by Post from <hi>Ali</hi> Pasha, then at <hi>Tentiswar,</hi> that his <hi>Salam-Chaous,</hi> called <hi>Chusaein,</hi> who had long since been sent to <hi>Vienna,</hi> with more distinct Demands of what the Turks proposed, and being supposed, through his long stay, to be detained a Prisoner, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain returned, and with him had brought the Baron of <hi>Goez,</hi> as Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuncio, <note place="margin">The Baron of <hi>Gowtz</hi> sent to <hi>Ali</hi> Pasha.</note> sent to <hi>Ali</hi> Pasha, to receive a more particular Information of the Turks propositions, for that the Emperour pretended, he was not as yet throughly satisfied therein. And thus matters, beyond all expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, began to incline to an agreement, in regard that <hi>Rome</hi> being now in danger herself, not by the Turks, but by the Christians, held herself uncapable to administer that Fuel to the Fire of War which She had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised; so that the League treated there beginning to fail, the Emperour grew faint, and the Princes cold, in their Preparations, wishing some Course could be effected, which might bring matters to an accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Such were the Discourses and imaginations of the Turks; In which condition we leave the state of Affairs until the beginning of the next year; and in the mean time it may not be from our purpose, nor tedious to the Reader, to record what befel this year most remarkable to the English Nation, and their Trade in Turky, which also may be beneficial, by instruction of past examples, to such who shall for the future be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Traffick and business of the Levant.</p>

                        <p>THE Messengers from <hi>Algier,</hi> as before related, having promised better Obedience for the future to the Commands of the Grand Signior, obtained a new Pasha for their City, and Country thereunto belonging; who before his departure, was enjoined by the Grand Signior to dispose Affairs with the Earl of <hi>Winchelsea,</hi> his Majesties Ambassadour at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as might demonstrate his disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions towards a Peace, and his desire that the Algerines should do the like, and accept of that Clause in the Articles, prohibiting the search of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Ships, either for their own or Strangers Goods. The place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the meeting between the Embassadour and the Pasha, was a certain Chiosk, or Garden house, belonging to an Eunuch, the <hi>Aga</hi> of a Seraglio at <hi>Pera;</hi> where both parties being met, the Pasha declared that the Grand Signiors desires were, That a Peace should be concluded on the Ancient Capitulations, and that by him these Orders were to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried unto <hi>Algier,</hi> from whence he was advised, that the Algerines were ready to accept those Articles, if one of his Majesties Ships singly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the Treaty; so that, the World might not esteem their conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension to proceed from Force and Compulsion. Hereof Advices being sent into <hi>England,</hi> a Peace ensued in some Months after, but what faith these Insidels kept will be related in the Sequel of this Story; the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of which is engraven with the Point of a Diamond, and the Losses which ensued thereupon to the Exchange at <hi>London,</hi> deserve a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Treatise, which in the mean time many Families retain in a sad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>May</hi> Advice was brought to the Lord Ambassadour, how that the <hi>Anne,</hi> a Frigate of his Majesties Royal Navy, commanded by Captain <hi>Jonas Poole,</hi> which had convoyed the general Ships to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> in her passage homewards stopped at the <hi>Morca,</hi> and came to an Anchor near a place in that Country, called the Black Mountain, commodious to Wood and Waterin; to which end were landed threescore men, armed with Swords and Firelocks; these made havock of the Woods on all sides, loading their Boats away as fast as they could, and not only so, but set great Trees on Fire, which in that dry Season of the Year dispersed it self far and wide; which being seen at a distance in the Night, alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the people of the Country, so that the Begh, or Governour came down with some Force to discover the matter, supposing that some Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teses, or Venetians might be landed. At the approach of this Body of Turks, our Men quitted the Woods, and shifted away as fast as they could to their Boats, of which thirty eight escaped, the rest falling short were intercepted by the Turks, and eleven of them were killed, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven taken Captives; and of the Turks, two Aga's, and two or three others had the fortune to fall by some Musket-shot from our men, whilst in this confusion, they endeavoured to defend themselves. On the news hereof, our Lord Ambassadour represented the whole matter to the Vizier declaring, That it was lawful according to our Capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:98602:109"/>
 to take refreshments, and supply our wants in any part of the Grand Signiors Dominions; and that therefore he demanded Justice on the Begh of the <hi>Morea,</hi> and restitution of the Captives. But the Vizier understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that some Turks were killed in the skirmish, lent not so ready an ear to these Complaints; howsoever, to be acquitted of the Ambassadours solicitations, referred the business to the Examination and Justice of the Captain Pasha: but it falling out that at that time the Consul and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants at <hi>Smyrna</hi> had an unhappy difference with the Captain Pasha, (which shall in the next place be related) was the Cause that all Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to his Favour and Justice were suspended, and a slow progress made towards obtaining the liberty of those poor unfortunate men. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, some months after it happened that the Begh of the <hi>Morea</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from that Government, and coming to <hi>Constantinople</hi> with his whole Estate, brought with him the eleven Englishmen, which he had taken, and offered them to sale unto the Ambassadour, who considering that they were Englishmen, and such as had been enslaved in actual ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of their King, he esteemed himself obliged both in Charity and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to redeem them. But the Case appeared too foul to demand their Liberty by strength of the Capitulations; for besides that, the cutting Wood in places inhabited without permission, is a Robbery and a Crime in its self, not to be maintained by the Law of Nations, the killing of a principal Aga, and wounding others, might sufficiently warrant the Turks, without any Breach of Peace, to detain these men as lawful Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives: Wherefore the Lord Ambassadour deeming it unseemly, that those who had served in his Majestics Navy should be condemned to the Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Gallies, disbursed fourteen hundred Lion Dollars, which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded for them, which was afterwards repay'd him by his Majesty; and having cloathed, and provided them with necessaries for their Voyage, conveyed them with the first occasions into <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The difference between the English Nation, and the Captain Pasha which impeded the Liberty, for some time, of these Captives, had its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> where some English Merchants making Collation one Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Garden, were assaulted and beaten by certain drunken <note n="*" place="margin"> Souldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Sea.</note> Levents, belonging to a Gally then in Port, in whose Company was a Portuguez Slave. The News hereof flying to the Frank Street put all the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood into an uproar, so that divers people with such weapons as <note place="margin"> TheGarden Avania.</note> came next to hand, in a sury went in pursuit of the Levents, and unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily meeting one, drew him into the English Consuls house, where they treated him with such blows as abated much of the heat and fumes of his Wine; during which disturbance and confusion, the Portuguez slave found an opportunity to make his escape. The Consul knowing it some advantage in <hi>Turkie</hi> to complain first, sent to the Kadi, giving him to understand the ill usage of four of his Merchants (whose names he gave in writing) by the unruly Levents, whilst they innocently, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injury to any, divertised themselves in a Garden; to which, for the present, little more was given in answer, than that on a farther examination of the business, the Consul should receive Justice. In the mean time the Turk, who had been beaten in the Consuls house, resolved not to leave the Gate till he had received satisfaction for his blows; and the others that were his Comrades demanded their Slave from the English, which was lost, by whose means and assistance (as they pretend) he had made his Escape. The matter came now to high Demands on both sides,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:98602:109"/>
which the Kadi, either not being desirous, or not of sufficient Authority to compound, the Gally departed without any agreement, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint was carried by the Turks to the Captain Pasha, who then being with his Fleet at <hi>Mytilene,</hi> with little other thoughts or business, was glad of this occasion to get money, and therefore suddenly returned the Gally again, with Orders to bring before him the four Merchants, whose names he particularized, to make answer to their accusation of having beaten his Levents, and contrived the escape of the slave. The Consul and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants being affrighted by this Message, and Command of so great a Personage, endeavoured with money to accommodate the business, by force of which it was at length taken up, costing in all the summ of Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars two thousand seven hundred, or thereabouts. The which passage may serve for an example to such as live in <hi>Turkie,</hi> that all troubles of this nature are best compounded for at first; for at the beginning nothing more was demanded than the price of the Slave, and of the broken pate of the Levent: but being suffered to come under the Cognizance of powerful and covetous Tyrants; as there is no fathoming their unsatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble desires, so there is no prospect into what inconvenient dangers such Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs will involve, and entangle themselves.</p>
                        <p>As <hi>Turkie</hi> hath been seldome or never without having false money cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, so the best sort of Silver hath been so clipped by the Jews, Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Merchants, and others; that the Dollar was brought at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> to six Drams, and at <hi>Smyrna</hi> to seven, which made great confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Trade of these Countries. Wherefore the Vizier as he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given proof and testimony to the World of his strict observance, and adherence to the Mahometan Law, so he was desirous to appear highly careful and sensible of the Publick Interest: And therefore as the most necessary work, he began with the Dollars of six Drams, proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin"> The Viziers E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict against Dollars of six Drams.</note> that they should no longer pass in payments, and that those in whose hands they were found, delivering them into the Mint should receive a 8 o in return of every such Dollar, by which means the Mint would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance a. 4 on every Dollar, esteeming every dram worth 14 Aspers, and that for the present no Dollar being currant under seven Drams, it might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards bebrought to Lyons, and Dollars of nine Drams; which regulation, though at first grievous to some particular persons, would afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the common advantage and benefit of Trade. To forward which Design the Grand Signior, and Queen Mother sent all their Dollars of six Drams to be new coined into Aspers at the Mint, so likewise did the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier, intending to be very strict in prohibition of that money. But a while after it happened that the Treasurer of the Viziers Steward having occasion to pay monies, either for his own or his Masters account, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced some Bags of six Drams on those to whom payment was to be made; the Receivers denied to accept them, but he being a powerful man, and very urgent, forced the money upon them, with which laden, as they had received them, they went directly to the Vizier, acquainting him that they were desirous to obey his Commands, as to the six Dram Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, but his Stewards Treasurer had forced on them that sort of money, which if it was his pleasure that they should still pass, they were content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to receive, if not, they desired him to give Command for their pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in other money. The Vizier being highly enraged, that the first Violation of his Commands should begin in his own Family, immediately ordered, without farther proof or process, that the Offenders Head
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98602:110"/>
should be struck off, and his body thrown into the Sea; which Sentence was executed in the same hour for example and terror of others, and to expiate the crime, and take away the scandal from the fountain of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, whose streams can never be esteemed to run clear when the source is corrupted. In like manner the Overseer of the Mint was strangled, and <hi>Emir</hi> Pasha, formerly Pasha of Grand <hi>Cairo,</hi> was banished to the Isle of <hi>Lomnos,</hi> for making the Coin of Aspers 5. <hi>per cent.</hi> worse than their true value.</p>
                        <p>The Merchants at <hi>Aleppo,</hi> being far from the Court, are more subject to troublesom Avanias than others, who are nearer to the head or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, from whence Justice should proceed, as may appear by many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <note place="margin">Merchants of <hi>Aleppo.</hi>
                           </note> and particularly by an accident which fell out there this year. For it happened, that a Janisary which served the English Nation, riding abroad with some of the Merchants, for want of heed, or the unruliness of his Horse, chanced to hurt a Youth playing in the streets. Whereupon the Merchants, and the Janisary, not to suffer this business to come within the knowledge of the Cities Officers, immediately for some money quieted the complaints, and stopped the farther demands of the father; and to make the business more secure, caused the father to make Hoget before the <hi>Kadi,</hi> that he was well satisfied, and remained without farther pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, either on the Merchant, or the Janisary, for the hurt which his child had received. But the Pasha, who had for a long time attentively watched an opportunity to extort mony from the English, was resolved not to let pass this fair occasion; and therefore sent to demand from the Consul those Merchants, which he called Accessories to this mischief, and the Assassinates of a Mussulman. The Consul appearing in person before the Pasha, denied to deliver up the Merchants being guiltless of any crime 5 and that for hurt to the child, the father had received full satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from the Janisary, and given a discharge before the <hi>Kadi.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever this reason would not pacifie the Pasha, who could acknowledge no other argument available than a sum of money; and therefore in prosecution of his design produced ten false Witnesses, that the child was dead of its hurt, and that English men had done the mischief. The Consul had now no other answer than a flat denial; for the Pasha had forced by threats the Hoget from the Janisary, and persisting with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy in defence of his Merchants, the Pasha confined him for an hours time in a Chamber of his House, and beat, and imprisoned his Drugger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. The Consul afterwards returned home; and perceiving a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Pasha and the Mufti, purchased the favour of the Mufti on his side, and procured from him an Hoget of the several proceedings in this business, which was dispatched away with all expedition to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> that a redress of this injury might be obtained from the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Power. Whilst the Lord Ambassador in due manner resented this breach of Capitulations, and prepared to make his complaints to the Vizier, it happened that certain Christians of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> from whom the Pasha had forced 18000 Dollars by unjust extortion, were then at Court solliciting the restauration of their right. The Ambassador judging this a convenient and opportune preparation to prepossess the mind of the Vizier with a true apprehension of the injustice of this Pasha, encouraged and pricked forward these abused and oppressed Christians in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; and the next day presented his Memorial to the Vizier, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the particulars of the late passages at <hi>Aleppo:</hi> which with the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:98602:110"/>
other Crimes alledged the Day before, so moved the mind of the Vizier, that he promised the Ambassadour to send a Kapugibashee of the Grand Signior to enquire into the Truth of these Allegations; and that he might be satisfied of his real intentions to do him justice, he advised him to send a Messenger in company with this Officer, who might witness the reality of his proceedings. The Kapugibashee being in this manner dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched, and arriving at <hi>Aleppo,</hi> made the Pasha refund the money he had unjustly taken from the poor oppressed Christians of that Country; in which good action my Lord Ambassadour had been an useful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, having encouraged the Agents of those Christians at <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> counselled them what Course to take, and introduced them by his Chief Interpreter to the Presence of the Vizier, for which he received the thanks of the Greek and Armenian Patriarchs, who gratefully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to the English Consul at <hi>Aleppo,</hi> how much they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to the charity and favour of the English Ambassadour: But whilst all mens eyes were in expectation what farther proceedings were designed against the Pasha in favour of the English, the Officer denied to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any instructions therein, and so returned to <hi>Constantinople</hi> without taking notice of the English Concernment. The Ambassadour judging himself herein slighted, sent to the Viziers Kahya to know the mystery of this neglect; for the Vizier and himself having pawned his word, and promises to do him justice, against the Pasha of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> it seemed strange that his assurances should vanish into nothing; and that he so meanly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed his Quality and Office, as to disparage it with so much disrepute and contempt as must necessarily befall him, should this Pasha escape without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> punishment; For then the World might with reason believe his Applications of no prevalency, and his Merchants fear the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency of his protection. To which the Kahya answered, That it was true, that the Kapugibashee was not instructed in the Concernments of the English, in regard a more solemn and eminent piece of Justice was designed for the Ambassadour, than any that could be performed by the Kapugibashee, and that in twenty or thirty days at farthest the Pasha should be deprived of his Office. The next day following the Kahya ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised that the Hattesheriff, or Imperial Command for deposing of the Pasha, was signed, and that old <hi>Mahomet</hi> Pasha of <hi>Darbiquier</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted in his place; which News was highly pleasing to the Lord Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour, in regard he had been an ancient Friend to the English, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom he presaged to our Nation at <hi>Aleppo</hi> all security and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. By which Story it is observable, That though the Supreme <note place="margin">Reflections on the Premises.</note> Officers amongst the Turks are willing to satisfie Christian Ambassadours resident with them, in the Care they have of their Welfare, and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of their Capitulations; yet are not desirous to publish to their own people the punishment of their Grand Officers, at the instigation or for the concernment of a Christian: And that though the Turks are apprehended amongst us for a people of great Morality, and singleness in their Dealings; yet it is observable in this, as well as in other their actions, that they have double tongues and faces, and know how to act with as fine a Thread, and plausible pretences as are accustomary in the most politick and refined Courts of <hi>Italy.</hi>

                     <p>THE Baron of <hi>Goez,</hi> which at the end of the last year arrived at <hi>Buda</hi> with several overtures of peace, had so far proceeded in his Treaty with <hi>Ali</hi> Pasha of <hi>Buda,</hi> that all Articles seemed almost conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and scarce any difficulty to remain, unless the Surrender of <hi>Zekel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hyd</hi> on the Confines of <hi>Hungary;</hi> which also was afterwards accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated by Agreement, That the City should be resigned into the hands of the Prince of <hi>Transilvania,</hi> as the most equal Condition between the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and the Turk.

                     <p>The Spring drawing near, the Vizier prepared all things for action, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating and appointing such, who in his absence were to supply the Offices of State: <hi>Ishmael</hi> Pasha, then Pasha of <hi>Buda,</hi> was designed for <hi>Chimacam,</hi> or Governour of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and <hi>Mustapha</hi> Pasha, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain Pasha, Brother in Law to the Great Vizier by marriage of his Sister (and now the present Vizier) was made <hi>Chimacam</hi> at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> near the Person of the Grand Signior. All other preparations for War went forwards, thirty pieces of Cannon from <hi>Scutari,</hi> and fifty from the Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio, most of a vast bigness and weight, which had served in the taking of <hi>Babylon,</hi> with great store of Ammunition and Provisions of War, were transported up the <hi>Danube</hi> to <hi>Belgrade,</hi> and the Princes of <hi>Molda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> and <hi>Valachia,</hi> had now Commands sent them to quicken their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in making their preparations of War, and in providing Sheep, Beef, Rice, and all sorts of Victuals for supply of the Camp; and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Proclamation was made in all places, That all Souldiers, who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved one Asper of pay from the Grand Signior, were to prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for the War.</p>
                     <p>About the middle of <hi>February</hi> the Horse Tail was set forth at the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers Gate; (which is the usual signal of the Camps motion within the space of a month) so that none may excuse himself from the War for want of due and timely intimation. And though the time for departure
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:98602:111"/>
nearly approached, yet the Grand Signior was so impatient, that he would scarce expect until the Equinoctial, which was the Term formerly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and published for this expedition; resolving sometimes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed<note place="margin">The Grand Signior impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to leave <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
                        </note> before, and leave the Vizier to follow him, letting fall words of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, That such as loved and honoured him would keep him company. But this hasty resolution, and eager desire of his Journey the Vizier, Mufti, and others of his Counsellours did moderate, perswading him to a little longer patience: to which, though with some difficulty, he assen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; yet he could not forbear from his horses back, and constant exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises abroad, nor could he be induced to take one nights repose longer in his great Seraglio at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but lodged at <hi>Daout</hi> Pasha, a small Palace about four miles distant from <hi>Constantinople.</hi> Which extravagant manner of living most people attributed to his wandring humour, and delights in hunting, riding, and such like exercises, having his sole plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in the Woods and Fields: But others, who judged with better foundation, did conceive, That the Grand Signiors choice of other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Residence rather than his Imperial Seraglio, proceeded not so much from his own unsetled humour, and course of living, as from an apprehension of some Designs, and mutinous Treasons of the Janisaries against him: for to speak the truth, since the death of <hi>Kuperlee,</hi> the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia began again to be corrupted; and if we may believe the opinion of the most principal Turks, the Vizier undertook this War to employ the busie spirits of the Souldiery, which began to grow resty and insolent through idleness, and by that means secure his own life, and establish his Condition and Fortune.</p>
                     <p>The Equinoctial being come, the Grand Signior would not have one days longer patience; for though the Season was wet and rainy, yet the Tents were pitched; and though the Wind was so violent and forcible as overturned almost the whole Camp, yet no difficulties and inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Weather could give one hour of intermission to the Sultans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires: Wherefore on the <hi>9th</hi> of this Month the Grand Signior departed<note place="margin">Much.</note> from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> attended with his Court, his principal Officers of State, and with what part of his Army was then in a readiness to march. The magnificence of the show they made, was according to the usual so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, yet worthy the sight of a Stranger, and perhaps not incurious to the Reader in its Relation.</p>
                     <p>First, marched with a singular Gravity, the several and distinct Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders<note place="margin">The Cavalcade which the Gr. Signior made when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
                        </note> of Civil and Military Officers in their proper Habits and Capari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the Santones in their wild dress followed by the Emirs, or such as are of the Kindred of their false Prophet; The Great Vizier, and Mufti rode in rank together, the Vizier on the left hand, the most honourable place amongst the Souldiery, being the side to which the Sword is girt, as the right is of greatest esteem amongst such as are of the Law, being that hand which guides the Pen: The Trappings of the Viziers Horse were plated with Gold, and before him were carried three horse-tails, called in Turkish (<hi>Tugh,</hi>) and behind him came about three hundred and fifty Pages, all Young men well mounted, and armed with Jacks and Coats of Male: Next followed the Minions of the Court, or Seraglio, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Paicks with Caps of beaten Gold, and embroidered Coats, the Solacks with Feathers, armed with Bows and Arrows; these two last are of the highest degree of Lacqueys, which more nearly attend the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Grand Signior; These were followed by nine led Horses of the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98602:112"/>
Grand Siginor, richly adorned with precious Stones, and Bucklers all covered with Jewels of an unknown value. Immediately before the Person of the Grand Siginor was led a Camel carrying the Alcoran in a Chest covered with cloth of gold: The Grand Siginor himself was cloathed in a Vest of cloth of gold lined with a Sable incomparably black, held up from the sides of his Horse by four Pages; his Person was followed with great numbers of Eunuchs, and Pages with long red Caps wrought with gold about the head, carrying Lances and Mails, with two locks, one on each side of their head, which are worn by such only as are of the Royal Chamber: after these crowded great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Servants, with the chief Comp. of Spahees, commanded by the <hi>Selict ar Aga,</hi> in number about 1800. And in this manner and order they marched to their Tents.</p>
                     <p>The Tents were raised on a small Hill, as may be judged about four miles distant from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and about two thousand in number ranged at that time without order, only the Grand Siginor's seemed to be in the midst, and to over-top all the rest, well worthy observation, costing (as was reported) one hundred and eighty thousand Dollars, <note place="margin">The richness of Turkish Tents.</note> richly embroidered in the inside with gold, and supported by Pillars plated with gold. Within the <note n="*" place="margin">In Turkish Perdéh.</note> Walls of this Tent (as I may so call them) were all sorts of Offices belonging to the Seraglio, all Retirements and Apartments for the Pages, <hi>Chioskes</hi> or Summer-houses for pleasure; and though I could not get admittance to view the innermost Rooms and Chambers, yet by the outward and more common places of resort, I could make a guess at the richess and greatness of the rest, being sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous beyond comparison of any in use amongst the Christian Princes. On the right hand hereof was pitched the Grand Viziers Tent, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly rich and lofty; and had I not seen that of the Sultans before it, I should have judged it the best that my eyes had seen. The osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and magnificence of this Empire being evidenced in nothing more than in the richess of their Pavilions, sumptuous beyond the fixed Palaces of Princes, erected with Marble and Mortar.</p>
                     <p>On the 16. of this month the <hi>Aga</hi> of the Janisaries first raised his <note place="margin">The Turks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin their March.</note> Tents, and began his march, the next day followed the Grand Siginor, Vizier, and other Officers, and Spahees. At which time all <hi>Asta</hi> was full of Souldiers flocking from all parts of the East, as from <hi>Aleppo, Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scus, Arabia, Erzirum,</hi> and <hi>Babylon:</hi> so that for a long time Boats and Barks were continually imployed to ferry the Souldiery from <hi>Scutari</hi> into <hi>Europe:</hi> and the High-ways, Villages, and all parts of the Road towards <hi>Adrianople</hi> were filled with Souldiers, as if all <hi>Asta</hi> had issued out to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and inhabit the German Possessions. And for greater expedition in the March of the Army, Proclamation was made of a general Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous at <hi>Sophia</hi> at the <note n="*" place="margin">The Turks Feast.</note> 
                        <hi>Biram,</hi> then within three weeks time, where they designed to soil their Horse, and refresh themselves before they fell in carnest to their business. But before the Grand Vizier departed from <hi>Adrianople</hi> to prosecute a War in <hi>Hungary</hi> against the Emperour, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Siginor <hi>Ballarino</hi> to his presence, as if he would treat with him of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters tending to an adjustment with <hi>Venice;</hi> when at the same timo he had 20000 men in a readiness at <hi>Scutari</hi> to march into <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and to joyn with other Forces in <hi>Bosna</hi> and <hi>Croatia;</hi> but this dissimulation and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Treaty served only to discover on what Terms a Peace might be obtained, in case Affairs in <hi>Hungary</hi> should be so pressing as
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:98602:112"/>
to require an application solely of Arms to that Country.</p>
                     <p>Not only had Signor <hi>Ballarino</hi> Affairs of publick trouble, but likewise something touched him of private concernment in his own Family; where the Turks, I know not upon what information coming to search, found in his house two figures, one of a man, and the other of a woman made of linen cloth, stuffed with Wool and Cotton; the which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted by the Turks to be Images of Sorcery and Inchantment; one representing the Grand Siginor, and the other his Mother, were design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a secret manner, by thrusting Needles and Pins into those parts, where the heart and liver is, to cause those whom they represent to dye with macerations and consumptions, according to the Inchantment of <hi>Medea. In jecur urget acus.</hi> And this suspicion was augmented by the reports of the neighbourhood, who hearing the Priest often recite his Litany, and sing Evening-song, avouched that they constantly over-heard the Charms muttered in such forms as are used by Magicians and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers: wherefore designing to take the Priest, who was the Father Provincial of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> and punish him for his Witchcraft, the good man fairly fled, and kept himself out of harms way, until Signior <hi>Balla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino</hi> could quiet the minds of the Turks by some Art, which he more forcibly practised upon them by a stronger charm of money and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents than that which was the subject of their complaint.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time all scars and dangers of <hi>Candia</hi> vanished, because the Turks bent their Forces and chief of their strength against their Enc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at Land: to provide against which, the Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> sent into <hi>Dalmatia</hi> the, Baron <hi>Spaar</hi> for General, with many other Officers under him, namely the Marquess <hi>Maculani,</hi> Count <hi>Ettore Albano, Carlo Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nengo,</hi> and <hi>Roverelli,</hi> Count of <hi>Caudes,</hi> the Cavalier <hi>Grimaldi, Echenfelt,</hi> and others. Into <hi>Friuli, Francisco Morosini</hi> was dispatched in quality of Proveditor General with supreme Power and Authority, and in this manner all matters were as well provided and secured by Land, as they were by Sea.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Biram</hi> chanced to happen out this year towards the end of <hi>April,</hi> by which time the Vizier, and most of his Army, assembled according to Proclamation at <hi>Sophia;</hi> where having continued some time, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted well in what manner to put their designs in execution, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in their March towards <hi>Buda,</hi> and the Confines of <hi>Hungary;</hi> but in the way the Vizier was encountred by a Messenger from the Emperor, offering all reasonable Propositions of Peace, if possibly a stop might be given to the farther progress of that vast and formidable Army. All matters were proposed which probably might give satisfaction; the Fort of Count <hi>Serini</hi> (the grand eye-sore of the Turks) was proffered to be demolished, with other Conditions which before the March of the Army were never proposed or demanded. But the Vizier gave little ear to these fair Overtures, but proceeded forwards in his Demands, as he did in his March: requiring now, not the demolishment of the Fort, but the surrender of it entirely with all the Strength, Artillery, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition into the hands of the Grand Signior. Had this condition been granted, it is probable the desires and pretensions of the Turks would not have stopped here, but have risen, as the spirits of their Enemies had condescended, and exceeded all the hopes and advantage which they imagined probable and feasible to be obtained by the War. Wherefore this Message proving fruitless, the Bringer of it was permitted licence to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98602:113"/>
return into <hi>Germany:</hi> But the Resident was refused dismission, being detained in the Turkish Camp, as an Instrument to mediate a Peace, when both sides should grow weary of the War.</p>
                     <p>About this time the Tartars were greatly infested by the Cosacks, who were then very formidable and strong, approaching near the City of <hi>Osac,</hi> the Key and chief Fortress of <hi>Tartary,</hi> under the Command of a<note place="margin">The Cosacks insest the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars.</note> Fisherman of the <hi>Boristhenes,</hi> who having had great successes, and colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted a considerable sum of money, became a dangerous Enemy: By Sea also they commanded absolutely, roving uncontrouled, having a Fleet of Saykes and Gallies near an hundred and fifty Sail, against whom the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar <hi>Han</hi> or King of <hi>Tartary</hi> craved of the Grand Signior forty sail of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies that year to oppose them. But this Force of the Cosacks was soon abated; for it pleased God, that passing out of the <hi>Palus Moeotis</hi> through the narrow passage of <hi>Colchos</hi> into the Black Sea, the best part of this Fleet suffered shipwrack; with which they were so dismayed, that the twelve sail of Gallies (which was the whole Force the Turks could spare this year for that Sea) gave a check to the remainder, and forced them again to the Banks of the <hi>Boristhenes.</hi> The rest of the Turkish Fleet, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, together with the Beys Gallies, in all but of thirty Sail, departed from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> with design rather to make some appearance of a Fleet, and noise amongst their own people, and collect the Contributions of the Isles in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> than out of hopes of effecting any thing against the Venetians, and so it succeeded; for this Fleet remained the whole Summer at <hi>Mytilene,</hi> not daring to appear abroad for fear of the Enemy.</p>
                     <p>Though the Tartars were so hardly beset by the Cosacks, yet their danger at home was not a sufficient excuse to disingage them from their assistance in the. War of <hi>Hungary.</hi> For the Vizier marching towards the Frontiers, sent one Messenger after the other to hasten the Tartar <hi>Han</hi> with all speed possible to the Wars. But the Tartars seeming not so willing, or so ready as the Turks expected, more positive commands, and severe threats, were dispatched than before, that laying aside all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses or delays, they should with all the Force of their Country attend in this present War against the Emperour, or otherwise the Tartar <hi>Han</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The Tartar un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to go to the War.</note> was to be deprived of his Government, and his Son constituted in his place. These severe menáces reduced the Tartar to great straits; fearful he was to displease the Sultan, not knowing what ill consequences might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from thence; but more apprehensive he was of the approaches of the Cosacks, and of the displeasure of his own People, who were resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to see this fire of War extinguished in their own homes, before they would attend the designs, or satisfie the lusts of a stranger Prince. In this Dilemma the Tartar <hi>Han</hi> finding himself, made use of fair words and promises, ingaging his word, That after the harvest was past, no obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle should prevent his compliance with the Sultans expectations; for at present it was impossible, in regard that should their people at this sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son be diverted srom gathering the harvest, the Corn and Fruit would remain on the ground, and so occasion a Famine, and destruction of their Country. And herein the Tartar had some reason; for these people go not to the Wars, as other Nations, who leave a sufficient number behind to cultivate their Country, and perform all other Offices and Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in a Common-wealth: but these making their chief livelihood <note place="margin">The course of lis: amongst the Tartars.</note> and subsistence on the prey and robberies they make on their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98602:113"/>
as many as resolve to eat Bread and live, who are men not old or impotent, able to bear Arms, betake themselves to their Horse and Bow, so that when their Army is abroad, their Towns and Villages are only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, and defended by their Women. But the Turk whose desires are never satisfied with reasons, or withstood by words, or with any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the execution of his Commands, dispatched another Message more <note place="margin">They are threatned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</note> full of threats and resolution than formerly, carried by the Embrahor, or Master of the G. Signiors Horse, menacing nothing but Fire, and Sword, and Destruction, to the <hi>Han</hi> and his Country, if he longer delayed to perform his Duty. But by this time the Harvest being almost gathered, and their fears against the Cossacks partly extinguished, the Tartar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised with all expedition an Army of seventy thousand men, under the Conduct of the Prince his eldest Son, who whilst they were putting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in order, and assembling for the War; reports were murmured, as <note place="margin">They send an Army into <hi>

The Sultan who sets a small value on the Lives and Estates of his Christian Subjects, judged this Proposition but reasonable, so long as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these terms he might obtain the benesit of the Tartars assistance, who are the best Horse to forage, destroy, and make desolate a Country.</p>

To this City also was this <hi>Kuzlir</hi> Aga exiled, who in the enjoyment of his Office for several years, had amassed a most vast Wealth, incredible to be spoken, and much to be wondred, that a Negro, whose hue and person is contemptible amongst all, whom God hath created of a Colour different from those who partake more of Light, and are of nearer similitude with the Sun, and Nature of an Angel, one whose Original was a Slave, and his price never above a hundred Pieces of Eight, should be loaded with such Goods of Fortune, and enriched with the Treasury of a Prince: His Retinue consisted of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 900 Horse, (besides Camels, and Mules for his Baggage) amongst which a hundred were led Horses, worth seven or eight hundred Dollars a

Horse, and that he might still seem to live by his Princes Bounty, a thousand Aspers a day was to be his constant pay, to be issued out of the G. Signiors Revenue in <hi>Egypt;</hi> by which we may in part calculate the greatness of this Empire, when so vast Richesse is accounted but a reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able proportion for so vile and mean a Slave: Howsoever the G. Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors Treasury suffers little hereby, for this wealth and pomp is but lent him to keep, and look on; he is uncapable to make a Testament, or consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute an Heir; the G. Signior himself succeeding to all the Estate he hath given him, and the improvement of it. This Negro being proceeded as far as to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> had his Companion the Baltagibashee, recalled from him with design to be put to Death, but afterwards by mediation of some powerful Friends, who took advantage of the gentle and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign humour of the Sultan, his pardon was obtained, and he preferred to a small <note n="*" place="margin">Government of a Pasha.</note> Pashalick in the lesser <hi>Asta.</hi> Howsoever the Eunuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in his Journey to <hi>Grand cairo,</hi> where being arrived, after three Days, was by the Imperial Command stript of all his wealth and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which amounted unto two Millions of Dollars, to be restored again to their sirst Master, who uses to lend his Slaves such gaieties and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, only to afford the World occasion to see and admire the vast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Wealth, and contemplate the vanity and unconstancy of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esse and Worldly glory. This poor Negro thus devested of all, returned to his primary condition of a Slave, in which he was born, and for many years had lived, and was now banished, forsaken, and disconsolate in the upper <hi>Egypt;</hi> whither going scarce with sussicient to preserve him from Famine and Beggery, the Beyes of <hi>Egypt,</hi> out of compassion, bestowed on him an Alms of twelve Purses, being eight thousand four hundred Dollars, according to the Account of <hi>cairo,</hi> now the only. support and sustenance of his Life.</p>
                        <p>This Victory gained over these great Personages, and foyl given to the Queen Mother herself, was not carried by this young Favourite with that prudent equality of mind as was decent; but being puffed up with pride and glory, adventured to a judgment and censure of the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est matters of State, which touched not a little the jealousie and scorn of the Great Vizier, who therefore wrote to all those grave Sages, to whose Counsel he conceived the Sultan gave any car or credit; represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with extraordinary passion and fervency the dangers he apprehended might befal his Master, and his Empire, whilst both were subject to the unexperienced Counsels of <hi>Asan,</hi> a Youth both in years and knowledge. That it was much to the disparagement of the Supreme Office of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier, whilst he was with thousands of Turks on the Frontiers contending for the Glory and Enlargement of the Ottoman Dominions, subjected to millions of dangers and labours; to be supplanted by a Boy, sit only for an attendant in his Masters Chambers; and to have the privacy of the Emperours State Counsels and policy rilled by a Youth, whose years had not sitted him for the knowledge and continence of an ordinary Secret. These reasonable Complaints of the Vizier's were by some of his wise Friends, whose Age and Gravity had produced something of Reverence towards their Persons, not without hazard and fear communicated unto the Sultan, the violence of whose Love being with time moderated and abated, he began to consider the reasonableness of this Discourse, and so on a sudden, to the great admiration of all, cast off his Favourite, creating him a Kapugibashee, or chief Porter, with a hundred and sifty Aspers a day Sallary.</p>

                        <head>The Ruine of <hi>Samozadè,</hi> the Reis Effendi, or Chief Secretary of State to the Great Vizier.</head>
                        <p>AND since we have related a Story which partly represents the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy and tyranny of the Turkish Greatness, it may yet please the Reader, should we add another, though a little out of its due order, not less remarkable, and worthy of Record than the former.</p>
                        <p>When <hi>Newhausel</hi> was besieged, called by the Turks and Hungarians <hi>Oymar,</hi> and divers attempts made on it in vain; <hi>Samozadè</hi> the Reis Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendi, with less caution and wisdom than he did usually practise in other matters, wrote a Letter to the Chief Eunuch of the Women, then in the Seraglio at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> to this effect. That if the Grand Signior desired to have that Fortress taken that was then besieged, he should chuse a more able Captain for his Army than the present Vizier, a person who had only been educated in a Tekeh, or Colledge, and studied in the speculations of Law, and not in the Oda's of the Janisaries, or Customes and Exercises of the Camp: and therefore if his Majesty thought fit to chuse another General, he could not cast his eyes on any more able and deserving than <hi>Ibrahim</hi> Pasha his Son in Law, a Person qualified for the Office of Vizier, being skilful in all points both of War and Peace. This Eunuch being the person that had succeeded to the former lately exiled, having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this Letter, immediately without farther Art or Prologue, read it to the Grand Signior, at which though at first he was startled, yet not as yet weary of the Vizier, but still conserving a kindness and esteem for him, took the Letter from the Eunuch, and sent it to the Vizier, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting him to inflict what punishment he judged most agreeable to his own preservation and vindication of his honour. The Vizier having received this Letter, seemed not in the least to be surprized with the perfidiousness of <hi>Samozadè,</hi> but in a cool temper recollecting all the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications and Addresses (which we have mentioned before) at his first entrance into this Supreme Office, and judging from thence, that he was not a person capable of friendship, or a steadiness to his Interest, sent for him, and for <hi>Ibrahim</hi> Pasha his Son in Law to his presence, and first ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upbraided his Treachery, and want of Integrity, in return to all the Caresses and Endeavours he had used to win his Faith, caused both their heads to be struck off by the Executioner.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Samozadè</hi> was one of the most wise and best practised Secretaries of State that ever served the Ottoman Empire, and one whom our English much lamented, being perfectly acquainted with the particulars of our Capitulations, and Constitution of our Trade; and had not his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Covetousness blemished his other moral Vertues, he might have been esteemed a man rare, and a Minister not unworthy the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Monarch of the World. The Richesse he had collected during the time of his State Negotiations were incredible and immense, for he spared and lost no opportunity of gains, which rendred him the more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and obnoxious to the stroke of Justice. His Goods were now seised on for service of the Sultan, his Master, as justly confiscated for Treason, his Estate was found to amount unto three millions of Pieces of Eight in ready money; He had sixteen hundred Camels, four hundred Mules, six hundred Horses of the best sort, besides ordinary Horses of service
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98602:115"/>
proportionable to those of value. In his Chests and Stores were found four thousand Girdles, or Sashes of the best sort of Silver, never worn; seven and twenty pounds weight of Pearl, three hundred Daggers (or Turkish Hanjars) most set with Diamonds and Rubies, besides ninety Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Vests, each whereof might be valued at a thousand Dollars; His Swords and rich Furniture were without number, or account, with a Cart Load of the best and finest <hi>China;</hi> over and above all this remained to his Son a Revenue of about ten pounds Sterling a day, who being condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the torture to confess the hidden Riches of his Father, at his first examination discovered one hundred and twenty five thousand Zaichins of Venetian Gold.</p>

                        <head>Of an Avania brought upon the Dutch Nation.</head>
                        <p>BEfore we proceed on with the Relation of the War in <hi>Hungary,</hi> where we for a time shall leave the Great Vizier, it will not be from our purpose to digress a little in recounting certain intermediate Accidents, which had reference to our own and the Dutch Nations In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest at the Ottoman Court. And first I shall begin with the Dutch, to whom a considerable trouble and misfortune befel, by means of a ship of theirs called the Emperour <hi>Octaviano,</hi> which designing to lade Turks Goods at <hi>Alexandria</hi> for <hi>Constantinople,</hi> had her Licence and Dispatches obtained by means of the Holland Resident, the Sieur <hi>Warnero.</hi> This ship being accordingly laden at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> whereon also the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior himself had thirty thousand Dollars Interest, and being ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, was near the Port surprized by the Venetian, and Maltese Corsairs, and so taken. This News was posted over land from Grand <hi>Cairo,</hi> and the Cargo sent of the Goods, importing fourscore and four thousand Dollars, which in the Month of <hi>June</hi> arrived at <hi>Constantinople.</hi> The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons interested in this loss being many, in the nature of a Tumult applied themselves to the Grand Signior, and demanded sentence against the Dutch Resident for reparation, alledging that he had recommended the ship, and Commander, who had combined with the Corsairs to surprize him, and that the Resident had engaged for the faithfulness of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain, who had betrayed their Goods, not endeavouring to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so much as by the shot of one Musket. The Grand Signior being likewise concerned herein himself, was easily perswaded to grant his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Sentence, That the loss of all should concern the Dutch Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and his Nation, requiring the Chimacam of <hi>Constantinople</hi> to sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon the Resident, and intimate his pleasure therein, exacting a time limited for the payment. The Resident being called to several Audien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereupon, denied to have had any hand in the employment of this ship on this Voyage, and that their Capitulations, to which the Grand Signior had sworn, acquitted him from being responsible for the misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of any of his Nation, for whose fidelity and good behaviour he had never personally engaged, and thereupon positively refused to make himself liable for payment of this money, to which he was neither obliged by the Law of Nations, nor his own private Act. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, the Turks sentenced the Resident to be liable to make satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; in regard that when the ship was first freighted, he appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98602:116"/>
the Chimacam at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and being asked whether the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of this Ship was an honest man, and one who might be intrusted with such a concernment of the Turks; his Answer was, That he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved he might, and that he was always esteemed faithful and honest to his Trust: which in the Turkish Law amounting to as much as if he had said, he would become his security, the Grand Signior consirmed the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer sentence against the Resident, and with haste and sury dispatched a Kapugibashee to bring his person to <hi>Adrianople;</hi> where being arrived, and continuing as yet constant to his first Answer, was committed to custody of the Chaousbashee, or Chief of the Pursuivants, where they gave him time until after the Feast of the little <hi>Biram,</hi> to consult his own good and security of his Nation within the Turkish Dominions. The Feast was no sooner ended, but the Grand Signior sent immediately to know his ultimate resolution, declaring, That if he continued still ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate against his Power, he had commanded that he should be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to that Dungeon which had some few years before been the Lodging of other Christian Ministers. The Resident terrified at the thoughts of such an Imprisonment, declined from his former constancy, ingaging to pay the money in an hundred and five days time, for no longer would be granted; so violent and unreasonable the Turks were in their demands against the Law of Nations, the particular Capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the common reason and justice of the World. This money was for the most part taken up by the Dutch Nation in <hi>Turkie</hi> at In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, and afterwards the debt extinguished by money lent them by the States, for payment of which a particular Imposition was granted on all Goods brought from <hi>Turkie,</hi> until the debt to them was cleared with an Interest of one <hi>per cent.</hi> for the year. By which it may be observed, how little are esteemed the persons of Christian Representatives in the Turkish Court; who having proved with what tameness some Princes have taken the affronts offered to the person of their Ambassadour in former times, and now observing with what patience the States of <hi>Holland</hi> have sustained the like insolence and injury in their Resident, they may possibly profess their Function sacred, but yet in matters of their own interest will never be induced to vouchsafe them that respect or just treatment which is due to them.</p>

                        <p>IN the preceding year we declared how a Peace was concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Algier:</hi> for better confirmation whereof, and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our Merchants Estates in the <hi>Levant,</hi> upon occasion of a future breach, it was judged necessary by His Majesties Council, That the respective Articles last made and concluded with <hi>Algier, Tunis,</hi> and <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poli</hi> should be distinctly described and ratified by the Grand Signior, with this Clause at the conclusion of each, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                           <q>That in case the foregoing Articles were not kept by these his Subjects respectively, but should contrary to the meaning thereof through Piracy be broken, that then
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98602:116"/>
it should be lawful for the King of <hi>England</hi> to chastise those people by his own Arms and Force, without impeachment or breach of that good Peace and Amity which intervenes between His Majesty of Great <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> and the Ottoman Emperour:</q> And this was supposed might always be a Plea in defence of the English Nation in <hi>Turkie,</hi> when at any time His Majesty provoked by the injuries of those faithless and piratical Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, should take due revenge upon them, not only on the Seas, but also on the Land, subverting those very Cities and Fortresses, which are the Nests of Piracies, and the common chastisement and Gaols of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. When these Articles came to the hands of His Majesties Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour the Earl of <hi>Winchelsea,</hi> with Orders to have them ratified and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in the manner foregoing, the Turkish Court was then at <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> to which place on this occasion the Lord Ambassadour made a journey from his usual Residence at <hi>Constantinople;</hi> and having acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Chimacam</hi> with the whole matter, and the Propositions rightly apprehended by him, they were offered, and the next day communicated in behalf of the Ambassadour to the Grand Signior, who readily promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed compliance with His Majesties desires, ordering the Articles, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of them, to be ingrossed and prepared for the Imperial assent. Howsoever some considerable time ran on before they were delivered out, in regard that being matters of State relating to War and Peace, they could not be fully granted without privity and knowledge of the Grand Vizier, who was the supreme Counsellour, and therefore we were forced to attend thirty five days before an Express could go and return from the Frontiers with the Answer expected, which was as easily granted by the Vizier, as before it was entertained by the Grand Signior. On <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust 5.</hi> the Confirmation of the several aforesaid Articles were consigned unto my self in presence of our Lord Ambassadour by the hands of the <hi>Chimacam,</hi> being my self designed in person to deliver them; for which service a Frigate of His Majesties Navy attended at <hi>Smyrna:</hi> so that very evening I departed, and arrived at <hi>Smyrna</hi> the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>August.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In my Journey from <hi>Adrianople</hi> to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> omitting the Geography of the Countries, and the pleasant view I had from the top of a Mountain between <hi>Malagra</hi> and <hi>Gallipoli,</hi> from whence I could survey all the <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lespont,</hi> and at the same time take a prospect of the Propontick and Ionian Seas, I shall only relate two passages which befel me in this Journey, not: unpleasant to be remembred.</p>
                        <p>The first was at a small Village called <hi>Isheclé,</hi> at the foot of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Ida,</hi> not far from the Ancient <hi>Troy,</hi> now named by the Turks <hi>Kauz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dog,</hi> which signifies the Mountain of Geese; the people that inhabit here are of a rude disposition, great Thieves, and of a wild and savage na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; at my entry thereupon I was advised by those that were with me, that it was necessary to take Mules to carry my Baggage through the Mountains, and to press the people to convoy me to the next Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by virtue of a Command the Grand Signior had granted me for the security of my Travels; so that arriving at this place by break of day, I went directly with all my Attendance, being about eighteen or nineteen Horse to the Kadi's House, where knocking hard at the door, a Servant looked out at the window, and spying so great a company, wholly affrighted, ran to his Master, and awakening him with such dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful news, he had scarce any soul or life remaining to render an answer; for he was one of those, who three times a day was used to take his
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98602:117"/>
Dose of Opium, which gave him a strange kind of intoxication or drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness; during the operation of which, men have their spirits violently moved and agitated, that afterwards it leaves them so wearied and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid, that in the morning when they first awake, they remain like dead stocks, their members are benumbed, and can scarce turn from one side to the other. In this condition the News of new Guests surprized this Kadi, when wholly feeble he called to his servant to reach him his Box of Opium, of which when he had taken his usual proportion, and that it began to work, his life returned again to him, and he began immediately to recover, so that he had courage to open his Gates and receive us in: when he had read the Command, and found no hurt in it, the man was transported with joy and Opium, and was so kind, chearful, and of a good humour, that I could not but admire at the change; he told me, that he lived in a barbarous Country, and was forced to use that for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement, and as a remedy of his melancholy hours. I easily perceived the effect it had upon him, for he seemed to me like a Bedlam; in which humour he called all his Neighbours about him, and after a wise consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, they provided me with two Mules, and five men on foot with rusty Muskets without powder or shot to guide and guard me through the Mountains. I had not travelled two miles before all my guard was stollen aside, and taking advantage of the Woods and Mountains were fled from me, so that I found my self with no other than my own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in an unbeaten path, and a way unfrequented; the man excepted who drove the Mules, who for sake of his Beasts was obliged to a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attendance. We travelled in this manner through the Mountains about four hours, when near a Village called <hi>Suratnée,</hi> we met one of the Principal men on Horse-back, carrying a flead Mutton behind him, which upon examination we discovered to be carried for a Bribe to the Kadi of <hi>Isheclee,</hi> that so he would be his Friend, and favour him in his Cause: And farther upon inquiry finding, that our entertainment was likely to be mean at <hi>Suratnée,</hi> we forced the Gentleman to return with us, and to sell us his Mutton at the market-price, and so for that time we disappointed our Kadi of his Fee or reward: and being upon the rise of a Hill descending to <hi>Suratnée,</hi> so that the people could see us at a distance, they like true Sons of <hi>Kauz-dog</hi> forsook their habitations, and fled, which we perceiving posted after them, and catched two of their men, whom we brought under Shart, (or the Country-mans Oath, which they account very sacred, and will by no means break) to be true and faithful to us, to serve, and not leave us for so long time as we should remain in their Village; and accordingly these men were not only serviceable, but diligent: so soon as they discovered me to be one who would pay justly for what I took, and was not a Turkish Aga, or Servant of Great men who harass the people, and take their service and meat on account of free Quarter, the whole Village retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned again from their places of Refuge amidst the Woods, so that I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wanted provisions nor attendance.</p>
                        <p>Another passage happened unto me of better civility and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Plains of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> where not many miles from that ancient City, I arrived about six a clock in the evening at certain Tents or Cots of Shepherds, being only Hurdles covered with Hair-cloth, lined within with a sort of loose Felt, a sufficient defence against the Sun and rain; the Turks call these people Euruchs, and are Shepherds, who with their
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98602:117"/>
wives, children, and cattel live and inhabit, where they most delight, or like the Shepherds of ancient days, remove their dwellings to those places where they find most plenty of water and pasture. Amongst these Cots so soon as I alighted from my Horse, I was received and saluted by the Aga or Chief with great humanity and kindness; for so soon as he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood who I was, and that I was imployed in publick Affairs, he presently placed me under some neighbouring Trees, and called for Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets and Cushions to sit on, which were more fine and rich than agreed with the outward appearance of men wholly unaccustomed to a City-life. After some discourse had with me, which I remember to have been very courteous and inquisitive of my condition and business, he provided Provender for our Horses, and in a short time ordered Bread and Eggs to be brought for to stay my stomach, supposing that hard Travels had sharpened my appetite. About an hour after that, he invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all my company, and then we fed very plentifully of several dishes which the good Houswives had dressed within the Precincts of their poor Tents: whilst the Shepherds had in the field killed a fat Kid, and were then roasting it whole at the fuel of a tree which they had fell'd; this Roast-meat they cut into quarters, and with Bread and Salt put it into a Linen-cloth, delivering it to one of my Servants for our Breakfast the next morning. Having thus well refreshed my self with the charity of these good Shepherds, I arose with the Moon about eleven a clock at night; but before my departure, I demanded what I had to pay: to which the generous Shepherd replied, That my acceptance was a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient payment, for that all men were obliged to be civil and hospitable to men who travelled the World like me for publick service; and withal desired me to speak well, wheresoever I came, of such poor men who led their lives in the sields, who were instructed in these Principles, <hi>viz.</hi> to hurt none, and to be humane and helpful to all mankind.</p>
                        <p>In a few days after my Arrival at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> I imbarked on the <hi>Bonaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> Frigat commanded by Capt. <hi>Berkeley,</hi> afterwards Sir <hi>William Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> and shaping our course first for <hi>Tripoli</hi> in <hi>Barbary,</hi> we came to Anchor <note place="margin">Tripoli.</note> before the Town the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi>: and immediately going ashore, we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to the Presence of the Pasha of that Country, whom I acquainted with the occasion of this Address, delivering into his hands two Copics of the late Treaty of Peace, one confirmed by the Hand and Seal of His Majesty our Gracious Soveraign, and the other of the Sultan; both which he received with singular respect and reverence, promising to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Peace sacred and inviolable; and so being dismissed fairly from him, we speedily repaired on board, and setting sail again that night with a prosperous gale, we anchored in the Bay of <hi>Tunis</hi> on the second <note place="margin">Tunis.</note> of <hi>September:</hi> and the next day being landed, we in the first place madc our Addresses to the Dey, who bears the Office of Prince or Governour in Chief, though in the Arabian Language the word signifies as much as Uncle, to whom I tendred the Confirmations of Peace in the same form and manner as before at <hi>Tripoli:</hi> the Dey received them with respect and honour, promising to continue the Peace; that part which was from our King he received himself; but that which was from the Grand Signior he advised me to deliver to the Pasha; for coming from his Master, it might more nearly concern him than any other: the Pasha ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving seen and read the Hattesheriff, returned it again to the Dey to be placed amongst the Records and Registers of the Divan, and so making a
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98602:118"/>
Visit to all the great men in power, giving them notice of our business, that so none might take exceptions, or judge themselves neglected for want of Addresses; we the same Night departed from <hi>Tunis,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded forward in our Voyage to <hi>Algier.</hi> But before we arrive there, I have time to acquaint the Reader of the pestilential Fever which then affected our whole Ship. When we departed from <hi>Smyrna,</hi> we had four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen sick of the Autumnal Distemper, but before ten Days, we had ninety five out of a hundred and sixty men, which lay sick on their Beds and Hamocks; and we feared so general a weakness, that we should not have had strength sufficient to have Sailed our Ship; for I think there was scarce any amongst us in perfect health. But God shewed his strength in our weakness, so that in ten Days, having buried nine of our men, he was pleased with the change of our Climate, to renew our health, and in Answer to our Prayers, as it were by a Miracle, to restore us to all the Health, and Strength, and Comfort, that we could desire.</p>
                        <p>At <hi>Algier</hi> that Den of Thieves, and Harbour of Faithless Men, and all Impiety, we arrived the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> where immediately with as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of the Consul, we designed to tender the Confirmations of the Peace unto the Divan; then the supreme and absolute power. But whilst we imagined the Peace firm, and improbable, that those Articles which were concluded and agreed but the last Year, should so easily and soon be forgotten; we found the Scene of affairs greatly altered, and sears of an unexpected rupture; for the Ships of <hi>Algier</hi> roving in the Seas, had lately sent in nine small English Vessels without a Pass from the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> for want of which, they pretended by a new Agreement they ought to be prize; of which, six by means of the Consul being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased, three only remained under detention at our Arrival; when im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately we applyed our selves to <hi>Shaban</hi> Aga, a Spanish Renegado, then Cape or Chief of their confused Divan; to him we first disclosed the import of our Message, and shewed the Confirmations of our Peace subscribed by the King of <hi>England,</hi> and the G. Signior. After he had read them, a Divan was called, and the Confirmations openly published; at which time, it was assented, and agreed, that the Articles ought to be maintained, and the Peace continued: but to have this established by sirm Authority, it was farther referred to the Great Divan, which is a grand Assembly of the People, who usually meet together every <hi>Saturday</hi> of the Week. In the mean time, having had an acquaintance formerly with the Pasha of this place, sent hither by the G. Signior, we were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to make him a Visit, the better to discover in what nature they honour and own the Ottoman Port: but before we could be admitted to his presence, we were obliged to demand Licence of the Divan, which they granted with some unwillingness, and with the caution of two or three Witnesses of our Discourse. We were scarce welcomed into the room, and the usual salutations passed, before we were interrupted by the Officers, and not suffered to proceed; so little esteem they made of the Pasha, to whom notwithstanding they allowed twelve thousand Dollars a Year for his maintenance, so as to carry the fair and specious outside at the Ottoman Court, of receiving a Pasha from thence; but were so far from permitting him to intermeddle in the Government, that they confined him like a Prisoner, not suffering him to stir abroad without permission and consent of the Divan, and that very seldom, though he often pleaded, his health was much empaired
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98602:118"/>
by his restraint, and craved enlargement, rather for necessity than his pleasure.</p>
                        <p>The Day of the great Divans Assembly being come, the Confirmations of the Peace were again read, and well approved, and so laid up in the Repository of their Writings; and promise made us for releasement of our Ships. But let us now observe the levity and unsteadiness of this popular Government; for being the Day following appointed to receive our dispatches, and discharge of the three Ships; there arose unexpectedly <note place="margin">The uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy of the popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment at <hi>Algier,</hi>
                           </note> at the Divan, certain scruples and jealousies amongst them, which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately quashed all our Negotiations, and instead of confirming the Peace, produced a War. For the Divan being met, they were afraid to release the Ships, lest the Souldiers who had sent them in, being then abroad, should call them to question for it at their return; and not to release them, might be an occasion of a War; which not succeeding according to their desire, the causers thereof might be called into question, and punished for it; of which still remained the fresh memory of late Examples. In this <hi>Dilemma</hi> of their affairs, they resolved to make the Act herein, to be of general and publick assent; and to that end they Assembled a Grand Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van, calling the Captains of Ships and Gallies, then in Port, unto their Council; who without hesitation, or questioning other matters, declared, that the three English Ships were lawful prize; and that it was no longer requisite to maintain the second Article of freeing Strangers goods on English Vessels; it neither being the design nor interest of <hi>Algier,</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesit all Christendom by their Peace with <hi>England:</hi> this Sentence was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the whole rabble of the Divan, with cry and noise; to which, the wiser sort, notwithstanding our Plea, and reasons to the contrary, which lasted for full two hours, were forced to condescend, and concur in the same vote. Howsoever by importunity, and something of the force of reason, which in the most blind and obscure minds of men, hath something of forcible violence; we obtained the release of the three Ships, upon discharge of the strangers goods, and payment of their Freight. But the second Article of Peace, forbidding the search of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Ships, for Strangers Estates or their Persons, was declared null, and no longer to be maintained; nor the Peace likewise, unless his Majesty would accept it upon that condition, to which end, they wrote this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Letter.</p>

                        <p>In this manner a second War broke forth in the space of two Years, by which a person may judge of the inconstancy and unsteady humour of this People; who but three days before, gave us all the evidence of fair correspondence and Friendship; and it is probable, that when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Divan, they came not with resolutions or thoughts of War; however accidents and occasional Discourses each with other, following the cry and humour of some rude Savage person, which leads the rest, carried all things with violence towards a breach: So that by what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded, and from these following reasons, it may be concluded impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to maintain a sirm and lasting Peace with this People.</p>
                        <p>First, Because these people are composed of the worst sort or scum of the Turks, and worst of Christians, which are Renegadoes, who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced God and their Country, and a Generation of people who have no Religion, nor Honour; Peace cannot be longer expected or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, than fear or interest enjoins them to compliance.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The Government of <hi>Algier</hi> being popular, and in the hands of a vile Commonalty, who are ignorant persons, guided by no Rules, or Principles; unsteady in all their Councils, not resolving or consulting any thing before they enter the Divan, do commonly follow that resolution, which they perceive to be carried on with the greatest noise; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are a people not capable of Peace or Friendship.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, This irrational Commonalty is over-awed by a heady Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery, who are only then affrighted into a Peace, whilst a stronger force compells them into good manners. But when that power and punishment is withdrawn, they again harden their hearts like <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and then when the temptation of rich Merchant men presents it self, their natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Piracy returns, and their Covetousness again prevails, and then they curse the Peace, and the makers of it, and without remorse break their Articles, and their Faith, having neither honour, nor Conscience to restrain them. Wherefore unless the Heads of the chief Causers of the War be given in satisfaction, or money paid for the expence, and Hosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges given for security of it, it can never be expected that a lasting Peace should be maintained with this people; the proof of which, hath been made appear by the sequel of affairs, and by those Wars which have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued since this time. And now let us return to the Wars in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and become Spectators of those Transactions, which were then the general concernment of the Eastern and Western World.</p>

                           <hi>The Proceedings of the War in</hi> Hungary.</head>
                        <p>WE left the Grand Vizier on his March towards the parts of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> with an Army, as computed, to consist of eighty thousand fighting men, and of about seventy thousand designed for Pioniers, and other necessary services of the Army. In this march the Vizier out of <note place="margin">The Vizier de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires a Treaty to amuse the Christians.</note> design to slacken the Warlike Preparations of the Christians, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the inclinations of the Emperour to Peace, desired a Treaty, that if possible, matters might be reduced to terms of accommodation. The Resident of <hi>Germany,</hi> was then in the Army, but he, not being impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered singly for any such Treaty, the Baron of <hi>Goez,</hi> then with <hi>Ali</hi> Pasha at <hi>Temeswar</hi> was sent for, and being arrived, were both called into the Viziers Tent at <hi>Belgrade,</hi> to whom it was proposed, That in Case the Emperour desired a Peace, he should resign into the hands and possession of the Sultan <hi>Zekelhyd, Zatmar, Clausenburg</hi> aliàs <hi>Colosvar,</hi> with the late built Fort of Count <hi>Serini,</hi> without which, no Sacrifice could appease the anger, and give a stop to the progress of the Ottoman Armes. Whilst these Propositions by Post were dispatched to <hi>Vienna,</hi> the Vizier proceeded in his Journey to <hi>Strigonium,</hi> now called <hi>Gran,</hi> to which place, after six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Days time, the Messenger returned with an answer from the Emperour, which showed an inclination towards an acceptance of Peace on the terms proposed, but with instructions to his Ministers to moderate by their discreet mannagement (what was possible) the rigour of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. For by reason of the disaffection of the Hungarians, whom the Emperour had lately disgusted by demolishing several of their Churches, and discountenancing the Protestant Religion which they professed; and by reason of the phlegm of the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> whom different in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests made slow and unactive in their preparations against the common Enemy; the Emperour was wholly unprovided to oppose the violence of this over-flowing Torrent, and became an unequal match for the Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman Force. The Turks perceiving that the Germans began to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend, and yield to any conditions, which might purchase their quiet, started a farther demand of fifty thousand Florins of Yearly Tribute, and <note place="margin">This Tribute was paid by the Emperour to Sultan <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
                           </note> two Millions of Crowns for expence of the War, to be paid by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to the Sultan. These proud and unexpected Proposals startled not a little the Baron of <hi>Goez,</hi> who readily made answer, that he clearly perceived now, that there were no intentions to a Peace, since the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier was pleased to make the matter so difficult and impossible, for that it were as easy to bring Heaven and Earth to meet, as his Master to meet the G. Signior in the Concession of this particular. These extravagant demands awakened the Imperial Court, who now observing the Turks without their Vizard, to march hastily to surprize them, vigorously rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed themselves to make that convenient provision and defence by War, which the straitness of time permitted them: so that in the first place they Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled a Diet at <hi>Ratisbonne,</hi> where it was resolved to raise four Armies; the first for the Guard and defence of <hi>Moravia</hi> and <hi>Silesia,</hi> under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Count <hi>Susa,</hi> a Native of <hi>Rochel.</hi> The second under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Count <hi>Raimond Montecuculi,</hi> for safety of <hi>Rab, Newhausel,</hi> and <hi>Komora,</hi> and the Frontiers of <hi>Hungary.</hi> The third under Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Count <hi>Nicholas Serini</hi> for defence of <hi>Croatia.</hi> The fourth
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:98602:120"/>
composed solely of Hungarians, commanded by the Palatine of that Country, which they reported to consist of thirty thousand fighting men. Fifthly, It was ordered that all Garisons should be well provided of Victuals and Ammunition; and that the Inhabitants of <hi>Vienna</hi> should take into every house a provision for a years maintenance, and such as were not able at their own Cost, were to abandon their Dwellings. And in the mean time the Villages round about were demolished, to the great amazement and confusion of the people.</p>
                        <p>The Turks now bearing in their thoughts nothing but War, began to design and chalk out the best order and method for its prosecution. The principal places then in eye of the Vizier, were <hi>Raab,</hi> and <hi>Komorra,</hi> Fortresses of considerable strength, maintained and defended by Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of known prowess and conduct, and provided equally with all sorts of Ammunition and Provisions, agreeable to such considerable Bulwarks and Walls, not only of the German Empire, but (I may say) of all Christendom. <hi>Raab,</hi> called by the Italians <hi>Javarin,</hi> and by the Turks <note place="margin">Raab.</note> 
                           <hi>Yanick,</hi> is scituated in a plain, level, and Champion Country; the Town it self very regular and compact, the Fortifications most exact according to the new model, and much improved in its strength since the recovery of it from the hands of the Turk, by whom it was once taken, in the year 1594. it hath its name from the River <hi>Rab,</hi> on which it is seated just on the meeting of the <hi>Danube. Komorra</hi> is a stronger Fortress, erected in an Island of the River <hi>Danube,</hi> called after the same name, which hath <note place="margin">Komorra.</note> often been attempted by the Turks, but with ill success; at both which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I have personally been, and viewed them with much delight. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Vizier considering the strength and difficulty of these places, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to take due and mature consideration before he engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in any enterprize, and to that end assembled together in Consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with him the most ancient aud grave men, that were Natives of the Country; some of these being such who had lived in <hi>Rab,</hi> been Slaves there, and had well marked and observed the strength of that Fortress <note place="margin">The Turks de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate of the Method to be used in the war.</note> both as to Nature and Art, assured the Vizier, That the Work was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense, difficult, and dangerous, and not to be accomplished in the space of one Summer; and that the Winters in that Countrey were very cold and rigid, and ill agreeing with the temperament of the Asiatick Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery. The Vizier, though he farther considered that his Souldiers were as yet young and unexperienced, and that a foyl encountred at the first Enterprize, might be a discouragement from following the continued Tract and Course of this War, which must be sustained with labour and patience, and that to withdraw his Forces in the Winter would be a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to the Ottoman Armes, a blemish in the beginning to his own Reputation, and an encouragement of the Enemy: Howsoever, having a violent Ambition and Desire to become Master of <hi>Rab,</hi> he could not rest satisfied in this Counsel before he had consulted with <hi>Ali</hi> Pasha, and other Pashaws of the Frontier Countries, who duly considering the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as it stood, concurred in the same judgment that was formerly made of the difficulty of this design; and herein they were the more strongly confirmed, by the report of certain Hungarians, whom some parties of Horse, under the Command of <hi>Ali</hi> Pasha, roving and sallying out near the Walls of <hi>Rab,</hi> had surprized and taken, who being brought bound before the Vizier, related, That the Town was well provided with all sorts of Ammunition and Provisions, and the Garison reinforced by
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98602:120"/>
Count <hi>Montecuculi</hi> with supply of four thousand men, and in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner reported the Work as difficult as the Turks of the Countrey had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly signified. This relation confirmed by so many hands, diverted the Vizier from this Design; for before that time imagining it a place which might easily be subdued, he proposed to himself, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, a clear and undisturbed March to the Gates of <hi>Vienna,</hi> which he swallowing also in his thoughts, hoped by his own success to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the shame of <hi>Solyman's</hi> flight from the Walls of that City, and besides the Glory of forcing the Emperour from his Imperial Seat, he should attone for the sin of the Ottoman Cowardice, and be the first who undertook to mend the actions, and outvie the prowess of the most magnificent, and most successful of their Sultans. But the Ambition of this grand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign giving way to necessity, and to those other impediments which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed it, after due and mature Consultation, <hi>Newhausel,</hi> called by the <note place="margin">Newhausel.</note> Hungarians <hi>Oywar,</hi> was sixed upon as the place to be first attempted, and held up to the eye of the Souldiery, as the reward and prize of their valour and hazard. Wherefore Boats were provided, and Planks, and Timbers for a Bridge to pass the <hi>Danube,</hi> which the Turks in a few days, according to their usual expeditions, had raised; so that the Army both Horse and Foot began to transport themselves as fast as was possible to the other side, but the multitudes crouded over in that disorder and hast, that three or four thousand men had scarce passed the River before the Bridge was so broken and shattered, that some time was necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to repair it, before the rest of the Army durst adventure to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Companions. The Approach of the Turkish Army alarmed all that side of <hi>Hungary,</hi> but especially the Inhabitants of <hi>Newhausel;</hi> who observing the Turks to bend their Course that way, plainly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw the Storm of War to be breaking on them: the News also of the fall of the Bridge, and thereby the Separation of about four thousand Turks from the Body of the Army, was brought in by the Country peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who forsaking their Villages fled for succour to the stronger Fortress of <hi>Newhausel.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Forcatz,</hi> the Governour of <hi>Newhausel,</hi> a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Forcatz</hi> the Governour of <hi>Newhausel,</hi> ill advises a Sally.</note> and experienced Souldier, though esteemed by the Turks unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, taking this Alarm, judged that this occasion of cutting off that part of the Turkish Army which had past the River, was in no wise to be omitted, and therefore assembled a Council of War, which consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all the principal Officers and Commanders of the Garison; (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst which was Colonel <hi>Volter,</hi> that commanded the four thousand men, lately sent to reinforce the Town) he declared that his opinion was, Immediately to make a Sally on that part of the Turkish Army, which had already passed the River, before the Bridge was repaired for Transportation of the others; which endeavours, by Gods Assistance, succeeding well, might not only discourage the Enemy, but be a means to divert them from their present design upon their City. This Advice, though he pressed with heat of Argument, and violence of Speech, yet could it not prevail with the rest of the Council, which seemed wholly averse thereunto, especially <hi>Volter</hi> who declared, That his Commission was not to fight in the Field, but to conserve himself within the Walls, for maintenance of his Garison: Some days passed in this Dispute, whilst <hi>Forcatz</hi> growing more eager and hot on this design, used opprobrious Terms, and expressions of infamy towards the other Officers, accusing all such of Cowardice and Treason, who refused to concurr with him in
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98602:121"/>
this Enterprize and advantage on the Enemy, which Heaven seemed to reach out to them for their Deliverance, if their wisedom and courage afforded them only will and grace to lay hold on the opportunity. These sharp words and resolution of the Governour provoked the minds of the Officers to a condescension, and thereupon about eight thousand men of Choice, and approved Souldiers, well armed with stout hearts, and hard Iron; not suffering themselves to be upbraided with such reproach, in the silence of the Night, under the Conduct of <hi>Forcatz,</hi> (their own Commander <hi>Volter</hi> remaining in the Town) took their way towards the Turkish Camp, and being armed with Firelocks, marched with all priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, without lighted Matches, or sound of Drum or Trumpet. But whilst the foregoing Dispute lasted, the Turks had transported the gross of their Army over the River, and then lay on her Banks, resting securely under their Pavillions. The Christians approaching near the Turkish Camp, <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Forcatz</hi> surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the Turkish Camp.</note> with the first twilight, and dawning of the Morning, (perceiving the Enemy unprovided, but not discovering their Force) dealt at first on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set, their shot most plentifully amongst them, and proceeding amidst the thickest, cutting, shooting, killing, and making havock of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. The amazed Turks having many of their Companions brought to their last sleep, before themselves were throughly awake, and some flying before they discovered the reason or the danger, an Alarm was given by the confused murmur of <hi>Allah, Allah,</hi> and that the Christians were upon them, reached the farthest Quarters of the Turkish Army, which immediately put themselves into Battalia, and order of fighting, whilst this handful of Germans proceeded forwards, dealing their blows amongst their Enemies, cutting the Cords of the Tents, and destroying all before them. But by this time the Turks having put themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a posture of Defence, the Horse and Foot came marching in a Body, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending their Wings in the form of a half Moon, so as to enclose this small number, and on all sides to assail them. The Germans seeing this formidable sight approach, and no safety in flight, encouraged each other <note place="margin">The Germans are routed, and fly.</note> to sell their Lives at as dear a rate as they could; all hopes of escape seeming desperate, they fought with that courage and obstinacy as ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed the Turks, and yielded not until their Spirits fainted with labour, and their Swords were blunted by the Bodies of their Enemies. The Count <hi>Forcatz</hi> hardly escaped, but by the help of his Horse, with some few others, fled to <hi>Newhausel,</hi> which unwillingly received him, wishing that the rashness of his Counsels had only proved his own destruction, and not involved so many brave and innocent Souldiers, who were only unfortunate for being over-powered by his command and perswasions: The rest overwhelmed with multitudes yielded; for though they beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themselves beyond the power and courage of men, yet the numbers of the Enemy prevailed at length over these Christian Champions, whose Gallantry was more eminent and conspicuous in being subdued, than the Glory of their Enemies in the Victory. In this Skirmish few escaped, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst which four hundred Gentlemen were slain, and about eighteen hundred Prisoners reported to be taken, a bad Omen at the beginning of this War. This Rout being given, the Turks triumphed in Blood, <note place="margin">The Vizier deals not like a Souldier with his Prisoners of War.</note> and success, and returned with their Captives, and Trophies back to <hi>Stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonium,</hi> where the Vizier mounting a Throne of State and Majesty, treated these valiant Souldiers, not like men of War, or Captives taken in open Field, but as a Judge condemned them to dye by the hand of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:98602:121"/>
the Hang-man or Executioner, passing a formal Sentence of Death upon them, as if they had been Thieves or Assasinates arrested by the hand of Justice. The Sentence being passed, and the Turkish Army drawn up, these valiant Christians were ranked in order and sile to dye, who had so lately with Swords in their hands, ranged themselves in Battle against their Enemy; and so soon as the Executioners fell to their work, and the horrid Massacre was begun, the Guns were fired, and the whole Camp resounded with barbarous Musick and shouts. In the mean while the most superstitious amongst them triumphed, that God was now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying the Infidels, manifesting the truth of their Prophet, and doing his own work; not unlike the assertions and doctrines of those Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to Religion, who have always hallowed and excused their cruelties with the Name of God, and sanctified the blood they have shed by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their Enemies <hi>Amalekites,</hi> and by pretence of false Lights and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies countenanced their most impious Sacriledge in Gods Churches, and Invasions of their Neighbours Rights. The merciless Executioners had proceeded to bereave of life about thirteen or fourteen hundred persons, the Vizier standing a Spectator with zeal to his Sect and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, until the Turkish Souldiery who inhabit the Borders, glutted with so much cruelty towards their Neighbours began to murmur, and at length to speak aloud, That to destroy Captives in cold blood was an action against the Law of Arms, and might be revenged by their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with like examples of cruelty, since none there present, being all Souldiers, were secure from the misfortunes and mutabilities of War. The Vizier over-hearing these whispers of the Souldiery, gave a stop to the cruelty of the Executioners, and sent such as survived to different Prisons in <hi>Buda, Adrianople,</hi> and <hi>Constantinople.</hi> I have seen not far from <hi>Strigonium</hi> the heads of these Wretches thus miserably butchered, thrown up into a heap, the beards and hair of those that lay undermost still growing; the earth which sucked in their blood, became thence stenched up and barren, and the white bones and carkasses of their bodies lay dispersed and scattered in a large field; so that I could not but call to mind the massacred Legions under the Conduct of <hi>Quintilius Varus</hi> in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi> and those <hi>albentia ossa,</hi> and the barbarous Altars flowing with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man blood; and I could as passionately fancy to have seen the angry Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans return to appease the Ghosts of their Country-men with decent Burial, as I was sensible of <hi>Germanicus</hi> his zeal, when he adventured to contaminate his Augurs Office by his too forward Humanity and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion towards his Country and Parentage. But this cruelty of the Vizier was recompensed by Count <hi>Serini</hi> not long after, who having had some success against <hi>Arnaut</hi> Basha and his Army of whom he had slain six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, and such as he took alive, in cold blood he dismembred and tortured, and having of some cut off their hands, and plucked out their eyes, sent them to report the reason of this inhumane and merciless usage to the Vizier.</p>

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98602:122"/>
                           <hi>Newhausel,</hi> having passed the <hi>Danube,</hi> that certainly they had intercepted this Recruit, had not <hi>Forcatz</hi> amused their minds, and for a while stopped their hasty approach, by advancing a white Flag to the top of the Walls, as if he had had a design of Treaty and Surrender of the Town upon Conditions: so that here the Turkish Army made a halt, and for three or four hours time remained with expectation when Conditions for the Surrender should come; every one wondering to see the Flag of Truce erected, and so much silence in the Fort, and yet no appearance of a Message. In this interval and breathing of time, the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour safely arriving within the Town, the white Flag was changed to colours of defiance, to the great astonishment and anger of the Turks: Whereupon the Vizier drawing somewhat nearer, began to intrench and begirt the Town on the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> which was defended by three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Officers, <hi>viz.</hi> Count <hi>Adam Forcatz,</hi> the Marquess <hi>Pio</hi> an Italian, and one <hi>Lucatelli</hi> an old and experienced Souldier. But the Vizier, before he would offer any violence to the Town, thought sit to summon them in this stile: That through the Grace of God and the Miracles of our Prophet, who is a Son of both Worlds, and by whom there is Happiness <note place="margin">The Turks Summons.</note> and Glory, I that am the first of the Council, and General of the most Mighty Emperour of the Turks, that is the King of all Kings of the Earth, To you <hi>Adam Forcatz</hi> that are the Chief among all the Nobility of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> do make known, That through the Command of my most Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Lord, the most terrible, the most puissant, and most mysterious Emperour, I am come with his Forces before <hi>Newhausel</hi> to reduce it to his Obedience. Wherefore if you shall deliver up the place to Us, you shall have liberty to march out with what belongs unto you from the highest to the lowest, and he that would rather stay shall keep his Goods and Estate: but if you will not yield, we will take it by force, and every man of you, from the highest to the lowest, shall be put to the sword. If the Hungarians did but know the good intentions of the mighty Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, they and their children would bless God for him. Peace be to the obedient. The Christians not submitting to these Summons, the Turks continued to make their nearer approaches, and being now at a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient distance, raised two great Batteries, on which they mounted a hundred Pieces of Cannon, and from thence made such constant shot as shaked the Churches, and almost levelled the most lofty Buildings with their foundations. The 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>August</hi> was designed for a general storm, so that before break of day Faggots and Rubbish were brought to fill the Ditches, and sealing Ladders to ascend the Walls; but though the <note place="margin">The Turks storm the Town.</note> Ottoman Forces were puissant, and their Assault they made fierce and brisk, yet they were received with that gallantry by the Defendants, that the Trenches early in the morning were filled with the carkasses of the dead, and at last the Turks forced to give over the Assault, with the loss of great numbers of their men.</p>
                        <p>The Siege still continuing, and the Turks angry, and inflamed with the disgrace of their late foil, endeavoured to redeem their Honour by their Attempts, filling up the Ditches with Rubbish, serving themselves therein of the Christian Captives lately taken: The Defendants on the other side, by the dictates of Nature and Reason, were directed to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their houses, wives, and children from the rapine and violence of an unjust Enemy; so that both Parties moving from different Principles, used all the Art and Valour possible for destruction each of other: the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98602:122"/>
noise of Cannon from the Forts raised by the Turks, resounded conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in the Air, and from the Town the shot were often so fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately placed, that daily, besides great numbers of ordinary Souldiers, many Persons of Note and Quality amongst the Turks were slain.</p>
                        <p>But the Turks having before this Town a greater number of Souldiers than either could come to sight, or what was thought necessary to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due it, the Vizier selected from his Army a very considerable Force to enter and spoil <hi>Moravia</hi> and <hi>Austria;</hi> of these were 600 Tartars joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">The Turks en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Moravia</hi> and <hi>Austria.</hi>
                           </note> to a strong Force of Turks, who by the guidance of the Natives passing the River <hi>Waegh,</hi> spoiled and destroyed all the Country round about, carrying men, women, and children into slavery, leaving what was not conveniently portable, in ashes. But in passing the River, they incountred a considerable Body of Germans, both Horse and Foot, and being opposed by them, were at first forced to retreat again over the River with the loss of about eight hundred Janisaries; but the next day renewing the Fight with better courage and success, passed the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in despight of the Imperialists, whom they pursued almost as far as <hi>Presburg.</hi> These Turks were seconded by a greater Body of Tartars, every one after the manner of his Country, leading one or two spare Horses, made Inroads within five miles of <hi>Vienna,</hi> destroying and laying in ashes all places before them; things there resembling Dooms-day consumed with fire, and not so much almost left as marks or appearance of habitation.</p>
                        <p>These Troubles and Confusions in <hi>Hungary</hi> were the talk and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">The confusion of the German Councils.</note> of all Christendom, and indeed little more they were than talk; for the Christian Princes farther distant, as less concerned stood at a gaze, expecting the issue of that Treaty which was between the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the Pope; and the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> (whatsover was resolved at the Diet) like men surprized knew not what Succours to afford: some thought it now time to treat with the Emperour, and recover the Rights and Priviledges they thought their due, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend to no Terms of confederate assistance against the common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, unless with advantageous considerations to their State; and all in general acted with that negligence and coldness, as if only the State of <hi>Austria,</hi> and not the common Cause of <hi>Germany</hi> had been concerned. The Election of a General for the Imperial Army admitting long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, was another retardment to the Preparations for the War; the Duke of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> was nominated, and sollicited to accept the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Command; but the Title of being General of the Empire, or the Imperial Army, was a dispute undeterminable, and a difficulty not to be overcome: and though the Enemy had passed their Frontiers, and triumphed in their Possessions, and threatned the subversion of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom, yet Jealousies, Niceties, and acry Formalities took up all the time; so that at length their Councils had no other result than an increase of Animosities and Difficulties amongst themselves. The Emperour also <note place="margin">The Emperer removes to <hi>Lintz.</hi>
                           </note> terrified with the Siege of <hi>Newhausel,</hi> and the near Incursions of the Turks, abandoned his City of <hi>Vienna,</hi> carrying with him the Records and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of his Richess to <hi>Lintz,</hi> to the greater apprehension, discouragement, and fear of the whole Country in general, and was an act which might have produced very fatal effects, had not the Winter approached, and the progress of the Insidels been interrupted by the Valour, Vigilance, good Fortune, and Conduct of Count <hi>Serini,</hi> who in requital of those Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98602:123"/>
the Turks made into the Christian Territories, entred the Turkith Borders near <hi>Komorra,</hi> and there with Fire and Sword destroyed all before him, defeated a Party of about three thousand Janisaries, taking from them a good Booty of Money and Provisions designed for Relief of the Leagure before <hi>Newhausel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>During these varieties of success the Turks still continued the Siege, and having now made a breach, and almost filled the graft with rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish, Faggots and other implements, attempted a second storm on the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> but were repulsed with an extraordinary loss, by the couragious Gallantry of the Defendants: on the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> was given another more furious Assault, every Pasha leading his men <note place="margin">The Turks make another assault on the Town.</note> in the Front, so that the Action this day was so violently and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously performed, that the Turkish Ensign was advanced to the top of the Rampire of the Fort <hi>Frederick,</hi> where both sides coming to handy blows, the dispute continued a long time; but the courage of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants at length prevailing, the Turks were driven headlong from the Walls, and their Colours wrested from them with the loss of about five thousand men, and four hundred Christians. Though the Turks were much abated in their courage by this days work, yet the Vizier obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately continued the Siege, preparing speedily for another storm, in which he hoped to force the Christians to a Surrender. In the mean time, to facilitate the design of the Turks, on the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> the chief Magazine of Powder (none knows how) took fire, and blew into the air, by which blow fifty Souldiers and several Officers were slain; but the worst was, that the besieged were deprived of all their Powder, unless what remained in private houses, which so dismayed the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, that immediately with one voice they demanded a Parly: the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men also began a confused tumult, crying out for a Surrender, in which they were so impetuous and violent, that they threw stones from their windows on the Souldiers. Amidst of this confusion the Turks disposing their Companies to make another storm, the Officers resolved upon a Treaty, which concluded with these following Conditions.</p>
                        <p>First, That the Commanders and Garrison should march out on the <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Newhausel</hi> yielded.</note> 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> with Bag and Baggage, and have safe conduct as far as <hi>Komorra:</hi> and that for a convenience of the sick and wounded, the Vizier should be obliged to provide four hundred Carts and more, if there should be occasion.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, That as such as desire to abandon their dwellings, may have liberty to depart, so such as desire to abide may continue their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and that the Religious and Ecclesiastical persons may perform their Functions as in former times.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, That upon the Surrender of the principal Works, no Turk shall enter within the Town, until all such as intend to depart have quitted their stations.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, That for performance of Articles, two Aga's should be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for Hostages; and that until the foregoing Articles were fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, all acts of Hostility should cease.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, That the Garrison might not be necessitated to march through the Turkish Camp, the Turks themselves were obliged to make them a new Bridge, or repair the old to pass the <hi>Niter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>These Articles, though punctually observed by the Turks, yet the Tartars, who are of a faithless and barbarous nature, upon certain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98602:123"/>
assaulted the Garrison, as they marched out, and had doubtless moved the rest of the Camp Rabble to imitate their example; had not many of the Pashaws at the Head of their Troops, killed the most for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in this Rebellious attempt, whose perfidious insolence and riot could not yet have been restrained, had not the Garrison quickned their pace, more like a flight than an orderly March. But the Vizier on the contrary, distributed money to the Garrison, and especially to the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians, with design (as is supposed) to allure and attract their minds to a belief of the gentleness of the Turkish Yoke; as if he compassionated the miseries of that Country, which was the Stage whereon the Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of so many miseries and slaughters were acted. This Siege continued about the space of 43. Days; of the Garrison marched out 3500. sound men, and about 500. wounded; those Inhabitants who would remain, had protection and liberty. The Army which besieged the Town con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted of 50000. men. In the Town were found 60. pieces of Brass Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, but most broken and unserviceable, with little Ammunition, but with great provision of Hungarian Wines. The loss the Turks might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, is computed to have been of about 15000. men, amongst which was slain, the Spaheelar Agasee, or General of the Horse, <hi>Beco</hi> Pasha, Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerbeg of <hi>Romalia, Vsasf,</hi> Pasha of <hi>Anatolia,</hi> and <hi>Ibrahim</hi> Pasha of <hi>Seydi,</hi> with sixteen Captains belonging to <hi>Buda,</hi> and nine to <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The loss of <hi>Newhausell</hi> affected the Austrian Court with so drendful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of the Ottoman Fortune and Fury, that they hastened the finishing of the Works, and Fortifications of <hi>Vienna;</hi> cutting down all the Woods and Boseage thereabouts, which might benefit or thelter the Enemy; and so great an impression did the fear of the Turks prevalency and power work on the minds of the Germans, that they not only For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified the Frontiers, but secured the innermost parts of <hi>Austria,</hi> which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend along the River, as far as within three Miles of <hi>Lintz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But above all, <hi>Possonium</hi> which was upon the Frontiers, though not <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Possonium</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risoned.</note> an open Town, yet of no strength or resistance, was not neglected, but reinforced with a considerable Garrison, and the Works restored and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, with as many additional Fortisications as time would admit. But the Inhabitants had lost so much of their Spirit and Courage, by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy relation of the fate of <hi>Newhausel,</hi> and the apprehension of the dreadful advance of the whole Turkish Force; that their constancy to the Emperour began to waver, and to entertain some thoughts of submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the mercy and clemency of the Turks, who had newly declared, that such as voluntarily submitted to the Ottoman Obedience, should for three years be exempted from all Tribute or Taxes. This consideration adjoined to fear, so prevailed on those of <hi>Possonium,</hi> that they shut the Gates against the Garrison which was sent to recruit and defend them; some publickly declaring the extremity of their affairs had no other safety than in a surrender of themselves to the mercy and protection of the Vizier. Howsoever the Count <hi>Strozzi,</hi> with his Italian Artifices, so wheedled the <note place="margin">Count <hi>Strozzi.</hi>
                           </note> grosser humour of the Hungarians, that they were perswaded to admit him and his Regiment within the Town, where he disposed all things with that Conduct, and built those Forts, and in a short time so apparently rendered the Town tenable, that the Inhabitants taking Courage, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to defend themselves, in obedience to their Prince, to the ultimate point of Estates and Lives. In the mean time the Turks made themselves <note place="margin">

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98602:124"/>
its strength, yet was by the peoples fears, and allurements of the Viziers promises and fair Propositions, committed to the mercy of the Turks, and swore in Fealty to them the 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> day of <hi>September.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>By this time the news of the taking of <hi>Newhausell,</hi> was arrived at the <note place="margin">Festivals for Victory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Turks.</note> Ottoman Court, where it was entertained with so much joy, that a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelma, or Festival, was appointed for the space of seven days through the whole Empire; which according to the fashion of the Turks, is Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by adorning the Gates, and outward Walls of their Houses, so soon as it begins to be dark, with great store of Lamps and Candles, during which time the Nights are spent with Musick and Bankets, as the Dayes are with Visits and Presents, and <hi>Corban,</hi> (which is an Almes which rich men make in flesh to the poor sort, and is given either at the little <hi>Biram,</hi> which is called the Feast of <hi>Corban,</hi> or upon some publick Thanksgiving, which is performed in this manner.) He that makes the Corban, first layes <note place="margin">The manner of Corban.</note> his hand upon the head of the Sheep, or Lamb, makes a short Prayer, and then in the name of God cuts the throat, the Butcher afterwards fleying off the skin, the Corbanist divides the flesh into small pieces, to as many poor as slock to receive it. In the heat of these Revels, and Bankets, every one spake high in praise of their fortunate Arms, and Congratulated each with other, the prosperous beginnings of this War, promising to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the following year, rather a time of Peregrination or Travel through the pleasant Countries and Cities of the Christians, than blood and sweat in obtaining the possession of their Enemies. Nor were such imaginations vain, or absurd for the Commonalty to entertain; in regard it was evident to the World, in what manner the Ottoman Arms roved through <hi>Hungary</hi> uncontrouled, without an appearance of any consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Force to give them the least stop or interruption; so that under the very Walls of <hi>Rab</hi> and <hi>Presburg,</hi> and on the Banks of the <hi>Danube</hi> near <hi>Komorra,</hi> Incursions and depredations were made, and great numbers of people of both Sexes, and of all Ages, were carried into slavery, the Country all round laid wast, the Corn and Hay burnt; with all other miserable effects and Concomitants of War.</p>
                        <p>In this manner all places seemed to fall down and yield at the very ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the Turks approach; for not only <hi>Leventz</hi> surrendred it self, but likewise <hi>Nitra,</hi> though over-topped by a strong and an impregnable Castle, was by the Cowardice of the Commander betrayed at the first Summons of the Turks; for which action, the Captain afterwards, by express Command of the Emperour suffered Death.</p>
                        <p>After all these successes, though no opposition appeared in the Field, to obstruct the luxuriant and wanton march of the victorious Squadrons of the Ottoman Army; and not only <hi>Hungary,</hi> but <hi>Austria,</hi> and the lower <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> was Alarmed and terrified with the rumour of the Turkish num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; and though the Vizier (as it is said) began this War with the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious thoughts of possessing <hi>Vienna</hi> it self, and out-vying the Acts of <hi>Solyman</hi> the Magnificent: Yet it seemed strange, that being come thus far, and almost in prospect of his hopes, that he should give a check to his Fortunes, and not advance towards <hi>Vienna;</hi> to which now the passage seemed wide and open; but it was almost a miracle, that he should not make a Visit to <hi>Possonium,</hi> before which, had he only displaid his dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Arms, it had surrendred at his first Summons and Appearance. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead <note place="margin">The Vizier as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults <hi>Schinta,</hi> but beaten off.</note> whereof he attempted <hi>Schinta,</hi> the Magazine of the Emperours Arms and Artillery, but found not the same easy entrance as he did with

the Governour of <hi>Nitra,</hi> but instead thereof, being stoutly repulsed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter several assaults, concluded the enterprize too difficult, and requiring more time and bloud than could be countervailed by the acquisition of that place. Wherefore raising his Camp, he employed a considerable party to take <hi>Novigrade,</hi> a Castle scituated on a high Rock, encompassed <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Novigrade</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Turks.</note> with a Ditch of thirty four Foot deep, Garrisoned with 600. Souldiers, and provided sufficiently with Victuals and Ammunition; howsoever by ill fortune and worse Conduct, this place also was resigned into the hands of the Turks.</p>
                        <p>By this time the Winter approaching, and the season of the Year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning <note place="margin">The Vizier re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats to his Winter Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> to be unfit for action, the Great Vizier retreated as far as <hi>Belgrade,</hi> to take up his Winter Quarters with the gross of his Army.

                     <p>THE Month of <hi>January</hi> was now well entered with its rigid Frosts, when <hi>Apasi</hi> Prince of <hi>Transilvania,</hi> beholding his Souldiers in their Winter Quarters, and all things quiet and still about him, judged it seasonable for his establishment to discover himself with some lustre to the World, seated in the usual Throne of the Transilvanian Princes; which sight appeared sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversally grateful to the people, that they began to be enamoured of their Prince, and to applaud his Person, his Prowess and Vertues, and to cast an ill and envious Eye on those Cities, which were Garrisoned with Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Souldiers. About which time the Fortress of <hi>Zechelhyd</hi> revolted from <note place="margin">

The news of this Sedition flew quickly to <hi>Vienna,</hi> from whence imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately a Messenger was dispatched with an Act of Pardon, from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:98602:125"/>
upon submission, and proffers of full satisfaction of all Arrears; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1664"/> but the Souldiery finding themselves only paid with words, hearkened to the more effectual Propositions of <hi>Apasi,</hi> who taking hold of this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, sent every Souldier ten Dollars with a Suit of Cloaths, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing larger and more constant pay than they received from the Emperour, with which the Garrison being satisfied, surrendred up their City on the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>January.</hi> But whilst other Armies remained in their Quarters, and other Commanders gave themselves up to ease, and drowned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in Wine and Bankets; and whilst Jealousies, Envics, and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, disturbed and confused the resolves of Diets and private Councils; The generous and vigilant <hi>Serini,</hi> having received advices from <hi>Adriano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> that the Turks design in the next Campagna, was to convert the whole heat and fury of the War upon <hi>Croatia,</hi> and through that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to open a passage unto <hi>Friuli;</hi> his active Spirit conceived that heat and flame, that the Winters cold could not chill his hot and eager desires from entering into the open Field, and commencing some attempt and enterprize on his Enemy. Wherefore on the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> he began his march from <hi>Serinswar,</hi> with an Army of about 25000. men; And in the first place, marching along the Banks of the <hi>Dravus,</hi> shewed himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Berzenche;</hi> which upon conditions of marching away with Arms, Bag, and Baggage, was surrendered to him. <hi>Bakockza</hi> was likewise yielded, and a Palancha on the River quitted upon report of the Counts approach, leaving behind them eight brass Guns in the Fort. From hence he marched towards <hi>Esseck,</hi> otherwise called <hi>Oseck,</hi> which is the only pass from the upper to the lower <hi>Hungary,</hi> having a Bridge of Wood over a Moor or Fen, about six or seven miles in length, which once I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, with my Horse, I was an hour and three quarters in passing (as I observed by my Watch), and reported to have been six years in building. This Bridge <hi>Serini</hi> resolved to burn, which cost the Turks 300000. Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, <note place="margin">Oseck.</note> and six Years time to build, imagining that to rebuild it again, was a work of that time, as could not be repaired in one Summer, and that by this means the Turks would be disappointed of all action the following Year, and the Empire have time to breath, and assemble the utmost of <note place="margin">The Bridge burned.</note> their strength and force together: wherefore taking opportunity of the hard Winter, when the Marsh was frozen, and a strong wind to carry the flame; he sent before him 2000. Dragoons, and 3000. Croats, which encountring 6000. Turks at the foot of the Bridge, set for guard of that place, were so ill treated by them, that they had been wholly cut off, had not a considerable Force of Horse and Dragoons, come in to their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, by whose resolution they not only routed the Turk, but took the Palancha, which was the defence of the Bridge, and having gained it in hot blood, put all to Fire and Sword; after which, Fire being set to the Bridge in divers places, in a short time it was consumed and remained in ashes. The news of this exploit was received at <hi>Vienna</hi> with great Joy; believing that for the following Year, they had disappointed the Turks of a passage, but by the sequel it will appear, how much they erred in the account made of the diligence of the Turks, who in forty days re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired that which they esteemed a work of some Years; and as I obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, it was all built of new Timber, and on another foundation different from the old.

to surrender on Terms and Articles of Agreement; the Christians with this confidence marched near the Walls, where the Turks espying their advantage on their Enemies now under command of their Guns fired upon them, and did severe execution, killing amongst others several principal Officers, of which were General <hi>Hammerling</hi> and Count <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berstein;</hi> which perfidious action so transported <hi>Serini,</hi> that he resolved on a furious assault, and performed it with that gallantry, that on the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> he took the Town by storm and force of Arms, and in recompence of their treacherous Stratagem, put all the Inhabitants to the sword, and gave up the Town to the Pillage and Plunder of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery, and afterwards setting it on fire, rendred it the most horrid spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle of fire and sword that had as yet been seen or known in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent War.</p>
                     <p>These successes of <hi>Serini</hi> gained him the reputation of a valiant and fortunate Prince, and his liberal hand in frankly bestowing the Booty and Pillages amongst the Souldiery, invited great numbers to follow his Banner. His active Spirit and Vigilance gained him likewise a reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongst the Turks, that their principal fear and dread was of <hi>Serin-Ogli,</hi> as of a watchful and politick Enemy; for in every place he made great havock and spoil, being reported to have laden two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand five hundred Carts with Slaves, Goods, and Ammunition, and to carry with him an hundred fifty five Pieces of Cannon taken out of small Forts and Palancha's, and to have laid waste all the Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Dravns</hi> and the <hi>Danube.</hi> In these Incursions, and victorious and dreadful travels through the Enemies Country, the valiant <hi>Serini</hi> at length arrived at <hi>Sigeth,</hi> a Fortress consisting of a new and old Town <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Sigeth</hi> besieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> conjoyned by a Bridge which crosses a famous Marsh or Fen, ennobled by the Attempt made thereon by <hi>Solyman</hi> the Magnificent in the year 1565. with an Army of six hundred thousand men; in defence of which <hi>Nicholas Serini,</hi> the great Grandfather of the present Count, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalized his Fame and Memory with the loss of his life, and renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the place it self by his Feats of Arms. At this place <hi>Serini</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to revenge the blood of his Ancestors, and sacrisice great numbers to the Ghost of his Grandfather; to which end he sent the Count <hi>Olack</hi> before him with part of his Army, to summon the Enemy, and prepare the way to his own more effectual force; <hi>Olack</hi> had ordered all things accordingly, when <hi>Serini</hi> full of Glory and Spoils arrived him in his Leagure, and joyning together appointed the day for a general storm; but whilst these things were meditating, and that <hi>Sigeth</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced almost to the last extremity, advice came of the near approach of a Body of twelve thousand Turks and Tartars; to encounter which <note place="margin">The Siege rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</note> the Attempt was accounted difficult, considering the loss and diminution of the Christian Forces, which by continual actions, and the bitter suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Winter season, were reduced to a number inferiour to that of their Enemies, and wanting all sorts of Provision and Ammunition, it was resolved, as most expedient, to raise the Siege, which was the next day performed, and the Souldiery taken into Garrisons to repose and recruit themselves. But whilst by the active and zealous Spirit of this great Champion most matters proceeded successfully on the side of <hi>Croatia,</hi> the Christian Affairs on the other side, by the negligence of some Ministers, ran into evident ruine and disorder.

under the Command of the Governour <hi>Retani,</hi> did now, wanting pay, (the sinew and life of the Souldiery) follow the late example of <hi>Zechel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hyd,</hi> and surrendred it self into the hands of <hi>Apafi;</hi> and though the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and murmurings of the Souldiers gave a sufficient time of warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make due Provisions against a misfortune so imminent and plainly appearing, yet the want of expedition at <hi>Vienna,</hi> and the unprofitable application only of empty words and air to feed the penury and satisfie the appetite of starving men, was a remedy so little available, that the Garrison submitted to <hi>Apafi,</hi> and yielded to Conditions whereby they might eat and live: the story of which place, compared with that of <hi>Zechelhyd,</hi> was so shameful and pungent to men capable of any impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of honour or duty, that at length it awakened the Germans, and admonished them to provide better for <hi>Zacmar</hi> and <hi>Tockay,</hi> and other Frontier Garrisons, lest they also should incur the like Fate and misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune with the two former.</p>
                     <p>By this time the Actions of <hi>Serini</hi> were rumoured in the Grand Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gniors Seraglio, and the report of them became common in the mouths of the Vulgar; wherefore full of anger and disdain, the Sultan wrote severely to his Vizier, reproving him of negligence for suffering <hi>Serini</hi> so freely to range his Countries without controul, to the great disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Empire, and damage of his People: whereupon the Vizier not as yet having received his Recruits, nor prepared so early for the March of the gross of his Army, dispatched notwithstanding a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Force to precede him, with Orders either by stealth to surprize <hi>Serinswar,</hi> or else to lay siege unto it. This Army marching by the way of <hi>Bosna,</hi> the News thereof was brought to Count <hi>Peter Serini,</hi> appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Count <hi>Peter Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini</hi> defeats the Turks in the Streights of <hi>Morlac.</hi>

                     <p>The month of <hi>March</hi> being now well entred, the Frosts began to thaw, and the Air become more mild and moderate, when Count <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Serini</hi> entertained thoughts of laying siege to <hi>Canisia:</hi> But to lay the foundation of this design with the better judgment, it was thought first necessary to view the state and situation of the place; wherefore the Count in person accompanied with about fourteen Officers, went one day <note place="margin">The danger of <hi>Serini.</hi>
                        </note> to take a survey thereof; but he was not so private in his design, but that it was known to the Turks, who secretly laid five hundred men in wait to take him, and upon the near approach of <hi>Serini,</hi> started from their holes with shouts and out-crys; but the Count was so well mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his Croatian Courser, that he out-ran them all, and got refuge in the Thickets of a neighbouring Wood, where three hundred of his own Horse alarmed at a distance by the Echo's of the cry, came in to his succour, and making head against the Turks, routed and defeated them, killing and taking many Prisoners; amongst the slain was found one armed cap-a-pe, with a silk twist or cord of divers colours about his waste, who was, as reported by the Captives, to have been one who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to have taken <hi>Serini,</hi> and with that cord to have brought him bound to the feet of the Vizier. <hi>Serini</hi> having thus escaped, resolved

to revenge himself of the affront, and therefore made most dreadful spoils, and confusion in all places round <hi>Kanisia,</hi> so that the people flying thither for Sanctuary, were refused entertainment by the Pasha, who at that time labouring with scarcity, and expecting a siege, had no need of unnecessary guests.</p>

                        <hi>Serini</hi> having now fully resolved to lay siege to <hi>Kanisia,</hi> thought fit first to signifie the design to his Imperial Majesty, for which purpose he dispatched away the Engineer General with Letters to the Council of War of the Lower <hi>Hungary,</hi> containing a perfect relation of the success and progress of his Arms in that Winter, and how he had laid waste and desolate all that circumference of Land which lyes between the River <hi>Dravus</hi> and <hi>Serinswar,</hi> by which means <hi>Kanisia</hi> was already strained <note place="margin">

The particular Journal of <hi>Serini's</hi> success was not less pleasing to his Caesarean Majesty, than his present Heroical reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution against <hi>Kanisia,</hi> who thereupon gave Orders to the General Council to supply him with all Provisions, Ammunition, and Men, which were requisite for this Siege, and was graciously pleased himself to express in a Letter to the Count the sense he had of his Merits and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, which he applauded and extolled in the words following.</p>

                        </note> the Commonweal of the Empire. The taking of <hi>Nemhausel,</hi> and the Progress of the Ottoman Armes, had awakened the German Princes with that sense of the common danger, that a Diet was assembled at <hi>Ratisbone</hi> to consult of the most effectual means that might give a stop to the uncontrouled incursions of the Turk. And not to trouble the Reader with the names of all those Princes and Ambassadours which there appeared, it will be sufficient to signifie, That besides his Cesarean Majesty, there were present, as his Plenipotentiaries, the Elector of <hi>Mentz,</hi> and Arch-Bishop of <hi>Saltzburgh:</hi> And though many Princes show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves with Glory and Splendour; yet none appeared with that Pomp and Magnificence as the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who for number of Coaches, richness of his Liveries, and compleat Government of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, was so neat and polite, that he seemed not only to exceed every Court in particular, but in Elegance and Magnificence to equalize them all together. Upon Debate of matters in reference to this War, the Count of <hi>Olach</hi> was unanimously chosen General for the Confederates of the <hi>Rhime;</hi> but the more hot Disputes between the Protestants and Papists about Election of other Generals kept matters in longer suspence, yet at length the Marquess of <hi>Baden</hi> was chosen Marshal General in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the League, the Marquess of <hi>Durlach,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> his Councellours, and Directors of the War, and Count <hi>Francis Fucher,</hi> General of the Ordnance. But in the Levies of their Forces <note place="margin">The strength of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Army.</note> they concurred more freely and willingly; for besides the Imperial For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which consisted of 41600 Foot, and 13900 Horse, the Allies and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates furnished 13850 Foot, and 3350 Horse; the Auxiliaries of the Empire made up a Body of 16991 Foot, and 4037 Horse, besides the Forces of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> and the Succours of <hi>France,</hi> so that, by Gods Providence, the Christian Army was this year esteemed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, if not more numerous than the multitudes of their Enemies.</p>
                     <p>The next matter under consideration was the nomination of Ministers <note place="margin">Italy.</note> to be sent abroad to implore assistance from Christian Princes more remote; the Count <hi>Piccolomini</hi> was to negotiate in the Courts of <hi>Italy,</hi> but having taken a Distemper in his Journies, died after a short Sickness at <hi>Milan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Also the Count <hi>Colalto,</hi> sent to his Majesty of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> died in <note place="margin">England,</note> his Journey before he arrived at <hi>London;</hi> notwithstanding which the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous piety of his Majesty was not wanting with a liberal hand to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute towards the promotion of the Christian Interest.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Poland</hi> nothing more could be obtained than Terms of Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie, <note place="margin">Poland,</note> and Demonstrations of Good Will and Desires, for that their Forces being employed against the Moscovite to recover the lost Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of <hi>Lituania,</hi> could not possibly attend the Service and Command of his Imperial Majesty, though they could not but at the same time reflect on their premures and necessities with shame and confusion, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled them from answering with like returns, the grateful memory they still retained of the assistance against <hi>Sweden.</hi>

To his Most Christian Majesty Count <hi>Strozzi</hi> was employed, before whose Arrival at <hi>Paris</hi> the common report and vogue was, That that King resolved to contribute an effectual assistance to the Christian <note place="margin">France.</note> Cause in that present Conjuncture; which pious disposition <hi>Strozzi</hi> so happily improved, that he obtained from his Majesty a Grant and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of four thousand Foot, and two thousand Horse, raised and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at his own charge, to be united with the Troops of the Rhinish League: And farther his Majesty was so gracious herein, that he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished a Declaration, That what person soever would serve the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour against the Turk, his resolution and action therein should be accepted by him, in the same manner, as if the service were immediately tendered to himself. Upon which many persons of Quality resolved upon this expedition, amongst which was the Duke of <hi>Buglion,</hi> the <hi>Marquis de Villeroy,</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Richelieu,</hi> and many other Heroes, and Persons of Bravery, who ventured their Lives with no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration than that of honour and Religion. But before I pass from this Embassy, give me leave to report a Complement which Count <hi>Strozzi</hi> passed upon this King, which some say did savour a little too much of flattery and affectation. The matter was this: Count <hi>Strozzi</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Count Strozzi's Speech to the French King.</note> being admitted to hiis Audience, so soon as he entered into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I know not whether it was feigned or real, he seemed to be struck with such an amazement and fear, that for a while he was not able to pronounce a word articulate or intelligible; but at length recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting himself, he began with a trembling voice to excuse this hesitation of his Speech, having his Senses dissipated, and his Eyes dazled with the Rays and Splendour of so much Majesty; and with that, as in a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture or ecstasie, broke out into an admiration of the French Monarchy, the report of whose Greatness and Glory, though arrived to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Confines of the Universe, came yet far short of that real Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty which he saw and admired, whose dreadful and mysterious Throne was sufficient to revive the dead Ashes of the Sabean Queen to prostrate herself before this new <hi>Solomon,</hi> much excelling the wisdom, the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chess, the vertue, and happiness of the former. And thence descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the like sagacious obsequiousness, to confute the malicious Reports of malignant tongues, who, envious of the harmony of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Spirits, represented his Majesty as ill-affected to the Austrian Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, whereas to the contrary, he could testifie to have found that excess of Affection, and admirable disposition in his Majesty towards the Emperour his Ally, as rendred his Embassy abundantly happy and successful, which, joined to the Zeal his Majesty had towards the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Cause, was like Friendship united to Charity, and Moral Vertues made perfect by spiritual Qualifications. In fine, he compared his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Majesty to that Glorious Sun, which communicating his light to the Christian World, affords the most benign influence to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Climate; with much better reason therefore ought <hi>Germany</hi> to participate so great a Circle of those Rays, as may serve wholly to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and darken the dim and barbarous Light of the Ottoman Moon. In sum, <hi>Strozzi</hi> knew so well how to manage his Discourse, and play the Oratour, that he obtained considerable assistances, and returned to his Master the Emperour with full Demonstrations of all obliging Terms, and courteous Treatments. And having thus understood what preparations are making in Christendom, let us pass over into the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:98602:130"/>
Turks Quarters, and see what is in the mean time transacting in those Dominions.</p>
                     <p>At this time the rumour of a Rebellion and Mutiny amongst the <note place="margin">Rebellion of the Beghs in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</note> Great Beghs at Grand <hi>Cairo</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> afforded matter for trouble and consultation at the Ottoman Court; for that those Beghs who have great possessions and power in that Country, made seizure of <hi>Ibrahim</hi> Pasha, and imprisoned him, being about the expiration of his three years commonly allotted to that Government; and therefore near upon departure. The demands they had upon him was for no less than three thousand purses of money, which, according to the <hi>Cairo</hi> Account, are reckoned seven hundred and fifty Dollars a purse, and pretended to be taken from them against Law and Justice; and that without resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution thereof they resolved not to restore him his liberty. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solence against so eminent a Pasha, qualified with such absolute pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in his Government, and one related to the Grand Signior by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of his Sister, compared with the late neglects and disobedience of that people, who for some years had failed in the full payment of their Tribute, were interpreted as evident Symptoms of disaffection, and malignancy, which that people entertained against the Ottoman Subjection. Wherefore the Sultan immediately dispatched away the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of his Horse to <hi>Cairo,</hi> with full power to appease this Rebellion, and with Lenitives to moderate the fury of the people, who seemed to be too licentious and unbridled to be governed by a Musselim, or Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Wherefore the Selictar Aga was elected Pasha, and to depart with all expedition. In the mean time this Messenger, to make greater haste, took post through <hi>Asia</hi> with thirty in his Company, and in a short time arrived at Grand <hi>Cairo,</hi> where, with fair terms, and restitution of some money from the Pasha, all matters were reduced to an amicable compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, only the punishment of the Chief Mutiniers, with a fair Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, deferred for a season, was afterwards according to the Turkish fashion, when time and opportunity presented, remunerated to those factious Spirits with a severe Interest, and satisfaction to Justice.</p>
                     <p>Not long after <hi>Ibrahim</hi> Pasha having obtained his liberty, returned from his Government of <hi>Cairo</hi> to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where refreshing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self some time with the embraces of his young Sultana, an Imperial Command for immediate payment of four hundred Purses of money to <note place="margin">

                           </gap>,</note> the Grand Signiors Treasury, disturbed his delightful quiet. The Pasha made a present payment of one half, but desired time for the remainder, either for want of that instant supply, or else on hopes of ease of his Fine. But the Sultan, who is impatient of any delay in his Slaves, which savours of obstinacy or disobedience, though never so reasonable, dispatched another Command enjoining present compliance, and as a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty for the late neglect, raised the Demand from four hundred to six hundred Purses, which if not as readily payed as required, the Kima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cham of <hi>Constantinople</hi> was impowred to commit him Prisoner, within the four Gates of the Seraglio, the fatal Prison, from whence few find other Release than by Death. The Pasha not being able to comply, <note place="margin">and impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> was there restrained of his Liberty; and yet had the good fortune in a few days to obtain his freedom, by the endeavours (as some suppose) of the Great Vizier, who having by this Act weakened his Power and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, did afterwards as an instrument of his Deliverance, conserve his Life, and obtain for him the Government of <hi>Darbiquier,</hi> where being
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:98602:131"/>
remote and obscure at so far a distance, could never be capable to sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, or by his great popularity and affable comportment endanger the present happy state of the Viziers Office.</p>
                     <p>Matters growing now towards action, by return of the Spring, the Grand Signior, to incourage his Vizier in a continuance of his duty, sent him a Horse and a Sword as a testimony of his favour and good esteem of his person: and Orders were issued out through all the Empire for publick Prayers to be made some days before the Vizier began his March towards the Enemy. This appointment of publick Devotions occasioned matter of argument and dispute between the Mufti and a Shegh or Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, one that was always near the Grand Signiors Person, and therefore on confidence of his familiar accesses to the Presence of the Sultan, and on presumption of his Sanctity and Priviledge of his Office, took liberty to oppose and contradict the Oracle of the Ottoman Law. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem <note place="margin">A Dispute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti and a Shegh.</note> in question was, Whether Prayers appointed for success of the Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman Arms, according to the Law of their Prophet, were to be made privately, and in every Mosch or Oratory apart, or in a general Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the whole City. The Mufti maintained the last Position, citing in favour of his opinion the testimony of divers Arabick Doctors, and the customs of the present and past times. The Shegh on the contrary was for Devotions to be performed in every Mosch, declaring, That the Assembly of all the people of a City into one body did nothing avail or inforce the power of Prayer; for they being true Believers were all illuminated, and had no need of helps to make their Prayers more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent or more acceptable. The argument was hot on both sides: and though the Mufti had got another Shegh on his part, who might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to as much of illumination as the other, and joyned to the Mufti's opinion, who is the Mouth and undoubted Interpreter of the Law, might seem able not only to resolve the knottiest difficulties, but to impose an assent on them with greater authority; yet the Shegh having the Grand Signior on his side, presently got most of reason, and forced the Mufti to recant his former opinion as erroneous, and to banish the other Shegh his Companion, pretending that he was now convinced, and had sooner discovered the truth, had not the Impostor, the false Preacher deceived him by his feigned illuminations. This Victory gained the Shegh much applause and esteem with the Grand Signior, so that he vented what Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine he pleased, and all he said was taken for Divine Rules and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts. He was born about <hi>Van</hi> on the Confines of <hi>Persia,</hi> so that he is called <hi>Vanni Efendi,</hi> and is of the Armenian Race: he preached every Friday at <hi>Adrianople</hi> in one Mosch or other, where the Grand Signior was for the most part present; and though the greatest part of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were stuffed up with praises of the Mahometan Religion, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives against Christians, sentencing all polluted and profane who asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate with them, and exclaiming against the abomination of Wine; yet it is confidently reported, that he is no strict Observer of the Law he professes, the which his Disciples and Familiars are ready to excuse in him, saying, That it may be lawful for him to dispense with such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in regard his Illuminations and high Prerogatives of Sanctity have infranchised him from observance of the meaner and less substantial points of their Law.</p>
                     <p>The Turks who are as much given to Predictions and Interpretations <note place="margin">Predictions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Turks.</note> of old Prophecies, as ever the Egyptians were, busied themselves this
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:98602:131"/>
year more than ever, to know the Event of this War. Some who had studied ancient Arabick Predictions, had extracted certain Astrological Figures, and from thence framed strange fancies, according to the humor or melancholy of the Astrologer; one whereof coming to the Grand Signiors ear, mentioning divers things obscurely, and in general of the great effusion of blood, but that at last the advantage and Victory should remain to the Turk, and that the Grand Signior himself should shortly make a Journey; the Grand Signior troubled hereat, as much as ever <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was about the Interpretation of his Dream, sent for one of the Chief Justices of the Law called the Kadilescher, and with him conferred concerning this Prediction: all things pleased him well, but only the latter part of making a Journey. Whither that Journey should be, he could not imagine; his Arms were so prosperous in <hi>Hungary,</hi> that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Vizier had no need of his presence either to animate or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit his Army: and to any other part, he knew not what could move him from his delightful and beloved City of <hi>Adrianople.</hi> The Kadiles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher supposing that he might put that Interpretation thereon which might not be ungrateful, replied, Perhaps, O Emperour, he may mean that you shall again return to your sublime and happy Port of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople.</hi> The Grand Signior suddenly touched herewith burst into cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler: <note place="margin">The Grand Signiors aversion to <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople.</hi>
                        </note> How, said he, to <hi>Constantinople!</hi> what joy, what comfort can I have there? Hath not that place been fatal to my Father? What benefit had my Uncle from thence? or any of my Race? Have not all my Princes Ancestors been subject to a thousand Mutinies and Rebellions in that place? I shall sooner than return thither set fire to it with my own hands, and rejoyce to see that City with my Seraglio brought to ashes. And that we may farther discover the strange aversion the Sultan had to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and his resolution to change the Seat of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, it is observable, that he built a small Seraglio not far from <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A small Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio by that name near <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople.</hi>
                        </note> in imitation of that near <hi>Constantinople</hi> called <hi>Odout Pasha,</hi> the place to which he most frequently resorted after that City fell under his dislike and hatred. The Village where his Palace was built was called <hi>Chiomlichoi,</hi> or the Village of Pots, where earthen vessels were made: but the Grand Signior changed the name, and called it <hi>Odout Pasha;</hi> with which name before the people were well acquainted, and that it was accustomed to their mouths, two poor silly Country-men mistaking, and calling it simply by the former name, were apprehended by some of the Bostangees; and brought before the Grand Signior as contemners of the Imperial Command, and by his immediate Sentence were put to death.</p>
                     <p>About the end of <hi>May</hi> the Grand Signior had a Son born to him of <note place="margin">A Son born to the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior.</note> one of his Women, for joy of which seven days of <hi>Dunalma,</hi> or rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing were appointed through all the Ottoman Dominions: but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at <hi>Adrianople</hi> the Solemnity was greatest, all sorts of Artisans en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to outvy each other in their shows and pastimes to entertain the City. At the Gate of the Seraglio was erected a magnificent Pavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion for the Grand Signior, before whom were shown rare artificial Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works invented by the most ingenious Masters thereof amongst the Jews: one of which firing a Rocket, which not ascending with usual strength, unhappily fell on the Vest of the Grand Signiors Favourite, standing at the door of the Tent: at which the Young man being surprized, sent to find out him who fired it, which happening to be a poor Jew, was condemned immediately by the Grand Signiors sentence to receive eighty
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:98602:132"/>
blows on the soals of his feet: but as report went, this young Favourite not appeased with this slender punishment, obtained the Sultans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to put him to death.</p>
                     <p>But to return to the Turkish Camp. The Vizier was astonished to understand that <hi>Kanista</hi> was besieged, and wondred much at the rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Serini,</hi> in attempting a work so difficult without probability of success; howsoever being advised, that the Garrison was ill provided of Victuals and Ammunition, he gave order for its supply. In order to <note place="margin">The Siege of <hi>Kanisia.</hi>
                        </note> which eighty Carts laden with Provisions convoyed by a considerable number of Turks, were conducted by way of <hi>Sigeth;</hi> but being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in their passage by <hi>Serini's</hi> Souldiers, were routed, put to slight, and their Provisions taken. In the mean time the Besieged made many vigorous Sallies, and some not without loss to the Christians, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselves the better uncovered the tops of their houses, and made their Lodgings under ground, secure from Granadoes, or shot of the Enemies Batteries. On the other side the Ammunition and Artillery from the Emperour came not so timely as was expected; nor were the Bomboes and Granadoes so artificially made, but that many of them spent themselves in vain: the Succours likewise of men fell very short of the numbers promised, and Souldiery being drawn from their Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarters before the colds were past, or the pasture grown, began to murmur; but nothing discontented them so much as want of Pay, the just complaint of Souldiers, which discouraged them more than the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of their adventure: against all which <hi>Serini</hi> provided as much as he was able out of his own Purse, continuing the Siege more out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation than probable hopes of success; for his Army was at least di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished two thousand in its number, of which four hundred Hungars, and two hundred Germans were lost in the first Assaults made upon the Suburbs, and the rest perished by sickness, and the vigorous and frequent Sallics of the Enemy. Howsoever <hi>Serini</hi> seemed not to doubt of the success, if he could but be for some time secured from the advance of the Vizier, who now began to draw his gross and numerous Army out of their Winter-quarters into the open field; and therefore with the other Officers before <hi>Kanista</hi> signified their advice to the Emperour and General Council of War, That it was necessary that the Imperial Army should be as early in the field as the Ottoman; and for the more methodical government of Affairs, that the Army should be divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three Bodies, one to recruit the Forces before the Town, a second to march to <hi>Osek,</hi> and hinder the Enemies passage over the <hi>Dravns,</hi> and a third to take the field, and apply assistance where it was judged most useful. This counsel being well accepted by the Emperour, Orders were immediately issued forth to General <hi>Montecuculi</hi> to begin his March, with design to obstruct the Turks passage over the <hi>Dravns;</hi> for that the success against <hi>Kanista</hi> was of that high importance, as might justly require the imployment of all the Christian Forces in its concernment. Wherefore one Post was dispatched after the other to <hi>Montecucli</hi> to sollicite his speedy March, and to give a stop to the Viziers progress. But he answered, That he attended General <hi>Sporch,</hi> whom he every day expected to joyn with him; but this Answer proving by the effect to be nothing more than a present excuse, gave occasion of sulpicion, and produced that discontent in the minds of the most zealous, as spread a rumor through all <hi>Germany</hi> much to the disreputation of <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <pb n="157" facs="tcp:98602:132"/>
Time thus being protracted, and no Forces appearing to recruit the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, at length advice came to the Generals, when they were just going to dinner, that the Vizier with a most numerous Army was within <note n="*" place="margin">Fifteen Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish miles,</note> three Leagues of the Town. For the Bridge of <hi>Osek</hi> was against the common opinion again rebuilt, planked, and compleated, with new Timbers in the space of forty days; many hands making light work; which when first founded, was the work of six years: which Expendition was the more remarkable, in regard that this Bridge was not formed out of the ruines of the old, nor founded on the same ground, but new framed out of the Woods with as much comliness and order as besits a Bridge of that nature and length, passing over a wild Marsh or Fen. The news of the Viziers so near approach was strange to <hi>Serini,</hi> who by the calculation made of his March, did not yet expect him for several days; but the Vizier ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the straitness in which <hi>Kanista</hi> might be, leaving the gross of his Army, made more expedite Journies with a Body of twenty thousand Horse, which not being unknown to <hi>Serini,</hi> his daring spirit was once resolved to give him Battel, in which opinion was also Count <hi>Strozzi;</hi> but <hi>Olach</hi> dissenting, and refusing to ingage his Forces, the Siege was <note place="margin">The Siege of <hi>Kanista</hi> raised.</note> raised, and all the Forces with good order retreated to <hi>Serinswar,</hi> where they arrived the day following, leaving to the Enemy a great quantity of Powder, Match, Shovels, twenty Carts of Meal, and two Iron Guns broken.</p>
                     <p>No Pilgrim ever followed his way with more devotion to the sacred Shrine, than the Vizier was willingly led in pursuit of his Enemy to the <note place="margin">The Turks pursue the Christian At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tny.</note> Walls of <hi>Serinswar,</hi> being the place to which his intentions inclined, as the beginning and consummation of the War. Over against this envied Fort there is a little Hill strong by Nature, incompasled with a narrow Ditch, yet not so narrow, as that a Horse can leap over it, nor yet so shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low as to be forded. This Hill <hi>Serini</hi> proposed to the rest of his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legues or Coadjutors, <hi>viz. Olach</hi> and <hi>Spaar,</hi> as a place commodious to incamp their Army, because lying open to the River, could easily be relieved, and would serve as a Redoubt or Out-work to the Fort, in which upon all extremities they might find Sanctuary and refuge: But the apprehension of the Viziers Numbers, and his near approach had made that impression of fear in their minds, that no safety seemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, unless they could see the River <hi>Mura</hi> between them and their Enemy. Nor was <hi>Serini</hi> more successful in his perswasions to assault the Enemy, whilst they were wearied with their March, and busied in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending their Tents, the other Generals being of opinion, that it was too great a hazard for them alone to venture their Forces in so unequal a Combate, but they ought rather to expect <hi>Montecuculi,</hi> by the addition of whose Forces the lot of War would be less hazardous, if not wholly certain. In this manner great Enterprises have been disappointed, which have wanted only resolution to make them successful, Fortune being commonly favourable, if not a servant, to bold and daring Spirits; the disunion also of Generals hath been the overthrow of the wisest Counsels, and Wars have been observed nover to have thrived where the Heads of Armies have been of dissenting humors of different interests.</p>
                     <p>This timidity on the Christian part raised in that manner the spirits of the Turks, that without stop or opposition passing the River <hi>Muer,</hi> they arrived at <hi>Serinswar,</hi> where they immediately fell to their Mattock and <note place="margin">The Turks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench before <hi>

                           <hi>Serini's</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to fight with the Turks.</note> before the Ottoman Army had arrived to its full numbers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting now of an hundred thousand fighting men. To which reasons <hi>Serini</hi> replied, That the Christian Cause, and the States and Confines of the Empire were not to be maintained by men that carry their thumbs at their girdles, or by Armies made resty with ease, and wanton with luxury. That those Armies were raised not to consume and exhaust the Revenues of their Princes, and Exchequers of their States, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king satisfactory amends by a valiant defence of that Interest which they owned. That the Enemy had not been before that time attempted, was no fault or neglect of his, who under the very Walls of <hi>Kanisia</hi> resolved to give them Battle; but that the other Generals supposed it more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and caution to protract the Engagement till his Arrival, who being now happily conjoyed with them, nothing ought to deter them from a glorious Attempt on the Turks, who not consisting of above thirty thousand men, ill disciplined, and worse armed, were not able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the prowess of their Veterane Army, which far exceeded them in number, discipline, and courage. These or such like expressions <hi>Serini</hi> used; and to prove what he averred, he dispatched a confident Person of his own, who spake naturally the Turkish Language, with a Letter to the German Resident, then entertained under custody in the Turkish Camp, to know of him the true <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>But before we proceed farther, it seems pertinent to our purpose, to <note place="margin">Reflections on the disgrace of <hi>Serini.</hi>
                        </note> declare the reasons and grounds of the preceeding neglects and discoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance passed upon <hi>Serini</hi> by the Grandees of the Imperial Army, which not being vindicated by the Emperour, seem to have been cast upon him by his express Order, or at least to have been willing for some private respects, to have the person of <hi>Serini</hi> abased, and his actions obscured. It is therefore to be noted (what before hath been said) That the first pretence the Turks made for this War, was this Fort of <hi>Serinswar,</hi> raised against the Capitulations and Articles of the last Peace; for which, though the violence against <hi>Varadin</hi> may be pleaded as equal, if not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the present breach, to which this was only subsequent, and seemed to be but a just recompence or effect thereof; yet because it was that stone of scandal and offence, which drew after it that deadly War, in which the Emperour unwillingly engaged against the Ottoman Power, and caused him freely to intimate unto <hi>Serini,</hi> his desire rather to see that Fort demolished, than the Peace interrupted; to which <hi>Serini</hi> yielding no Ear, drew upon himself the deserved displeasure of his most gracious Prince, who permitted the act of his obstinacy and disobedience, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a just snare to his own folly. But perhaps, that displeasure which was Justice in the Emperour, might be Envy, and emulation in his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:98602:134"/>
who beholding with jealous Eyes his actions and succesies the Winter before, which enraged his Enemies, and exalted his name to that glory in all the Courts of Christian Princes, that the Pope honoured him with Medals of Gold; the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> with the Order of the Golden Fleece; the French King as a demonstration of his esteem, with a Token of ten thousand Crowns; and Cardinal <hi>Francis Barberini,</hi> with a Pension of eight hundred Crowns a Month; and all other European Princes, at least made the most part applications to him by Congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Letters, admiring his Virtues, and applauding his Successes; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting their Gazets and Diurnals, Weekly to divulge and publish his praises. From whence may rationally be collected, the true occasion of that Envy, which by cold assistances, and slow succours, obstructed as well the taking of <hi>Kanisia,</hi> as the valiant defence of <hi>Serinswar,</hi> which was decryed, not only as a Fort erected without due and mature consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, but without art, or regular proportions, which might render it tenable; accusing at the same time as well the rashness and temerity of <hi>Serim's</hi> Counsels, as his want of judgment and experience in Military Affairs.</p>
                     <p>But to leave now the sad subject of the Christian misfortunes, occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by their own quarrels and dissentious, which the Grand Enemy of Gods Church always endeavoured to sow for advancement of his own Kingdom: Let us cast our Eyes on the other parts of unhappy <hi>Hungary.</hi> The Siege of <hi>Kanisia</hi> being raised, and <hi>Serinswar</hi> taken, and demolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, success had swelled, and puffed up the minds of the Turks to a height that nothing seemed difficult or impossible to their desires.

Upon approach of <hi>Husaein</hi> Pasha, the Christians gave way, and retreated, intending to receive their Enemy in a larger Field, and afford an occasion to them of greater confidence in execution of the design they came to act. The Turks supposing the Christians to be fled for fear, with more boldness marched forward. And believing this retreat to proceed rather of fear than policy, continued to contemn the pusillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Christians, and lest it should argue too much regard and esteem of their Force, vouchsafed not to send Scouts abroad, either to view their Camp, or to prevent surprisal: but some of their Officers wisely considering, that a Souldier ought never to despise his Enemy, they were perswaded to send a considerable Body of Horse, to view and discover the Enemies Force, who in the way, meeting with a party of the Christians, after a small Skirmish put them to flight, and taking some Prisoners, brought them before the General; the Prisoners upon Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation confessed, that Count <hi>Susa</hi> was fully resolved the next Morning

The Turks having thus passed the Marsh, made a halt and faced the Christians until Noon; who moved not a foot from their ground, that so they might obtain the advantage of the Sun; which in the Morning being in their Faces, would upon declining be an offence unto the Turks.

This Army before your Eyes, consists in part of <hi>Moldavian,</hi> and <hi>Valachian</hi> Christians, forced to this War by compulsion, not of choice; the rest are either Turks educated in the sostness of <hi>Asia,</hi> or Tartars who never made advantage by Battle, but by flight; these are they with whom you have this day to contend before the Walls of <hi>Lewa,</hi> where many of your Wives, and Children, and Friends, are immured, and are Spectators of your Vertue and Courage: Let us therefore valiantly address our selves to this Battle, on the success of which the fortune of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> depends.</p>

                        <head>The Speech of <hi>Husaein</hi> Pasha to his Souldiers.</head>
                        <p>WHilst our General the Grand Vizier is so successful in his Arms abroad, having subdued the strong Fortresses of <hi>Oywar</hi> and <hi>Serinswar,</hi> and struck a terrour and amazement to all the Enemies of our formidable Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; let not us be unactive, or want our share in the renown and fame of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph and Victory. I shall not need to put you in mind of the glorious exploits of your Ancestors, whose Valour and Vertue, which formed this vast Empire round about us, you ought now to imitate, and give the World new prooss, how emulous you are to exceed the Courage and bravery of former times. The other divisions of the Ottoman Power have contended hitherto with their Enemies on unequal terms, and droven them forth from their shelters of Trenches and Bulwarks; but here you have an open Field to fight, nothing between you and the naked Breasts of your Enemies; we stand in equal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and terms with them; nothing can win the day but only Valour, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lose it but meer Cowardice. These are the shattered Companies we have expelled last Year from <hi>Oywar,</hi> and the Companions of those, whose Bodies and Heads we have heaped before <hi>Strigonium:</hi> should we submit to be subdued by these, whom our <hi>Osmanlees</hi> have so often Conquered; we should not only stain our selves with the highest infamy and shame, but give a turn to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Fortune of the Ottoman Arms.</p>
                        <p>By this time it was Noon, and the Sun turning it self from the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian to the Turkish Army, a Warning piece was fired from the Christian Camp, at which sign their whole Army began to advance, and with chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullness to approach the Turks, who stood ready to receive them. At the <note place="margin">

Whereupon the Moldavians, and Vala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians, sinding themselves half famished, forced their Princes to return home, being glad of the occasion to acquit themselves of the Turkish <note place="margin">The Moldavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Vala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians return home.</note> Wars, in which they were used more like Slaves than Souldiers. The Princes though sensible of the danger this unlicensed departure, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion of the Wars might bring upon their persons, were yet necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to yield to the violence and mutiny of their Souldiery: in their march homewards they encountred no difficulties or opposition, unless at the <hi>Tibiseus,</hi> where a small number of Turks would have denied them passage, but were soon dispersed by the Sword of the resolved Souldiery, who having conducted their Princes to their usual Courts, made an end betimes of this Years Campagna. <hi>Husaein</hi> Pasha in the mean time, being denied entrance at <hi>Strigonium,</hi> fled to <hi>Newhausel,</hi> where his presence was most acceptable for reinforcement of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Of the Turks were killed in this Fight 6000, of the Christians 150; none of Quality, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting one <hi>Kovari,</hi> a worthy and stout Hungarian Captain; 4000 Carts were taken, laden with all sorts of Provision and Ammunition for War; about 100 Colours, and a great number of Tents, and Arms of all sorts; twelve pieces of Cannon, about 1000 Horse; and 140 Camels, straying in the Fields, without care of Keepers, or Riders, with great: Droves of Cattle of all sorts, and other good booty and spoil, which remained as a reward to the Conquerour. The number of Prisoners was not great, by reason that the Souldiery, in heat of the pursuit, and in revenge of the Turks Cruelty towards the Garrison of <hi>Komar</hi> the less, whom lately in a barbarous Cruelty they had put to the Sword, were wholly inclined to slaughter and destruction, only about 700 Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davians, and Valachians, were spared until they came in sight of <hi>Strigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi> where they erected several Gibbets, and hanged them thereupon, with their Muskets about their Necks, requiting (as they supposed) part of the Viziers Cruelty, and executing part of Gods Justice upon those who profess the name of Christ, and yet sight under the Banner of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet.</hi>

looking on their condition as desperate, gave fire themselves to their Wooden Buildings, passed the Bridge, and recovered <hi>Strigonium.</hi> The Town thus abandoned, the Christians had no difficulty to get possession, but entering quietly in, seized what was remaining of value, and adding to the flames, by other fires, in a few hours reduced all to Ashes; <note place="margin">Farcan burnt.</note> which being done, <hi>Soisé</hi> marched back to <hi>Komorra,</hi> to refresh his men, and take Counsel what ought to be the next design and enterprize to be taken in hand. And here for a while was a pause, or full point of the actions of <hi>Soisé,</hi> who not wanting Adversaries in the Imperial Court, emulous of his happiness and fortune, instilled such suspicions and scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples into the mind of the Emperour and Council, as caused <hi>Soisé</hi> to give up his Commission, that he might seek a life private, and free from the evil tongues of the envious, until afterwards his Vertues dispers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those malignant Clouds, he was restored to the good opinion of his Cesarean Majesty, and honoured with the Charge and Command of the strong Fortress of <hi>Komorra,</hi> where I my self had once the honour to make him a Visit, and was courteously received by him. This ill suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of the Pasha of <hi>Buda</hi> arrived the Viziers ears, whilst he was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to pass the River <hi>Rab,</hi> in which were many difficulties, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Banks were defended by the Christian Palanchas, which in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very adventure cut off considerable numbers of men. At which loss of men, and time, and the ill success near <hi>Lewa,</hi> the Vizier being greatly moved, made another attempt on the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>July;</hi> advancing with the Gross of his Army as far as <hi>Kemend,</hi> where the River runs narrow and shallow, but by the valour of the Hungarians, Germans, and French conducted by General <hi>Montecuculi,</hi> an Italian born, were repulsed with some Slaughter.</p>
                        <p>On the first of <hi>August,</hi> the Turks made another considerable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, <note place="margin">The Turks with part of their Army pass the Rab.</note> having planted Guns on the Banks of the River, which shot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Christian Camp, and passed over in one place six thousand Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries and Albanians, and near a Village called <hi>Chiesfalo,</hi> where the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was narrow and shallow, very considerable numbers of Horse crou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded over. At which formidable sight, the Christians collecting their Forces together, retreated to a more spacious place, where might be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Field sufficient for both Armies to draw up and join Battel. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout half the Army having now passed the Water, the other part, in which was the Vizier, remained still on the other side, intending the next Morning to follow and advance to the Body, which was gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but it happened, by Gods Providence, that that very Night there <note place="margin">The Rab swells with immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Rains.</note> fell such a Deluge of Rain, as immediately made the River to swell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove its Banks, and become altogether unpassable without a Bridge or Floats; so that the Turkish Army being now divided by the Waters, were uncapable of yielding any sudden assistance each to the other. Howsoever, the Vizier judging that that Part of his Army which had already passed, was an equal Match for the Christians, entertained not the least diffidence of good success, at least supposed they might be able to decline a Battel, until by abatement of the waters (which could not be long at that Season of the Year) he were enabled to pass, and join his main Body with them; and therefore full of hope and confidence, having at first discomfited the forlorn hope of the Christians, which consisted of a thousand men, dispatched immediately Messengers to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Grand Signior of his success and passage, which News he
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:98602:137"/>
knew would be the more grateful, because the Grand Signior by daily Letters and Commands urged him to proceed in his March, and not to suffer the impediment of a narrow Ditch to be an interruption to the whole Ottoman Force, which in former times was not restrained by the depth or breadth of the Ocean. The Grand Signior having received this Intelligence, as if the intire Victory and Triumph over the World con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in the passage over the <hi>Rab,</hi> was transported with such an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary joy and assurance of Victory, that to anticipate the good News a solemn Festival was ordained for the space of seven days, and seven nights, called by the Turks <hi>Dunalma;</hi> in which time the whole nights were made light with Lamps and Candles, and made chearful with great <note place="margin">The Turks vain joy.</note> Guns, Vollies of Muskets, Sound of Drums and Trumpets, revellings and what other Solemnities might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> joy and triumph. But scarce three Nights of this vain Dream had passed, before the Grand Signior awakened by intelligence, contrary to his assured expectation, of the Defeat and Destruction of a considerable Part of the Viziers Army, shamefully commanded the Lights to be extinguished, and the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing four Nights designed for Joy, to be converted to Melancholy and Darkness: And though the rashness and vain fancy of the Governors was the sole cause of this precipitate mirth, yet as great men love always to charge their errours and follies on the shoulders of others, so the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan accused the Chimacham, through false Information, to have been the Authour of this shameful Decree; and in that fury, calling the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner, had certainly taken off his head, had not his young Minion, <note place="margin">Signifies the Son of a Kul, or Slave.</note> or Favourite, now called <hi>Kul Ogli</hi> (promoted to the Preferment of <hi>Asan,</hi> before mentioned) with much earnestness and Prayers interceded for his Life.</p>
                        <p>And indeed this Joy and Triumph was so much more ridiculous and shameful, by how much more fatal and destructive was the ensuing Event. For the Turks being now got over the River, had not, at first, time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough given them to cast up Earth, but were forced by the Christians to an Engagement; For the Christian Army was drawn into Battalia to receive them. The right Wing consisted of the Austrian Forces, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Montecuculi</hi> himself; The Left was formed of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> commanded by Count <hi>Olac,</hi> to which was adjoined forty Troops of the French Cavalry, conducted by Monsieur <hi>Coligni,</hi> and the main Body was commanded by the Marshal General Marquis <hi>Bada,</hi> which composed a very formidable Body, and assailed the Turks with extraordinary Valour; the Fight was very furious, and began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout nine a Clock in the morning on the third of <hi>August,</hi> and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till four in the Afternoon with variable fortune; during which time the Waters being abated, the Spahees passed over in several places, and charged the left Wing of the Christians, and in other places they made attempts, only to divert the Army, whilst the Janisaries threw up Earth to secure a passage for the rest; which when the Christians espied they at first resolved to sound a Retreat, but afterwards, perceiving that the Trench was but newly begun, <hi>Montecuculi</hi> drawing up the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Army into a half Moon, attacked the Janisaries on all sides with that fury, ordering the Bodies of Horse to contend with the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hees; that the Turks now faintly fighting began to give ground to their Enemies, at which instant turn of Fortune, an outcry was heard, That <hi>Serini</hi> on the other side had set on the Viziers Camp; which so animated

This defeat though in Christendom not greatly boasted, by reason that the destruction of the Turks, which was most considerable by the Water, was partly conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, yet the Turks acknowledge that Ruine and Slaughter to have been of a far greater number than what the Christian Diaries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, confessing that since the time that the Ottoman Empire arrived to this greatness, no Stories make mention of any Slaughter or Disgrace it hath suffered to be equal unto the calamity and dishonour of this.

The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, the fury of <hi>Serini</hi> and <hi>Soisé,</hi> whose zeal without consideration of irritating the Turk, or fear of moving the passion of the Lyon beyond the terms of an easie pacification, transported them to commit all damage and ruine, which are the just concomitants of War; which rage seemed over-violent to the Court at <hi>Vienna,</hi> and not to suit with the present Policy of the War, which was designed to be carried on rather in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive than in an offensive posture; imagining perhaps, that the good nature of the Turk might be complemented into Peace, and that gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness and generosity might have the same effect upon them, as it had upon <hi>Saul,</hi> when <hi>David</hi> had his life at his mercy, and yet spared him: according to which counsels of the Court, <hi>Montecuculi</hi> squaring every particular of his motions, and thereunto adding success, mounted on the wings of Fame, and had his Glory celebrated without diminutions; but the hot and zealous temper of <hi>Serini,</hi> which Souldier-like understood nothing but down-right blows, knew not how to use that moderation and caution, which the Imperial Court judged an ingredient so requisite to the prudent management of the present War, that he was esteemed uncapable of command, who had not discretion enough to practise it: and this was the true reason that <hi>Serini</hi> was discountenanced, and that his Command was taken from him, and that his Appeal to the Court was
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:98602:139"/>
without redress: howsoever in regard that the Fame he had won car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him high in the esteem of all Christendom, he was entertained with hopes and fair promises; and even after the very Battle of <hi>Rab,</hi> nothing was more commonly discoursed than the giving <hi>Nicholas Serini</hi> a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand independent of any other General: but in the end it proved no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but vain Proposals to humor the fancy of <hi>Serini</hi> himself, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <p>With this News the Turks remained greatly ashamed and dejected, having but two days before demonstrated excesses of joy, congratulated the happy News one to the other, and after their manner sent Presents abroad, derided the Christians upon the News, exprobriated them with a thousand injuries, and applauded their own Vertue, Valour, and the righteousness of their Cause and Religion: but on a sudden Intelligence coming contrary to their expectations, such a dampness fell upon their spirits, that for some days there was a deep silence of all News at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople;</hi> they that the day before sought for Christians to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to them the Miracles of their Victory, now avoided their Company, ashamed of their too forward joy, and the liberty they had taken to contemn and deride the low condition of the Christian Camp.

                        <p>The minds of the Souldiery after this defeat were very much discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, <note place="margin">Sedition in the Turkish Camp.</note> tending more to sedition than obedience. Every one took licence to speak loudly and openly his opinion, that the War was commenced upon unjust and unlawful grounds.

All generally accused the first Vizier as the Author and ill Manager of the War, <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quissima <note place="margin">Tae. in Vitâ A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gricol. e.</note> bellorum conditio est, prospera omnes sibi vendicant, adversa uni im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putantur,</hi> and calling to mind the solemn Oath with which Sultan <hi>Solyman</hi> confirmed his Capitulations with the Emperour, particularly vowing never to pass the <hi>Rab,</hi> or place where the Turks received their defeat, without a solid and reasonable ground of War, concluded that this Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was a violation of the Vow, and an injury to the sacred Memory of that fortunate Sultan, and therefore that all Enterprises and Attempts of this War would be fatal and destructive to the Mussulmen or Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and the end dishonourable to the Empire.</p>
                        <p>This opinion was rooted with much superstition and strength of fancy in the minds of the Vulgar: and the rumorsin the Camp that the Vizier upon a false Alarm of the approach of the Enemy towards his Quarters, had commanded the Army to retreat, administred fury and courage to the Christians, and fear and amazement to his own; from which errour and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity was occasioned that slaughter which ensued; on which discourses and reports dangerous discontents daily increasing in the hearts of the souldiery, it is thought, they would have vented their passion, and revenge on their General, had he not at a publick Assembly of all the Heads and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of the Army cleared himself freely, by charging the miscarriage
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:98602:139"/>
of all upon the Grand Signior, having acted nothing but with Authority of the Imperial Command, promising with as much speed as honour and safety would permit, by agreement and composition of Peace to bring the War to a conclusion. And this contrivance and art was that (as is supposed) which for the present secured his life; for the Souldiery were greatly terrified and possessed with a dread of the Christians, and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon every Alarm. For the old and experienced Commanders and Veterane Souldiers were either destroyed by the secret Proscriptions of the Vizier <hi>Kuperlee,</hi> or slain in the Engagements of this Year, and the Asian Spahees and other Souldiers having wives and children, and possessions to look after, were grown poor, and desired nothing more than in peace and quietness to return to their homes: so that nothing could come more grateful to this Camp, no largesses or donatives could pacifie the minds of the Souldiery more than the promises and expectations of a Peace.</p>
                        <p>The Sultan during these disturbances and misfortunes was preparing <note place="margin">The Grand Signiors hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Yamboli.</hi>
                           </note> for a hunting Journey to an obscure Village called <hi>Yamboli,</hi> about three or four days travel from <hi>Adrianople,</hi> designing to drive all those vast Woods along the Black Sea for Game, where he had a small ruinous Seraglio. The Queen-Mother, the Chimacam, with all the Court, were to accompany him. The Equipage and Pomp he went in perswaded many, that the design of that Journey was grounded on other causes of Policy, than what were generally penetrated: some conceived, that the Vizier contrived his Journey thither, to divert him from opportunities of receiving Intelligence from Spahees, and others of the true state of the Camp, and management of Affairs: others judged it might be to avoid in that obscure place the mutinous seditions of the Souldiery. On what consideration soever it might be, the Grand Signior having spent some time abroad, returned again to <hi>Adrianople</hi> with all his Retinue, without doing any thing more important than killing great numbers of wild Beasts, and ennobling those Wildernesses and Woods about <hi>Yamboli</hi> with the same of his renowned Hunting. <hi>Keblelee</hi> Pasha being slain (as we have said) before <hi>Scrinswar,</hi> who was Husband to the Viziers Sister, the Vizier bestowed the Widow on <hi>Husaein</hi> Pasha of <hi>Silistria.</hi> And much about the same time the Grand Signior considering that his own Sister, by the death of her old Husband <hi>Ishmael</hi> Pasha, slain in the last Battle, led a single life, conferred her in Marriage upon the old <hi>Mahomet</hi> Pasha, whom before we have related to have been <hi>Kahya</hi> to the Vizier, late Pasha of <hi>Darbiquier,</hi> and now of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> who as an Honour charged with a weight of troubles and other inconveniences, seemed thankfully to receive her; and though he was a man of ninety years of age, and had long since forgot the solaces of the bridal Bed, yet according to the custom of Marriage with a Sultana, he was ingaged to divorce his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Wife, with whom he had past the summer and winter of his age, and as a constant Husband, was still uxorious in his love. So that in the midst of Wars, where some found Graves, others found Marriage-beds, and reason of State found a Vacation to conjoyn <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption of ruder Enterprises.</p>
                        <p>The Great Vizier after his defeat marched to <hi>Stultweissenburg</hi> or <hi>Alba Regalis,</hi> to recruit and refresh his Army, and expect the Recruit of the Pasha of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> who was said to bring with him about eight thousand Souldiers.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="172" facs="tcp:98602:140"/>
From <hi>Stultweissenburg</hi> the Turks, with the gross of their Army, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Strigonium,</hi> and here the Vizier not unmindsul of the shameful flight, and rebellious return of the Princes of <hi>Moldavia</hi> and <hi>Valachia</hi> to <note place="margin">Vizier sends for the Princes of Moldavia and Valachia.</note> their own Countries without his order or permission, sent one Messenger after the other in great haste and fury after the Turkish manner, to recal those Princes to the War, and that laying aside all excuses whatsoever, they should immediately, with what Forces they could collect, repair again to the Camp. The Princes weary of the War, and fearful of the Viziers evil intentions to take away their lives, endeavoured to excuse <note place="margin">The Princes of Moldavia and Valachia recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Wars.</note> their flight, alledging, that their People would not obey, or follow them to the Wars in any considerable numbers, and that now it being the end of the Summer, new Levies would be of great expence, and of little benesit, and disenable them from paying their yearly Tribute; of which (notwithstanding their consumption of Treasure in the last Expedition) they were like to find no ease or relaxation, though a burden too great for their harassed and impoverished Country to support. But these excuses were no arguments to resolved Turks, so that Commands came doubled and trebled one after the other full of threats and menaces, to march forward with what Forces they could collect, the Messengers assuring them, That there was no design prepared against them by the Vizier, but what was friendly and of good intention. At length the Princes not able to remain longer without a censure of Rebellion to the Port, with heavy hearts and light purses set forwards with about fifteen hundred men apiece, sending before such sums of Money and Presents, as they hoped might mollifie and prepare their access to the Vizier, whilst they themselves marched slowly, to afford longer time to the operation of this Physick. The Prince of <hi>Valachia</hi> had intrusted about forty thousand Zaichins to an Officer of his called his Vestiario or Master of his Wardrobe, whom he had sent before him, therewith to make his access easie and safe to the Vizier: of whose faith that he might assure himself the better, he made him swear before the Holy Altar, and take the Communion thereupon, that he would be faithful and active in this Negotiation. The Vestiario thus departing, added to his religious <note place="margin">Fides Graeca, or the honesty of a Greek.</note> Vows, common promises and protestations; but no sooner was he a few miles distant from his Master, before he tired in his Vows, and altered his road from the Vizier to the way leading to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> declaring as he went, That his Prince was become Rebel, and was fled, and that he, not to be Partner in his perfidiousness, was hasting to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> there to give evidence of his faith and submission to the Turks. This unexpected news coming to the Prince, caused him to despair of all security and reconciliation with the Vizier, and force him by flight to make good the words of his treacherous Servant; so that taking with him his Wife and remainder of his Wealth, passed through <hi>Transylvania</hi> with much difficulty, and at length arrived within the Emperours Territories, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving to exchange an inconstant and dangerous Principality for a more secure and private course of life. But this impious Greek did not rest quiet with his ill acquired Estate without receiving disturbance from the Boiars or Nobles of the Country; and <hi>Stridia Bei</hi> the new-made Prince, justly accusing him for having robbed the Publick Treasury, extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him the sum of 150000 Dollars towards his Investment in the Principality, and ease of the Country, which was now wracked for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of old debts, and the growing charges of the new Prince. And
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:98602:140"/>
thus much of the Princes of <hi>Moldavia</hi> and <hi>Valachia.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>At <hi>Strigonium</hi> great were the Consultations, what course was to be taken: The Christians were now Masters of the Field, and the Turks dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, and now the Summer was so far spent, that it was too late to think of recovering their reputation that year with the hazard of a Battel. So that at length it was resolved to unite the shattered Forces of <hi>Chusaein</hi> Pasha, lately defeated by Count <hi>Susa,</hi> to the Army of the Vizier, and attend to secure <hi>Oywar</hi> or <hi>Newhausel</hi> with Provisions, Ammunition, and Reinforcement of that Garrison, whereby this War might conclude with some Trophies of advance, and inlargement of the Ottoman Borders, which in all their Wars is the design and Maxime of the Turks. So that marching thither, they gathered and collected all the Provisions possible, and having supplied the Garrison, they returned again to <hi>Strigonium</hi> with all expedition, retaining still impressions of terrour from the late ill suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess. And that they might march with less impediment, they sent their Artillery and heavy Baggage down the <hi>Daenube:</hi> such was the fear of the Turkish Army at present, that it is supposed, had the Christians eagerly pursued their Victory, they had not only defeated the whole Turkish Force with little opposition, but also without any impediment marched to the very Walls of <hi>Buda.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But what infatuation soever blinded the Christian Counsels, little or no advantage was taken, as if the design of the Emperour had only been to repel the Enemy from his Borders, or that he feared to irritate the Turks with a too inveterate and pertinacious prosecution of his Victories. Instead of which the Vizier making some Overtures of Peace, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing the reality of his intentions by his Presents of a Vest of Sables, and a Horse richly furnished, with which he flattered and caressed the German Resident, the Articles were accepted and embraced at <hi>Vienna</hi> with much greediness, and the Peace almost wholly concluded and clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up in a moment, to the astonishment of the whole World. But as <note place="margin">The reasons which inclined both Parties to Peace.</note> matters of this nature cannot succeed without just and due considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, so on both sides certain causes concurred which inclined and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed things to an accommodation. For on the Turks part there want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not such in the Ottoman Court, who emulous of the Grand Viziers fortune and charge, endeavoured to remove him from the favour of his Prince, by accusing him in many particulars of negligence, and impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the conduct of his Affairs. To answer which, his return with the Olive-branch of Peace in his mouth, and yet the Laurels of Conquest on his head, having added so considerable a Fortress as <hi>Newhausel</hi> to the Dominions of the Empire, and demolishment of <hi>Serinswar,</hi> the Original cause of the War, were a sufficient conviction of the evil accusations of his Adversaries, and an argument irresistible, when inforced by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his own Presence. On the Emperours side, the demand of the City of <hi>Erfurt</hi> by the Elector of <hi>Mentz</hi> situated on his Consines, at a time of so much exigency as this, and seconded by hopes of assistance from <hi>France,</hi> and the Hans Towns on the <hi>Rhyne,</hi> whereby it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable great turbulences might result, inclined the Emperour with much reason to Proposals of Peace; Instructions for which being conveyed to the Resident then in the Turkish Camp from the Caesarean Court, after a short Treaty the Articles were agreed and concluded, as followeth.</p>
                        <p>First, That <hi>Transylvania</hi> remain with its ancient Limits and Priviledges under the Command of Prince <hi>Michael Apasi.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="174" facs="tcp:98602:141"/>
Secondly, That the Emperour of <hi>Germany</hi> have liberty to fortifie both <hi>Gutta</hi> and <hi>Nitra.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, That the Turks shall not alter or innovate any thing on the Confines of <hi>Hungary,</hi> or any other part bordering on the Emperor.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, That <hi>Apasi</hi> pay six hundred thousand Dollars to the Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman Port for expences of the War.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, That all Acts of Hostility between the Emperour, and the Grand Signior, and their Subjects for ever cease.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, That the two Provinces of <hi>Zatmar</hi> and <hi>Zaboli,</hi> granted to <hi>Ragotzki</hi> by his Imperial Majesty during life, return again to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, to which neither the Prince of <hi>Transilvania,</hi> much less the Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Port, shall ever pretend.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, That the strong Castle of <hi>Zechelhyd,</hi> which revolted from the Emperor, be demolished, in regard neither Party will relinquish his Right thereunto.</p>
                        <p>Eighthly, That <hi>Varadin</hi> and <hi>Newhausel</hi> remain to the Turk, having conquered them by force of their own Armes.</p>
                        <p>Ninthly, That for confirmation of this Peace, Ambassadours be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably sent with Presents of equal value.</p>
                        <p>On these Terms (of which none seems disadvantageous to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Interest, unless the fourth Article, the dishonour of which seems to be covered with the name of <hi>Apafi,</hi> though the score was paid by the Emperour) the Peace was established, and the Vizier, as a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereof, gave liberty to many Christian Captives, some whereof were of Quality, and Proclamation was made through all the Confines for a Cessation of Armes. Howsoever, some petty matters remained undecided, which were deferred until the Arrival of an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ambassadour, who was to exchange with the Turks another Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour in the Month of <hi>May</hi> following; and in the mean time sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension of Armes, and all other Hostilities was confirmed. At which News all sorts of People amongst the Turks were greatly rejoyced, and the Publication thereof the more welcome, by how much the more unexpected. Whereby we may observe the alteration of that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Martial disposition, which was natural to this Empire, which whilst it was exercised in War, grew hardy, active and inured to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like exercise, but now through Idleness and want of War (except the Venetian, which affords the Souldiery no considerable employment) their minds became resty, wearied with one year and a halfs labour, and dejected with the unprosperous success of one Summer.</p>
                        <p>But what Considerations soever the Emperour might have to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Peace, the Hungarians were highly dissatisfied with it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">The Hungari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans oppose the Peace.</note> it was founded on their proper loss; and that <hi>Newhausel</hi> was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for a price of the common quiet, which none but themselves paid, and yet all <hi>Germany</hi> enjoyed the benefit. That that Town was an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendage to the Kingdom of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and to which the Emperour ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only the claim (as they pretended) of an Elective Prince, could not dismember any part without consent of the States thereof; and this position they maintained with that heat and fury, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared themselves disobliged from observation of the Articles, resolving to vindicate their own right in despight of all opposition whatsoever; and that since the Emperour had undertaken their Protection he was bound to assert their freedom, and defend their Cities, even with the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:98602:141"/>
expence of his own Treasury, and at the hazard of his own hereditary Possessions. But to these exorbitant Demands the Emperours Council replyed with these following reasons and moderation; That they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were the first Beginners and Promoters of this War; That His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty at their instance and request condescended to protect them as Subjects, not only with draining of his own Exchequer, and blood of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial Dominions, but with the charge of hired and mercenary Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. In the mean time what assistance had the Hungarians brought to this War or to their own defence? What Contributions did they ever make? What Forces did they ever unite in the Field by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral assent of their whole Kingdom? Notwithstanding his Majesty was ready to continue the War, could they themselves propose either a safe way for the maintenance of it, or that the present Conjuncture did not offer honourable Conditions of a happy Composure? Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <note place="margin">The Emperors Reasons for a Peace.</note> That the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> his Uncle, and Father in Law, being aged and decrepit, leaving no other Heir than an insirm and sickly Child, to support the charge and weight of all his Kingdoms, it was requisite that at such a time as this, he should be free from all incumbrances, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to assist the Infant in Administration of the Government, or to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert his own Rights (if so it should please God) in the Succession. And that now, since a Treaty was on foot for Election of a Successour to the Kingdom of <hi>Poland,</hi> it was necessary for His Imperial Majesty to bear his part in that Transaction; but above all, it was considerable, That the common Enemy being rich and powerful, God had seemed to put his Victory into their hands to no other end than to improve it unto a Peace, which being at this time neglected, the best that could ensue would be the miseries of War, which turning on the inconstant Wheel of Fortune with variety of successes, is always attended with Slaughter, Captivity, Fire, Sword, and a thousand other Calamities. These, and such like reasons, moderated and mollified the exasperate spirits of the Hungarians, so that they seemed to acquiesee and be satisfied, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Vertue of Necessity, had patience where there was no other remedy.</p>
                        <p>The sudden News of this unexpected peace did in like manner affect the French King, and the States of the Empire, judging it unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them to be interested in the War, and yet unconcerned in the Conclusion of the Peace. Howsoever, things being well represented, and as well received and understood; his Most Christian Majesty accepted of the Reasons as just and satisfactory. In the mean time the French had a <note place="margin">The French Army march homeward.</note> free liberty to make choice of their Winter Quarters, which they fixed upon in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> but their King being unwilling to burden the Country with his Souldiers for a longer time than they were serviceable to them, he ordered them to march, and quarter in <hi>Alsatia;</hi> but before their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture the Emperour honoured Monsieur <hi>de Coligni</hi> with his Picture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circled with Diamonds, and the other Officers with Gold Chains and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals; ordering the Troops not to march above ten miles a day, and every third to be a day of repose, and to be entertained all the way at free Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, so as to return into <hi>France</hi> jocund and healthy, as they departed thence. But before they would bid adieu to those Countries, the General and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers paid their Visit to Count <hi>Nicholas Serini,</hi> presenting him with a Horse, Furniture, and Pistols, as a small Tribute to that Great Captain, whose Fame was celebrated through the whole world, ingenuously confessing, That the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:98602:142"/>
rumour of his name struck more amazement and terrour in the Enemy, than the Armies that actually faced them, and was more instrumental in obtaining the Victory on the Banks of <hi>Rab,</hi> than their weapons or cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage which fought against them. But not long after this worthy Heroe <hi>Serini</hi> hunting one day separated from the rest of his Attendants in the Thickets of a Wood, behold, on a sudden was surprized by the rushing forth of a wild Boar, which raging, and made furious by some Wounds he had received, first struck him in the Knee, with which falling to the ground, the fierce Beast not giving him leisure to recover himself, gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched him again in the head with his broad Tusk, which proved so mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, that in a short time he expired in the Arms of one of his Pages. This <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Serini's</hi> Death.</note> was the end of this valiant Captain, who unconquered in many and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled Conflicts of his Enemies, was made the prey of an ignoble Beast. Such are the secret and occult Providences of Heaven, which men interpret or reflect on as they are governed by prejudice or interest. And so did the Turks attribute the Fall of this their Grand Adversary to the righteousness of their Religion, and justness of their Cause; as if he had been a person unworthy to dye by the hand of a man, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be executed by that Beast, which is most abominated and detested by the Turkish Rites. He was a Person as mortal an Enemy to the Turks, as ever <hi>Hannibal</hi> was to the Romans; in Dangers most cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious, <note place="margin">The Character of <hi>Serini.</hi>
                           </note> in War valiant, and patient of labour, in Peace courteous, and moderate in his Pleasures; his Diet was natural, rather than artificial; in Bankets, or Drinking Meetings, after the fashion of that Country, was sparing in Wine, and rather abstemious than intemperate; Musick and Dances were the Entertainment of the softer and effeminate Part of his Court, rather than his own Pastimes, whose Recreations were chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Woods, and in fuch Huntings as had something in them of si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude with Martial Exercises; his Judgment was profound and deep, and yet his familiar Discourse facetious; his Conversation obliging, his humour affable, and yet severe and majestick; he spake much, and yet well, his disposition was liberal and generous, especially to his Souldiers, whom he never restrained or defrauded of their Booty and Prey, but contented every one with a just and exact Division. In short, he was one of those zealous Champions of the Christian Cause, who in the Chronicles of past Ages ought to be placed and numbred amongst the worthiest Heroes.</p>
                        <p>The Winter now approaching, and a conclusion in all appearance made of the War, the Vizier returned to <hi>Belgrade,</hi> designing to remain there until the German Ambassadour had entered the Turkish Borders, and in the mean time sent for his Mother thither, pretending that in an uncertain and changeable estate the Maternal Blessing is of highest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation, <note place="margin">The Vizier sends for his Mother to <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade.</hi>
                           </note> it being esteemed pious amongst the Turks for a man to die at the Feet of his Mother. This Mother of his was esteemed a cunning or wise Woman, by whose Charms and Incantations his Father, and he were supposed long to have conserved the Office of Vizier; and as my own Ears can witness the common Souldiers Discourse, That his Mothers Art consisted much in Philtrums and Charms, reconciling affection and friendship, and had a power over the Grand Signiors Inclinations and Understanding, rendring all things and actions the Vizier had perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this War full of merit and admiration. This I say was the Discourse of some common Souldiers.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="177" facs="tcp:98602:142"/>
In the month of <hi>December,</hi> that Blazing-star which appeared formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to most parts of the known World, was also seen within the Turkish Empire, not without a general terrour of all, as prognosticating disasters <note place="margin">The Blazing-star.</note> of Sword, Pestilence, and Famine; and set the Turkish Astrologers at work to find out the mystery it portended: from whose Art most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly was divined the death of some great Person in the Empire, which some would have to be the Grand Signior, others the Vizier, others both, as they desired alteration and change of Government.</p>
                        <p>The Grand Signior continued all this time at <hi>Adrianople</hi> taken up with <note place="margin">The Sultans hatred to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases.</note> an extraordinary delight and pleasure in his Court there, with which his aversion to <hi>Constantinople</hi> so much increased, that he could not endure so much as the name of the place: and if accidentally in his Hunting (as is reported) he chanced to fall into the road which led thither, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring himself thereof, would immediately turn thence, as one that corrects himself of some desperate errour, or avoids a path which tends to an evitable destruction. The Kadelescher and the other grave Judges of the Law observing this unreasonable hatred of their Prince to his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Seat, considered how prejudicial it was to him and his People to have a City of that renown, antiquity, and commodiousness of living despised and abandoned: and that perhaps the Souldiery now upon their March from the War, might be impatient of returning home, as all the Dependents on the <hi>Divan,</hi> and Personages of great Quality, desired to injoy their Habitations and Gardens at <hi>Constantinople;</hi> from which discontent on all sides it was concluded, That there might result dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Seditions and Mutinies, and therefore resolved (and as some say also at the instigation of the Vizier) to prostrate themselves before the Grand Signior, and tender him their opinions and sence in that particular, which they accordingly performing and assigning the Kadelescher, or the Chief Justice with all humility to be their Mouth in this Petition, their counsel was received with that indignation, that they were chased from the Grand Signiors presence with fury and high displeasure, and the Kadelescher at that moment deprived of his Office.</p>
                        <p>To these other extravagances the Grand Signior would have added another of a higher nature and cruelty, by causelesly putting to death <note place="margin">The Sultan seeks to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> his Brother <hi>Solyman,</hi> whom all the time of his Raign, together with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Brother, he had kept Prisoner in the Seraglio: for now having a Son of his own, he conceived it more secure to remove all competition that might be for the Government, according to the example and custom of the Ottoman Princes; but suffering some remorse of conscience in the thoughts of imbruing his hands in the blood of his guiltless Brother, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it more justifiable to perform the Fact by process of Law, and to that end sent to the Mufti for his Fetfa or Sentence, <hi>viz.</hi> That in such a case, where there is a sufficient provision for continuance of the true Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of the Ottoman Family, whether it may be lawful, according to their Law and ancient Presidents, to take off some as superfluous Suckers, that draw not only nourishment from the root, but endanger also the life of the Tree. But the Mufti was not so cruel or unjust as to pass this sentence, but rather supplicated the Grand Signior to defer this resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for having but one Son, and that a Child, which was subject to the common chances of mortality, the Ottoman Family was not so sufficiently provided of Heirs, that he could pass his sentence for taking away one who was so necessary a reserve and member of it; with which reply the

Grand Signior suffered himself to be overcome, having some touches of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1665"/> conscience, and perhaps not being naturally cruel some sense of compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion towards his innocent Brother.</p>
                        <p>But returning now to the Great Vizier, we find him in his Winter-quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters at <hi>Belgrade,</hi> where having taken an affection to the elder Son of the Tartar <hi>Chan,</hi> or else having conceived some hatred or displeasure against the Father, frankly proffered to depose the Father, and confer the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment <note place="margin">The Vizier of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to depose the Tartar <hi>Chan.</hi>
                           </note> upon him who was the Son. But it seems this young Tartar, though barbarous, had yet so much of filial obedience and reverence instamped on him by Nature, that he modestly refused the proffer, and immediately dispatched a Messenger with secret Advices to his Father. The Tartar <hi>Chan</hi> received this Intelligence with great indignation, and purposing to play that game in reality with the Vizier, which he had passed on him only by way of overture, wrote a Letter to the Pasha of <hi>Buda,</hi> a man of great abilities and courage, advertising him, that hearing a true and worthy character of his prowess and wisdom, he could not but desire to be his friend; and that he might make demonstrations of his being such, he prossered all the interest he had at the Ottoman Court to promote him to the supreme Office of first Vizier. What Fate so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever accompanied this matter, either from the Confidents of the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, or of the Pasha, the substance of the Message came to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Vizier, who obtaining a private Commission immediately from the Grand Signior therein, sent for the Pasha, and without farther process, or evidence of proof, or accusation struck off his Head.</p>

                     <p>The Spring being now well forward the time of action, and the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer at hand, the Turks remained with great expectation of the German Ambassadour; and with greater impatience, in regard that their Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador had for some time continued upon the Frontiers. It was now <hi>May,</hi> and yet no news from <hi>Germany;</hi> so that many began to doubt the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Peace, others reflected on the dishonour of the Grand Signior, in having his Ambassadour so long on the Frontiers, as if the Peace had been precarious and desired by the Turks: some considered the present ill consequences, in case the War should break out again; for the licence was given to the greatest part of the Army to return home, and all such as came as far as from <hi>Babylon, Damascus,</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> to the Frontiers in <hi>Hungary</hi> were departed; and to recal these again, and other Zaims and Timariots <note place="margin">Rumors of the People on oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of stay of the German Ambassadour.</note> from remote parts, required a considerable time, of which their distress would not admit, should the Christians prove deceitful in their Treaty. Besides which, reports were spread abroad, that the French had intercepted the Ambassador in his passage about <hi>Komorra,</hi> and had given an interru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption to the Peace. Others reported, that the Ambassadour was dead in his Journey, and that the Hungarians were again in Arms, as wholly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied with the Peace. These rumors flying about, all people blamed the facility of the Great Vizier in being too credulous, and confident of the faith and morality of the Christians; and the Enemies of the Vizier more boldly adventured to accuse his ill management of Affairs, which did not a little tickle the ambition of <hi>Mustapha</hi> Pasha, then Captain Pasha, and Chimacam of <hi>Adrianople,</hi> supposing that all the disgraces and ill suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses of the Vizier prepared a way for his ascent unto that Office. And to become more popular, being a man naturally of an affable and plausible carriage, insinuated himself into the favour and good opinion of the Great men and principal Favourites of the Seraglio, over-acting his part in some measure by condescensions unbeseeming the degree and dignity <note place="margin">

These passages were not altogether unknown to the Vizier; and though at a distance he could not perfectly view, and discover particularly the comportment of this Chimacam, yet being by conversation well acquainted with his subtle disposition, guessed at his thoughts and the rest of his actions, and to deal with him in the same terms, wrote a Letter to the Grand Signior, bewailing the ill success of the War against <hi>Venice,</hi> and the ill estate and condition of the Fleet, to repair which, and to give courage to their men, and restore the Discipline in marine Affairs, the presence of the Captain-Pasha was necessary in the Fleet, who had now for two years injoyed the benesit and the title without personal attendance on that important Charge. The Grand Signior having received' this Letter, concurred in the same opinion with his Vizier, and gave Orders to the Chimacam to prepare himself to serve that Summer at Sea; for that now it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary he should be in person there, and less requisite his presence in the City, where his Office would speedily be made void by return of the Vizier. The Chimacam immediately in obedience to his great Masters command, put himself in a posture for his Voyage, and in the first place sent away his Women to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and appointed the Fleet not to

depart until his faither order: yet in the mean time so secretly and under-hand made use of the friendship of the Court-Favourites, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting as from themselves, how useful the service and attendance of the Chimacam was as yet in the City, by reason that the delays of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Ambassadour made the Viziers return uncertain, and that this Office would ill be supplied by any other, they obtained licence for his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in Office, and disappointed the intentions and designs of the Vizier.</p>
                     <p>About the end of <hi>May,</hi> after long expectation arrived the German Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour at <hi>Buda,</hi> to the great joy of the Turkifh Camp. I then was there my self, and observed the general satisfaction at this news: so that now the Ambassadour being entred the Frontiers, and his arrival secured, on the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> the Vizier began his March from <hi>Belgrade</hi> with the whole Army, and I kept company with them for thirteen days. On the last of <hi>June</hi> the Vizier arrived within six hours Journey of <hi>Adrianople,</hi> intending in two or three days to prepare for his solemn Entrance. But it is reported, That the Viziers Mother had by her Art so affected the heart of the Grand Signior towards her Son, that he could not longer want his presence, and therefore in the way dispatched frequent Messages to him to hasten him as fast as his convenience would permit. And bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to assure him of his grace and favour, sent his young Favourite, a handsom Youth of about twenty years of age, to meet him with a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of five Horses richly adorned and furnished, and to feast him plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully on the way: and being come within a few hours Journey, the Grand Signior could not contain his desire of seeing him, until the day of his Entry; but ordered him immediately to come to him, being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of a private Conference. The Vizier accordingly obeying, and being come to the Royal Presence, the Grand Signior kissed him on the shoulder, and honoured him with a <note n="*" place="margin">It is in the fashion of a Mace, which the Turks wear at their Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles.</note> Topoose of gold studded with precious Stones, with a Sword, a Dagger, and a Horse richly furnished, with which Regal Munificence he returned triumphing to his Tents, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now fully assured of the real grace and constant favour of his Master. The second of <hi>July</hi> the Vizier made his Entrance with solemn Pomp and Glory through part of the City, passing again into the field to remain under Tents with the whole Camp, being so ordered by the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior, in regard the City was neither capable to contain so great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber without dispossessing the greatest part of the Inhabitants of their Houses; nor in this hot season of the year was it so wholesom and cool as the open air of the Country. Besides matters would be in a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter readiness for a departure towards <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to which place the Vizier had perswaded the Grand Signior to make a Visit after Audience given to the German Ambassadour, whom the people now expected with wonderful impatience.</p>
                     <p>Not many days after arrived Count <hi>Lesly</hi> the Ambassadour Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary from his Caesarian Majesty to the Grand Signior, who made a solemn Entrance into the City, passing first through the Turkish Camp, where the Grand Signior remained, and thence to the House furnished and appointed for him at the expence of the Sultan. The Cavalcade was <note place="margin">The German Ambassadours Entrance.</note> as followeth: In the Front of all were the ten Chaouses which had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Ambassadour through the whole Journey, these were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by an hundred fifty five other Chaouses with Muzevegé, with some Captains over the Janisaries. The Ambassadour had of his own
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:98602:144"/>
Retinue about a hundred and fifty Persons on horse-back, well mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and cloathed after the Hungarian fashion; his proper Guard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted of four and twenty Persons armed with Partisans; before him went his Trumpets, and Kettle Drums, but not sounding, with two Banners of Spread Eagles flying, one of them richly embroidered, carried by a Count of the Empire. The Ambassadour himself was cloathed with a Cloth of Silver Vest, lined with Sables, on his Cap he wore a Feather after the Turkish fashion, adorned with Jewels, which they call (<hi>Sargouch</hi>) and is only used by the Grand Signior, and his principal Vizier; before him went eight led Horses richly furnished; immediately after him fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Pages and Servants of the Spaheelar Agasee, and of the Aga which conducted him from the Frontiers. Next came his Litter covered with Violet coloured Velvet and carried by Mules; then his three Coaches with six Horses a piece, one of which being richly gilded, and made chearful with Glass Windows after the new mode, the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior became much pleased with it, and at his request it was presented to him; after these followed four or five other Coaches of four Horses, in which were Churchmen and unfirm persons; and last of all came the German Waggons, and other Carts with those of the Countrey with Baggage.</p>
                     <p>This Ambassadour was not long arrived before he was admitted to <note place="margin">Audience gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour.</note> Audience with the Prime Vizier, who bestowed on him a Vest of Sables, with a Horse and Furniture of considerable value, and a hundred of his Retinue were vested with Coftans, which amongst the Turks are testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of favour and acceptance. About four days after the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour had Audience with the Grand Signior himself, at which were only forty Coftans given out, which coming from so Grand a Personage, were in value multiplied much above the number given by the Vizier.</p>

sent to hold a Trade in the Turkish Dominions. In answer whereunto the Vizier replied according to the usual complement, That the Arms of the Port are always open to those who desire to entertain a friendship and correspondence with it. But because in former days Ambassadours from <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Genoua</hi> having like promises of admission, were not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, through the union of the English, and French and Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, obstructed in their passage, and forced to return home, though one of them as far as <hi>Scio</hi> in his way, and the other as <hi>Ragusa;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Marquess in remembrance hereof pressed the Vizier farther in his promise, desiring him to give him the assurance, that what opposition might be made to the contrary by other Ministers, he would yet keep firm to that word he had given to his Republick: the Vizier constantly promised that he would; and if any other Ambassadours were not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with the friendship and Treaty of that day, they might seek their remedy as they pleased, and if they pleased might have liberty to depart. The Marquess being satisfied with this assurance, took Letters to his Republick in assurance thereof, and Articles were given, and Priviledges <note place="margin">The Genoese received.</note> for Trade signed according to the Tenour of other Capitulations: and being herewith dispatched, he returned home by Land, and the next year appeared again himself in the Person of Ambassadour Extraordinary to the Ottoman Court; where after high and considerable Presents and great Expences made, chiefly supported by the House of <hi>Durazzo,</hi> a Resident was seated at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and a Consul at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> where we will leave them for a while, and some years after (God willing) take an account of the profit and loss this progging Nation had made by this Embassy and Trade. But before we leave this point, it will be worth our noting, how hainously the French Ambassadour Monsieur <hi>La Haye</hi> took this entertainment of the Genoese, in regard he was so concerned against his admission, that he declared to the chief Ministers of State, how he had received Orders to oppose the entrance of the Genoese Nation as highly prejudicial and obstructive to their Trade; and in fine, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Grand Signior, that in case he resolved to entertain them, his Master would withdraw his Ambassadour and Nation, and therefore they ought to consider, whether a new Friend and an inconsiderable Republick ought to be preferred before the known and approved ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of the powerful Empire of <hi>France.</hi> But whatsoever the French Ministers were able to act to the contrary, the Genoeses kept their stations, in which they were the better secured by those frequent occasions of disgust his most Christian Majesty in defence of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Cause, had given to these Enemies of the Christian Faith.</p>
                     <p>The Great Vizier and the German Ambassadour being now both at the Ottoman Port, the Wars were concluded, and every one began to dispose his affairs to a quiet and a reposed life. But this Empire being still by Gods Providence in a condition of growth and augmentation, could not remain long in Peace, nor long in health without exercise and <note place="margin">The Turks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the War in <hi>Candia.</hi>
                        </note> action. Wherefore no sooner was <hi>Germany</hi> at ease, than the Visier be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to move the prosecution of the War in <hi>Candia,</hi> desiring to obtain the glory of subjecting totally that Island, which for the space of twenty five years had been the principal subject of the Ottoman design and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, and acquire to himself the Fame in History of being Conquerour of <hi>Candia,</hi> and Concluder of the Venetian War. Wherefore the Vizier with several other principal Persons, assembled in a Garden near the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:98602:146"/>
City of <hi>Adrianople,</hi> sent for the Signior <hi>Ballarino</hi> Representative for the Republick of <hi>Venice;</hi> where being come, at the first word demanded of him the Surrender of the whole Island of <hi>Candia.</hi> To which he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly replied, That so great a gift was not in his power to give, and that his office was only to be assistant to that happy hour, wherein all matters might concur towards Peace, and that his Mediation might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute towards a conclusion of this long and tedious War. In the mean time he should acquaint his Prince with the demand the Vizier was pleased to make. To which the Turks added menaces, with high and insolent words, designing to bend their whole force and power against <hi>Candia,</hi> the effect of which will hereafter be a material subject of our History. And thus much, to my best remembrance, I received from the mouth of that Venetian Minister.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the Grand Signior, though he continued his Sports and Hunting, without regard to the violent heats of the Summer, yet he began to entertain something more of warm affection towards his Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and to be reconciled to that Sex, in contemplation of his little Son, who beginning now to play and prattle, afforded him matter of entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Apartments of his Women; so that he affectionately doting on his Queen, gave order for increase of her Revenue and Attendance, <note place="margin">The Grand Signior passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately loves his Queen.</note> and appointed the best Artisans of <hi>Adrianople</hi> to make her a Crown studded with very precious Stones to adorn her Head, of which he was so impatient, that he ordered the Goldsmiths to work in the Seraglio, permitting them scarce time to eat or sleep until it was finished. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of which affection of her Sultan, this Lady so corresponded, that she appeared passionately in love, practising certain pretty tricks of swooning and of an uneasie condition in his absence, which so endeared him in all respects to her, that it was said the Sultan kept himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant to this Queen only, and contrary to the custom of other Emperors, and permission of the Turkish Laws, made use of the multitude of his other Women only for Slaves, or Attendants to the greater state and adoration of his beloved Queen.</p>
                     <p>And now the Grand Signior, at the perswasion of the Vizier and others of his Council, resolving to winter at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> certain Women of the lower rank were dispatched before, as fore-runners of the removal of the Court: and being in the Seraglio at large without observance and awe of their usual Spies, two of the boldest Wenches finding a Cradle, wherein the Royal Infants were usually laid, adventured to pick out the best Jewels, of which some were very good Stones, and afterwards laid it up again in a private place, where it was not easily found. Not many days after the Queen-Mother wanting the Cradle of so much value and antiquity, where many of the young Sultans had lain, sent to the Seraglio at <hi>Constantinople</hi> to fetch it thence. But it not being found, inquisition was made into all secret corners, the Wardrobes were searched, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appeared, to the great fear of those to whose care it was committed, one accusing the other to acquit himself. In fine, the matter was so traced, that some whispers there were concerning those in whose hands the Cradle not long before was seen to remain. The Women having guilty consciences were amazed in being so closely followed, and fearing the matter should be perfectly discovered, entred into consultation what course they should take to save their lives and their honour. In fine, they both concluded, that in such an extremity desperate remedies ought
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:98602:146"/>
to be used, than which none was better than to set fire to the Seraglio, by which means, either the thing sought for would be esteemed for burnt and consumed by the fire, or in so great a loss it might be hoped that <note place="margin">The Seraglio at <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> set on fire,</note> matters of smaller moment would not be remembred. Wherefore the bold Wenches without other consideration gave fire with their candle to the roof of Cedar, of which wood most of the Womens rooms in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio are made, which in a moment made such a flame, as with the help of a little wind, was carried through all the quarters of the Womens Apartments, and thence took its way to the <hi>Divan</hi> Chamber, and other considerable parts of the Court, where many Records and Registers of Law were consumed to ashes, together with one of the lesser Treasuries, where much richess, which endured not the test of fire, perished: and the whole Seraglio had run an evident hazard, had not the Bostangees and other Servants of the Court ventured far into the flames, in which many of them miserably perished. The fire being quenched, and the Women afterwards (I know not how) detected to have been the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors thereof, were sent to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and being there accused, were strangled by the immediate order of the Grand Signior.</p>
                     <p>But the destruction of that considerable part of the Seraglio was no impediment to the Grand Signiors return to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> being rebuilt with that speed and industry, equal or excelling the magnificence of the former, that the day prefixed for the Journey thither was not prolonged by reason thereof. Howsoever the Grand Signiors aversion to the place made the wheels of his Chariots move slow, and the quickness of his Attendants grew slack and cold, observing so much displeasure in their Emperor to the place designed. For though he was pressed by the Vizier to begin his Journey, and could not handsomly refuse to comply with the time appointed; yet to defer this resolution as long as was possible, he contrived a long way of Meander towards <hi>Constantinople,</hi> forming his Journey in Company with the Great Vizier by way of the <hi>Dardanelli</hi> upon the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> on pretence of viewing the Fortifications of the new Forts raised at the entrance of that Streight, and sending some Provisions from thence for Relief of <hi>Candia;</hi> wherefore the Captain-Pasha was commanded to Sea with three Gallies, and at <hi>Gallipoli</hi> to attend the Grand Signiors arrival, being to transport him thence to the Castles, and back again. And the design being now resolved, and hot to prosecute the War in <hi>Candia;</hi> for transporting thither a numerous Army, it was concluded, That the Captain-Pasha should propose to the English Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour the Grand Signiors desire of fifteen Sail of Ships, with consent of our King, for this service, the Turks paying what reasonable Rates should be demanded. But the Earl of <hi>Winchelsea</hi> then Lord Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, modestly replied, That though His Majesty of <hi>England</hi> did always entertain a good affection and a zealous disposition towards the Affairs of the Grand Signior; yet at present the War with <hi>Holland,</hi> and ill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding with <hi>France,</hi> made his occasions for his own Shipping more urgent than usual, and the time most unseasonable to press his Majesty in this particular: by which reply and several other excuses of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour, the Captain-Pasha perceiving an aversness to the Proposition, and that Christians unwillingly arm Turks against the Cross, gave an account of this discourse to the Grand Signior and Vizier, who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately gave order for the building of sixty Gallies against the next Spring, which with what they had before would make up above an
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:98602:147"/>
hundred Sail. The Rendezvous of this Fleet, together with Saykes and other Turkish Vessels, from thence to transport the Vizier and his Army for <hi>Candia,</hi> was appointed to be made at <hi>Malvoisia;</hi> of the success of <note place="margin">The Turks prepare for a War on <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia.</hi>
                        </note> which we shall have occasion (God willing) to discourse in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Year, which gave a beginning (as we may say) to the total loss of that Country and to that famous Siege, which in History will bear the Fame of one of the most memorable in the World. And as a preparation thereunto, and as a supply of the present urgent necessities, three Ships, <hi>viz.</hi> one English, another French, and a third Dutch were laden with Corn, and thirty Sail of Beys Gallies, with all sorts of Arms and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, with a Recruit of a thousand Janisaries, were dispeeded from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> for Reinforcement and Succour of that Island.</p>
                     <p>And now at length the Grand Signior after his long circuit arrived at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where he made his solemn Entry the third of <hi>October,</hi> but not with that Joy and Pomp, which usually attended other Sultans in their return from the Wars and labours to their Imperial City; but all things seemed like the Sultans humour sullen and displeased; for he sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <note place="margin">The Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior arrives at <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
                        </note> lodged in his Seraglio, or slept there, but at a small Palace called <hi>Damt-Pasha,</hi> where he for the most part made his abode; only sometimes in the day he passed a few hours at his Seraglio, but rested not there in the night: the reasons hereof some attributed to the remembrance of those dangers and troubles which he had seen in that Court, and which made so deep an impression on his fancy, that he could never enter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in those Gates without some sense of terrour for the late disorders.</p>
                     <p>The German War being thus concluded, the Sultan returned to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> and Affairs disposing themselves to spend their fury against <hi>Candia,</hi> all things growing black and tempestuous towards that Coast, the Venetians prudently provided to oppose the storm. And as an able <note place="margin">Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> received into service of the Venetians.</note> General, and wise and experienced Captains are the supports of an Army; and that the success of War depends much on Martial Discipline, and on the vigilance and wisdom of the Commanders, the Senate gave order to their Ambassadour at <hi>Turen</hi> called <hi>Catarin Belegno,</hi> to offer unto Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess <hi>Ghiron Francesco Villa,</hi> a Native of that Country, the honourable charge of General of the Foot with a stipend of 12000 Crowns of year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pay; the said Marquess obliging himself to bring with him four Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptains, and two Lieutenant-Generals, for entertainment of whom the Republick allowed five thousand Ducats, besides seventy Ducats a month pay to an Engineer. To this Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> a power was given to command in chief over all, without subjection to any other than to the Captain-General, and to the Proveditor-General in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> when he waged War in that Province: and in short, his actions were not to be questioned or examined by any other than the Senate it self, to whom he was immediately subjected, and a Gally was to be allotted purposely to transport him and his Family to <hi>Candia.</hi> Upon these conditions agreed at <hi>Turen,</hi> Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> took his Journey to <hi>Venice</hi> about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>April,</hi> being accompanied with his Kinsman <hi>Francesco Villa,</hi> his Nephew <hi>Benedetto</hi> Count of <hi>Lagnasco,</hi> Count <hi>Lodovico Saluzzo,</hi> and Count <hi>Bernardino Barretta,</hi> which four served in quality of Captains, together with <hi>Gio. Francesco Pusserla</hi> and <hi>Alessandro Negri,</hi> who were Lieutenant-Generals, and <hi>Gio. Girolamo Quadruplano</hi> Engineer. With these Companions and several other Voluntiers Gentlemen of Quality, the Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> was received with much honour by the Nobility and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:98602:147"/>
People of <hi>Venice;</hi> and being introduced into the Colledge, with a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular grace and fluency of Language he began to speak in this manner.</p>
                     <p>IF thanks, most Serene Prince, and most Excellent Sirs, ought to be equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent <note place="margin">The Speech of Marquis <hi>Villa</hi> to the Senate.</note> to the benefits we receive, I must of necessily (not to appear ungrateful) refuse those favours, which this most Serene Republick is pleased to confer upon me; or resolve to appear ungrateful, because I am unable to make a compensation. But I satisfie my self in this, That as the mind which receives favours, and returns thanks is the same; so that mind which makes acknowledgments with a due sense of them, doth in some measure equal the benefit, though it prove defective in expressions to declare it. I do theresore confess and acknowledge, that the Election you have been pleased to make of me amongst so many conspicuous Persons, unto a Charge graced by most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Predecessours, and in it self most honourable, is a most singular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and an effect of your immense Bounty to me; which though it be limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with some subordination, yet it may serve for the ultimate Goal to a glorious Course of Military labours. I must also farther acknowledge, That as it is the property of this most Serene Republick to receive momentary Services, and to render them eternal by Records in History; so they have been pleased to adjoyn unto my mean deserts a remembrance of the humble devotion which my Ancestors professed towards them: I mean <hi>Alfonso Villa</hi> my great Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, who in that most glorious Fleet at <hi>Lepanto,</hi> whose Sails were the wings of Victory, evidenced his Christian zeal against that People, which issuing from the bowels of Sea-monsters, continue to vent their ancient rage against your most Serene Highness. Nor with less promptness of mind, had my Grandfather <hi>Francesco Villa</hi> and my Father <hi>Guido Villa</hi> consecrated their Powers to your Command; but that the unparallel'd Equity of this most Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Republick gave permission, that one of them should take the charge of General of the Artillery of the Holy Church under the Pope his Supreme Lord, preferring a natural duty before a voluntary service; and that the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entertained in service of the most Invincible <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> in <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> you were pleased to judge, That the service done to a Prince your Confederate, and Son of this Republick, was a service and duty rendred to your selves: so that this Election made of me by this most Serene Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and approved by the singulur goodness of that <hi>Charles Emanuel,</hi> who now reigns, evidences the Destiny of my Family, and obliges me to satisfie that hereditary debt by performances, which my Ancestors entertained only in their wishes. Hence it is, that to this my Election some celestial influence hath concurred, by which I am clearly assured, that your more than humane power is desirous to imitate the Divine, which oftentimes makes use of weak means to operate miraculous effects, that to you only the success may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, and to you only the thanks be returned: that if the Providence of your Serenity, and of this most Serene Republick will be pleased, (as I am assured you will) to imitate the Divine Providence, which cooperates with means, the number and quality of your Troops and plenty of your Provisions, which are the nerves of War, are those means which correspond with the ends you design: and therefore I dare presage, that I shall not only see the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning horns of the changeable Ottoman Planet precipitated into the Sea by the Venetian horn of strength, but those glorious Conquests renewed, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred your Name more bright and resplendent than the Sun it self in his Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental parts. With these auspicious Presages, I feel already in my breast an impatient heat to sacrifiee my life in so worthy a cause, fancying that I serve
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:98602:148"/>
the Universe, whilst I am engaged in the service of the greatest of Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, which communicates delicious Fruit to all People, gathered from those triumphant Palms, which were planted and watered with her own sweat and labours; and resembles her own generous Lion, which continually stands on the Guard in opposition to the common Enemy, that all other people may rest quiet, and repose secure. And thus much, Most Serene Prince, and Most Excellent Sirs, shall suffice to have been spoken by a Souldier, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Eloquence, to whom courage is more requisite than words, and to fight well with the hand, is more laudable than to utter florid Speeches with the tongue.</p>
                     <p>According to the preceding counsel and desire of Marquis <hi>Villa,</hi> the Senate sent by divers Convoys great plenty of Provision and Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Candia,</hi> and fitted their Fleet with all things necessary; and strengthened their Forts both with Horse and Foot drawn out of their Garrisons on the <hi>Terra Firma,</hi> being assisted with men and money from other Princes and States. The Pope gave them liberty to levy four thousand men out of his Countries, the Emperour also furnished them with a considerable Force, to which were made Additions from other Parts of <hi>Germany.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this manner the prudent Care of the Venetians provided for their own safety: But at <hi>Constantinople</hi> things were more quiet, for it being Winter, the Turks made Entertainments for the German Ambassadour, who was first feasted by the Chimacam, and twice afterwards, with much Magnificence, by the Great Vizier at his own Garden, seated on the <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> all difficulties being before overcome, and agreed, unless the deliverance of the poor Captives from the Prison and the Oar, who continued in the torment of expectation between hope and fear, either of liberty or perpetual slavery. Which Treaty though it properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Vizier, to whom the absolute power is derived, yet in formality it was reserved for matter of the last Audience with the Grand Signior, who being desirous to attend his Hunting and Pastime abroad, was in pain, until he had complyed with his Office towards this Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour, whose departure though not some time after designed, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often called upon, to receive his Dispatch from the Grand Signior, was admitted on the 31<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> to his Audience with the same for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality and feasting as is common to all other Ambassadours in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van, or place of Judicature, and received three and forty Costans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on himself and his retinue, and thence being conducted to the Chamber of Audience, with some of the principal Noblemen of his Company, they presented themselves on their Knees, with their Faces on the Ground, according to the Custom of the Eastern Courts; with which occasion the Heer <hi>Reningen,</hi> who had for sixteen or seventeen <note place="margin">The German Ambassadour's last Audience with the Grand Signior.</note> years been Resident for the Emperor, a person grown infirm with Age and the Gout, and his Knees not so active and pliable as the younger sort, coming also to take his turn in this prostrate manner of Worship, was so rudely handled by the Kapugibashees, who assisted on each Arm at the Ceremony, that he not being able to bow his head to easily as others, was thrust down by them with so little consideration or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, that his Brows and Forehead were broken on the Flour; which mischance so disordered him, as put him besides that Speech which he had premeditated in Turkish to address to the Grand Signior; and though he
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:98602:148"/>
curbed what was possible his passion, whilst he remained in the Royal Presence, yet in vain afterwards he vented his Choler with words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those unmannerly Officers without other remedy or satisfaction. The Demands of the Ambassadour were in writing read before the Grand Signior, according to the custom of the Court, and principally concerned the freedom of the Slaves, some of which were then in the Gallies, and Banniard, and others of the most principal in the seven Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Other Demands there were in relation to the State of <hi>Transylvania,</hi> that for the future it might be free from Incursions, in which particular the Turks had already violated the Peace; and that a more orderly Government of Affairs might be observed on the Frontiers, than usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally had passed, as agreed by the last Capitulations. To which the Grand Signior gave no Answer, referring all to the Vizier, only told the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour in short, That he should counsel his Master to beware of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading the Ottoman Dominions, or acting any thing in prejudice of the Peace.</p>
                     <p>The Articles of Peace made between the two Emperours were for the most part a confirmation of the ancient Agreement, only it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided as a new Addition, That the Armies should depart from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of <hi>Transilvania.</hi> Secondly, That the Castles and Forts garrisoned with German Souldiers in that Countrey should be resigned into the hands of the Prince. And Thirdly, There were other particulars added in reference to <hi>Newhausel,</hi> and the Countries adjacent lately conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the Limits of both Emperours, as before declared.</p>
                     <p>But whilst these things were in agitation, and Ambassadours inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably at either Court, the Turks of <hi>Varadin</hi> and <hi>Janoua</hi> made frequent incursions into <hi>Transilvania,</hi> destroying the Villages, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, away great numbers of Captives; and so lately, as about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>August</hi> last, those of <hi>Varadin</hi> conveyed themselves privately under the Castle <hi>Cseh,</hi> and robbed the Horses belonging to that Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, killed some, and carried others into slavery; at which time also two thousand Turks besieged the Castle <hi>Valko,</hi> which they took, and razed to the ground; which Complaints of their Countries Aggrievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Transilvanians intimated to the German ambassadour, as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters already acted contrary to the late Articles of Peace, requesting far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to interpose for a moderation and abatement of their Tribute, which <hi>Kuperlee</hi> had, contrary to Oath and reason, unjustly augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But the Ambassadour seemed so coldly to interpose in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, as taught the Turks to deny his Requests, acquiescing with this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, That it was no breach of Peace the to make incursions on the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, as also without Cannon to rob, and spoil, and skirmish, not exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing five thousand men in number. For it appeared that the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour <note place="margin">The Reasons why the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor interposed notin behalf of <hi>Transylvania.</hi>
                        </note> was most desirous to secure the main points of the Peace, which concerned most the Interest of the Empire, and not hazard it for such like Concernments of <hi>Transilvania;</hi> for though it seemed strange to the World to see a Peace hastily clapt up with disadvantageous Terms on the Emperours side, whilst he was victorious and fortunate in several Enterprizes; yet they that penetrated farther into the State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Empire report, That there was a necessity of making a moderate use of these successes by a fair accommodation, rather than to tempt Providence by a too eager and continued prosecution of the war. For it was observed that the Designs of making the Duke of <hi>Anguien,</hi> Son
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:98602:149"/>
to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> King of <hi>Poland</hi> proceeded forward; and that there was a Combination of a dangerous League amongst the Princes of the <hi>Rhine.</hi> The Divisions between the Germans and the Hungarians encreased; the latter of which are known to be an obstinate sort of People. The Army also of the French was feared in the Bowels of the Empire, under the Command of Monsieur <hi>la Feüvillade,</hi> who under pretence of applying themselves to the assistance of Christendom, were suspected to come with intentions to advance the interest of their King, and force the next Diet to elect him King of the Romans; in order whereunto, and in consideration of farther assistance, they demanded several Towns in <hi>Hungary</hi> to be delivered into their hands, and made extravagant Propositions for Winter Quarters; all which considered, made the German Ambassadour more tender how he entered into Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes with the Turk, which might prejudice the essential points of the Peace, or occasion a new War more destructive to <hi>Germany</hi> through the dangers before intimated, than by the Arms and Hostility of the common Enemy. These Considerations made the Ambassadour less zealous in the matter of <hi>Transilvania,</hi> and in all others which were not really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to his Masters immediate service; so that having no other difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty remaining, than the liberty of the Captives, on the day of his last Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience <note place="margin">The German Ambassadour's Audience with the Vizier.</note> with the Vizier, being the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> he urged with more earnestness their Release, which was in part granted; those of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies were delivered from their Chains and Oars; but such as were of greater Quality in the seven Towers were detained, untill the Emperor had on his part released the Turks of Quality in like manner; and though it was agreed in the Article, That Captives should on both sides be released, yet the Vizier interpreted it to be in respect to Number and Quality, of which I remember to have heard often Complaints, and especially of those poor Gentlemen, then under Irons and restraint, who though afterwards received their freedom, yet for the present en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured more torment in their minds, than if they had never been put in expectation to enjoy their hopes. At the end of the Audience the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour proposed something in behalf of the Religious of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> That certain places of Devotion might be restored them, which were injuriously taken from them by the Greeks; and also that Licence might be granted for re-Edification of some Churches, and Monasteries de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed in <hi>Galata</hi> by the late Fire: To the first of which the Vizier an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, That the Franks with the Greeks of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> should have a fair and equal Tryal at Law about the possession of those places in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and Justice and Right should be done unto the injured; but the latter Proposition he positively denied, for being a matter contrary to their Law and Religion, was not dispensable by his Power, nor ought he to expect a Complement from him, or Gratuity of that nature, which was inconsistent with the honour and conscience of the Donor; but that in any thing else he was ready to yield to his Desires, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might understand the value he put upon his Person, using this Expression, That he was more satisfied that the Emperour had designed so illustrious and worthy a person to this Embassy, than if he had sent him a hundred thousand Dollars more of Present, and at the Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Audience, vested both the Ambassadour and Resident with Sables, which ended with all imaginable satisfaction, and mutual content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

On the 21<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the month of <hi>November</hi> arrived at <hi>Constantinople</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>De Ventelay,</hi> Ambassadour from the French King to the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior, who was Son to the Sieur <hi>De la Haye,</hi> the former Ambassadour, a <note place="margin">An Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour arrives srom <hi>France.</hi>
                        </note> person much talked of before he arrived, a generous and an accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gentleman, and one well practised in the Affairs of that Country. To understand which story the better we must look back to the former Year, at the beginning of which during the German War, and that the Vizier remained in his Winter-quarters at <hi>Belgrade,</hi> a Corrier with Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from his most Christian Majesty to the First Vizier arrived, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed not the occasion of his coming, nor the contents of his Letters with that secrecy, but that those who were imployed in the Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Papers into Turkish, made it publickly known to be no other than a recital of the many provocations his most Christian Majesty had received from the Pirates of <hi>Barbary,</hi> containing a List of the Ships, Men, and Goods they had from time to time seized and made Prize: in vindication of which indignities to his Honour, and in protection of his People, he could not do less than make a War upon those Pirates (for as yet the advice was not come, that the French had deserted <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geri</hi>) in which for the foregoing reasons the Grand Signior ought not to judge himself concerned. And for the Succour given the Emperour, it was not afforded as King of <hi>France,</hi> but as one of the Princes of the Empire, in which capacity, by virtue of his Tenure, he was obliged to contribute such Forces on the like emergencies and distresses of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. And if the foregoing reasons were available with the Sultan to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him (as in reason he ought) to believe he continued in perfect friendship with him, without breach of Articles, he was then ready to send his Ambassadour to reside at the Port, provided it might be Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>De Ventelay,</hi> Son to Monsieur <hi>De la Haye</hi> late Ambassadour there, who was the person that had some time since received indignities from the Vizier <hi>Kuperlee,</hi> that so his Majesty might receive satisfaction, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the very person of Monsieur <hi>De Ventelay</hi> honoured by extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary demonstrations of respect, in reparation of the former affronts. This Messenger having translated his Papers, obtained licence to ride Post to the Vizier, and in the frosts and extremities of the weather in <hi>Jannary</hi> set forward on his Journey; but in his passage through <hi>Adrianople,</hi> visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Chimacam, and desiring his licence in like manner to ride Post to the Vizier on publick affairs, received such a lesson of scorn and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, vented with the extremity of choler against the French Nation in publick Divan, with terms undecent to be repeated: and that in far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther resentment, if he were First Vizier, he would refuse to accept any friendship or alliance with them; but since he was inferiour to the Great Vizier, he would dispeed him to the Camp, and grant him a Command for his Post. But it seems this Corrier being arrived at <hi>Belgrade,</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with better terms, and more courtesie by the Vizier, who had learned by experience of the late Christian Wars, and proof of the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the French Nation, that the Propositions of that King were not lightly to be contemned. And therefore consented that Monsieur <hi>De Ventelay</hi> might freely come (using their common expression) that the Arms of the Port are always open to receive the addresses of Friends, Allies, and Confederates. With this Message and Letters the Corrier was dispatched by way of <hi>Ragusi</hi> with safe conduct, and what else was requisite for his securer passage. No doubt but his most Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:98602:150"/>
was the more urgent, that the person of Monsieur <hi>De Ventelay</hi> (who was the subject on whom formerly the Turks had exercised such injurious violence) should be accepted for Ambassadour, and resolved, <note place="margin">Reflexions of the Turks on the Embassy of Monsieur <hi>De Ventelay.</hi>
                        </note> unless they received him, he would send no other, that so his Honour which suffered before in this person, might be repaired again by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and reverence they were to shew to him as Ambassadour; as if in repentance of their former unkindness, they should now strive to make amends by extraordinary demonstrations of honour to this Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. For it was judged in <hi>France,</hi> and there concluded, That there was no other means to repair the Kings Honour, than by the Embassy of Monsieur <hi>De Ventelay;</hi> to which that a greater reputation might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he was transported in one of the Kings Ships called the <hi>Caesar,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a Fire-ship, and a small Patach for a Victualler, and for his better Equipage was attended by four or five Marquesses and Persons of Quality. Being arrived at the farther part of the City called the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Towers, the Ships came to an Anchor, from whence the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour sent to advise the Vizier of his arrival, desiring as one mark of the extraordinary honour promised him, that a return might be made to the Salute of his Ship from the Seraglio, by the Cannon which lay under the Wall, a Ceremony before never demanded, or practised with respect to any Christian or Turkish Vessel; and that his landing might be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with a more than usual reception by the attendance of Officers, or at least equalled to the Formalities of the late English Ambassadour. But the Vizier it seems judged, that the reception of the English, strain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a particular occasion, was not to be brought into example, and that a Salute from the Seraglio was so besides the ordinary custom, that he esteemed the demand to be extravagant, and that such a President would be dishonourable to his Master. And therefore resolving not to exceed the particulars of former customs, offered at his landing to have him accompanied to his House with ten Chaouses; only the Ambassador not accepting hereof, in a discontented manner entred with his Ship the day following, and giving the usual Salutes to the Seraglio, landed at <hi>Topenau,</hi> a place near to his own Dwelling, from whence with no other attendance than his own Company, privately walked up, and with no farther ceremony took possession of the place of Residence of former Ambassadours from <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding this slight treatment, the Ambassadour was not so much mortified, but he conceived hopes, that the Turks would at length in contemplation of his Masters greatness, gratifie him with some signal demonstrations of extraordinary honour, by concessions of unusual Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and greater facility in his Negotiations: and therefore was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, though as yet he had not had a personal Audience of the Vizier, to desire a revocation of the agreement made with the Genoese, (the Marquess <hi>Durazzo,</hi> of whom we have spoken before, being just upon his departure) protesting against it with all earnestness, as a matter so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the French Traffick and Commerce in those Dominions, that if admission were given to the Genoese, they must expect to lose friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and commerce with <hi>France.</hi> But notwithstanding this heat and other protestations against it, the Vizier who inherited his Fathers spirit, little regarded the discontent of the French, but calmly answered, That the Grand Signior was Master of himself and Country, and might make Peace or War at his own pleasure without licence or permission of the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:98602:150"/>
French King; and that such as were envious, or discontented at the Peace, had free liberty to depart, and take their remedy as they esteemed most beneficial.</p>
                     <p>In this manner matters passed between the time of this Ambassadours <note place="margin">A strange acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent befallen the French Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain of the Man of War.</note> Arrival and his Audience. In which interim the curiosity of Monsieur <hi>Abermont,</hi> Captain of the French Man of War, had like to have proved fatal to him; for whilst he viewed from the Gallery of his Ship the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant situation of the Seraglio, and the Prospect of the <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> behold at a distance appeared certain Gallies gently gliding down the stream, dressed up with Flags and Streamers, which all Ships and Saykes saluted with their Guns as they passed. This Captain being informed that the Grand Signior was there in person, and returned from his Hunting, which he had made in certain Woods not far from the City, saluted him also as he passed with twenty five Guns; but being not able to discover his person, presently fitted his Boat and followed him, hoping to receive that satisfaction at his landing; for conceiving, that access to the Ottoman and Eastern Princes is as facile and grateful, as it is to those of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, with all confidence endeavoured to accost the Person of the Grand Signior as near as was possible. The Grand Signior turning his eyes, and seeing a man habited (as he conceived) in a barbarous and extravagant dress, apprehended the Majesty of his Person violated by so near and bold an approach of the curious Stranger; and thereupon, without farther inquiry, being moved with scorn and indignation, called for the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, who is ever ready at his hand. But some persons then present, especially the Bostangibashee, being of more moderation, beseeched the Grand Signior to have a little patience, and to inquire of the Ghaur or Infidel (as they call'd him) the cause of this his boldness: with which the Grand Signior suppressing a little his passion, and having patience until one was sent to expostulate with the Captain, who all this while, though he perceived some disturbance, was yet ignorant that the matter so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously concerned himself; and not being able to understand the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger, nor to be understood by him, rendred the business more confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and less understood: which the Messenger observing, and knowing the danger of this worthy and innocent Gentleman, being perhaps of a compassionate nature and prudent, framed this excuse to the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior, That he did not well understand the Infidels language, but what he conjectured was, That he being Captain of that Vessel, which had newly saluted his Majesty as he passed with twenty five Guns, was now come in confidence of his Royal bounty and clemency to receive a Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, as a sign of his Majesties favour, and reward of his own respect. The Grand Signior having by this time his choler somewhat abated, was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pacified with these gentle words; the Bostangibashee also interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at the same time in his behalf, that he was a stranger, and ignorant of the customs of their Court, and that if he deserved punishment, he might be remitted to the examination of the Vizier, who might chastise him, as he found it reasonable. The Grand Signior contented herewith, the rude Bostangees seized the Captain and hurried him to the Vizier, who all this time was ignorant of his errour or his danger, more than that he perceived by the accent of their words, and by their gestures, that something was amiss, and debated in reference unto him. The Drugger-men, or Interpreters of the French Nation being sent for, and the Vizier and the Captain both understanding the matter, the crime
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:98602:151"/>
appeared only to be an absurdity committed through ignorance: yet to please the Grand Signior, and to make an appearance, as if something were done in chastisement of this bold curiosity, the Vizier ordered, that the Captain should be conducted by two Chaouses to the Ambassadour, there to be put in Chains and in Prison, until satisfaction was made for his fault. The Captain being thus brought before the Ambassadour, this honest Gentleman was punished in the same manner as we do those in Christendom, who crowd to see their Prince.</p>
                     <p>The Ambassadour had his first Audience with the Vizier on the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> which being insignificant to any other business more than to the delivery of his Masters Letter, and other matters of Form and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, we shall need to insist the less upon it.</p>
                     <p>His second Audience before that of the Grand Signior, was in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning <note place="margin">The French Embassadours second Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> of <hi>January,</hi> at which time the Ambassadour began to declare what he had in Commission from his King, which principally related towards a satisfaction for those affronts formerly offered him in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his Father, and himself inculcating into the Vizier a true appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of the greatness of his Master, his Force by Land, his powerful Fleet which should that following year be set forth in the Mediterranean Seas, with other arguments which might challenge due respect and honor to so great a Prince. These Proposals and Discourses, though the Vizier seemed not to entertain with that benign and flexible ear as was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or thought satisfactory, and thereupon several disgusts did afterwards succeed; howsoever in the end all matters cleared up again, and his Excellency was permitted to return to his own House with all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble satisfaction, as he was pleased to intimate to the Ambassadour for his Majesty of Great <hi>Britain.</hi> Soon after followed his Audience with the Grand Signior according to the usual Ceremonies; so that all things run smoothly with the French for several years after. And here by the way it is observable, That an English Ambassadour once arguing hotly with the Vizier on some points of the Capitulations, in which judging himself wronged, threw the Capitulations to the Vizier, telling him, that he might keep the Writing and Paper, since he resolved not to obey the Letter. The Vizier hereupon calmly took the Capitulations, and laid them behind his Cushion, which the Ambassadour in a more considerate temper could not again recover under an expence of fifteen hundred Pieces of Eight.</p>
                     <p>During the time of these Negotiations the Grand Signior wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed his time and thoughts in Hunting, ranging all the Woods for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral days journies round <hi>Constantinople,</hi> in which Exercise twenty or thirty thousand men were imployed, collected from the Cities and Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges round about, all which were paid at the publick expence and charge of House-keepers both Turks and Christians, which in one hunt might <note place="margin">The Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors Huntings.</note> amount to thirty or forty thousand Dollars. With this burden the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being often oppressed, and many perishing in the Woods with cold and hunger, began to murmur at the excess of Tyranny, cursing their Princes madness and folly, maintained with the life and ruine of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. But not withstanding all these whispered curses and secret menaces the Grand Signior followed his delights with such frequency, and with that heat and eagerness, that the people perceiving no end of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, began to speak loudly and plainly, and by some principal Persons gave the Vizier to understand, That the people would not longer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:98602:151"/>
the extravagant Vagaries of their Prince at so dear a rate, of which he that was his chief Councellour ought to inform and advise him. The Vizier, who was before sensible of the excess of his Masters humour in this particular, and that immoderation, even in lawful and innocent exercises, may become a Vice, and when acted with oppression of the Subject as dangerous as other terms which sound more of Tyranny and Violence, resolved with courage and humility to represent to his Master the danger of such expensive Huntings, especially when over frequent; and therefore assured those who made their Complaints, That for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture all matters should be redressed, and the Grand Signior should not be so prodigal in his Huntings on the Purse of his Subjects. And so sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was the Vizier of the disorders which might arise from hence, if some remedy were not speedily applied, that he immediately departed <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> to find out the Grand Signior, who was lodged in some reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red cool place, environed with Woods and Mountains; leaving <hi>Solyman</hi> Pasha for Chimacam, or Deputy, in his place, in whose former Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment many terrible Fires had happened in <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About this time Advice came to <hi>Constantinople</hi> of certain Addresses the <note place="margin">The <hi>Nogay</hi> Tartar desires Lands of the Grand Signior.</note> 
                        <hi>Nogay</hi> Tartar had made to the Pasha of <hi>Silistria</hi> to obtain a Country to live in between the Rivers of <hi>Boristhenes</hi> and the <hi>Danube;</hi> for that their own Country being full, they were forced to abandon and empty it of forty or fifty thousand Families, who lived in Waggons, and had about a hundred thousand head of Cattle, all which with their substance, they proffered for Subjects to the Grand Signior, if he pleased to afford them protection, and Land for Pasture and habitation. The Pasha ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving hereof, gave them assurance of security under the shadow of his Masters favours, sending information thereof to the Port, who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly embraced these new-come Guests, and entered into consultation what Country and Limits should be assigned them. In the mean time the <hi>Krim</hi> Tartar jealous of this people, and not knowing what incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience such Neighbourhood might produce, fell upon them, and cut off a great number of them, forcing the rest to return into their own Country, which though ill taken at first by the Turks, was yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards excused by the Tartar, and dissembled by the Port.</p>
                     <p>Though all things appeared quiet at <hi>Constantinople</hi> after the Peace concluded with the Emperour, and that the German Ambassadour was returned back to his Master; yet the Turks prosecuted their Designs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Venice,</hi> and made great preparations in the Provinces of <hi>Albania, Bossena,</hi> and <hi>Licca,</hi> which confine on the Venetian Territories; and though in reality those Forces were not intended against those parts, but in order to a more warm prosecution of the War in <hi>Candia,</hi> whither the Vizier intended to transport himself in Person; yet the Venetian State not fully penetrating the Design, took the Alarm chiefly in <hi>Dalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> and reinforced their Garrisons of <hi>Cataro</hi> and other Fortresses. And that matters there might be well provided, and all things acted with due circumspection; Marquis <hi>Villa</hi> was ordered to visit those Garrisons in his <note place="margin">Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> surveys the Forts in <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia.</hi>
                        </note> Voyage to <hi>Candia;</hi> so that departing from <hi>Venice</hi> attended with two Gallies, he arrived in a few days at <hi>Zara,</hi> and thence proceeding to <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lato,</hi> where the Proveditor General, <hi>Catarin Cornaro,</hi> made at that time his residence; they both joined together to survey the most important places of that Province. They began with the City of <hi>Spalato,</hi> which <note place="margin">Spalato.</note> rather seems a place intended by Nature for a Palace of delights, than a
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:98602:152"/>
Garrison of Armes; being the Seat which <hi>Dioclesian</hi> (who was born at <hi>Salona,</hi> six miles distant from thence) chose for his Garden of retirement, after he had renounced the Empire, and is now turned into a ruder shape of War, since the Invasion of the Turk made it necessary to be fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for security of itself, and the parts circumjacent. <hi>Spalato</hi> is now very strong, being secured by divers Redoubts; the chief of which is scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on a little rising, called <hi>Grippe,</hi> distant about a Musket-shot from the Town, is strengthened with four Royal Bastions, and with good Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; there is also a new Line of Fortisication drawn round the Town, which renders it the strongest, and most considerable of all <hi>Dalmatia:</hi> But to make this place the more impregnable, these Generals laid the foundation for another Bulwark; and as an evidence of their Union, they cast a medal with a stamp on one side of <hi>Cornaro,</hi> and on the other of Marquis <hi>Villa,</hi> and so rendring thanks to God, the Service ended with firing all the Guns of the Town.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards both the Generals embarking, passed that Night to <hi>Curzo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Curzola.</note> anciently called <hi>Corcina Negra,</hi> which is one of the greatest and best of the Isles of this Gulf; Thence passing by <hi>Ragust,</hi> where the Deputies of that Government, in recognition of that Soveraingty which the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians have over the Adriatick Seas, presented the usual refreshments to the General of the Province; and in a particular manner treated Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis <hi>Villa</hi> with a Present in name of their Republick. That Night they <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Cataro</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasto.</hi>
                        </note> arrived at the Entrance of the Channel of <hi>Cataro,</hi> and taking <hi>Perasto</hi> in their way (which is a strong Fortification about six miles distant from <hi>Cataro</hi>) they were received there with firing all the Guns of the Town, which were doubly multiplied by an Echo returned from the sound of the neighbouring Mountains. Thence they proceeded to visit <hi>Budua,</hi> a place well fortified, as also Fort S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>George</hi> in the Island <hi>Liesina,</hi> which is the usual Rendezvous of Brigantines, and armed Barques; at length they went to <hi>Almissa,</hi> where they made a general Muster of all the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Province; in all which places having viewed and amended the defects in Fortification, and given order for supplying them with Ammunition and Provisions necessary; they returned back to see the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Fortress of <hi>Clissa,</hi> the scituation of which seems to have been <note place="margin">Clissa.</note> planted when Nature desired to sport, and be wanton; for it issues, as it were, out of the Bosom of two Mountains, which are at an equal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the Town, and then drawing themselves at each end into the fashion of a Bow, seem to form a triumphal Arch. The passage through these Mountains is so narrow and crooked, that it appears like a Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth; and being supplyed with plenty of Fountains and Cisterns both within and without the Fortress, the Suburbs demolished, and no incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances to cloy and weaken its strength, is certainly more obliged to Nature for its defence than to Art. From hence they proceeded to view <hi>Sebenico,</hi> which is another strong Fortress, scituated on a rising Hill, and <note place="margin">Sibenico.</note> overviews a spacious Port, the entrance to which is secured by the Fort S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Nicholas;</hi> and the City it self, besides its own Walls, is guarded by a Cittadel, and by the new works of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>John,</hi> scituated on two Hills; From hence the Generals returning to <hi>Zara,</hi> the Capital City of the Province, which being encompassed by the Sea, and annexed to the Land only by a Bridge, which is also defended by a Fort, is rendered the strongest and most impregnable of all the Fortresses. And here ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made a general Muster of all the Forces, and visited the Country
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:98602:152"/>
of <hi>Novigrade,</hi> and <hi>Possidaria</hi> the habitations of the Morlach Militia, the Marquis returned again to <hi>Venice,</hi> being called thither by the Senate; for the Year being now well spent, and the Winter approaching too near to admit of any considerable action; the time grew seasonable for counsels in which manner the Affairs of Wars might best and most advantageously be directed for the succeeding Year. Yet in regard Advices were come from <hi>Candia,</hi> That the Turks were much afflicted with the Pestilence, and scarcity of all Provisions; it was judged requisite to prosecute the War the more eagerly against them, before the Great Vizier arrived there with such an Army as commonly attends his Person; it being advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from Count <hi>Leslie,</hi> the Emperours Ambassadour at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that the whole force of the Ottoman Armes was to refund it self speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on that Island. This Intelligence hastned the departure of Marquis <hi>Villa</hi> from <hi>Venice,</hi> with such Force as was then in a readiness, being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected with necessary Instructions of what he ought to act in <hi>Candia.</hi> In his Voyage thither he touched at <hi>Corsu, Cesalonia,</hi> and <hi>Zant,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards happily arrived on the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> at the Isle of <hi>Paros</hi> or <hi>Parest</hi> in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> where he met with the Captain General, and other Chief Commanders of the Fleet, together with <hi>Vuertmiller</hi> the Lieutenant General of the Ordnance; and here the Marquess reforming several Companies, which were much diminished in their numbers, a general Muster was made of all the Forces, which being ranged in form of Battel, they were accounted to amount unto eighteen hundred Horse, and eight thousand two hundred ninety five Foot. This Army had some want of Fire-Armes, and other Necessaries, of which the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate being advised, they promised to supply all by a Convoy, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring; and congratulating in their Letters to Marquis <hi>Villa</hi> the good News of his happy Arrival at <hi>Paros,</hi> raised and prompted him to At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements worthy his Courage and Grandeur; for being a Person now elevated on the Bulwarks of <hi>Candia,</hi> he seemed to stand on that Theatre, where he had all <hi>Europe</hi> for his Spectators.</p>

                           <hi>The Troubles which the English Trade found this Year in</hi> Turky.</head>
                        <p>THE Currant of our Negotiations ran smoothly this Year without any considerable interruption in all parts of <hi>Turkie,</hi> unless at <hi>Alep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po,</hi> where the Emin, or Customer, according to his usual practice, began a new pretence, not only against former Presidents, but also against the very Letter of Capitulations, demanding 2 ½ <hi>per Cent.</hi> Custom at <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derone,</hi> and 3 at <hi>Aleppo;</hi> a matter against which our Articles of Peace and Commerce have made many and sundry Provisions; Notwithstanding the Customer (like others of his Predecessours, who have ever at <hi>Aleppo</hi> made Disputes about their Customes, without being restrained by the most strict Imperial Commands, and plainest Decisions of the Law) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to make good his pretence by a sequestration on the whole Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go of two general Ships, then under his Custody in the Custom-house. The Consul hereupon had recourse to the Justice of the Kadi, and there produced the Capitulations, the Hattesheriff, or Royal Signature, under the hand of Sultan <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> wherein the particulars of Custom were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated, a Command from the present Vizier, and his Father, and other
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:98602:153"/>
Commands from <hi>Adrianople</hi> and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> all of the same tenour. The Emin on the other side, had no other Argument than his Baratz or Patent from the Tefterdar or Lord Treasurer, which was so prevalent, and of that force with the Kadi, joined with the fear and favour he bore towards the Emin; that it was judged by him to stand in ballance with all the other Imperial Signatures; and therefore left the business (which was as much as the Customer desired) undecided, making a Declaration, that the reasons on both sides were so forcible, and the arguments so equal, that he concluded it more proper, that a matter of so great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance should be reserved for the determination of more powerful and eminent Officers. The matter standing thus doubtfully, the Emin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it too great a pawn to detain so great a quantity of Cloth for a difference only in the Custom, delivered to every man his consignation, reserving only fifty Bales to make himself good on the judgment and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands he expected shortly in his favour. The difference being now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred up to the Court, the Lord Ambassadour received the just com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the Consul and Merchants; for redress of which abuses, his Excellency dispatched my self, then his Secretary and Druggerman, to the Vizier at <hi>Belgrade,</hi> attending the advice of the German Ambassadours entrance into the Frontiers. The Vizier having heard the difference, was ready to have passed sentence in our favour, had not the Tefterdar the only Advocate for the Customer, from whom the Original of our Evils was derived, put an unhappy obstacle in the course of our Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, pretending that therewerd antient Tefters or accounts amongst his Books, which mentioned two and a half <hi>per Cent.</hi> at <hi>Scanderone,</hi> and three at <hi>Aleppo;</hi> and though it was urged to the contrary, that we never had to do with the Registers of the Treasurers, nor had managed any Apalto, or Farm of the Grand Signior; but our Capitulations are our Law and Rule, and our Commands Registred in the Reis Efendi's, or Secretaries Office, than which we never had, nor could ever acknowledge any other Canon: yet the Vizier over ruled our reasons, and we were forced to submit, until the Tefterdar took his leisure to examine and consult his Books.</p>
                        <p>The Vizier and his Army being then upon their return, we found no opportunity to renew our sollicitations, until we came to <hi>Nissa,</hi> where the Army had two days of repose, and there again as in other places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we urged the Tefterdar so importunately, that at length we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled him to acknowledge to the Vizier, that our affairs were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistred in his Office. So that now we took liberty to declare our reasons to the Vizier; which we drew from our Capitulations, the antient Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesheriff of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> the Vizier and his Fathers own Commands, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of others of the like tenour, not omitting other Arguments and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, which rendered the business not a little clear and apparent to the capacity of the Vizier: who thereupon reprehended the Tefterdar, for seeking by his Command to introduce an innovation contrary to our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulations, and promised us Commands in our favour; but we replyed, that we had already Commands, and the Grand Signiors own Royal Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature on our side, and that our Ambassadour had not sent us so many days Journey to seek another, which perhaps would as ill be observed as the former; But it was the punishment of the Customer which the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour expected, who against so many clear evidences, durst proceed to the violation of them all. Many other words were added pertinent and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:98602:153"/>
forcible to the present purpose. To which the Vizier answered, that he was now upon his Journey, where business of this nature was ill dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched. And therefore ordered us to proceed to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> where he should have more leisure to consider what was sit to be done in order to justice and satisfaction of the Ambassadour. Hereupon I left the Army, wherein I was much incommoded, and proceeded with all haste to <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> where the Great Vizier in some days after me arrived, and there we renewed our wonted endeavours, and sollicitations, that we might come to an end of this business, and that justice might be done us: But the Vizier willing to gratify the Tefterdar, was not forward to pass his Sentence, but put us again off to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where the Books should be perused, that were laid up amongst the Registers of the <hi>Divan:</hi> For that this matter was a concernment of the G. Signiors, in determination of which, he ought to be tender and considerate. That for sending for <hi>Ibrahim</hi> Aga, the Customer (which was one of the principal of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands) to answer for the injuries he had done our Nation, he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ordered to appear at Court, where he should be ready to stand to judgment for what the Ambassadour should object against him: and this had been the answer which was contrived to be given to the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour himself, in case he had (as once he designed) appeared at <hi>Adriano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> in person on this occasion.</p>
                        <p>The Vizier arriving at <hi>Constantinople</hi> some few Months after; The Lord Ambassadour obtained Audience of him on the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing still for justice against the Customer of <hi>Aleppo:</hi> but nothing thereof could be procured, besides a Command for restitution of the fifty Bales of Cloth, detained in the hands of the Emin, upon the pretence before related, and that the payment of Customs should be regulated after the rate of three <hi>per Cent.</hi> according to the antient usance. For putting this Command in execution, an Aga was ordered to be dispatched, for whose service herein the Vizier allotted a thousand Dollars should be paid him, which though an extravagant reward, yet to put an honour and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity on the business, and not to displease the Vizier, it was granted to him, and so he was dispatched the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> for <hi>Aleppo.</hi> But the troubles of our Merchants at <hi>Aleppo</hi> ended not here: For the-Tefterdar greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to see his designs against us to have no better issue, thought to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us by a new invention of prohibiting the Scale of <hi>Scanderone</hi> to all English and other Christian Vessels, and that the Factories should be transferred again over to <hi>Tripoli</hi> in <hi>Soria;</hi> a place formerly frequented by our Merchants, but by reason of the danger and inconvenience of that Port, the Trade was transported to the Scale of <hi>Scanderone.</hi> This alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation the Tefterdar pretended to have been granted to the Merchants at their carnest Petition, and promise to the G. Signior, of payment of 13000. Dollars Yearly, for discharge and maintenance of those Guards which were requisite in that place for safety of the Coast, and defence of the Caravans which pass with Merchants goods to <hi>Aleppo;</hi> but time and corruption of the Ministers had deprived the Grand Signior of the benefit of that duty. And this he urged with the greater instance and eagerness, knowing that the Scale of <hi>Scanderone</hi> being prohibited, the Hattesheriff whereon consisted the priviledge of the Merchants, and their sole security must consequently fall, and they forced to a new agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. On this occasion our Lord Ambassadour had Audience with the Vizier, and insisted on that point of our Capitulations, which gives us
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:98602:154"/>
liberty to trade in any part of the Grand Signiors Dominions; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to consent to be restrained, or confined to any particular place, was to assent to a breach of the Capitulations, which was out of his power, and only to be dispensed with by his Master the King of <hi>England,</hi> and the Grand Signior by whom they were established; and to connive or assent to the breach of one particular clause, was to hazard the loss and breach of the whole: for that our Capitulations (to use the Turks saying) are like a string of Beads, of which, when one link is broken, the others drop off. To which the Vizier replied, that the Scale of <hi>Scanderone</hi> was open, and clear as before for the English Trade; but because the Tefter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar, and Customer, pretended that the Grand Signior was put to great expences for maintenance of a Watch and Guard at that Port, which was only in respect to the security of the Merchants Goods; Orders should be given for taking away those Officers, as unnecessary and insignificant to the publick Service; no Guards having ever been in that place, the Embassadour judged his business to be granted, and so thanked the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier and departed. But not many days after the Tefterdar procured a Command for shutting the Scale of <hi>Scanderone,</hi> and transporting the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to <hi>Tripoli:</hi> which Command was rather intended to affright our Nation into some composition, than really to be put in execution, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by the sequel; for the Tefterdar better considered than to bring so great an <hi>odium</hi> upon himself from the whole Country and City of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leppo,</hi> and to enforce the Embassadour to have recourse to the Grand Signiors own person, for redress of an abuse of so high a nature, in dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of his Imperial Capitulations. Howsoever it is observable in the transaction of all this business, that it is difficult to bring a corrupt Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Minister to Justice or punishment, meerly for breach of our Capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or in respect to any difference or abuse offered to Christians, unless the complaint be accompanied with presents or money, which are most prevalent Arguments in the Turkish Court; and in this Case I really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that had three or four thousand Dollars been offered as a reward for bringing the Customer to capital punishment, the complaint had found acceptance, and honourable success: for default of which, the Cause was starved, and naked, and carried no fire or heat in those aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations with which it was represented. It is likewise observable, that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness in the Turkish Court doth not always find that dispatch, or expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as is generally believed in Christendome, unless it come accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the interest of the Ministers themselves, and then it is transacted in a moment, which otherwise languishes with delays, and will never want excuses to defer it.</p>

                     <p>WE shall begin this Year with the strange rumour and disturbance of the Jews, concerning <hi>Sabatai Sevi,</hi> their pretended Messiah, which for being most principally acted in <hi>Turkey,</hi> may properly belong to the History of this time and place; which therefore for delight of the Readers, I shall here insert: for though it may have been elsewhere pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, yet being an issue of my Pen, I may lawfully now own it, and annex it to this History, in respect of that near coherence it may have therewith; and that many other particulars have been added thereunto, which succeeded until the Death of this <hi>Sabatai.</hi>

According to the Predictions of several Christian Writers, especially <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1666"/> of such who comment upon the Apocalypse or Revelations; this Year of 1666. was to prove a Year of Wonders, of strange revolutions in the World, and particularly, of blessing to the Jews, either in respect of their Conversion to the Christian Faith, or of their Restoration to their Temporal Kingdom. This opinion was so dilated and fixt in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of the Reformed Religion, and in the heads of Fanatical Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asts, who dreamed of Fifth Monarchies, the down-fall of the Pope and Anti-Christ, and the greatness of the Jews, insomuch, that this subtle people judged this Year the time to stir, and to fit their Motion accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the season of the Modern Prophecies. Whereupon strange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports flew from place to place, of the March of multitudes of people from unknown parts into the remote deserts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> supposed to be the ten Tribes and a half, lost for so many Ages. That a Ship was arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Northern parts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with her Sails and Cordage of Silk, navigated by Marriners who spoke nothing but Hebrew, and with this Motto on their Sails, <hi>The twelve Tribes of Israel.</hi> These reports agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus near to former Predictions, put the wild sort of the World in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an expectation of strange accidents this Year should produce in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Jewish Monarchy.</p>
                     <p>In this manner Millions of people were possessed when <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> first appeared at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and published himself to the Jews for their Messiah, relating the greatness of their approaching Kingdom, the strong hand whereby God was about to deliver them from Bondage, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them from all the parts of the World. It was strange to see, how this fancy took, and how fast the report of <hi>Sabatai,</hi> and his Doctrine, flew through all parts where Jews inhabited, and so deeply possessed them with a belief of their new Kingdom and richess; and many of them with promotion to Offices of Government, renown and greatness; that in all places from <hi>Constantinople</hi> to <hi>Buda</hi> (which it was my fortune that Year to travel) I perceived a strange transport in the Jews, none of them attending to any business, unless to wind up former Negotiations, and to prepare themselves and Families for a Journey to <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> all their Discourses, their Dreams, and disposal of their affairs, tended to no other design, but a re-establishment in the Land of Promise, to Greatness and Glory, Wisdom and Doctrine of the Messiah, whose Original, Birth and Education is first to be recounted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> was Son of <hi>Mordechai Sevi,</hi> an Inhabitant and natural of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> who gained his Livelihood by being Broker to an English Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant in that place; a person who before his Death was very decrepit in his Body, and full of the Gout and other infirmities: But his Son <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batai Sevi</hi> addicting himself to study and learning, became a notable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in the Hebrew and Arabick Languages; and especially in Divinity and Metaphysicks, he was so cunning a Sophister, that he vented a new Doctrine in their Law, and drew to the profession of it so many Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as raised one day a tumult in the Synagogue; for which afterwards he was by censure of the Kockhams (who are the Expounders of the Law) banished out of the City.</p>
                     <p>During the time of his Exile he travelled to <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> now called <hi>Salonica,</hi> where he married a very handsom Woman; but either not having that part of Oeconomy as to govern a Wife, or being impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent as to Women, as was pretended, or that she found not favour in
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:98602:155"/>
his eyes, she was divorced from him. Again, he took a second Wife more beautiful than the former; but the same causes of discontent rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a difference between them, he obtained another Divorce from this Wife also. And being now free from the incumbrances of a Family, his wandring head moved him to travel through the <hi>Morea,</hi> thence to <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poli</hi> in <hi>Syria, Gaza,</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and by the way picked up a Ligor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nese Lady, whom he made his third Wife, the Daughter of some Polonian or German, her Original and Country not being very well known. And being now at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> he began to reform their Law, and to abolish the Fast of <hi>Tamuz,</hi> (which they keep in the month of <hi>June</hi>) and meeting there with a certain Jew called <hi>Nathan,</hi> a proper Instrument to promote his design, he communicated to him his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his course of life, and intentions to declare himself the Messiah of the World, so long expected and desired by the Jews. This design took wonderfully with <hi>Nathan;</hi> and because it was thought necessary, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Scripture and ancient Prophecies, that <hi>Elias</hi> was to precede the Messiah, as St. <hi>John Baptist</hi> was the Fore-runner of Christ, <hi>Nathan</hi> thought no man so proper to act the part of the Prophet as himself; and so no sooner had <hi>Sabatat</hi> declared himself the Messiah, but <hi>Nathan</hi> disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers himself to be his Prophet, forbidding all the Fasts of the Jews in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and declaring that the Bridegroom being come, nothing but joy and triumph ought to dwell in their habitations, writing to all the Assemblies of the Jews to perswade them to the same belief. And now the Schism being begun, and many Jews really believing what they so much desired, <hi>Nathan</hi> took the courage and boldness to prophesie, That one year from the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Kislan,</hi> which is the month of <hi>July,</hi> the <note place="margin">June.</note> Messiah was to appear before the Grand Signior, and to take from him his Crown, and lead him in chains like a Captive: <hi>Sabatai</hi> also at <hi>Gaza</hi> preached Repentance to the Jews, and Obedience to himself and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, for that the Coming of the Messiah was at hand. Which novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties so affected the Jews, Inhabitants of those parts, that they gave up themselves wholly to their Prayers, Alms, and Devotions; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this belief the more, it happened that at the same time that news hereof with all particulars were dispatched from <hi>Gaza,</hi> to acquaint the Brethren in foreign parts; the rumour of the Messiah had flown so swift, and gained such reception, that Intelligence came from all Countries, where the Jews sojourn, by Letters to <hi>Gaza</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the happiness of their deliverance, and expiration of their time of servitude by the appearance of the Messiah. To which they adjoyned other Prophecies relating to that Dominion the Messiah was to have over all the World, that for nine months after he was to disappear; during which time the Jews were to suffer, and several of them to undergo Martyrdom; but then returning again mounted on a celestial Lyon, with his Bridle made of Serpents with seven heads, accompanied with his Brethren the Jews, who inhabited on the other side of the River <hi>Sabation,</hi> he should be acknowledged for the sole Monarch of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, and then the Holy Temple should descend from Heaven already built, framed, and beautified, wherein they should offer Sacrifices for ever. And here I leave the Reader to consider, how strangely this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived People was amused, when these confident and vain reports and dreams of Power and Kingdoms had wholly transported them from the ordinary course of their trade and interest.</p>

This noise and rumour of the Messiah having begun to fill all places, <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> resolved to travel towards <hi>Smyrna,</hi> the Country of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and thence to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the capital City, where the principal work of preaching was to be performed: <hi>Nathan</hi> thought it not fit to be long after him, and therefore travels by way of <hi>Damaseus,</hi> where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving to continue some time for better propagation of this new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, in the mean while writes this Letter to <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> as followeth.</p>

                     <p>And now all the Cities of <hi>Turkie,</hi> where the Jews inhabited, were full of the expectation of the Messiah, no Trade or course of gain was followed; every one imagined, that daily Provisions, Richess, Honours, and Government were to descend upon him by some unknown and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous manner. An Example of which is most observable in the Jews at <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> who now full of assurance, that the restauration of their Kingdom, and the accomplishment of the times for the Coming of the Messiah was at hand, judged themselves obliged to double their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and purifie their Consciences from all sins and enormities, which might be observed by the scrutiny of him who was now come to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into the very thoughts and imaginations of Mankind. For which work, certain Kochams were appointed to direct the people in the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of their Prayers, Devotions, and Fastings: but so forward was every one now in his acts of Penance, that they stayed not for the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Kocham, or Prescriptions or Rules, but applied themselves immediately to Fastings; and some in that manner beyond the abilities of Nature, that having for the space of seven days taken no sustenance, were famished: others buried themselves in their Gardens, covering their naked bodies with earth, their heads only excepted, remained in those beds of dirt, until their bodies were stiffned with the cold and moisture: others would endure to have melted wax dropt upon their shoulders: others to roul themselves in snow, and throw their bodies in the coldest season of the winter into the Sea, or frozen waters. But the most common manner of Mortification was first to prick their backs and sides with thorns, and then to give themselves thirty nine lashes. All business was laid aside, none worked or opened shop, unless to clear his Ware-house of Merchandise at any price: who had superfluity in Houshold-stuff sold it for what he could, but yet not to Jews, who were interdicted from all bargains or sales under pain of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, pecuniary mulcts, or corporal punishment; for their comportment as to business and imployment was esteemed the test or touch-stone of their faith. It being the general Tenent, That in the days that the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah appeared, the Jews should become Masters of the Estates and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of Insidels, until when they ought to content themselves with matters only necessary to maintain and support life. But because that every one was not Master of that Provision and Fortune as to live without daily labour; therefore to quiet the clamours of the poor, and prevent the enormous lives of some, who upon these occasions would become vagabonds, and desert their Cities, due order was taken to make collections, which were so liberally bestowed, that in <hi>Thessalonica</hi> only four hundred poor were supported by the meer charity of the richer.
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:98602:156"/>
And as they endeavoured to purge their consciences of sin, and to apply themselves to good works, that the Messiah might find the City pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for his reception; so lest he should accuse them of any omission in their Law, and particularly in their neglect of that ancient Precept of Increase and multiply, they married children together of ten years of age, and some under, without respect to richess or poverty, condition or quality; but being promiscuously joyned to the number of six or seven hundred couple, upon better and cooler thoughts, after the deceit of the false Messiah was discovered, or the expectation of his Coming grew cold, were divorced, or by consent separated from each other.</p>
                     <p>In the heat of all this talk and rumour came <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> the City of his Nativity, infinitely desired there by the common Jews, but by the Kochams or Doctors of their Law, who gave little or no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to what he pretended, was ill received, not knowing what mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief or ruine this Doctrine and Prophecy of a new Kingdom might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. Yet <hi>Sabatai</hi> bringing with him Testimonials of his Sanctity, holy Life, Wisdom, and gift of Prophecy, so deeply fixed himself in the heart of the generality, both as being holy and wife, that thereupon he took courage and boldness to enter into dispute with the Grand Kocham (who is the head or chief Expositor of their Law, and Superintendent of their civil Government) between whom the arguments grew so high, and language so hot, that the Jews who favoured the Doctrine of <hi>Sabatai,</hi> and feared the Authority of the Kocham, doubtful what might be the issue of the contest, appeared in great numbers before the Kaddee of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> in justification of their new Prophet, before so much as any accusation came against him; the Kaddee according to the custom of the Turks swallowed money on both sides, and afterwards remitted them to the determination of their own Justice. In this manner <hi>Sabatai</hi> gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ground daily; and the Grand Kocham with his Party, losing both the affection and obedience of his People, was displaced from his Office, and another constituted more affectionate and agreeable to the new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, whose power daily increased by those confident reports of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies being struck with phrensie and madness, until being restored to their former temper and wits by him, became his Friends, Admirers, and Disciples. No invitation was now made in <hi>Smyrna</hi> by the Jews, nor Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, or Circumcision held, where <hi>Sabatai</hi> was not present, accompanied to the solemnities with multitudes of his Followers, and the streets co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Carpets or fine Cloth for him to tread on; but the humility of this Pharisee appeared such, that he would stoop and turn them aside, and so pass. And having thus fixed himself in the opinion and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people, he began to take on himself the Title of Messiah and the Son of God, and to make this following Declaration to all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Jews, which being wrote Originally in Hebrew, was transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for me faithfully into Italian in this manner.

                     <p>Notwithstanding the Disciples of <hi>Sabatai Sevi,</hi> were not so numerous, but many opposed his Doctrine, publickly avouching, that he was an Impostor, and deceiver of the people, amongst which was one <hi>Samuel Pennia,</hi> a man of good Estate and Reputation in <hi>Smyrna;</hi> who arguing in the Synagogue, that the present signs of the Coming of the Messiah were not apparent, either according to Scripture, or the Doctrine of Rabbins, raised such a Sedition and Tumult amongst the Jews, as not only prevailed against his arguments, but had also against his life, had he not timely conveyed himself out of the Synagogue, and so escaped the hands of the Multitude, who now could more easily endure Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my against the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and Prophanation of the Sanctuary, than contradiction or misbelief of the Doctrine of <hi>Sabatai.</hi> But howsoever it fell out, <hi>Pennia</hi> in a short time became a Convert, and Preacher up of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batai</hi> for the Son of God, and Deliverer of the Jews; and not only he, but his whole Family, his Daughters prophesie, and fall into strange ecstasies: and not only this house, but above four hundred men and women pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie of the growing Kingdom of <hi>Sabatai,</hi> and young Infants who could scarce yet stammer out a syllable to their Mothers, repeat and pronounce clearly the Name of <hi>Sabatai</hi> the Messiah and Son of God. For thus far had God permitted the Devil to delude this people, that their very children were for a time possessed, and voices heard to sound from their stomachs and entrails: those of riper years fell first into a trance, foamed at the mouth, and recounted the future prosperity and deliverance of the Israelites, their Visions of the Lyon of <hi>Judah,</hi> and the Triumphs of <hi>Saba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tai.</hi> All which were certainly true, being effects of diabolical delusions, as the Jews themselves since have confessed to me.</p>

                        <pb n="207" facs="tcp:98602:157"/>
With these concomitant accidents and successes <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> growing more presumptuous, that he might correspond with the Prophecies of Greatness and Dominion of the Messiah, proceeded to Election of those Princes which were to govern the Israelites in their March towards the Holy Land, and to dispense Judgment and Justice after their Restaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>In this manner things ran to a strange height of madness amongst the Jews at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> when appeared such Pageantry of Greatness, that no Comedy could equal the mock-shows they represented. And though none durst openly confess any scruple or doubt of this common received Belief, yet for confirmation of the Jews in their Faith, and astonishment of the Gentiles, it was judged no less than necessary, that <hi>Sabatai</hi> should shew some Miracles, whereby to evince all the World that he was the Messiah. And as the present occasion seemed to require an evidence and conviction infallible of this truth, so it was daily expected by the Vulgar with an impatience suitable to humors disposed to Novelty, who out of every action and motion of their Prophet, began to fancy something extraordinary and supernatural. <hi>Sabatai</hi> was now horribly puzzled for a Miracle, though the imagination of the people was so vitiated, that any leger-de-main or slight of hand would have passed more easily with them for a Wonder, than <hi>Moses</hi> striking the Rock for water, or dividing the Red Sea. And an occasion happening, that <hi>Sabatai</hi> was in behalf of his Subjects to appear before the Kaddee or Judge of the City, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ease and relief of some oppressions which aggrieved them; it was thought necessary a Miracle should be worked now or never, when <hi>Sabatai</hi> appearing with a formal and Pharisaical gravity which he had starched on, some on a sudden avouched to see a Pillar of Fire between him and the Kaddee, which report presently was heard through the whole room, filled with Jews that accompanied <hi>Sabatai.</hi> Some of whom, who strongly fancied it, vowed and swore they saw it; others in the outward Yard, or that could not come near to hear or see for the crowd, as speedily took the Alarm, and the rumor ran, and belief received by the Women and Children at home in a moment. So that <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> returned to his house triumphant, fixed in the hearts of his People, who now needed no farther Miracles to consirm them in their Faith. And thus was <hi>Sabatai</hi> exalted, when no man was thought worthy of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, who did not believe him for the Messiah: others were called Kophrim, Infidels, or Hereticks, subjected to the Censure of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, with whom it was not lawful so much as to eat. Every man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced his Treasure, his Gold, and Jewels, offering them at the feet of <hi>Sabatai;</hi> so that he could have commanded all the Wealth of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> but he was too subtle to accept their money, lest he should render his design suspected by any acts of covetousness.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> having thus fully fixed himself in <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and filled other places with the rumors of him, declared that he was called by God to visit <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where the greatest part of his work was to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished; in order whereunto he privately shipped himself with some few Attendants on a Turkish Saike in the month of <hi>January <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           </gap>,</hi> lest the crowd of his Disciples, and such who would press to follow him, should endanger him in the eyes of the Turks, who already began to be scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized at the Reports and Prophecies concerning his Person. But though <hi>Sabatai</hi> took few into the Vessel with him, yet multitudes of Jews tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:98602:158"/>
over land to meet him again at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> on whom all their Eyes and expectations were intent. The Wind proving Northerly, as commonly it is in the <hi>Hellespont</hi> and <hi>Propontis, Sabatai</hi> was thirty nine days in his Voyage, and yet the Vessel not arrived: So little power had this Messiah over the Sea and Winds. In which time the News fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running to <hi>Constantinople</hi> that the Jews Messiah was near, all that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple prepared to receive him with the same joy and impatience as was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in other parts where he arrived. The Great Vizier then also at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> (being not yet departed on his expedition for <hi>Candia</hi>) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard some rumours of this Man, and the disorder and madness he had raised amongst the Jews, sent two Boats, whilst the Saik was detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by contrary Winds, with Commands to bring him up Prisoner to the Port, where accordingly <hi>Sabatai</hi> being come, was committed to the most loathsome and darkest Dungeon in the Town, there to remain in farther expectation of the Viziers Sentence. The Jews were not at all discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged at this ill Treatment of their Prophet, but rather confirmed in their belief of him, as being an accomplishment of the Prophecy of those things which ought to precede his Glory and Dominion; which Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration induced the Chiefest Persons amongst the Jews to make their Visits and Addresses to him with the same Ceremony and Respect in the Dungeon, as they would have done, had he then sate exalted on the sublime Throne of <hi>Judah.</hi> Several of them, with one <hi>Anacago</hi> by name, a Man of great esteem amongst the Jews, attended a whole day before him, with their Eyes cast down, their Bodies bending forward, and hands cross'd before them; (which are postures of humility and service in the Eastern Parts) the undecency of the place, and present subjection not having in the least abated their high thoughts and reverence towards his person.</p>
                     <p>For the Jews in <hi>Constantinople</hi> were become as mad and distracted, as they were in other places, all Trade and Traffick forbidden, and those who owed money, in no manner careful how to satisfie it; Amongst which wild Crew, some were indebted to our Merchants at <hi>Galata,</hi> who not knowing the way to receive their money, partly for their interest, and partly for curiosity, thought fit to visit this <hi>Sabatai,</hi> complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That such particular Jews, upon his Coming, took upon them the boldness to defraud them of their right, and desired he would be pleased to signifie to those his Subjects, his pleasure to have satisfaction given.</p>
                     <p>Whereupon <hi>Sabatai,</hi> with much affectation, took pen and paper, and wrote to this effect.</p>
                     <p>To you of the Nation of the Jews, who expect the appearance of the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah, and the salvation of <hi>Israel,</hi> Peace without end. Whereas we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, That you— are indebted to several of the English Nation, It seemeth right to us to enorder you to make satisfaction to these your just Debts: which if you refuse to do, and not obey us herein; know you that then you are not to enter with us into our Joys and Dominions.</p>
                     <p>In this manner <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> remained a Prisoner at <hi>Constantinople</hi> for the space of two Months; at the end of which the Vizier having design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his expedition for <hi>Candia,</hi> and considering the rumour and distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance the Presence of <hi>Sabatai</hi> had made already at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> thought it not secure to suffer him to remain in the Imperial City, whilst both the Grand Signior, and himself were absent; and therefore changed his Prison to the <hi>Dardanelli,</hi> otherwise called the Castle of <hi>Abydos,</hi> being
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:98602:158"/>
on the <hi>Europe</hi> side of the Hellespont, opposite to <hi>Sestos,</hi> places famous in Greek Poetry. This removal of <hi>Sabatai</hi> from a worse Prison, to one of a better Air, confirmed the Jews with greater confidence of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Messiah, supposing that had it been in the power of the Vizier, or other Officers of the Turks, to have destroyed his Person, they would never have permitted him to live unto that time, in regard their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes enforce them to quit all jealousies and suspicions of ruine to their State by the death of the Party feared; which much rather they ought to execute on <hi>Sabatai,</hi> who had not only declared himself the King of <hi>Israel,</hi> but also by Prophecies published fatal things to the Grand Signior and his Kingdoms.</p>
                     <p>With this Consideration, and others preceeding, the Jews flocked in great numbers to the Castle, where he was imprisoned, not only from the Neighbouring Parts, but also from <hi>Poland, Germany, Ligorn, Venice, Amsterdam,</hi> and other places, where the Jews reside; on all whom, as a reward of the expence and labours of their Pilgrimage, <hi>Sabatai</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed plenty of his Benedictions, promising encrease of their Store and enlargement of possessions in the Holy Land: So great was the confluence of the Jews to this place, that the Turks thought it requisite to make their advantage thereof, and so not only raised the price of their Provisions, Lodgings, and other necessaries, but also denied to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any to the presence of <hi>Sabatai,</hi> unless for money, setting the price sometimes at five, sometimes at ten Dollars, or more or less, according as they guessed at the abilities and zeal of the Person; by which gain and advantage to the Turks, no Complaints or Advices were carried to <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anople,</hi> either of the Concourse or Arguments amongst the Jews in that place, but rather all Civilities and Liberties indulged unto them, which served as a farther Argument to ensnare this poor People in the belief of their Messiah.</p>
                     <p>During this time of Consinement <hi>Sabatai</hi> had leisure to compose and institute a new Method of Worship for the Jews, and principally the manner of the Celebration of the day of his Nativity, which he prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in this manner.</p>

                     <p>Besides which Order and Method of Liturgy for Solemnization of his Birth, he prescribed other Rules for Divine Service, and particularly published the same Indulgence and priviledge to every one who should pray at the Tomb of his Mother, as if he had taken on him a Pilgrimage to pray and sacrifice at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> The Devotion of the Jews towards this pretended Messiah, encreased still more and more; so that not only the chief of the City went to attend and proffer their service towards him in the time of his Imprisonment, but likewise decked their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue with <hi>S. S.</hi> in Letters of Gold, making for him on the Wall a Crown, in the Circle of which was wrote the 91 Psalm at length, in a fair and legible Character; attributing the same Titles to <hi>Sabatai,</hi> and expounding the Scriptures in the same manner in favour of his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as we do of our Saviour.</p>
                     <p>Howsoever some of the Jews remained in their Wits all this time, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst which was a certain Cocham at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> one zealous of his Law, and of the good and safety of his Nation; and observing in what a wild manner the whole people of the Jewswas transported with the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less belief of a Messiah, leaving not only their Trades, and Course of Living, but publishing Prophecies of a speedy Kingdom, of rescue from
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:98602:159"/>
the tyranny of the Turk, and leading the Grand Signior himself captive in Chains; matters so dangerous, and obnoxious to the State wherein they lived, as might justly convict them of Treason and Rebellion, and leave them to the mercy of that Justice, which on the least jealousie and suspicion of matters of this nature, uses to extirpate Families, and subvert the Mansion houses of their own People, much rather of the Jews, onwhom the Turks would gladly take this occasion to despoil them of their Estates, and condemn the whole Nation to perpetual Slavery. And indeed it would have been a greater wonder than ever <hi>Sabatat</hi> shewed, that the Turks took not advantage from all these extravagancies to drain the Jews of a considerable Sum of money, and set their whole Race in <hi>Turkie</hi> at a Ransome, had not these passages yielded them matter of pastime, and been the subject of the Turks laughter and scorn, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it a disparagement to the greatness of the Ottoman Empire, to be concerned for the rumours and combustions of this despised people. With these Considerations this Cocham, that he might clear himself of the blood and guilt of his Countrymen, and unconcerned in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon destruction, went before the Kaddee, and there protested against the present Doctrine, declaring, That he had no hand in setting up of <hi>Sabatai,</hi> but was an enemy both to him and his whole Sect. This free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Cocham so enraged and scandalized the Jews, that they judged no Condemnation or Punishment too severe against such an Offender, and Blasphemer of their Law, and Holiness of the Messiah, and therefore with money and presents to the Kaddee, accusing him as disobedient in a Capital Nature to their Government, obtained sentence against him to shave his Beard, and commit him to the Gallies.</p>
                     <p>There wanted nothing now to the appearance of the Messiah, and the Solemnity of his Coming, but the presence of <hi>Elias,</hi> which the Jews began to expect hourly, and with that attention and earnestness, that a Dream or Phantasm to every weak head was judged to be <hi>Elias,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taught and averred, that he was seen in divers Forms and Shapes, nor to be certainly discovered or known before the Coming of the Messiah. For this Superstition is so far fixed amongst them, that generally in their Families they spread a Table for <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> they make an invitation of poor people, leaving the chief place for the Lord <hi>Elias,</hi> whom they believe to be invisibly present at the Entertainment, and there to eat and drink without diminution either of the Dishes or the Cup. One person amongst the Jews commanded his Wife, after a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of this kind, to leave the Cup filled with Wine, and the Meat stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Night for <hi>Elias</hi> to feast and rejoyce alone, and in the morning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising early, affirmed, That <hi>Elias</hi> took this Banquet so kindly, that in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of gratitude and acceptance, he had replenished the Cup with Oyl in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Wine. It is a custom amongst the Jews on the Evening of the Sabbath to repeat certain praises of God, (<hi>Haudola</hi>) which signities a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction or separation of the Sabbath from the prophane days (as they call them;) which praises or blessing they observe to perform in this manner. One takes a Cup filled with Wine, and drops it through the whole house in the name of <hi>Elias,</hi> saying, Elias <hi>the Prophet,</hi> Elias <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, come quickly to us with the Messiah the Son of</hi> David. And this, they affirm, is so acceptable to <hi>Elias,</hi> that he never fails to preserve that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily so devoted to him, and augment it with the Blessings of encrease. Many other things the Jews avouch of <hi>Elias,</hi> so ridiculous, as are not
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:98602:160"/>
necessary to be declared, amongst which this one is not from our purpose, That at the Circumcision there is always a Chair set for <hi>Elias.</hi> And <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batai Sevi</hi> being once invited at <hi>Smyrna</hi> to the Circumcision of the first<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Son of one <hi>Abraham Gutiere,</hi> a Kinsman of <hi>Sabatai,</hi> and all things ready for the Ceremony; <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> exhorted the Parents of the Child to expect a while until his farther order. After a good half hour <hi>Sabatai</hi> ordered them to proceed, and cut the Prepuce of the Child, which was instantly performed with all joy and satisfaction to the Parents: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwards demanded, wherefore he retarded the performance of that Function; his answer was, That <hi>Elias</hi> had not as yet taken his Seat, whom as soon as he saw placed, he ordered them to proceed: and that now shortly <hi>Elias</hi> would discover himself openly, and proclaim the news of their general Redemption. This being the common opinion of the Jews, and that <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> was the Messiah, being become an Article of Faith, it was not hard to perswade them that <hi>Elias</hi> was come already, that they met him in their dishes, in the dark, in their Bed-chambers, or any where else invisible, in the same manner as our common people believe of Hobgoblins and Faries. For so it was, when one <hi>Solomon Cremona,</hi> an Inhabitant of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> making a great Feast, to which the principal Jews of that City were invited, after they had eaten and drank freely, one started from his seat, and avouched that he saw <hi>Elias</hi> upon the Wall, and with that bows to him, and complements him with all reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and humility: some others having in like manner their fancies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready prepossessed, and their eyes with the fume of Wine ill prepared to distinguish shadows, immediately agreed upon the object, and then there was not one in the Company who would say, he did not see him; at which surprise every one was struck with reverence and awe, and the most eloquent amongst them having their tongues loosed with Joy and Wine, directed Orations, Encomiums, and acts of thankfulness to him, courting and complementing <hi>Elias,</hi> as distracted Lovers do the supposed presence of their Mistresses.</p>
                     <p>Another Jew at <hi>Constantinople</hi> reported, That he met <hi>Elias</hi> in the streets, habited like a Turk, with whom he had a long communication, and that he injoyned the observation of many neglected Ceremonies, and particularly the Zezit, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 38. <hi>Speak unto the Children of Israel and bid them, that they make sringes in the borders of their garments through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their generations, and that they put upon the sringe of the border a rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of blue.</hi> Also the Peotz, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 27. <hi>Ye shall not round the corners of your head, nor marre the corner of your beard.</hi> This apparition of <hi>Elias</hi> being published, and as soon believed, every one began to obey the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, by fringing their garments; and for their heads, though always sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved according to the Turkish and Eastern fashion, and that the suffering hair to grow, to men not accustomed was heavy and incommodious for their health and heads; yet to begin again to renew, as far as was possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the ancient Ceremonies, every one nourished a Lock of hair on each side, which was visible beneath their Caps, which soon after began to become a sign of distinction between the Believers and the Koparims, a name of dishonour, signifying as much as Unbeliever or Heretick, given to those who confessed not <hi>Sabatai</hi> to be the Messiah. Which particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, if not observed, it was declared as a menace of <hi>Elias,</hi> That the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Jews who come from the River <hi>Sabation,</hi> as is specified in the 2. <hi>Esdras Chap.</hi> 13. shall take vengeance of those who are guilty of these omissions.</p>

But to return again to <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> himself, we find him still remaining a Prisoner in the Castle of <hi>Abydos</hi> upon the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> admired and adored by his Brethren with more honour than before, and visited by Pilgrims from all parts, where the Fame of the Coming of the Messiah had arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: amongst which one from <hi>Poland</hi> named <hi>Nehemiah Cohen</hi> was of special note and renown, learned in the Hebrew, Syriack, and Chaldee, and versed in the Doctrine and Kabala of the Rabbins, as well as <hi>Sabatai</hi> himself: one (of whom it was said) had not this <hi>Sevi</hi> anticipated the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, esteemed himself as able a Fellow for to act a Messiah as the other. Howsoever it being now too late to publish any such pretence, <hi>Sabatai</hi> having already prepossessed the office, and with that the hearts and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Jews, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was contented with some small appendage or relation to a Messiah; and therefore to lay his design the better, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired a private Conference with <hi>Sabatai.</hi> These two great Rabbins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, a hot Dispute arose between them. For <hi>Cohen</hi> alledged, That according to Scripture and Exposition of the Learned thereupon, there were to be two Messiahs, one called <hi>Ben. Ephraim,</hi> and the other <hi>Ben. David:</hi> the first was to be a Preacher of the Law, poor and despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and a Servant to the second, and his Fore-runner; the other was to be great and rich, to restore the Jews to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to sit upon the Throne of <hi>David,</hi> and to perform and act all those Triumphs and Conquosts, which were expected from <hi>Sabatai. Nehemiah</hi> was contented to be <hi>Ben. Ephraim,</hi> the afflicted and poor Messiah, and <hi>Sabatai</hi> was well enough contented he should be so; but that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> accused him for being too forward in publishing himself the latter Messiah, before <hi>Ben. Ephraim</hi> had first been known to the World, <hi>Sabatai</hi> took this reprehension so ill, either out of pride and thoughts of his own Infallibility, or that he suspected <hi>Nehemiah</hi> being once admitted for <hi>Ben. Ephraim,</hi> would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, being a subtle and learned Person, perswade the World that he was <hi>Ben. David,</hi> would by no means understand or admit of this Doctrine, or of <hi>Ben. Ephraim</hi> for a necessary Officer: and thereupon the Dispute grew so hot, and the Controversie so irreconcileable, as was taken notice of by the Jews, and controverted amongst them as every one fancied; but <hi>Sabatai</hi> being of greater Authority, his Sentence prevailed, and <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> was rejected as Schismatical, and an Enemy to the Messiah, which afterwards proved the ruine and downfal of this Imposture. For <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> being thus baffled, and being a Person of Authority, and a haughty Spirit, mediated nothing but revenge; to execute which to the full, he took a Journey to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and there informed the chief Ministers of State and Officers of the Court, who (by reason of the gain the Turks made of their Prisoner at the Castle on the <hi>Hellespont</hi>) heard nothing of all this concourse of people, and Prophecies of the Revolt of the Jews from their obedience to the Grand Signior. And taking likewise to his Counsel some certain discontented and unbelieving Cochams, who being zealous for their Nation, and jealous of the ill consequences of this long continued and increasing madness, took liberty to inform the Chimacam (who was Deputy of the Great Vizier then at <hi>Candia</hi>) that the Jew Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner at the Castle called <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> was a lewd person, and one who endeavoured to debauch the minds of the Jews, and divert them from their honest course of livelihood, and obedience to the Grand Signior, and that therefore it was necessary to clear the World of so factious and dangerous a Spirit. The Chimacam being thus informed, could do no
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:98602:161"/>
less than acquaint the Grand Signior with all the particulars of this mans condition, course of life, and Doctrine; which were no sooner under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, but a Chaouse or Messenger was immediately dispatched to bring up <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> to <hi>Adrianople.</hi> The Chaouse executed his Commission after the Turkish fashion in haste, bringing <hi>Sabatai</hi> in a few days to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> without farther excuse or ceremony, not affording him an hours space to take a solemn farewel of his Followers and Adorers, who now were come to the vertical point of all their hopes and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>The Grand Signior having by this time received divers informations of the madness of the Jews, and the pretences of <hi>Sabatai,</hi> grew big with desire and expectation to see him; so that he no sooner arrived at <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> but the same hour he was brought before the Grand Signior. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batai</hi> appeared much dejected, and failing of that courage which he shewed in the Synagogue. And being demanded several questions in Turkish by the Grand Signior, he would not trust so far to the vertue of his Messiahship, as to deliver himself in the Turkish Language, but desired a Doctor of Physick (who had from a Jew turned Turk) to be his Interpreter, which was granted to him, but not without reflection of the standers-by, that had he been the Messiah and Son of God, as he formerly pretended, his Tongue would have been loosed into Eloquence and perfection of Languages. But the Grand Signior would not be put off without a Miracle, and it must be one of his own chusing; which was, that <hi>Sabatai</hi> should be stripped naked, and set as a mark to his dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Archers; if the arrows passed not his body, but that his flesh and skin was proof, like Armour, then he would believe him to be the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah, and the person whom God had designed to those Dominions and Greatness he pretended. But now <hi>Sabatai</hi> not having faith enough to stand to so sharp a tryal, renounced all his Title to Kingdoms and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, alledging that he was an ordinary Cocham and Jew, as others were, and had nothing of priviledge and vertue above the rest. The Grand Signior notwithstanding, not wholly satisfied with this plain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, declared, That having given publick scandal to the Professors of the Mahometan Religion, and done dishonour to his Soveraign Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, by pretending to withdraw from him so considerable a portion as the Land of <hi>Palestine,</hi> his Treason and Crime could not be expiated without becoming a Mahometan Convert: which if he refused to do, the Stake was ready at the Gate of the Seraglio to impale him. <hi>Sabatai</hi> being now reduced to his last game and extremity, not being in the least doubtful what to do; for to dye for what he was assured was false was against Nature, and the death of a mad man: replied with much chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, that he was contented to turn Turk, and that it was not of force, but of choice, having been a long time desirous of so glorious a profession, he esteemed himself much honoured, that he had an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to owne it first in the presence of the Grand Signior. And here was the <hi>Non plus ultra</hi> of all the bluster and noise of this vain Impostour. And now the Reader may pause a while, and contemplate the strange point of consternation, shame, and silence, to which the Jews were redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, when they understood, how speedily their hopes were vanished, and how poorly and ignominiously all their fancies and promises of a new Kingdom, their Pageantry and Offices for Devotion were past like a tale or a midnights dream. And all this was concluded, and the Jews sunk
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:98602:161"/>
on a sudden and fallen flat in their hopes, without so much as a line of comfort or excuse from <hi>Sabatai,</hi> more than in general to all the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that now they should apply themselves to their callings and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of God, as formerly; for that matters relating to him were finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the sentence past.</p>
                     <p>The News of <hi>Sabatai</hi> turning Turk, and of the Messiah to a Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan, quickly filled all parts of <hi>Turkie;</hi> the Jews were strangely sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised at it, and ashamed of their casiness of belief, of the arguments with which they had perswaded others, and of the Proselytes they had made in their own Families. Abroad they became the common derision of the Towns where they inhabited, the Boys houted after them, coining a new word at <hi>Smyrna (Poustai)</hi> which every one seeing a Jew, with a finger pointed out, would pronounce with scorn and contempt; so that this deceived people for a long time after remained with confusion, silence, and dejection of spirit. And yet most of them affirm, That <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batai</hi> is not turned Turk, but his shadow only remains on Earth, and walks with a white head, and in the habit of a Mahometan; but that his body and soul are taken into Heaven, there to reside until the time appointed for accomplishment of these Wonders: and this opinion began so commonly to take place, as if this people resolved never to be unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, using the Forms and Rules for Devotion prescribed them by their Mahometan Messiah. Insomuch that the Cochams of <hi>Constantinople</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the danger of this Errour might creep up and equal the former, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the belief of <hi>Sabatai</hi> being Messiah as damnable, and injoyned them to return to the ancient Method and Service of God, upon pain of Excommunication. The Stile and Tenour of their Letter was as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>

As that, when the Grand Signior sent to take him, he caused all the Messengers immediately to die; upon which, other Janizaries being again sent, they all fell dead with a word only from his mouth; and being desired to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive them again, he immediately recalled them to life, but of them only such, who were true Turks, and not those who had denied that Faith in which they were born, and had professed. After this they added, that he went voluntarily to Prison, and though the Gates were barred, and shut with strong Locks of Iron, yet that <hi>Sabatai</hi> was seen to walk through the streets with a numerous attendance; and when they laid shackles on his Neck and Feet, they not only fell from him, but were converted into Gold, with which he gratified his true and faithful Believers and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.

These strong re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports coming thus confidently into <hi>Italy,</hi> and all parts; the Jews of <hi>Casal di Monferrato,</hi> resolved to send three persons in behalf of their Society, in the nature of extraordinary Legates, to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> to make enquiry after the truth of all these rumours, who accordingly arriving in <hi>Smyrna,</hi> full of expectation and hopes, intending to present themselves with great humility and submission before their Messiah, and his Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> were entertained with the sad news, that <hi>Sabatai</hi> was turned Turk; by which information, the Character of their Embassy in a manner ceasing, every one of them laying aside the formality of his Function, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to lodge himself best to his own convenience. But that they might return to their Brethren at home with the certain particulars of the success of these affairs; they made a visit to the Brother of <hi>Sabatai,</hi>

who still continued to perswade them, that <hi>Sabatai</hi> was notwithstanding the true Messiah; that it was not he who had taken upon him the habit and form of a Turk, but his Angel or Spirit, his Body being ascended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, until God shall again see the season and time to restore it; adding farther, that an effect hereof they should see by the Prophet <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> verifyed, now every day expected, who having wrought Miracles in many places, would also for their consolation, reveal hidden secrets unto them, with which they should not only remain satisfied but astonished: with this only hope of <hi>Nathan,</hi> these Legates were a little comforted, resolving to attend his arrival, in regard they had a Letter to consign into his hands, and according to their instructions, were to demand of him the grounds he had for his Prophecies, and what assurance he had that he was divinely inspired, and how those things were revealed unto him, which he had committed to Paper, and dispersed to all parts of the World.</p>
                     <p>At length <hi>Nathan</hi> arrived near <hi>Smyrna,</hi> on <hi>Friday</hi> the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> towards the Evening, and on <hi>Sunday</hi> these Legats made their visit to him, but <hi>Nathan</hi> upon the news of what success his Messiah met with, began to grow sullen and reserved, so that the Legats could scarce pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure admittance to him; all that they could do, was to inform him, that they had a Letter to him from the Brotherhood of <hi>Italy,</hi> and Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to confer with him concerning the ground and foundation of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies: but <hi>Nathan</hi> refused to take the Letter, ordering <hi>Kaim Abolafio,</hi> a Cocham of the City of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> to receive it; so that the Legats re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned little contented, but yet with hopes at <hi>Nathans</hi> arrival at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> to receive better satisfaction.</p>

And thus ended this mad phrensie amongst the Jews, which might have cost them dear, had not <hi>Sabatai</hi> renounced his Messiahship at the Feet of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> These mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were transacted in the Years 1665 and 1666; since which <hi>Sabatai</hi> hath passed his time devoutly in the Ottoman Court, educated at the Feet of the learned <hi>Gamaliel</hi> of the Turkish Law, (<hi>viz.) Vanni</hi> Effendi, Preacher to the Seraglio, or as we may so term him, Chaplain to the Sultan, one so literate as to be esteemed the Grand Oracle of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:98602:163"/>
so precise, and conceited of his own Sanctity as a Pharisee, and so superstitious, that nothing seemed more to unhallow his Worship than the touch or approach of a Christian. To this Master <hi>Sabatai</hi> was <note place="margin">The course of life which <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batai</hi> led after he turned Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan.</note> a most docil Scholar, and profited, as we may imagine, beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in the Turkish Doctrine; so that in exchange of such impressions <hi>Vanni</hi> thought it no disparagement, from so great a Rabbin as his new Disciple, to learn something of the Jewish Rites, and rectifie those crude Notions he had conceived of the Mosaical Law. In this manner <hi>Sabatai</hi> passed his days in the Turkish Court, as some time <hi>Moses</hi> did in that of the Egyptians; and, perhaps in imitation of him, cast his eyes often on the Afflictions of his Brethren, of whom, during his life, he continued to profess himself a Deliverer, but with that care and caution of giving scandal to the Turks, that he declared, Unless their Nation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came like him, that is, renounce the Shadows, and imperfect Elements of the Mosaical Law, which will be compleated by adherence to the Mahometan, and such other Additions as his inspired Wisdom should suggest, he should never be able to prevail with God for them, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct them to the holy Land of their Forefathers. Hereupon many Jews flocked in, some as far as from <hi>Babylon, Jerusalem,</hi> and other remote pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and casting their Caps on the ground, in presence of the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior, voluntarily professed themselves Mahometans. <hi>Sabatai</hi> himself by these Proselytes gaining ground in the esteem of the Turks, had priviledge granted him to visit familiarly his Brethren, which he employed in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcising their Children the eighth Day, according to the Precept of <hi>Moses,</hi> preaching his new Doctrines, by which he hath confirmed many in their Faith of his being the Messiah, and startled all with expectation of what these strange ways of Enthusiasm may produce; but none durst publickly owne him, lest they should displease the Turks, and the Jews, and incurr the danger of Excommunication from one, and the Gallows from the other.</p>

And so we return to more important matters of the Turkish Affairs.</p>
                     <p>Since that we have so long insisted on the phrensie of the Jews, let us return to matters of greater Consequence, and more general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment; and look back to Count <hi>Leslie</hi> the Emperours Ambassadour, who having departed from <hi>Constantinople</hi> the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> of the last Year, we find on the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> of this year on the Frontiers ready to make exchange with the Turkish Ambassadour. The Night
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:98602:164"/>
before, Count <hi>Leslie</hi> was lodged at a Village called <hi>Elmas,</hi> where the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, as in the most parts of upper <hi>Hungary,</hi> are Calvinists in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and though they live between two Swords, do yet in time of <note place="margin">The manner of exchange of the Emperours and Turks Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours.</note> War, by paying a Tribute to both Parties, and providing Forage for both, remain more secure than in the Villages subjected to either, which are often burnt, or in some other manner miserably destroyed. The next day the Emperours Ambassadour, conducted by the Pasha of <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Ecclesiae,</hi> with about three hundred Horse, arrived at the place for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years observed for Exchange of Ambassadors, which is about an hour and halfs Journey, or five miles (as we may so say) distant from this Village, where in open Fields upon the Brink of the <hi>Danube,</hi> are set three Posts; the two Ambassadours meeting at that in the middle, after some Complements, take their leaves each of other, and so exchange. The German Ambassadour that day arrived near his Post about seven a Clock in the morning, but the Turkish, not being as yet come from <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mara,</hi> he could not proceed farther. After some expectation here, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice came, That the Turkish Ambassadour was resolved not to depart from <hi>Komara,</hi> until he was satisfied for the allowance of eighteen days, at a hundred Dollars for every day, which he had spent at his entrance into Christendom, between the Frontiers and the City of <hi>Vienna.</hi> But to this was replied, That it had never been the custom to allow the Turkish Ambassador mony for his daily provisions, until he entred the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors Court; and in the mean time the expences and charge of his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney were to be defrayed by the Imperial Officers, who had performed the same in a most ample and plentiful manner: But the Turk was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved not to be so satisfied, and therefore declared he would not depart without full payment; hoping the more easily to prevail, in regard the German Ambassadour was already in the Field, exposed to the cold and sharp weather, without provisions either for himself, Attendance, or Horses, whilst the Turk remained warm in his Boat, accommodated with his Stove, and wrapt in his Furrs, so that he hoped there might be a necessity of granting what he reserved for the rear-guard of his pretensions. The matter seemed unreasonable to the German Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, as also to the Turks that attended him, who being in the open and cold Air, judged it an unseemly time to capitulate. But in fine, the German gave him this Answer, That an Ambassador ought to be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that hospitality and entertainment which was accustomary, as he himself had done; for that since his departure from <hi>Buda,</hi> which was then seven days, he had not received one Asper of allowance, resting sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the Pasha's word, that from <hi>Buda</hi> homewards it was not accustomary to receive a farther treatment; so that if he insisted on the first he was to be allowed the latter, since both Ambassadours are to be used with terms of equality; and therefore to find an expedient to give him satisfaction, he was contented to resign his seven days allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the Grand Signior; and if any thing farther was really owing he would engage his parole of honour for the payment. And farther he added, That none but a corrupt Minister would make his private Interest to stand in Competition with a publick Design, and make the pretence of a few Dollars an interruption and impediment to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of the great Affairs of the two Empires, professing that he would have quitted all his right, rather than the least concernment of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster should have received a prejudice, on confidence of whose gracious
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:98602:164"/>
favour he depended for reparation of whatsoever he suffered for his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. He thanked God that he had happily managed his Embassy to the satisfaction of the Grand Signior, and the approbation of his Master, and was now ready to perform the last office and ceremony, in which if he did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, or was impeded, the fault was not his, being ready to return to <hi>Buda,</hi> so the other in like manner did to <hi>Vienna,</hi> there to remain until this difference was decided by their Masters. The Turkish Ambassador's Kahya or Steward who was present, and heard all this discourse, seeming not pleased to hear of a return to <hi>Vienna,</hi> immediately replied, That he conceived his Master would not remove from <hi>Komara;</hi> to which it was answered, That a man who so little understood the office of an Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour, as it appeared his Master did, was to be treated with some other kind of stile than was agreeable to the respect due to a publick Minister, and should therefore be forced to it in case he should refuse. The Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish Ambassadour having his stomach something taken down with the threats of returning to <hi>Vienna,</hi> that afternoon loosed from <hi>Komara,</hi> and between three and four a clock arrived at the place of Exchange; but the wind blowing hard, had put some of his Boats ashore, which were most laden, and fewest men to govern them, which asforded him occasion of farther delay, pretending that his Goods might be arrested at <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mara,</hi> and until he was satisfied to the contrary, he was resolved not to make the Exchange. The German Ambassadour was more moved with choler at this humor than at the former; and the Turks that attended, growing more hungry and more cold, bestowed on him a million of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. The Sun now declining towards its setting, Count <hi>Leslie</hi> sent word to the Turk, That he was resolved not longer to abuse his own patience, but immediately to proceed forward, giving order to his Coach to drive on, protesting, That if any mischief was derived from this irregular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, the fault was not his, nor would he answer for any of those fatal consequences which might ensue; to which also being added some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions of the Pasha of <hi>Quin<expan>

The Turks were drawn up on their own Quarter to the number of about three hundred, and the Hungarian Hussars or Horse-men on the other to about two hundred; the two Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours making a stand at their respective Poles, proceeded with equal paces to meet in the middle, where some few Complements having passed between them and Salutes interchangeably sent to the chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of each Empire, the German Ambassadour entred his Coach, and the Turk his Boat, and so both returned to their respective Courts. Such as was the sordid and interessed humor of the Turkish Ambassadour in this transaction, so no less dishonourable was his way of living at <hi>Vienna,</hi> where he sojourned with that miserable famine and penury in his house, as discontented all his family, causing some to leave him and return home; others with better motives (as it is hoped) to the number of thirty became Christians, and imbraced the Faith: at the same rate he was generous in his Presents; for to the Master of the House where he lodged he gave two five-Senars or eighteen Pence English, and to the Commissary who conducted him to the Frontiers he presented a Bag of Rice, which was not accepted, but returned with the like complement, as that with which it was tendered.</p>
                     <p>But no sooner was this Peace concluded, and the Ceremonies thereof <note place="margin">The Turks meditate a new War.</note> thus happily finished, but the Turks, attentive to another War, which
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:98602:165"/>
is the life of their Empire, and their only security against intestine Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, made all the Preparations and Provisions this Year, that were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, for the total subjection of <hi>Candia,</hi> of which this Vizier was highly ambitious, designing thereby to gain unto himself that renown of which his Predccessours had been in pursuit for the space of twenty five years; so that all Ammunition, Victuals, and whatsoever was necessary was in great quantities supplied from all the circumjacent parts of the Empire.</p>
                     <p>The City of <hi>Candia</hi> was some time before governed by the Proveditor <hi>Priuli;</hi> but afterwards the Venetians, apprehensive of the succeeding War, conferred the Charge on Marquess <hi>Villa,</hi> a worthy and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Souldier, with Title of General of the Venetian Infantry, as we have before intimated; and having left him and his Forces in the month of <hi>December</hi> last, on the Island of <hi>Paros;</hi> where having, as is said, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered his Forces, he imbarked them on sixteen Gallies, five Galleasses, and thirty five Men of War; with which sailing in company from <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Paros,</hi> the whole Fleet on the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> made their Rendezvous at <hi>Argentiera;</hi> during which time the Turks landed eighteen hundred Janisaries at <hi>Canea,</hi> being transported thither on thirty five Gallies, which having incountred with the Cavalier <hi>Hoquincourt</hi> in the Chanel of <hi>Scio,</hi> received some damage and loss of men in their way, though this Cavalier himself was wounded in the Engagement, and forty of his men slain. The Venetain Fleet departing from <hi>Argentiera</hi> on the 23<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> came in sight of <hi>Candia,</hi> when a very great storm arising with Thunder and Lightning, put the whole Fleet in danger of shipwrack; but by Gods Providence, though tossed with contrary winds, they arrived on 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> in safety in the Port of <hi>Suda,</hi> being directed thither in a dark night, by those Lights which the Fortress had put abroad, though the Turks on the other side had put out false Fires to deceive them. The Army being landed at this place, and a Muster made of the Forces, Pay was given to the Souldiery; with which being become the more couragious, they marched towards <hi>Canea,</hi> with hopes to perform some memorable Enterprise at that place. The Lieutenant-General <hi>Vuersmiller</hi> led the <note place="margin">An Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment near <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea.</hi>
                        </note> Van consisting of six hundred Foot, and an hundred and eighty Horse, and advancing beyond those bounds which Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> had prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed him, was incountred by a more numerous Force from the Garrison, by which being at first put into some disorder, had been intirely defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, had not the Marquess opportunely arrived to his Succour: howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Venetians lost in this Skirmish three hundred Souldiers, forty Horse, and twelve Officers, amongst which the Marquess <hi>Ceva</hi> was slain upon the place, and Captain <hi>Scot</hi> a Scotch-man taken Prisoner, whom the English Factory redeemed at <hi>Smyrna;</hi> of the Turks seven hundred were computed to have been killed, with the Aga of the Janisaries, a stout and a well experienced Souldier. And as this beginning was not very auspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to the Christians, so neither did the Heavens seem much to favour them; for an unusual rain with few fair days continued almost for the space of three months, which filled all Rivers, Marshes, and Ditches with so strange an inundation, that the Army beginning to want Forage for the Horses, and all other Provisions for their Men; and the Garrison of <hi>Canea</hi> being reinforced from <hi>Retimo, Chiramo, Armiro,</hi> and other places, discouraged the Commanders in that manner, that they thought it more convenient to retire and incamp in the pleasant and fruitful Vallies of <hi>Spina Longa,</hi> until better weather, and other Recruits of their Army

                     <p>The Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> landed here the first of <hi>March,</hi> being conducted <note place="margin">Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> lands at the City of <hi>Candia.</hi>

The Captain-General by this time arriving with the remainder of the Militia, a general Multer was made in the Trenches of the Fort <hi>Panigra;</hi> of which the Turks ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving advice, fell unexpectedly upon them with a strong Body; the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians being surprised hereat, and <hi>Versama</hi> a valiant Colonel being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>On the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> a Fleet of Gallies arrived with new Recruits, with which the Christians being reinforced, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Nor were the Turks less vigilant or valiant on <note place="margin">The Turks as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault them.</note> their side; for a Party of about two thousand men sallying from their Trenches, and marching secretly under the covert of a Mountain, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly assailed the Out-guards of about fifty Foot belonging to the Regiment of <hi>Frischein,</hi> commanded by Captain <hi>Rades;</hi> which after a stout resistance retreated into another Body of fifty Musquetiers, and twenty five Arquibusiers of the Regiment <hi>Arborio;</hi> who also being assisted by other detachments, recovered their first Post; but being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards overpowered by great numbers of Turks, were forced to quit the place; which Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> observing, ordered fifty Horse under Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Mattiazzi,</hi> and seventy Foot under <hi>Blane</hi> Sergean:
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:98602:166"/>
Major of the Regiment <hi>Arborio</hi> to their assistance, by whom the Post was again recovered with great slaughter of the Enemy: but this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage was of little other benefit than to inflame the spirits of the Turks, who rallying again their Force with fresh courage and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary valour came to handy-blows with the Venetians, forcing them to another Retreat with the death of Lieutenant <hi>Cerusa</hi> a Savoyard, and some common Souldiers; but the Turks injoyed not long this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; for the Musquetiers from the Line with some small Guns, and the gross Artillery from the Walls did much execution on them; and at the same time being charged by a Party of Horse under Command of Colonel <hi>Rades,</hi> the Venetians with glory and incouragement recovered their Post, driving the Turks in disorder and confusion to their Trenches. This success of the Christians served to heat the spirits of the Turks, and animate them to another Engagement: for having by private ways of <note place="margin">The Turks make another assault.</note> hidden Vallies conducted their Men, about four hours before night made another Assault upon the Venetians, I will not say surprised them; because remaining always in apprehension of the Enemy, they kept themselves so watchfully on their Guard, that in a moment they were ready to receive them; and that so warmly, not firing until they came within the length of two Pikes, that in a moment the field was covered with the bodies of Horse and Men; the Turks startled hereat, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether it were better to stand to it or fly, until incouraged by their Leaders, they kept their ground for a time: but being galled by the continual Vollies of shot, and charged by a Body of Horse led by Count <hi>Sforza Bissaro</hi> and Captain <hi>Casich;</hi> they were so shaken, that they turned their backs, and began to run, until falling in with the gross Body of their Party, they made head again; and mixing both Horse and Foot with the Venetians, they forced them to retreat to the side of their Trenches; and so closely plyed them, that the fresh Troops of the Turks on the right and left wing had cut them off, had not the Count <hi>Corra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dini</hi> by order of Count <hi>Sforza</hi> with a Regiment of Curassiers, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Colonel <hi>Scoppa</hi> with his Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Tadeo Motta,</hi> with a good number of Archibusiers, assisted by a Squadron of the Regiment of Count <hi>Bassaro,</hi> sallied from the Line, and being succoured on all sides, forced the Turks at length to sound a Retreat.

The Turks lost a thousand men with divers Commanders of Quality and Note: of the Venetians were killed Lieutenant <hi>Cerusa, Gio. Tessari</hi> Captain to <hi>La Motte,</hi> eleven Horse, and some few Foot: <hi>Motte, Corradini, Soupe,</hi> Count <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belli,</hi> and some others were wounded.</p>
                     <p>About this time advice being come to the Captain-General, That the Turks were dispeeding fifty Gallies laden with Men and Ammunition, he resolved to incounter them at Sea with four Galleasses and twenty Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, reinforcing his Fleet with twelve hundred men, which he took from the Camp; which being thereby considerably diminished, as also by the late Engagements; yet Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> kept his ground, but contracted the compass of his Trenches, and raised a Fort in sight of the Enemy, who had not the courage to give him the least interruption; but rather after this example fortified their own Trenches, shutting all Avenues or passages to Renegadoes, whom they suspected might fly, and give advice to the Christians: howsoever some of them escaped to the Venetian
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:98602:166"/>
Camp, declaring that the Cannon from the Town did much incommode the Turks in their Trenches; upon which Intelligence Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> ordered forty eight shot to be made at that place, where they were most offended, which put the Turks into great consternation: after which no considerable Engagements happened, besides some few Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes and Rencounters of no memorable note, in which one <hi>Antiquario</hi> a Quarter-master, Count <hi>Pio Ferretti,</hi> and others signalized themselves by particular Acts of Valour, as also Captain <hi>Vimes</hi> who killed <hi>Mehmet Bey,</hi> a Turk of great esteem, with his own hand.</p>
                     <p>But now the Turks receiving daily Recruits, as of eight hundred Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisaries, and six hundred Spahees landed at <hi>Gira-petra,</hi> and seventeen hundred more disbarked at <hi>Chissamo;</hi> and advices daily coming of great numbers of Galeots and Brigantines providing in the Gulf of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> and of eighteen Ships of <hi>Barbary,</hi> all ready to transport Souldiers to <hi>Candia,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The Venetian Camp raised.</note> moved the Captain-General to perswade the removal of the Camp for better security of the most important places: the which Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> performed accordingly in the night preceding the first of <hi>June,</hi> with much order and care; for first he caused the Artillery to be withdrawn, with the Mortar-pieces, Ammunition, and Provisions of War, and placed in the Fort of <hi>Mocenigo;</hi> then he caused half the Army to work in filling the Trenches, whilst the other half remained in form of Battle, and two hours before day blew up the Fort; which having done, they marched in three Bodies to the City, to the great joy and satisfaction of the Turks, who on that occasion made a day of Festival.</p>
                     <p>These particulars of Action having passed under the Conduct of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess <hi>Villa</hi> without any signal Victory or advantage over the Turk, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred subject to such who in the parts of Christendom were emulous of his glory, and envious of his eminent charge, to give liberty to their tongues to disparage the management of his Affairs, as not agreeable to that high expectation of success which the World conceived thereof, when he first entred on this imployment: But here it is observable at what rate men who lye soft and warm in their beds at home, unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the dangers, labours, and hazards of those who live and act abroad, can make their reflexions, and pass their censures on active and ingaged men, not considering the state of affairs, the uncertainty of Succours in so long and distant a tract of Sea as passes between <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Candia,</hi> subjected to winds and a thousand casualties; nor yet the numerous Troops of the Enemy, nor the Puissance of that Empire, which for its Power, Richess, and the Valour of its Souldiery may be esteemed the most Potent and considerable of all the Monarchies and known King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the Universe. But what conjectures soever envious men might make of the Conduct of Marquess <hi>Villa,</hi> yet the Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his labours, and owned his services, as being such, which having me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited the admiration and esteem of all the World, did in a particulae manner challenge their thankfulness and acknowledgments. About this time the Gallies of <hi>Malta</hi> arrived at <hi>Candia,</hi> where some dispute arising touching the place of precedence in the Fleet, which the Venetians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to them: they departed thence with some dissatisfaction, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Westward to transport the young Empress out of <hi>Spain</hi> into <hi>Italy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now Intelligence coming to <hi>Candia</hi> by divers Letters, that the Great Vizier was departed from <hi>Adrianople</hi> with a numerous Army, and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:98602:167"/>
was already arrived at <hi>Thebes,</hi> where a general Rendezvous was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the whole Army, with resolution to be transported from <hi>Malvoisia</hi> to that Island; the Venetian Generals and Commanders in chief con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded <note place="margin">The Great Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier arrives at <hi>Thebes.</hi>
                        </note> it necessary, if possible, to hinder their passage, and rather to fight them at Sea, which was their more propitious Element, than to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their landing, where they would be forced to dispute with unequal numbers and on disadvantageous terms. Accordingly the Captain-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral reinforced his Fleet with two thousand Foot, and a thousand Horse under the Command of Count <hi>Licinio Martinoni,</hi> appointing the Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to be at <hi>Argentiera,</hi> to which place also Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> repaired, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the way at <hi>Milo</hi> for refreshment of his Horse, it being an Island abounding with herbage; the Captain-General being for some days de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at <hi>Standia</hi> by contrary winds, a Consultation was held for the more advantageous management of the War; after which the whole Fleet making sail was on <hi>August</hi> the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> scattered by a furious storm, and not being able to recover <hi>Santoxini,</hi> they by good fortune fetched <hi>Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palia,</hi> an Island abounding with generous Wines, excellent Fruit, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges, and other Provisions; at length after various fortunes arriving at <hi>Andra,</hi> which is a great and populous Island, another Council of War was held, where it was again concluded, That all care was to be taken to intercept the Succours which the Enemy daily sent to <hi>Candia;</hi> to which end the Cavalier <hi>Grimani,</hi> Captain of the Galleons, was ordered to cruise about the Coast; and hearing that twelve Turkish Ships were <note place="margin">Twelve Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Vessels ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> lading Provisions in the Gulf of <hi>Volo,</hi> he repaired thither, and had the good fortune to take them with all their lading; but the other Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons missed of the like success; for notwithstanding the care and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance which was used, all matters seemed to succeed prosperous for the Turks, and adverse to the Christians; the designs of the first having an issue agreeable to their intentions, whilst those of the latter were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways disappointed either by Nature or by Fortune, or rather by that secret hand of Providence, which had allotted that Island for a Prize to the Ottoman Arms.</p>
                     <p>By this time the Turkish Army being at their Rendezvous at <hi>Thebes,</hi> the Great Vizier prepared to imbark; and considering the difficulty of the passage, thought it prudent first to make new Propositions to Signior <hi>Ballarino</hi> before he entred on this hazardous attempt, supposing perhaps, that the rumour of this March might have affrighted the Venetians to a Surrender of that Kingdom, that they might spare the blood and charge of that War which afterwards ensued: wherefore <hi>Ballarino</hi> being called from his house at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> began his Journey towards <hi>Thebes</hi> on the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> accompanied by a Capugibashee and three Janisaries; and in twenty three days arriving at <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> now called <hi>Salonica,</hi> he fell sick of a violent Feaver, caused by that agitation of body in his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels to which he was unaccustomed, and for want of that sleep which he used to take after his slender dinner, passing the rest of the day and night in continual watchings: at first he felt only some little alterations, which he hoping might pass over, resolved to proceed on his Journey notwithstanding the perswasions to the contrary of Signior <hi>Patavino</hi> his Secretary, with whom I was well acquainted, and ever esteemed for an honest and a worthy Person: but he continued resolute to proceed, fearing left his delays by the way should lose him the opportunity of that moment of Treaty, which was impossible afterwards to be retrieved;
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:98602:167"/>
for in his Journey he would often reason in this manner: If I should stop here, what censure would the World pass on me? I may possibly excuse my self; but in the mean time the Vizier may ingage too far in his design, and frustrate all those methods and foundations which I have laid towards a Peace: and then if I live, I shall be over-burdened with the reproaches of the World, for having abandoned the grand incumbence in its ultimate necessity, which is charged upon me, which will be a more sensible affliction than the agony of death. My sickness will be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by many to be rather dissembled than real. The dead man lives in the memory of his faithfulness and constancy, and the living man dyes in the indelible characters of his cowardise and misfortune. These were his own words. And thus travelling forward his Feaver daily increased to that excess, that on the sixth day he was forced to stop at a City called <hi>Isdino,</hi> where having instructed Signior <hi>Patavino</hi> in what manner he ought to manage affairs, and recommending his services and children to the favour and protection of the Senate, he passed to the other World, being ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by a solemn Funeral at the publick Expence, and interred in the Church of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> his Son <hi>Domenico Ballarino</hi> succeeding into the Office and Inheritance of his Father. The Senate understanding by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices from Signior <hi>Padavino,</hi> That the Vizier desired another Envoyé qualified with the Character of a publick Minister to reside with him in <hi>Candia,</hi> dispatched the Secretary <hi>Girolamo Giavarina,</hi> a Person of good abilities, to that place. And at the same time the Captain-General <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drea Cornaro</hi> pressing the Senate for licence to return to his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; his request was granted, and <hi>Francesco Morosini</hi> was appointed to succeed him in that important Charge, and was accompanied at a time of so great emergency with powerful Convoys, and with Recruits of Men, Provisions, and Ammunition sitting to carry on so pressing a War.</p>
                     <p>On the month of <hi>October</hi> the Great Vizier in person imbarking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <note place="margin">The Vizier pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses over into <hi>Candia.</hi>
                        </note> and Army at <hi>Malvoisia</hi> with many Pasha's, and men expert and active in the War passed over to the Isle of <hi>Candia,</hi> resolving by strength and dint of Sword to force that strong City to obedience, the main Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark of Christendom, situated at the entrance of the <hi>Archipelago;</hi> of the success of which famous Siege we shall have occasion to discourse more at large and more particularly hereafter; in order unto which the Great Vizier on the last day of this Year, went in Person to take a view of this City, and having surveyed all sides of it, apprehended that the Siege would be long and tedious; and therefore returned again to <hi>Canea</hi> to take those measures which were requisite for an Enterprise of that weight and consideration.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the Princes of Christendom being for the most part either in that discord amongst themselves, of which the Turks have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made their advantage; or else living in parts remote, did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider <hi>Candia</hi> as a Bulwark to their Dominions, and therefore rendred little other assistance to the Venetians than good words, and vain wishes for their success and Victory. The Popes Forces only under Command of <hi>Muzeo Mattei</hi> which were in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> were transported to <hi>Candia,</hi> and five hundred Foot belonging to the Grand Duke of <hi>Toscany,</hi> came into their places for defence of that Country. The most Christian King in return to the Embassy of <hi>Venice</hi> performed by the Cavalier <hi>Alvise Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredo,</hi> remitted to that Republick an hundred thousand Crowns, and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:98602:168"/>
Cardinal <hi>Barberini</hi> at his expence supplied four thousand Measures of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1667"/> Corn. But the present Conjuncture did not seem to smile on the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, for all the Gallies belonging to <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> as well as, those of <hi>Malta,</hi> were employed in the transportation of the new Empress <hi>Marge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rita</hi> of <hi>Austria.</hi> The Pope was infirm, and distracted with his own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick Affairs. The Emperour was a young Bridegroom, and besides the Diversion which a Wife gave him from Cares, he apprehended that he might speedily receive some disturbance from the Princes of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and from <hi>Sweden</hi> in the Dukedom of <hi>Bremen.</hi> The King of <hi>Spain</hi> was a Child of five years old, labouring at the same time under a war with <hi>Portugal,</hi> and threatned by the more powerful Arms of <hi>France,</hi> on the pretence of <hi>Flanders.</hi> Besides all which, the Turks were as well in quietness amongst themselves, as they were at peace with all other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; so that we may expect that the force and power of the Ottoman Empire should now be turned, like a Torrent, to overwhelm this spot of land, which seemed to be so scituated, as well to resist the Waves of the Seas, as the inundation of this mighty and Martial People.</p>

                     <p>AT the Beginning of this year the Winter and Cold which chilled and benumbed the Earth, encreased the heat, and gave vigour and action to the Tartars, who made such an unexpected incursion into <hi>Poland,</hi> that they carried with them near a hundred thousand captived Souls, as they were numbred before <hi>Jash,</hi> in their return home. The Polanders, awakened hereat, but ill advised, resolved on a Treaty where there was more just cause for an open War, and in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto dispeeded an Ambassadour to the Sultan, to expostulate the reason of this Breach of Peace, and require justice and satisfaction on those his Subjects, who had, contrary to the Articles of Peace, committed such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and outrages of open hostility; or at least, that the Turk would not take upon him to abett the cause of the Tartars, whilst the Polan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders took just revenge for their late injuries.

                        <hi>Poland,</hi> was to make Complaints unto his Majesty of the grand Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions the Tartars had made into <hi>Poland</hi> without any reason or cause of War; and that therefore his Master did expect from him, as from a just and vertuous Prince, a permission for revenge, and satisfaction of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, to enter <hi>Tartary,</hi> without assuming it as any ground of Breach or Infringement of that Peace which he held with him; or else that he would by his authority enjoin the Tartars to restore their Captives, and their spoils, and render them a reasonable satisfaction. The Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior returned no reply hereunto, but referred that to be done by his Chimacam, silence being esteemed some part of his Majesty and State, which he seldom breaks but with few and haughty words.</p>
                     <p>This Ambassadour was a man of a bold and daring Spirit, a fit Orator for such an Embassy, had not his immoderate Covetousness, the vice and folly commonly incident to Old Age, much eclipsed many of those Vertues of which he was Master. He was also a Man of a violent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, feavered to a madness in the height of his Choler, which strangely betrayed him to many undecencies in his Language and Comportment. For at his Audience with the Chimacam, when he came to receive the Grand Signior's Answer, his words were vented with that heat, and so like to menaces, that the Turks taking exception thereat, returned his course Speeches with the like Dialect, at which the Ambassadour swelled with that indignation and anger, as became not the Moderation and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of his Office; adding in Conclusion, That he was an aged man, full of years and corporal infirmities, that nothing could arrive more happy to him than a death in which he should triumph to suffer for the benefit and glory of his Country. This excess and intemperance of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage moved the Turks to set a guard upon him, and confine him to his own house in the nature of a Prisoner; which violation of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Office, so worked upon his Spirits, that he often vented some part of his fury in words and blows on the Officers of his Guard; for which rude behaviour having received some reproofs from the Chimacam, his passion not knowing which way to ease it self, feavered him into a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate sickness, of which in a few days, phrensical and distracted, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted <note place="margin">The Death of the Polish Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour.</note> this life.</p>
                     <p>The Secretary of the Embassy, being the next in Office, took upon him the Function and Charge of the Ambassadour, and having now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:98602:169"/>
to act, but to receive the Answer to the Message of his Master, for which a day being appointed, he was presented with a Horse and Furniture by the Chimacam, of whom having audience, he received no other satisfaction to the complaints against the Tartars than these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which were related to me by the Secretary of the Embassy, who did me the honour to make me a Visit, when I was on my recovery from a dangerous Sickness, at <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, That no compensation or pretence be ever hereafter demanded for the late incursions made by the Tartars into <hi>Poland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, That the Polanders make not War upon the Cossacks, who had lately renounced their subjection, and were sled for protection to the Ottoman power.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That the Poles immediately make war upon the Moscovite.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That the Turk Merchants have free trade into <hi>Poland,</hi> and that the Turkish Merchants receive satisfaction for what injuries and losses they lately suffered.</p>
                     <p>With these propositions and conditions of Peace, the Secretary was dispatched, which did not so well please the Poles as to return thanks for them or a Messenger with Advice of their Acceptance or Ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and though they could not but be sensible of the scorn and yoke the Turks would impose upon them, yet having still remaining amongst them certain Reliques of their former dissentions and diversity about e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of a Successour to their King, and there being a certain spirit of Luxury, Pride, and Sedition which was crept in amongst the Nobility, they considered not the advantage of the present time, but willingly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred a present ease, and enjoyment of their Feasts and Banquets, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the hazards and uncertainties of benefit, which they might receive by the doubtful lot and fortune of War; and though never any Season appeared more opportune and advantageous to the Pole than this, when the flower of the Turkish youth and Force was employed in <hi>Candia,</hi> and all places, in part, dismantled of their usual strength and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Souldiers to defend their Frontiers; yet they seemed resolved to pass by the former incursions, and spoils, and robberies made on their people, so the Turk would but stop here, and permit them, without far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther provocation, to enjoy their quiet, and debauched way of living: Only some of the Borderers on the Turks, who had deeply suffered by the late incursions, moved with the loss of their Estates, and the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitic of their nearest Relations, joined with a considerable number of the Moscovites, entered <hi>Tartary</hi> in the Months of <hi>October</hi> and <hi>November,</hi> and burned about three hundred Villages, carrying away Captives, and other prey, from under the very Walls of <hi>Coffá.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At this time also the Pasha of <hi>Balsora</hi> began new rumours and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable Rebellion, who being reported to have an Army of Horse and Foot consisting of forty thousand men, gave no small disturbance and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension <note place="margin">The Revolt of the Pasha of <hi>Balsora.</hi>
                        </note> to the Turks; who with their difficulties of War in <hi>Candia,</hi> and the jealousies of a storm from <hi>Poland,</hi> remained with some doubts and hesitancy about the way of their proceedings. At length Orders were dispatched to the Pashaws of <hi>Erzirum, Aleppo, Damascus,</hi> and <hi>Darbiquter</hi> to unite against the Rebel, to divest him of his Government and to send his forfeited head to his Master. These Pashaws according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joining their Forces, defeated the Rebel; and as all Conspiracies of open Rebellion distant from the Court, have had but ill success in these
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:98602:169"/>
Countries against the true Prince, so this Pasha was routed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forsaken by his Servants, fled with a few horse to the protection of the King of <hi>Persia.</hi> The principal Cause which moved the Pasha of <hi>Balsora</hi> (as I was informed from the mouth of the Pasha of <hi>Damascus</hi>) to this Rebellion, was the Confidence he had in his own strength, and the fidelity of his people, to whom of ancient right, that Government was of hereditary Succession, descended to him by his Ancestors for many Generations: by which means he challenged such absolute inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in his Principality; that for many years he refused to acknowledge the Grand Signior by any other tokens of homage, than in the bare name of his Protector, and in making publick prayers for his prosperity and victories.

                     <p>About the beginning of this year the Captain-General <hi>Cornaro,</hi> with the Proveditor of the Armata <hi>Francesco Barbaro</hi> returned to <hi>Venice,</hi> bringing with them one <hi>Ramadam</hi> a Sangiac of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and other Slaves taken by the Captains <hi>Grimani</hi> and <hi>Molino.</hi> The manner was this: <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madam,</hi> with three and twenty Ships, laden with Men and Ammunition, endeavoured to enter into <hi>Canea,</hi> but being charged by the Venetians, and overcome, set fire to their Ship, and leaping into the Schiff to save their lives were taken by the Boat of <hi>Molino;</hi> and though fourteen Gallies came out of <hi>Canea</hi> to their assistance, yet they could not hinder the taking of five of their Ships, besides several others which were put ashore and strand by four Maltese Corsairs, who entered into the fight, being called at a distance by the sound of the Cannon. About that time also a Turkish Gally was surrendred by the industry and ingenuity of the slaves, who having secretly boared some holes in the bottom of the Gally, and plugged them up afterwards, so as that they might let in the water, or stop it when they pleased; it happened that the Gally being near the Rock, which is called <hi>Polycandro;</hi> they secretly drew out the plug, whereby so great a Flood of Water on a sudden came in, that the Gally being ready to sink, the Turks affrighted forsook the Gally to save themselves on the Rock, leaving the Slaves in the Gally to shift as well as they could. The Slaves being thus free'd of their Masters the Turks, plugged up the holes again, and clearing the Gally of water rowed away, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themselves into the hands of the Venetians; upon which advice, the Captain General dispatched the Captain of the Gulf <hi>Lorenzo Cornaro</hi> with two Gallies to that Rock, where they became masters of all the Turks except two, who threw themselves into the Sea, preferring death before slavery.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> recalled Marquess <hi>Villa,</hi> who was his Subject, from <hi>Candia;</hi> the reasons for which was attributed to an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Breach with <hi>Geneva,</hi> the Switzers and the Valtelines, who were his Subjects, or rather to the ill Offices of those who envied his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, being desirous to have him recalled from a place of so much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reputation. In obedience to this revocation Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his leave of General <hi>Cornaro,</hi> returned from <hi>Candia</hi> as far as <hi>Zant;</hi> where meeting the new Captain General <hi>Francesco Morosini,</hi> and being by him assured, That the Pope, and Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> representing the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of Affairs in <hi>Candia,</hi> and the present urgency and necessity for his presence there, had obtained Licence from the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> for his continuance in that employment; upon which assurance, Marquess <hi>Villa</hi>

took a resolution to return again to <hi>Candia,</hi> being accompanied with a strong Squadron of Vessels carrying considerable quantities both of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition and Provisions.</p>

                        <p>The Town was fortified with seven great Bastions, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Sabionera, Vetturi, Jesus, Martinengo, Betlem, Panigra,</hi> and St. <hi>Andrea;</hi> these were all incompassed with a large and deep Ditch, of which were the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin of St. <hi>Spirito,</hi> the Revelin of <hi>Panigra</hi> flanked to the right with the Half-moon of <hi>Mocenigo:</hi> next hereunto was the Revelin of <hi>Betlem</hi> bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering on the Work of St. <hi>Maries,</hi> which to the left had the Revelin of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and this adjoyned to the Fortification of <hi>de Palma,</hi> next whereunto was the Revelin of <hi>Priuli,</hi> with the Redoubt of <hi>Crepa-cuore;</hi> and over all was the Royal Fort of St. <hi>Demetrio,</hi> which commanded the Work of <hi>Molino</hi> and <hi>Sabionera</hi> unto the very Sea.</p>
                        <p>Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> at his last return was chiefly intent to strengthen the Fortifications, and repair the Out-works, especially that of St. <hi>Andrea</hi> which was almost ruined, and the old subterranean Traverses were so full of water, and the old Galleries so high, that the Enemy could easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pass under them, all which he repaired and amended in a short time. In confidence of gaining this strong Fortress, the Turks demolished New <hi>Candia,</hi> situate about two miles from the Old, which the Vizier now pointed out to them as a better Seat, and incouraged them to win and inhabit it; so that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Their Forces at first consisted of about forty thousand fighting Men, and eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Pioniers, but soon afterwards increased to seventy thousand, and so for the most part were maintained during the Siege.</p>

                        <p>Things thus disposed on both sides, many and various were the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Aslauts and Sallies, the Traverses extraordinary, the Rencounters bloody, the resistance vigorous, not known or recorded in any Siege before; which though they can never be fully expressed, or particularly denoted, yet I should do injury to the ashes of those Heroick Christians who so freely entred the List, and on this Theatre of the World sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed their lives in defence of Christendom, should I not signalize some of them of divers Nations for their Prowess and Valour. And here par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me, good Reader, if I come short or fail in this relation, where many of unparalleled Valour and Vertue dyed obscurely and unknown, and the numbers of others so great, that to specifie them all, were to swell this Work to a larger Volume than the Book of Martyrs. Here was that Martial field into which remote Nations and unconcerned de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended, carried thither by zeal to the Christian cause, or by certain Principles of Valour and Magnanimity; so that though the War bore no other denomination than of the Venetian and the Turk, yet so great was the confluence of both parts of the World to this little Isle, as if it had been chosen by unanimous consent for a Stage to try the Title to the Universal Empire. The Town being thus beleagured on all sides, but where <hi>Neptune</hi> the Spouse of <hi>Venice</hi> kept it open, the Christians en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured <note place="margin">The first Mine blown up.</note> first to disturb the Traverses of the Turks by a Mine of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they blew up; but through the neglect or little experience of the Engineer, it being the first which they had fired, reverted, and did more hurt to themselves than to the Enemy; the errour of which being observed, another Fornello was fired, which taking its due place and measures, so affrighted the Turks, as yet not acquainted with this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and invention of War, that they began at the first onset to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, considering that if the ground was unsecure and unstable at that distance, what abysses and chasmes must there be prepared to make them graves under the Walls or entrance to the City. To second and justifie this Gun-powder Plot the Christians made two Sallies, one by the Savoyards under Command of Colonel <hi>Profito Torse,</hi> who issued forth from the Revelin of <hi>Betlem,</hi> and made great slaughter of the Turks with Granadoes on the side of <hi>Panigra;</hi> another was performed by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Arborio</hi> and Colonel <hi>Marini,</hi> accompanied with Count <hi>Brurasco</hi>

About this time arrived at <hi>Standi</hi> the Captain-General <hi>Francesco Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosini,</hi> who after some Consultation disarming his Fleet of about a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men, entred with that Succour into the Town, and yet fitted out a <note place="margin">The Captain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>General dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arms his Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</note> convenient Squadron of Gallies and Galleasses to rove in the <hi>Archipelago</hi> to hinder the Enemies Succours and Recruits, which were designed for <hi>Candia.</hi> In this interim the Turks repaired the old Battery against the <hi>Lazaretto,</hi> and laboured continually in their Galleries and subterranean <note place="margin">Five Mines the Christians sprang.</note> Works; so that by that time that the Christians had sprang five Fornelli upon them towards the point of the Half-moon of <hi>Mocenigo,</hi> the Turks had advanced so well towards the Borders of <hi>Panigra,</hi> that they sprang two Mines; but these being but the first proofs or essays of this kind of invention, reverted on themselves with the loss of two hundred of their men, and again fired a third with little success: which the Christians answered to better purpose, blowing up sixty or seventy Turks. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Turks made a farther tryal of two Mines by the Half-moon, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to their own loss, than to the damage of their Enemy.</p>
                        <p>In all the month of <hi>July</hi> passed not a day without some considerable action, sometimes to good, sometimes with bad success to both Parties; every day Mines were sprang on both sides, destroying the Lines, and overthrowing the Galleries; but the main force and heat of the War as it were concentring it self towards the Quarters of <hi>Panigra,</hi> to defence <note place="margin">Attempts of the Turks on the side of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigra.</note> thereof the Engineer <hi>Castellan</hi> as freely as couragiously proffered the use of his Art, and the hazard of his Person. In which whilst he imployed himself, and endeavoured to cleanse the Galleries of their rubbish, which the Enemies Mines had thrown down, the Turks threw such quantities of Bomboes and Stink-pots into those Caverns, as made the stench there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of so suffocating and noisom, that two Officers were choaked or smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered that went to view the place, and Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Cavalli</hi> and the Engineer <hi>Castellan</hi> himself were brought away half dead, poysoned with Sulphur and pestiferous smoke; to purifie which Grota, nothing could render the air more wholesom, in expulsion of the preceding va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, than the smoke of Juniper and burnt Aqua vitae, which being made use of with good success, the Christians fired two Mines, which opened so dreadful an abyss, as served for the grave of great numbers of Insidels.</p>
                        <p>During this time of daily rencounters arrived the Auxiliary Gallies <note place="margin">Arrival of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies from the Pope and Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta.</note> from the Pope and <hi>Malta,</hi> commanded by Prior <hi>Bichi</hi> and <hi>Bali del Bene,</hi> as also the Gallies of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> commanded by <hi>Gianettino Dorta</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Ferrandina,</hi> of whom the Captain-General would have borrowed some Forces to have served at Land; but their Commissions it seems or their courages were too strait to afford any such Supplies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing designed to cruise in the <hi>Archipelago;</hi> only the generous Chevalier <hi>d'Harcourt</hi> with ten other Camerades that were imbarked on the Gallies <note place="margin">Chevalier d'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Harcourt.</note> of <hi>Malta</hi> agreed to enter the Garrison, having come with no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign from <hi>France,</hi> than to offer themselves in defence of the Christian cause, and in a time of Peace, when their Prince had no need of their assistance and service, to give the World true evidences and proofs of the value and greatness of their souls.

having like Gavaliers Passant acted the parts of true Chivalry. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the Prior <hi>Bichi</hi> Commander of the Popes Gallies, nor <hi>Doria</hi> Admiral of those of <hi>Naples,</hi> act agreeable to the bravery of those French Gentlemen; for they not only denied, as we have said, to land a small number of their men, but as if they came only to make them a visit, sent this short Letter of Advice dated the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> in these words. <hi>The Auxiliary Gallies are obliged to depart this night and to return to</hi> Suda, <hi>where they are to remain until the expiration of that time which is appointed for them in these Seas.</hi> Prior <hi>Bichi</hi> likewise sent word to Marquess <hi>Villa,</hi> That he judged it fit to depart, by reason that no action presented for them to undertake: to which the Marquess replied, That he who seeks may find, and that such opportunities never offer to those who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to avoid them. <hi>Doria</hi> also, to colour his excuses, said, That his Orders were not to land men, unless the Town were in the extremity of danger of being taken; to which <hi>Villa</hi> replied, That he could not well be assured in what condition the Town was, since he never vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed to set his foot ashore, or conceived a curiosity of seeing the greatest and the most famous Siege that ever was in the World. In short, these Holy and Catholick Squadrons departed without contributing any assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to the Christians, incurring thereby the severe censure of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders in chief, with the anger and disdain of the Souldiery.</p>
                        <p>The Venetians have always thought it Policy to maintain an Agent in the Ottoman Quarters, perhaps with design to afford them Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, or to be ready to apply Terms of Peace in times of most ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent necessities. According to which Rule Signior <hi>Giavarina</hi> was sent <note place="margin">An Agent ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives at Candia to treat with the Vizier.</note> to <hi>Candia</hi> upon the Venetian Armata, now governed at Sea by one <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualino,</hi> with Instructions to treat with the Vizier, and perhaps to grant him any thing besides <hi>Candia,</hi> though without this nothing could come either welcome or satisfactory to the Turks. Howsoever to introduce him into the Camp, a white Flag was displayed on the side of the <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retto;</hi> which when the Turks perceived, they flocked in great numbers to know the mystery of this Signal of Pacisication. And though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appeared, besides a Letter directed to the Great Vizier, yet they hoped it might portend something of Treaty, which in the end would produce a Peace, and a conclusion of their labours, before the Winter surprised them in their colder Lodgings. The Vizier having read the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, had his thoughts raised as high as was possible in hopes of a Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and therefore most freely ordered, That Signior <hi>Giavarina</hi> should the Sunday following come to the Valley of <hi>Gioffiro</hi> with what Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and Followers he judged sit, proffering at the same time a cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Arms and all acts of Hostility: but the Christians who were not reduced to that extremity as to crave Peace, or a respite from action, kindly refused his gentle proffer, which so inraged the Vizier, that in <note place="margin">The Turks as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault Panigra.</note> a fury he gave fire to a Mine on the left side of <hi>Panigra,</hi> which was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded with that furious assault, that <hi>Panigra</hi> had boen put into great danger, had not the courage of the Defendants been supereminent; and repulsed the Enemy with so great a slaughter, that the earth round about was covered with dead bodies: which action was seconded by a brisk Sally performed by some Knights of <hi>Malta, asla Maison Neufve, do Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geron, de Clement, de Monrosier, de Charboniere,</hi> and <hi>de Blanbuisson,</hi> though against the advice and counsel of Marquess <hi>Villa,</hi> of which the two first were slain, and the rest returned with honour and success.</p>
                        <p>At the end of this month of <hi>July</hi> the Garrison received a Supply of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:98602:172"/>
six hundred Foot under Command of <hi>Ottavio Abia,</hi> a noble Venetian, who likewise made his entry more acceptable by twenty thousand Ducats which he brought with him. At the time of his arrival the Christians si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Mine with good success, but the Enemy had prepared another in revenge, which took such effect on the right Angle of <hi>Panigra,</hi> as broke the counterscarp ten paces, and filled the Ditch with Earth, on advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of which the Turks came to an Assault, but through the courage of <hi>Luca Grandis</hi> Serjeant Major, and other gallant Officers, a stop was given to the Enemies fury, and they beaten off with considerable loss.</p>
                        <p>And now for the present all Sallies ceased, whilst both sides carried on their designs under ground, thwarthing and crossing the Mines, each of other; in which subterranean Travels and Passages, the Miners often met, and had frequent and bloody Encounters, those that were strongest rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the Powder and Utensils of the weaker, so that the Scene of War seemed to be transferred <hi>ad inferos,</hi> and to be carried on with more fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and violence in the Grave, or the other world, than it was in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Air of the Cydonian Fields. The Turks becoming now as expert as <note place="margin">The Turks fire a dreadsul Mine.</note> the Christians in their secret and hidden Traverses, had penetrated so far, that on the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>August</hi> they fired a most dreadful Mine on the side of the half Moon, which made so great a Breach in that work, that eight men could march a breast; which so animated the Enemy with the advantage, that immediately in great numbers they mounted the breach to give an Assault; but supplies being timely afforded in assistance of the Guard, the Enemy was precipitated headlong, and overwhelmed with such showers of Musket shot, that the Retreat into their works was not only disorderly, but the number of those who survived so few and diminished, as gave proof how hazardous it was to attempt other more difficult and better fortified Bastions.</p>
                        <p>Nor was the success of the Turks less on the side of <hi>Panigra,</hi> where having made a Breach, they endeavoured to make good their ground under shelter of Sacks of earth, which the Christians drew away from them with long iron hooks, which was such a piece of sport to the besieged to see their Enemies dismantled of their shelter, and lye open to their shot, that a young Page of Marquess <hi>Villa,</hi> called <hi>du Clos,</hi> venturing in this action beyond his years, was shot with a Musket Bullet in the head, and so hastned to the other World covered with glory and renown.</p>
                        <p>There was scarce now a day which passed, that was not signalized with the springing of several Mines both on one side and the other; most of those made by the Christians were seconded with Sallies, and those of the Turks with Assaults and Stormings of one Fort or other. On the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> Signior <hi>da Riva,</hi> a noble Venetian, arrived with a Recruit of five hundred Souldiers, and a great number of Pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers, and the same day was celebrated, after the usual manner, by springing of Mines; one of which threw a Turk on the Fort of <hi>Pani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra,</hi> and ruined the Galleries of the Enemy; the next day likewise se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Fornelli were fired by the Enginier <hi>Lubatiers</hi> from the parts of the half Moon, and of <hi>Panigra,</hi> which filled up the Line, and spoiled the Redoubts of the Turks.</p>
                        <p>On the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the Christians vigourously sallied out with seventy Foot, under the Command of Colonel <hi>Vechia,</hi> and two other Captains from the Revelin of <hi>Panigra,</hi> who after a valiant skirmish, orderly retreated under the rampart of the Revelin; to which place the Turks eagerly
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:98602:172"/>
pursuing them, were entertained with a Mine, and tossed into the Air; which being done, the Venetians returned again, and were in the same manner encountred by the Turks, whereby a very hot fight began; during which time the Captain General, who stood on the Bastion of <hi>Betlem</hi> to observe the motions of the Enemy, saluted them with a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful shower of Musket shot. In short, after the Venetians had for the space of an hour resisted the Force of the Enemy with much slaughter, they retired with good order into the Ditch of the City.</p>
                        <p>On the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Captain <hi>Fedeli,</hi> with a hundred Souldiers, made another Sally, but being wounded, he retreated with some loss; which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured again on the Enemy by a Mine which the Enginier <hi>Quadruplani</hi> sprang with happy success on the Quarter of <hi>Panigra;</hi> and on the same day the Captain of the Galleasses, called <hi>Gioseppe Morosini,</hi> arriving with five hundred men, and two hundred thousand Ducats together with good quantities of Ammunition and Victuals, gave encouragement and relief to all the City; with whom also came the Cavalier <hi>Gonges</hi> and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in quality of Adventurers for Honour and Religion. There was not one day in all this Month, but divers Fornelli and Mines were fired on one side and the other; and though the Christians exercised as much military Art, Industry, and Valour, as men were capable to perform, yet the Turks still gained ground, and daily advanced their works up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Christians; wherefore the Captain General ordered that a Mine and three Fornelli should be fired; by which a small Fort of the Turks, near the Counterscarp, was overthrown, with divers other works lately raised.</p>
                        <p>The Turks had such good success with their last Mines, that a Week after they fired another, which was calculated so well that it ruined the Gallery of Communication between <hi>Panigra</hi> and its Out-works, and threw the Counterscarp into the Ditch of the Town; For the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary <note place="margin">The Turks spring another Mine.</note> repair of which Breach, and clearing of the Ditch, the Governors gave immediate Order, and appointed a strong Guard for defence and protection of those that laboured; and to make better dispatch, a most ingenious Engine was contrived to remove and rid the Ditch of Earth, which whilst it worked with admirable success, the Turks, by help of a Mine, blew it into the Air, and shattered it into a thousand pieces. Howsoever, the Christians desisted not from their intended work, but still laboured with Baskets, Sacks, and Wheelbarrows to carry away the Earth; which that they might do quietly and undisturbed, the Savoyards and Sclavonians made a furious and desperate Sally, which continued for the space of two hours; and though in that time the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy had opportunity to collect their greater Force into a Body, yet the Christians were not put to slight, but retreated orderly, and in a fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing posture, though with the loss of several Officers, of which were Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain <note place="margin">Two Mines of the Christians.</note> 
                           <hi>Rè,</hi> and others. To revenge these mines of the Turks, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians fired two others as dreadful as the others; the first near S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                           <hi>Spirito,</hi> which being under the Enemies Traverses, performed its desired Effect; the second was on the side of the half Moon, which swallowed up two of their Redoubts; And on the third of <hi>October</hi> they fired four other mines on the sides of <hi>Panigra</hi> and <hi>Betlem,</hi> one of which consisted of six and thirty Barrels of Powder, and another of fourteen, ordering at the same time a furious Sally from divers places; as namely, Captain <note place="margin">Four Mines and a Sally of the Christians.</note> 
                           <hi>Gamba</hi> sallied from the Revelin of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

under the Bulwark of <hi>Panigra.</hi> Colonel <hi>George Maria</hi> was ordered to assault the Redoubts which were opposed to the Breach, Colonel <hi>Vecchia</hi> to attaque the Redoubts between <hi>Panigra</hi> and the half Moon, Colonel <hi>Cremasco</hi> and <hi>Marini</hi> to assault the redoubts between the half Moon and <hi>Betlem.</hi> Count <hi>Brusasco</hi> defended the work of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                           <hi>Maria,</hi> Colonel <hi>Inber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti</hi> defended the Revelin of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                           <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and Serjeant <hi>Motta</hi> with thirty able Souldiers advanced to the farthest Lines of the Enemy, killing and putting to flight all before them. Colonel <hi>Frigeri</hi> Captain of the Fort S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                           <hi>Dimetry,</hi> and Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Vimes</hi> possessed several Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubts; and in the conclusion all retreated in excellent order with suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess and triumph, to yield the Turks evident arguments of their forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and courage; and that the Town was still so well provided, as not only to be in a Condition of defending it self, but offending the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.</p>
                        <p>Yet the Turks were still labouring to countermine the <hi>Fornelli</hi> of the Enemy, and to revenge the former Plots; to which end they had pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated to the most inward works of <hi>Panigra;</hi> but the Pioniers, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by the Engineer <hi>Quadruplani,</hi> discovering their Gallery, entred boldly in, and drove away the Turks, from whom they took thirty two Barrels of Powder, and by that means for the present preserved that work, and the Lives of many Souldiers.</p>
                        <p>The 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> the Christians sprang two Mines, one of thirty, <note place="margin">Two Mines of the Christians.</note> and another of five and thirty Barrels of Powder, which did the desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red execution upon the Turks; which some brave spirits seconded by a bold Sally, amongst which none was more eminent than a Greek Priest, who, moved with zeal to his Country, entered far into the Enemies Trenches, where having killed a Person of Quality hand to hand, he was returning with the Trophy of his head; but being in the way inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by three at once, he was unequally matched, and slain, and died with the highest honour imaginable under the Walls of his Native City.</p>
                        <p>Soon after the Cavalier <hi>Verneda,</hi> another Engineer, fired a Mine of <note place="margin">One Mine of the Christians.</note> forty Barrels of powder, which made the very City and Works tremble, like an Earthquake; for whereas this Mine should have taken its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect on the Enemies Redoubts, Providence ordered that it should take its passage through an old Gallery, with so much violence and smoke, that it suffocated the Miners, Carpenters, and Masons, to the number of sixty men.</p>
                        <p>Towards the end of this Summer the Turks at <hi>Constantinople</hi> and <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anople</hi> grew big with the expectation of the happy News and Arrival of that messenger that should declare the taking of <hi>Candia,</hi> and the end of the Venetian War; to entertain which joy with the more readiness, they had prepared Lights, and Lamps, and artificial Fire-works to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnize their <note n="*" place="margin">Which is their Triumph for Victory.</note> 
                           <hi>Dunalma,</hi> and made publick prayers and procession of the youth of the City twice a week; but finding their hopes frustrated, and their joys from Month to Month deferred, their expectations became tyred and wearied, and growing almost ashamed of their disappointment, began to throw the blame of the miscarriage of their Affairs on the ill Conduct of the Vizier, and the sluggishness of their Souldiery. The <note place="margin">The G. Signior sends a Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to bring him certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the State of his Camp in <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia.</hi>
                           </note> Grand Signior also more impatient than the rest, dispatched away a Messenger with Letters to the Vizier, reproaching his cowardise and sloth; that being provided with a most puissant Army, and with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appointments of War, should suffer the Ottoman Force to be baffléd
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:98602:173"/>
and entertained in taking a single Fort for longer time, than formerly it had been in subduing whole Provinces and Kingdomes; and moreover charged the Messenger to bring him a faithful and true Relation of the state of all Affairs, and what was the real cause and difficulty that so long obstructed the progress of his Arms; but yet sent the Vizier for his encouragement a Sword, and a Vest of Sables, as tokens of his favour. The Great Vizier moved with this message, resolved to give some certain proofs of his industry and valour, and either to take the place, or else at least to convince his Master, by the knowledge and testimony of his Inquisitor, that the Work was of more hazard and longer time than was apprehended in the Seraglio. Whereupon preparations were made, and the time of assault was appointed chiefly on the side of <hi>Panigra,</hi> so that pressing valiantly forward, they planted six of their Colours on the ruines of that work; so that now, full of hope and courage, they adventured to descend into the Ditch, but being prevented by three Mines, which contained seventy Barrels of powder, they were mounted in the air with so much noise and violence, that many Bodies were tossed on the Rampire of the Town, many of their greatest Redoubts over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, and Graves made for multitudes of the Assailants. This As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault as it began with great fury, so it continued for many hours; in which action Signior <hi>Pisani,</hi> Proveditor General of the Kingdom, was killed by a Granado. Howsoever, the Enemy was repulsed by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the Christians, insomuch that the Turks growing faint were pressed forward by the Vizier, who, to encourage his Souldiers, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed an extraordinary reward of honour and mony to him who should but first touch the Walls with his hands. The hopes of riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour so pricked forward all conditions of the Souldiery, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty desperately threw themselves at all, and endangered so far the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Panigra,</hi> that they had certainly possessed themselves of it, had not the Venetians had recourse to their last refuge of Mines, and blown the whole Work into the Air, by which perished three Pashaws, and great numbers of common Souldiers. And this for the present astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Turks, and gave a stop to the farther proceedings of this Assault. This proof gave an evident Conviction to the Grand Signior's Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the strength of the place, and difficulty of the Work; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been an Eye-witness of all, returned with dismal Stories of a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el War, reporting perhaps, and it was related in the parts of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, That this was a place where blood was spilt day and night, where Gallant Men had forgot to sleep, living in perpetual labours, enured to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable sufferings and hourly dangers, there being none secure either in the Church, in the house, or in the street; for Granadoes rained, Cannons thundred, Arrows flew, with stones like a Tempest; so that there was none in that place, but who quartered on the Brink of the Grave.</p>
                        <p>It now grew towards Winter, and yet the Vizier thought of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Quarters than his Trenches, judging that if he should quit his sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the labours and progress of the former Summer would be lost, and the Work to be again begun in the Spring. Wherefore resolving to keep his Works, provided all conveyances to carry away the Water, and sheds to cast off the Rain, and warmer Tents for the Souldiery, which yet could not so artificially be contrived, but that the Camp was full of mire and dirt, tedious and troublesome to Man and Beast, and the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:98602:174"/>
Quarters of the Souldiery, so damp between their Banks of Earth, as caused Catarrhs, Fluxes, Feavers, and other Camp Diseases with much mortality.</p>
                        <p>It was now the dead of Winter, and yet Martial Exploits were as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent as they had been in Summer; and though the great rains and flouds <note place="margin">The Winter causes all acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to cease.</note> of water extinguished the fires, and made, as it were, a cessation of Armes, and of all acts of hostility; yet this interval of calmness and tranquillity the Christians made use of to repair the Palisade of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                           <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drea,</hi> and the Lines of Communication within the Ditch. And because the main Bulwark was also shaken, and in some danger, all the Chiorma or Slaves of the Gallies were commanded ashoar to labour in the repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to make aninward retrenchment, which in short time, with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable diligence, was perfected, and on all sides compleated.</p>
                        <p>The Turks in the mean time carried their Traverses forward as much as they could, for they were now entered into the very Ditch of the Town; and because there was no possibility to work in the Mines, by reason that the Galleries were filled with water, they attended wholly to employ their great Guns, and fire Granadoes, so that they raised a new Battery near the Work of <hi>Mocenigo,</hi> which began to batter the lower parts of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                           <hi>Andrea,</hi> and raised another Battery on the ruines of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velin of <hi>Panigra,</hi> which being lower ground could not much prejudice the main Bulwark.</p>
                        <p>The Sultan satisfied with the Relation given by his Messenger con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the progress his Vizier had made upon the Town, and of the hopes there was in time to gain it, encouraged him with a Letter of Praise, accompanied with a Sword, and Vest of Sables, the magnificent Signals of the Sultans favour., And now besides the Force of Fire-Arms, the Turks made use of Arrows, shot into the Town, carrying pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers written in Italian and French, perswading the Souldiers to fly to their Camp, where they should receive civil treatment, and a secure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge; which gave that encouragement to those wearied with the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of the Siege and hard usage, that many of them made Tryal of the Turks entertainment, and escaping out of the Works, fled to the Enemies Camp, where they were cloathed, received Conduct Mony, and were permitted Licence to embark themselves for what place they pleased.</p>
                        <p>About this time the Proveditor General <hi>Barbaro</hi> and the Licutenant General of the Artillery <hi>Uvertmiller</hi> having obtained licence from the <note place="margin">General <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> and <hi>Uvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miller</hi> depart from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> Senate, returned to <hi>Venice;</hi> the first was displeased, that Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> should take the precedence of him; and the other, because his opinion of making a general Sally of all the Garrison on the Enemy was not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, but rejected by the Council of War, as a design pernicious and over-hazardous; for that the fighting with an Enemy more numerous than themselves, fortified in their Redoubts and Works, and hidden under ground in inextricable Labyrinths, was an Enterprise so rash, that no man wishing well to the Garrison, and of sound judgment ought to advise.</p>
                        <p>The Turks having in this Campagne fixed themselves well in a formal Siege, and gained ground, and many advantages on the Christians, of which the destruction of the Work of <hi>Panigra</hi> was none of the least; the <note place="margin">The deaths of Secretary <hi>Gia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varina</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davino.</hi>
                           </note> Vizier supposed it a seasonable time to enter into a Treaty by the hand of the Secretary <hi>Giavarina,</hi> who was there entertained for that purpose;
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:98602:174"/>
but he falling sick of the Camp-distemper dyed in a short time, whose death was soon after followed by that of Signior <hi>Padavino,</hi> who finished his days at <hi>Caned;</hi> the Plate, Money, and Houshold-stuff of both were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully inventored, and by the justice of the Vizier duly accounted for, and administred to the Venetians. The Instruments of Treaty being thus taken away, the Captain-Pasha was dispatched to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> carrying with him four thousand wounded and sick men, and a Letter to the Grand Signior and Divan, signifying his resolutions to win the place, or dye under the Walls of it; and to that end desired them to send him such Recruits of men and supply of Provisions as were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site. He complained of the cowardise of those to whom they had inchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Convoys; that he wanted both Powder and Bullet, for default of which they could neither ply their great Guns, nor go forward in their Mines; that bread was so dear, that no price could be set to it; that his Souldiers by slaughter and sickness did daily diminish, so that his Army was reduced to twenty three thousand Foot, seven hundred Horse, and two thousand Pioniers; and in fine concluded with urgent instances to have Recruits of all dispeeded to him, without which it was impossible to gain the Town, or save himself. Hereupon Recruits came from all parts, both of Men, Ammunition, and Provisions, especially from the Frontiers or adjacent places, which by such vast evacuations were almost dispeopled, more particularly in <hi>Albania</hi> and <hi>Castelnuovo</hi> extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Preparations were making both of Men, Horse, and Camels; and a report was spread, that the Grand Signior intended to pass over in Person to <hi>Candia;</hi> but this was soon disproved by his residence at <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rissa,</hi> where he remained to render assistance more easily, and receive advices more speedily than could be performed at <hi>Adrianople.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Great quantities of Corn were also sent from divers places, particularly from <hi>Smyrna,</hi> where English, French, and Dutch Ships were taken up for that service, to the prejudice of the Trade, and damage of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned: some of which Vessels were taken in their passago to <hi>Candia,</hi> whilst others arrived in safety through the negligence, as was supposed, of the Commanders at Sea. And indeed the Turks plyed their business with that industry and diligence, that notwithstanding the Force which the Venetians had at Sea, their Recruits for the most part arrived safe, and Corn began to be so plentiful, that the Vizier gave a prohibition against having more imported; and in short, nothing wanted for prosecution of the War, which was carried on in the Winter, as far as the season or the weather would permit; so that scarce a day passed without some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of action, either of storming or blowing up of Forts, overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Galleries, filling Trenches, the particulars of all which are so nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that to recount them would fill a Volume, and are more proper to be related in a Journal than a History, in which minute matters ought to be passed by, and nothing but acts of greatest moment be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded.</p>
                        <p>Howsoever great Actions at this season ceased for a while on one side and the other, only continual discharges of great shot and Bomboes were practised. And the Turks endeavouring with artifice to cover their designs, dispatched a Letter to the Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> by way of <hi>Suda,</hi> and thence in a Galley to <hi>Candia,</hi> touching certain Motives of Peace, supposing that Propositions and Offers of Accommodation would loosen the minds of the Officers, and render them less intent and diligent in
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:98602:175"/>
their Affairs; on receipt of which Letter, though Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> replied, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1668"/> That he had as much power from the Senate to conclude a Peace, as the Vizier himself had from his Master, yet the Vizier would not treat with him, but sent a Letter which was consigned by an Aga at the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark of <hi>Palma</hi> under the caution of a white Flag, desiring that it should be forwarded to <hi>Venice.</hi> About this time arrived to the great comfort of the Besieged the new Proveditor <hi>Bernardo Nani</hi> with five hundred Souldiers, and <hi>Matteo Matheus</hi> Sergeant General with some Recruits from the Pope, bringing with him three hundred Medals of Silver to bestow on such as deserved them, with Jubilees and Indulgences with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number, and thus ended the Action of this Year.</p>

                     <p>THE Spring approaching, toward the end of <hi>January</hi> the Turks full of hopes to compleat their Conquest, vigorously in all maritime Ports of the Empire made provisions of Corn and other Victuals to be sent to the Camp, when occasion should require, and opened a door for Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries according to the Turkish phrase, the Formality of which is in this manner: The Chief Officer appointed for that purpose asks severally such as come to be listed, Of what Chamber they desire to be; to which <note place="margin">Formality in making sanisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in these days.</note> they making reply, That they will be of the fifth, sixth, or seventh, or the like, the Officer gives them a blow under the ear with the palm of his hand, and bids them repair to their Chamber, with which they nimbly pass away. But herein the due form and order of Janisaries was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; for in former days Janisaries were educated in that condition from children, and from thence named <hi>Yenisheri</hi> or <hi>Tyrones,</hi> or the young Souldiery; but now on this necessity of raising Forces, ancient men, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of Families with long beards were admitted, to the disparagement of that Order, and corruption of the exactness of that Discipline. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Supplies also were sent of Beldargees or Pioniers; so that this year from several parts, according to the best computation, the Forces of <hi>Candia</hi> were recruited with a Supply of seventy thousand men, for transportation of which and of their Provisions, all Christian Ships were imbarged at <hi>Smyrna</hi> and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> several of which in their voyage to <hi>Candia,</hi> were intercepted by the Maltese Corsaires, and particularly a French Ship called the Arms of <hi>France,</hi> on which were between four and five hundred Turks, was taken, and in boarding of her about an hundred Turks were killed upon the Deck: some other small Vessels (one of which was a Ligornese under English Colours) were taken, the French Barks which had in this manner lost their Corn, unadvisedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> supposing the excuse of having done their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and of being over-powered by a stronger Force was sufficient: But the Turks who judge of nothing well, but by the success, having gotten them into their hands, made them not only return their Freight, but satisfie the loss of the Cargason.</p>
                     <p>In the Month of <hi>March</hi> the Vizier having intelligence of six or seven Venetian Gallies to be at <hi>Fodile,</hi> not far from <hi>Standia,</hi> under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Proveditor of the Armata <hi>Lorenço Cornaro,</hi> gave order to <hi>Regep</hi> Pasha of <hi>Romelia,</hi> who was Captain of the Souldiery, and <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach</hi>

sore against his will, doubting the truth of the report, yet readily obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and fitted his Gallies for the Enterprise. The Captain-General having intelligence of the design, prepared four Gallies in Port, and imbarked that night with a French Regiment and some Italians to the number of six hundred, besides two Companies of the Guards, and one of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veditor <hi>Nani,</hi> under the Command of Colonel <hi>André Facile</hi> and <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alto,</hi> accompanied also with the Proveditor Extraordinary, <hi>Daniel Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niani,</hi> Commissary of the Treasury of the Militia, with several other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptains and Officers; and arriving at <hi>Standia,</hi> found the Proveditor Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Cornaro</hi> newly entred there from crusing the Seas with sixteen Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, to whom having communicated the design, they immediately loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from the Port, and arrived at <hi>Fodilé</hi> before midnight. The Turks having from the place of their Anchorage discovered two Sail, hoped there might be no more, and therefore came forth to sight them; but ingaging farther, met such a number as evidenced the danger, and the little hope there was in other than in their Courage and Arms. The night being dark, the Venetians not to mistake each other, carried such great Lights on their Mast-heads, as not only distinguished them from the Enemy, but also directed them to give battle to the Turks, which they prosecuted so home, that they took and sunk five of the Turkish Gallies, of which the Admiral commanded by <hi>Durach</hi> Bey was one; the rest, though much shattered, and for the present unserviceable, did yet by the help of their Oars, and the darkness of the night, find a way to escape: nor was this Victory gained by the Venetians in a Fight of seven hours without the loss of two hundred Souldiers killed, and about five hundred wounded, besides some Persons of Quality and Command, <hi>viz.</hi> the Cavalier <hi>Arasi Justiniani,</hi> the Commissary <hi>Francesco Cornaro, Fosca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini,</hi> &amp;c. the wounded were <hi>Georgio Greco, Lorenço Bembo,</hi> and <hi>Marco Balbi.</hi> The Turks lost many of their best Sea-men and Souldiers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides Slaves and others, counting on every Galley one with another three hundred persons; amongst the Prisoners which amounted to four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ten, the Beys of <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Navarine</hi> with <hi>Mustapha</hi> of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolia,</hi> and the Chiaus of the Pasha of <hi>Aleppo</hi> were taken, together with eleven hundred Christian Slaves who were all freed, on condition that they should serve the Summer following in the Venetian Armata. Of the Turks were slain <hi>Durach</hi> Bey, the Bey of <hi>Coron,</hi> and <hi>Hastam</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Bey of <hi>Coron.</hi> The Great Vizier from the Camp could all the time behold the flashes of the small and great shot, and by help of the Venetian Lights perceive the success of his own Fleet, not answerable to his expectation. What loss the Turks sustained with Slaves and Souldiers is incertain, only an hundred Christian Slaves were released, and four hundred Turks captivated, and amongst the slain was <hi>Durach</hi> Bey him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, a stout Sea-man, and a known Pirate, who from a small Brigantine had raised himself to be Begh of the <hi>Morea,</hi> and to command four or five Gallies of his own. In like manner, and not long after, a Squadron of Venetian Ships were forced by storm in the night to anchor under Cape <hi>Spada,</hi> where accidentally six Turkish Gallies were riding. The Sky being very dark and close, the first Ship ran foul of a Galley, and so shattered and crushed her sides, that being ready to sink, the Turks for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook her, and run aboard the Ship to save a life which was to be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards miserable and slavish. The others assrighted at the arrival of these unexpected guests, slipt their Cables to seek harbour in a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuous
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:98602:176"/>
Sea; but the weather being too boisterous for Gallies, one of them was cast away, and about an hundred and seventy men lost: the news hereof being brought to <hi>Venice</hi> by Colonel <hi>Vecchia</hi> with the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs and Spoils taken from the Enemy, the Senate bestowed the honour of Knighthood on the Captain-General, comforting the families of the slain and wounded with signal marks of Honour and Glory.</p>
                     <p>The Captain-Pasha put this year to Sea more early than was usual, designing to make as many Voyages to <hi>Candia</hi> as was possible, with Succours both of Men and Ammunition; his design and work was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to avoid the Venetians, and to steal ashore his Recruits; to which end he made such expedition in every Voyage, that scarce could the <note place="margin">The success of the Turks at Sea.</note> Christians have advice of his arrival in any part of the Isle of <hi>Candia,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was well forwarded in his return: yet his haste was not so great, but one time having fifty three Gallies in his Campany, he adventured to look into the Port of <hi>Nio,</hi> where he met four Corsaires or Free-booters under Maltese Colours, commanded by two Brothers <hi>Themericort,</hi> and by the Knights <hi>Verva</hi> and <hi>Bremont:</hi> two of the Ships were on the Careen washing and tallowing their Vessels, whilst the other two, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Themericort</hi> Brothers were on the Guard, being at anchor in the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est entrance to the Harbour. The Turks supposed at first, that so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable an appearance of their Fleet would affright the Christians to a Surrender, rather than to contend on those unequal terms. But it seems the Corsaires were more resolute than was imagined; for no sooner did the Turks approach, than the Christians discharged their Cannon and Vollies of small shot so plentifully, as caused the Gallies to dispute at a farther distance, where shooting as it were at rovers with their long Cashee Pieces (not adventuring to come to a nearer Fight) for the space of eight hours made (as reported) about eight thousand shot, with little or no execution; so that the Captain-Pasha made his sign of Retreat, and forsook the Engagement, as being too dangerous and difficult an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise. But better success had the Turks the next month at Sea against Captain <hi>Georgio,</hi> an old and subtle Pirate, who for many years had vexed and pillaged, not only the Turks, but Christians on all Isles of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chipelago:</hi> great fortune he had in taking Turkish Saiks and Vessels, and some of them considerably rich, and when that prey failed him, or was scarce, he then pursued his game on the shore, from whence he often car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried men, women, and children into slavery, and oft-times had the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of considerable Booty. The Islands which lay open and unguarded <note place="margin">Captain <hi>Gior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio</hi> taken by the Turks.</note> were his common Rendezvous, where the men attended his service, and the women his lust. In this manner this Pirate passed for several years, having obtained unto himself a fame and terrour with the Turks, and richess at home: the place which he commonly chose to wash and tallow his Vessels, was amongst certain small Isles in the Bay of <hi>Edremit,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently <hi>Adrimetum,</hi> opposite unto <hi>Mytilene,</hi> from whence he had as from a Thicket or Wood a view of such Vessels as passed the great Road to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Constantinople:</hi> these frequent successes rendred him so confident and secure, that he still continued his station, notwithstanding the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish Naval Forces, which in the Summer season made their Rendezvous at <hi>Scio.</hi> But at length the Captain-Pasha with the whole Turkish Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata being at <hi>Scio,</hi> and with him three Ships of <hi>Tripoli,</hi> advice came that Captain <hi>Georgio</hi> had not forsaken his little Isles, but was there careening his small Fleet which consisted of two Ships and a Brigantine: hereupon
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:98602:176"/>
the Tripoleses were commanded out to encounter the Enemy, whom the next day they found so secure and negligent, that he discovered not his Foes before they were ready to attaque him. The Captain Pasha also fearing that the Tripoleses were not of sufficient Force to encounter so valiant and experienced a Commander, both to make the Enterprize the more easie and certain, and to gain the reputation of that business to himself, went out in person with all his Gallies. The Tripoleses had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fire on Captain <hi>Georgio</hi> before the Pasha came in to their assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but it falling calm, and the Ships not able to join in a nearer fight, gave way for the Gallies, which being above fifty in number, overpower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Christians on all sides; howsoever, the two Ships defended themselves against all this Force, until the Captain himself being killed, his own Ship surrendred, but so shattered, that she was scarce able to swim above water. This Ship being overcome, the Turks boarded the other, commanded by Captain <hi>de Leseases,</hi> who seeing no remedy to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void being taken, he leaped into his Boat, and blew up his Ship; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever could not escape his destiny, for having his Arm broke, he became a prey and a slave to his Enemy.</p>
                     <p>The News of this Victory was celebrated with so much the more joy, by how much this person was feared and hated; and was not only a subject of rejoycing to the Turks, but also to the Christians, whose Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Relations this Corsaire had pillaged and enslaved; so that the Inhabitants of the <hi>Archipelago</hi> for the most part were pleased with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and promised more security and quietness to their open Coasts. With no less triumph was this News posted to the Grand Signior, who rewarded the Messenger with two thousand Dollars gratuity, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed demonstrations of joy to be made through the whole Court; so dreadful was grown the Name of so inconsiderable a person, in respect of the greatness of the Ottoman Empire.</p>
                     <p>But the success of this advantage did not heighten the courage of the Captain Pasha to that pitch, as to make him more bold with the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Armata; for in the month of <hi>July</hi> having great Recruits of Men and Provisions to land, and hearing that the Venetians lay before <hi>Canea,</hi> having fortified a Rock, called S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Todoro,</hi> at the mouth of that Port, he resolved for <hi>Retimo;</hi> but pursuits, or intelligence of the Enemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the way, or his own fears still prevented him, until at length he was forced to <hi>Gira-Petra,</hi> a small and obscure place, far distant from the City of <hi>Candia,</hi> and the way thither by land rocky, and almost unpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable for Beasts of Burden; howsoever, the Men and Ammunition were there landed with that haste and expedition, that in less than thirty hours time the Captain Pasha was again upon his return for <hi>Scio,</hi> leaving the Souldiery, and the Ammunition he had disbarked to find a passage through the Rocks and Mountains: At which the Vizier was so displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that he sent the Captain Pasha this Message, That the next time he should forbear to bring farther supplies, until he could find a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious Port wherein to land them.</p>
                     <p>In this manner the Marine Affairs passed this year at Sea, the Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Fleet having, besides other succours, transported <hi>Ibrahim</hi> Pasha of <hi>Damascus</hi> with eight hundred Spahees unto <hi>Candia,</hi> whom we mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned formerly to have been Pasha of Grand <hi>Cairo,</hi> and married to the Grand Signior's Sister; and being one with whom I had a former acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and who was a great friend to the English Nation, I made him a visit as he passed through <hi>Smyrna.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="246" facs="tcp:98602:177"/>
Whilst these matters were transacting at Sea, on the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> arrived the new Proveditor General <hi>Bernardo Nani,</hi> and Sergeant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Mutio Matei</hi> with five hundred Foot, sent by the Pope, who gave i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence for destruction of some Monasteries, whose Orders were judged less necessary in the Venetian State, that their Revenue might be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the service of this War; after Arriva of which succours, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Muster was made of the whole Garrison, and the number thereof reckoned to amount unto eight thousand fighting Men; though soon afterwards continual action and exploits of War decimated the number, and many of the brave Commanders being taken off, every tenth man perished, and rendred the place in a condition which required continual supplies.</p>
                     <p>For many and various were the attempts and actions performed on both sides under the Walls of <hi>Candia;</hi> and first the Turks began to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a Battery which they had raised on the side of the <hi>Lazaretto,</hi> which so offended the Port, that there was no harbour or access for Vessels. On the contrary to which, by the Fort of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Andrea</hi> another Battery was raised, which offended <hi>Tramata</hi> very much, which was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther small harbour, capable only to receive Boats or Barks; the passage to which was so annoyed now by the Enemies Cannon, that no Vessel could go in or out, unless in the Night, and that too with some difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and danger.</p>
                     <p>The Turks gaining advantage on the side of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Andrea,</hi> applied their <note place="margin">The Turks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to make their passage by St <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>Andrea,</hi> and with an Engine strained it so violently, that they tore away several of the main Stakes of the Work without being perceived by the Centinels, who paid for that neglect with the price of their lives; upon which success they continued to advance their lines on that side, which Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> perceiving, resolved to hinder by some valiant sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. And first two hundred brave men selected out of several Regiments, conducted by Sergeant Major <hi>Motta,</hi> issued out from <hi>Panigra,</hi> and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their way along the Sea, bravely mixed with the Turks, and put them to slight; and though the Alarm thereof brought a Concourse <note place="margin">A Sally made by the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> of Turks from all parts of the Camp, yet the Christians stood so stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to it, that they struck a terror to their Enemies, and once forced them to a Retreat within their Trenches; and at length, after they had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown certain Redoubts and Traverses, they gave back with good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, returning with Victory and Glory; which bravery the Captain Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral acknowledged to all, and encouraged in the common Souldiery with a Present of fifty Zechins. This success gave the besieged opportunity to finish their Platforms which they had raised on the side of the Ditch adjoining to the Bulwark of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Andrea,</hi> on which they planted two pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Cannon which carried fifty pound Bullet a piece; which much disturbed the Enemies Traverses: Howsoever, the Turks with indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pains, and invincible patience battered the little Tower of <hi>Priuli,</hi> the Curtain, and Revelin of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Andrea,</hi> and employed all their power and attention to fill the Ditch with Faggots, Earth and other Rubbish.</p>
                     <p>On the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> after the Christians had first made a Breach on the Enemies Redoubt, which confronted the Revelin of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Andrea,</hi> and sprang five Mines one after the other, a second Sally was made by a considerable Body of the besieged, consisting of two hundred French
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:98602:177"/>
and Savoyards, three hundred Italians, two hundred Germans, and a hundred and twenty horsemen, who issued forth with that Gallantry, that driving the Turks under Covert, advanced far within their Works, <note place="margin">Another Sally.</note> with which Demonstration of honour the Captain General being satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they made the smoke which was a Signal for their Retreat; so that returning victorious without much loss, that day was remarkable, and numbred amongst the other days which were esteemed successful and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in that Siege.</p>
                     <p>Howsoever, the Turks with admirable patience and assiduity crept forward by their Traverses, and help of their great shot on the Bastion of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Andrea,</hi> which whilst <hi>Augustine Rostayne,</hi> Adjutant of Marquess <hi>Villa,</hi> considered, he was taken off by a Cannon Bullet; and yet the Turks could not advance so fast, but that the Engineer <hi>Maupassan</hi> gave some retardment to their progress by firing a Mine, which overthrew two of their Redoubts, and afforded them new work to repair them and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining Traverses.</p>
                     <p>This was the present state of the miserable <hi>Candia,</hi> when the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> recalled his Subject Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> from his honourable employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and a Ship, called <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, by appointment of the <note place="margin">Marquess <hi>Viils</hi> returns into <hi>Italy.</hi>
                        </note> Venetian Senate arrived at <hi>Standia</hi> to transport him and his Family to <hi>Venice;</hi> so that on the 11 of <hi>April,</hi> accompanied to <hi>Tramata</hi> by all the principal Officers of the Garrison, he embarked in order to his Voyage, whose place was about two Months after supplied by the Marquess S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Andrea Montbrun,</hi> a Nobleman of <hi>France,</hi> with whom the Venetian Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour at <hi>Paris,</hi> by order of that Republick, had prevailed to take upon him the defence and protection of that deplorable City, reduced now almost to its ultimate Crisis.</p>
                     <p>I cannot adventure to assign the reasons that might induce the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to recal the worthy Governour from this glorious action. Some say, that those who were emulous of his glory procured his revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; Others, that the Marquess himself desired it; and that finding <note place="margin">Causes of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess <hi>Villa's</hi> departure.</note> the Forces of the Town to decline, and the Turks to encroach and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate daily into the innermost parts of strength, he was desirous, after so long a Siege, to return with untainted glory; or perhaps weary of a Siege so tedious and perilous, he might desire to retire, having performed sufficient already in his own person, and enough to make all Christendom his Debtors and Admirers. So that I cannot but reproach those tongues and pens, which in report and writings attribute the cause of Marquess <hi>Villa's</hi> retirement to certain just occasions of discontent given him by the Captain General <hi>Francesco Morosini,</hi> who, envious of his Fame and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and unwilling to have a consharer with him in his honours, did u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually thwart his Counsels and Proposals; and more particularly contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Redoubt which Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> had built, and of which he had a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar esteem. Yet that <hi>Morosini</hi> might evidence the unsufficiency thereof, 'tis reported that he wrote a Letter to the Vizier, to assault that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt; for if he did, he promised to afford him opportunity to take it, by withdrawing all Forces from thence; which Letter, it is said, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed to Marquess <hi>Villa,</hi> and brought to his hands, which he with great prudence and moderation dissembled until the hour of his departure, and then produced it to the astonishment and shame of <hi>Morosini.</hi> To this particular I give the less belief, because I find it wrote in a Journal of this Siege by a person who was a great Favourer of the French, and
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:98602:178"/>
willing to share the intire glory to that Nation, and the miscarriages to the Italian. Whatsover might be the motive to Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade his return, is uncertain; howsoever, it is reported, that being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Zant</hi> in his way to <hi>Venice;</hi> and there meeting a strong Convoy bound for <hi>Candia,</hi> with recruits of Men, and plenty of provisions, he conceived new thoughts of the greatness of the Republick; and behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also with what vigour and vigilance they attended to the conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of that place, he began to testifie some remorse and dissatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for having abandoned a Charge which rendred his Fame great through the World; and the continuation of which labours being crowned with that success which his courage and conduct merited, might have brought a Blessing to all Christendom, and perpetuated his honour and glory to all posterity. The Marquess being arrived at <hi>Venice</hi> was received with the usual Ceremonies and Honours from the Publick, and being introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, after private Audiences, into the Colledge, he spake in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                     <p>IF the thanks which I render to your Serenity, and to your Excellencies <note place="margin">Marquess <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la's</hi> Speech.</note> could equal the greatness of those favours which I have received from you, it would have been but an ordinary glory to you not to have infinitely surpassed the bounds of my acknowledgements, as you have infinitely outdone the utmost of my Deserts; Nor could this August Senate have been exalted to the most elevated point of Soveraign Power, had I been able to render Services worthy of that generosity which composed it. For as the affection of the Creatures towards God, makes excuses for their wants and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; so having a zealous desire to contribute to the glories of this most Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Republick, not only my endeavours, my labours, and my bloud, but also my life, and my whole being; I beseech you to accept thereof as an attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the weakness of my abilities. This, my Lords, is that desire which I have ever demonstrated in all the wearisome performances of my Charge under the generous Conduct of the Captain General of your Armes, whose Valour I have endeavoured to second and imitate. This is that Desire which would have entertained me in the service of this most Serene Republick to the ultimate period of my life, if the Command of my Prince, concurring with the Assent of your Serenity, had not enjoyned my return. I confess, that I should feel in my self an inward Consolation, could I assist at the triumph of <hi>Candia,</hi> which I hope in a short time to see victorious over all her Enemies; until when, my Lords, the honour which you have been pleased to do me hitherto, cannot but be relished by me as a Comfort of my life. And what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Glory can I imagine to my self, than to have served a Republick, which may be called the most perfect work of the hand of God, which being found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like the Firmament upon the Waters, communicates happy Tranquillity through all the World? I am able now to boast, That I have seen a City which of it self alone is able to resist the Puissance of all <hi>Asia,</hi> and that I have proved and tryed the valorous opposition which it made against a formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Enemy. I can (I say) glory that I have awakened in the hearts of your Souldiery, their ancient Valour, and that I have sprinkled your Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels with my own Bloud; and it is but just that I should distil it to the last drop for the service of this most Serene Republick, which after so many Ages resigns it self up a Sacrifice for all Christendom. It is by your Arms (my Lords) and by your immoveable Constancy, that the City of <hi>Candia,</hi> which in former Days was esteemed the weakest of all the Fortresses of
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:98602:178"/>
                        <hi>Greece,</hi> is become at present the most famous Theatre of War. I dare not only hope, that the conclusion thereof will be happy, so long as your Serenity watchfully attends to the conservation of that place, but that also this August Senate will extend their Conquests into the most remote parts of all the East. This would be, most Serene Prince, and most Excellent Lords, the consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all my desires, and also that I might finish my days in the Service of this most Serene Republick, towards which I shall for ever conserve a most passionate zeal and an immortal acknowledgment.</p>
                     <p>The Senate, that they might testifie the esteem they entertained of the person of Marquess <hi>Villa,</hi> presented him with a Bason of Gold valued at six thousand Ducats, together with a Patent recounting at large the many famous Exploits which he had performed in their Service, which they expressed with a stile so generous and obliging, as may serve for a Record to transmit the Fame of his Merits to all Posterity.</p>
                     <p>Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> being departed from <hi>Candia,</hi> the Captain-General re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called all his Forces from divers parts of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> which he had sent thither with the Souldiers wounded in the last Battle; and being returned, they brought with them great numbers of Pioniers and Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to labour in the Fortifications and Mines: at the same time also the Captain-Pasha arrived at <hi>Canea,</hi> bringing two thousand Janisaries with him.</p>
                     <p>The Marquess St. <hi>Andrea Montbrun,</hi> a Gentleman of the French Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">Marquess St. <hi>Andrea</hi> visits the Works.</note> was transported to <hi>Candia</hi> by the General Proveditor <hi>Cornaro,</hi> where being entred into the Charge and Office of Marquess <hi>Villa,</hi> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing of the vigilance and circumspection of his Predecessour. And therefore in the first place having visited all the Forts, Out-works, and Retrenchments of the Town, ordered what was necessary for repair of the breaches, and amended what was deficient in the most distressed Fortifications. And though the Turks fired a Mine the 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>August</hi> at the point of the Fort St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> which made a most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous breach; yet it was so valiantly defended, and so speedily repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Enemy gained little or no advantage, and all by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary diligence of this Marquess St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> who passed whole months without uncloathing himself; and as his nights were without sleep, so his days consumed without repose, applying himself personally to all places where was most of danger, especially at the Fort of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drea,</hi> where he took up his constant Quarters.</p>
                     <p>The Turks now daily pressing the Town more nearly than before, Skirmishes and Sallies were more frequent and more bloody; so that about this time the Proveditor General <hi>Bernardo Nani</hi> applying himself with all earnestness in the performance of his Charge, was slain by a Musket-shot in his head; his death was much lamented by all, being a Gentleman who was born (as may be said) in the Fleet, having had his Education there, and passed his youth in Wars and dangers for the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and honour of his Country. <hi>Girolamo Bataglia</hi> was elected by the Republick to succeed him in the Office, whose death was also seconded by that of <hi>Francesco Bataglia,</hi> Brother of the Duke of <hi>Candia,</hi> being shot in the breast with a Musket-bullet; and though he was sent thither to administer Justice to the People, yet his zeal and courage carrying him to Martial Acts beyond his duty, made a grave for him amongst the other Heroes and Worthies of that place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="250" facs="tcp:98602:179"/>
The Turks approaching daily nearer with their Works, infested very much the passage of Vessels to the Town, and shot so directly into the Port, that no Ship, Galley, or Bark could remain in any security from their Cannon; to remedy which, a small Redoubt was raised at <hi>Tramata,</hi> which being well and strongly fortified served for a small Port, under the shelter of which the lesser Vessels found some protection, and was of great relief to the distressed City. About this time the Popes Gallies with those of <hi>Malta</hi> arrived, commanded by <hi>Fra. Vincenzo Rospigliosi,</hi> the Popes Nephew, who having not brought a greater number of people than what served to man their Gallies, they were not able to spare many for defence of the Town.</p>
                     <p>The long continuance of this Siege, and the fame thereof noised through the whole World, moved the heroick and gallant Spirits of our Age, to descend into this <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> this Field of War, and give proofs of their Prowess and Valour in defence of the Christian Cause; some being moved by a principle of vain-glory, proceeding from the briskness of a youthful and aery Spirit, and others from the sense of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and fervour towards Religion: amongst which none were more forward than some Gentlemen of the French Nation, as namely Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>La Fueillade, aliàs</hi> Duke of <hi>Roanez,</hi> with the Count St. <hi>Paul,</hi> a young Cavalier; to forward which design, taking first the Licence and Benediction of their King, they appointed their Rendezvous at <hi>Tolon,</hi>

                        </note> where they listed two hundred Gentlemen, Cadets or younger Brothers, who went in quest of Honour, and not of Pay, with four hundred ordinary Souldiers who expected their maintenance from the bounty of their Leaders. The chief of whom was Monsieur <hi>La Fueillade,</hi> and his Lieutenant the Chevalier <hi>De Tresines.</hi>

When these Persons of Honour and Courage arrived at <hi>Candia,</hi> they found the City hardly beset, and reduced to a strait and difficult condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for the Turks were advanced so near to the Fort of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> that the Souldiers within and without could cross their Muskets, and reach Tabaco one to the other: howsoever this breach was so well repaired with a good Palissado fortified with several Bonnets, and a double Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment on the Bastion it self, and a third Retrenchment of squared stone withal, that the oourage of the Besieged being nothing abated by the many and furious assaults of the Enemy, the Town still remained in a defensible posture, and still capable with good Succours and Supplies to yield matter of imployment for several years to the Ottoman Forces. These worthy Champions, as I said, being arrived, moved with the sense of Religion, and desire of glory to themselves, challenged the priviledge of mounting the Guard of St. <hi>Andrea;</hi> but that being already preposses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Knights of <hi>Malta</hi> and other Officers of the place, was refused to them. Howsoever the Captain-General <hi>Morosini</hi> was pleased to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them with the Guard of a small Chapel over that Bastion on the right hand of the breach, a place of no less danger, and therefore of no less honour than the other; with which the Cavaliers being satisfied, Monsieur St. <hi>Paul</hi> mounted the Guard one day at six a clock in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:98602:179"/>
and continued there until the same hour of the day following; during which time he lost his Major <hi>Dupré</hi> and Monsieur <hi>De Marenval,</hi> the latter of which had his brains knocked out with so violent a blow of a great shot, that some pieces of his skull dangerously wounded the Sieurs <hi>De Chamilly</hi> and <hi>De Lare,</hi> who were near to him: and more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously did the Turks ply the stations of these new-come Guests than any others, throwing Bomboes, Granadoes, Stink-pots, and other sorts of artificial Fire without cessation into their Quarters, notwithstanding which, this young Prince and Monsieur <hi>La Fueillade</hi> exposed themselves like common Souldiers, animating their men more with their example than their words.</p>
                     <p>And now by this time by so many Works and removals of Earth, by so many Traverses and Mines under ground, and throwing up the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns and bowels of the Earth into the Air, the soil became so brittle, crumbling, and as it were sandy, and like ashes, that it seemed not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable longer of enduring the Pick-ax or the Shovel, and was so porous, that the light of some Mines glimmering into the others Traverses, easily discovered each others Mines, whereby it became equally a trade and custom to steal Powder. Howsoever the Venetians so closely worked <note place="margin">The Christians overthrow a battery of the Turks.</note> with those Props and Arts, that they formed a considerable Mine, which on the first, of <hi>December</hi> they sprang with so much success, that they wholly overthrew a Battery of the Turks directed against St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> and buried all their Cannon.</p>
                     <p>But these French Gallants intended not from the first of their design to make this War their Trade, or the Town of <hi>Candia</hi> their place of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, but as Passengers or Pilgrims, whose souls are active, and hate idleness, to give the World some proofs of their Valour, and so away: wherefore <hi>La Fueillade</hi> their General pressed <hi>Morosini</hi> to give leave, that he and his Fellow-Souldiers might make a Sally, and enter into the Enemies Trenches, so as to yield a divertisement to those on the Walls; and perform that Action and Enterprise for which they had designed and undertaken this Voyage: of which some of them were so impatient, that they would not expect Orders for their Sally, as the Chevalier <hi>De Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,</hi> who alone entred into the Enemies Works, and returned with his Sword all bloody; at which <hi>La Fueillade</hi> his Commander was so incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that he reproved him with this short reprehension, <hi>I would as gladly see a Butcher as you.</hi> Others by this example scarce refrained from the like; amongst which Monsieur <hi>De Ville Franche</hi> drew a Turk by force from his Trench, and brought him to the foot of the Bastion; but there he was forced to quit his Prize, for being shot in the Leg with a Pistol-bullet, soon after dyed of the wound: By these examples the Commanders seeing it impossible to repress or abate the mettle of these vigorous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, their bridle was taken off, and licence given to make their excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; so that all things being ordered and contrived for a Sally, before break of day in the morning they silently issued forth, and leaping into <note place="margin">A Sally made by the French.</note> the Enemies Quarters, valiantly mingled with them, cutting and hewing down all before them; their Banner was a Crucifix carried in the Front by Father <hi>Paul</hi> a Capuchin Fryer, who little regarding those who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, proceeded with his Ensign as unconcerned, as if he had been in Procession; which so animated the Souldiery, that like men conducted by miracle, they broke through the gross Body of the Enemies Force: and so violent they were in their combate, and so intent to their business,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:98602:180"/>
that they neither observed the multitudes of the Enemy which came upon them, nor the signal of their Commander for a Retreat; until at length discovering their danger, they made speed with some disorder to return, having lost an hundred and twenty Gentlemen in this rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whose heads being cut off (as the custom of the Turks is) were pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Pikes end, and ranked before the door of the Viziors Tent, amongst which the head of the Marquess <hi>Doradour</hi> did beyond all the others draw the eyes of the Turks, who admired the clearness of his complexion, and fairness of the hair; which being breaded in tresses for the more convenience in fighting, made death it self beautiful, and was at the same time both his Enemies glory and their compassion. The French having thus evaporated their fury with this Phlebotomy, there not remaining above two hundred and thirty after this Sally of all those six hundred brought into <hi>Candia,</hi> Monsieur <hi>La Fueillade</hi> with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques departed: at which time the whole strength of the Town con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted of about seven thousand stranger Souldiers, four thousand Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and two thousand Savoyards, which was too weak a Garrison to resist so potent an Enemy, so formally and strongly incamped, unless supplied with new Recruits. Wherefore the Dukes of <hi>Brunswick</hi> and <hi>Lunenburg.</hi> mindful of their Christian Brethren in this distressed Siege, contributed three Regiments towards their relief, consisting in all of <note place="margin">The Dukes of <hi>Brunswick</hi> and <hi>Lunenburg</hi> sent Forces to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Candia.</hi>
                        </note> three thousand three hundred men. The first under Count <hi>Waldeck,</hi> the second under <hi>Molleson,</hi> and the third under Count <hi>Radesfeld.</hi> They made their Muster first at <hi>Verona,</hi> and imbarking at <hi>Venice</hi> the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> on the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1669: they arrived at <hi>Candia.</hi> These valiant Souldiers desiring to ease the long besieged Companies, demanded the Guards of <hi>Sabionera</hi> and St. <hi>Andrea;</hi> which being by this time become hot and dangerous stations, were not disputed with that heat of honour as formerly, but were easily yielded to the fresh and new-come Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery. Many now and various were the assaults which the Enemy made upon the Town, hoping to carry it by dint of Sword; but the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans unweariedly maintained their valour and courage, and particularly the Lunenburghers, whose gallantry deserved its due praise and reward. Their General Count <hi>Waldeck</hi> whilst he undauntedly incouraged his men, and openly exposed himself on the Works, received a mortal wound, of which soon afterwards he dyed; but before he expired, he assembled together his Fellow-Souldiers, and incouraged them in the Holy cause they were come to maintain, giving them as a Farewel-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <note place="margin">Count <hi>Waldeck</hi> dyes of his wound.</note> instructions, and perswasive arguments to a godly life, and having confessed his own sins in the presence of them all, he resigned his spirit into the hands of his Creator, leaving not only his own Forces, but the whole Town disconsolate for the loss of so able a Commander.</p>
                     <p>And now the time of year approaching, wherein the Town expected its ultimate Relief, and the Union of all the Princes of Christendom for raising the Siege, which had continued for the space now of about two years; the valiant Christians full of hopes, daily animated each other, casting their eyes to Sea-ward, promised a reward to the first Descryer of the long desired Fleet. The Turks also being advised of the expected Succours, resolved if possible to perform the business designed before their arrival; and thereupon made one of the greatest assaults that ever was yet given to the Town, in which though the Christians behaved themselves with all valour imaginable, yet the Turks still gained farther
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:98602:180"/>
footing and advantage. And now it fared with the Town after every storm, as it doth with a physical body after every accession of a Feaver, which though it intermits for some time, yet it leaves the Patient always more weak and debilitated than before. Wherefore the Christians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing in care and diligence, the Captain-General disarmed several of his Gallies to supply the Town with what Force he could possibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, and the Engineers imployed their brains for destruction of the Enemy, so that they fell again to their Mines, and sprang one which took good effect; soon after they sprang seven others, after which four more near the Revelin of St. <hi>Spirito,</hi> which blew up many Turks, ruined their Lodgings, and buried one of their Batteries: these also were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by another Mine of an hundred and sixty Sacks of Powder, which took its way between St. <hi>Andrea</hi> and the Revelin of St. <hi>Spirito</hi> with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary <note place="margin">A Mine of an hundred and sixty Sacks of Powder fired by the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> execution and violence, throwing up that vast quantity of Earth and Timber, that it not only overwhelmed the Enemy in the neighbouring Trenches, but overthrew a Battery of three Pieces of Cannon, which the Turks had raised on the Revelin of St. <hi>Andrea:</hi> yet all this served to increase the heat and fury of the Enemy rather than abate it; for they imagining this to be the ultimate force and the last blast of the expiring Fortress, plyed their assaults with the more fury and madness, pressing forward the crowds of the Souldiery collected lately in Villages, and the Janisaries newly created taken from the Plough to be matter and fuel for the Christians Powder.</p>
                     <p>Winter now approaching, and the Vizier resolving to quarter a second year under the Walls of <hi>Candia,</hi> began to provide against the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and resolved to lye still until the Spring should renew the time for action, but never intermitted his imployment of plying constantly his Batteries, and shooting Bomboes into the Town. In the mean time the Besieged being animated by their new additional Forces, whose spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits also were high, and desirous of action; the Commanders thought it not policy to suppress the heat and mettle of their courage at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, but gave way to the Souldiers proposition of a Sally, which was effected in the month of <hi>December</hi> with no bad success. For the Christians surprising the Turks unawares, little dreaming of any such design, fell in amongst them on the side of <hi>Sabionera,</hi> where they took <note place="margin">The Christians sally on the side of <hi>Sabio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera.</hi>

                           <hi>Katirgi-Oglé</hi> his original and life.</note> was formerly a common Thief, who robbed on certain Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains near <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Pisidia,</hi> called <hi>Ock-shaher,</hi> which now have their names from him: and being a couragious man and fortunate, drew a considerable number of Miscreants from all parts to follow him in his Enterprises. His profession was not to rob Caravans or Merchants tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling in their honest imployment; but Knight-Errant-like pretended to revenge the injuries and abuses of his Country by the unjust and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Ministers, whom for robbing and oppressing the people, he estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it Justice and Vertue to deprive of their ill gotten Wealth.

                     <p>Various were the Sallies and Conflicts the Christians made upon the Turks towards the end of this Year; one of which, after that forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was made by Marquess <hi>Villa,</hi> who with a thousand two hundred men fell in upon the Turks Trenches, where he had so good success, that he brought back with him a hundred Turks heads, which he planted on the Walls.</p>

But not long after the Marquess <hi>Cornaro,</hi> and the Baron <hi>Spar</hi> arriving with a Recruit of three thousand Men, as if they intended to requite the Turks last Assaults, made so resolute and so successful a Sally, that they left above two thousand Infidels dead upon the place, with a considerable number of their Officers.</p>

But before the departure of this Female Court, the disposal of the Grand <note place="margin">The Janisaries jealous of the safety of the Sultans Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> Signior's Brothers was moved and questioned by the Janisaries, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving long since been jealous and doubtful of their safety, did demand, that the protection and custody of them should be committed to the Queen Mother; who willingly received the Charge, and gave security by Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to defend and preserve them from all private Treachery, or publick Attempts with the same tenderness and care as she should her own life, or the life of her Son. In this manner these Princes and Princesses de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting, made a solemn and magnificent entrance into <hi>Constantinople.</hi> The chief of the Cavalcade was <hi>Kul-ogli,</hi> the Grand Signiors Mosayp, or Favourite, attended with a hundred and fifty Pages in Coats of Male, and Satten Vests; in one Coach was the <hi>Valedé</hi> Sultana, or the Queen Mother, in the next was the <hi>Hasaki</hi> Sultana, or the Grand Signior's Queen, in the third were the Brothers, in the fourth was the young Prince, or the Grand Signior's Son, after came the Conehes of more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Ladies attended with about a hundred and fifty black Eunuchs, in Vests of white Satten.</p>
                        <p>The Grand Signior also preparing for his journey to <hi>Larissa,</hi> pitched his Tents without the City; from whence one day vjewing round the Camp from a Jardac, or Tent, elevated above the rest, he espied with a Prospective Glass a certain person taking Tabaco in his Tent, whilst a Slave rubbed his Legs: His Attendants not able or willing upon his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to inform him who he was, he sent an Officer to make Enquiry, <note place="margin">The Gran. Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior displeased with Tabaco.</note> who returned with Answer, that it was <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> Aga, the Kahya or Steward to the Chimacam, and in effect Chimacam himself, having a great share in the mannagement of Affairs; but the smoke had like to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> smothered him and all his Fortunes; for this Grand Signior, who is as great an Enemy to it as King <hi>James</hi> was, or Sultan <hi>Morat,</hi> would have made him the Sacrifice to that Incense, had not those present inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded for him; who with the Chimacam's own mediation, and the cost of fifty Purses, or five and twenty thousand Dollars, ransomed his Life.</p>
                        <p>The Sultan being arrived at <hi>Larissa,</hi> News came of the near approach of the Excellentissimo <hi>Alvise de Molino,</hi> Ambassadour from the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <note place="margin">An Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour sent from <hi>Venice.</hi>
                           </note> Republick, with propositions of peace. But the Turks before they would admit the Embassy, or the person which brought it, to a nearer approach than a Days Journey from the Court, would be resolved first whether he brought with him the Keys of <hi>Candia;</hi> To which it was replied by the Interpreter, That he was not able to give them satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in that particular, being but a mean and ordinary servant, to whom the Secrets of State, and resolutions of great men were not committed, his Office being only to render faithfully the words and sence of his Masters, and not to enter into the private thoughts and Cabinet of their Counsels. To which the Chimacam proudly and barbarously made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, Go tell thy Master, that unless he brings the Keys of <hi>Candia,</hi> thy head shall pay for it. And that he presume not in person to approach nearer unto this Court. So the Ambassadour remained at a distance for some weeks, and at length was transferred over to the Vizier at <hi>Candia;</hi> who being more ready to hearken to propositions, in hopes by some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verture or other to hook in <hi>Candia,</hi> gave an easie Audience to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:98602:182"/>
 and controverted several Articles and Propositions with all freedom and patience. So that on the Venetians part, the Surrender of <hi>Suda</hi> was offered, and a Sum of money, in compensation of the War. The Vizier on the other side would be contented with nothing less than the Surrender of <hi>Candia;</hi> and in lieu thereof to grant a Licence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>build <hi>Paleo-Castro,</hi> an ancient Fortress. But the Fortress it self of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> being the prize and aim of both, nothing could be concluded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that; so that, the Ambassadour in fine, declared plainly, That the City of <hi>Candia</hi> was maintained and defended by the Armes of Foreign Princes, without whose consent it could not be resigned; all the rest of the Island should be the reward of their bloud and labour, only <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> was capable of no Conditions, but what were imposed on it by force of Armes.</p>
                        <p>The Vizier, whose honour could be salved, and the glory of the Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman Empire maintained, at no other rate than the subjection of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> would hearken to no other terms or proposals; so that the Treaty broke off, and the Ambassadour returned to <hi>Canea,</hi> there to remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til farther Overtures of an Accommodation should present.</p>
                        <p>It was now towards the depth of Winter when three men of War and a Fire-Ship, sent by the most Christian King, steered up the Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spont with words and boastings as full of Wind as their Sails; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">

                           </note> arrived at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> vaunting of their Force, as if sufficient to subdue the Turkish Dominions, they uttered certain rumours, that they were come to revenge the late affront offered to their Merchants, to cause that money to be repaid, which in late and frequent Avanias had been extorted from their Nation; and to renew their Capitulations with more advantageous terms. As namely, That their Customs from 5 be reduced to 3 <hi>per Cent.</hi> as the English, Dutch, and Genoeses pay. That their King be treated by the Sultan with the equal Presents and Gifts, according to the Custom used with the Emperour; and that at all times interchangeably Ambassadours be sent to reside in each others Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; with other propositions which seemed as extravagant to the Turks, as they appeared to others vain, and to have no foundation but in the report of the Vulgar.</p>
                        <p>But that which was reported by the most judicious concerning these Ships was, That his most Christian Majesty being made to understand perfectly the affronts put on his Nation by the Turks; and not fully satisfied (as is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed) with the respect they had shown to his Ambassador at <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> made it the chief Design of his Ships to withdraw him from thence, supposing it a less diminution to his honour, to have the person of his Agent subjected to affronts, than of his Ambassadour, to which (it was imagined) he might be obnoxious, in consideration of those great sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, which were in the following year designed for <hi>Candia.</hi> In what manner soever the Turks deemed of this appearance of Men of War to hector and brave them at their Imperial City, they did yet for the present cunningly dissemble the matter, giving the French fair words, and what plenty of Provisions their occasions did require. In what manner this Affair was transacted, I shall not adventure to relate, nor is it well or certainly known; Yet not long after came Orders for the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour to repair to the Court at <hi>Larissa;</hi> and that until the Grand Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or's pleasure was farther known, the Ships of War were to be detained. The Commander in chief, called Monsieur <hi>d' Almeras,</hi> was not a little
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:98602:182"/>
trou bled to have his Ships thus embargued, and labouring in his thoughts between the time limited in his Instructions by his Master and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint by the Turks, he once bravely resolved to hazard his passage through the Castles; but protracting the execution thereof from day to day, even until the end of <hi>April;</hi> at length Licence came for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, and Orders to repair unto <hi>Vola,</hi> near <hi>Larissa,</hi> there to take an Ambassadour, or Agent, or Envoyé from the Sultan to their King. For, it seems, the Vizier had intimated to the Grand Signior, That it was not time to disgust the French King, and to bring him under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a declared and publick Enemy, or at least to irritate him so far as might provoke him to send greater Forces, than perhaps he designed the next year, for <hi>Candia:</hi> and that he ought to comply with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent conjuncture, and salve that up for a time, which he might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards open at his pleasure. This counsel seeming reasonable to the <note place="margin">The Gr. Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior sends a Messenger to the French King.</note> Grand Signior, and agreeable to the present necessity, he ordered (as I was credibly informed) a thousand Dollars only to adorn his Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour; so pitifully do the Turks esteem of Christian Princes, and so highly do they value themselves, as if a Message from them would be reverenced in Christendom as a favour, though brought by a Porter or a Slave. But the French Ambassadour considering this allowance too mean a provision for a person qualified to appear before his Master, did (as it is said) out of his own Purse and generous Soul contribute a far greater Sum, with two Vests of Sables towards his better Equipage. In this manner the Sultan dissembling an appearance of good correspondence with his Christian Majesty, dispatched away his Envoyé on the Ships of War, being a Person in quality of a <hi>Mutafaraca,</hi> one of the same degree with a Chaous, to expostulate with the King concerning several Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and especially his Reasons for sending for his Ambassadour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sending another according to ancient custom to supply his Office, wondering much at this sudden alteration of friendship, without any cause given on the Ottoman side: and with these smooth and fair words the Turks imagined they might charm the Spirit of the King for a while, and suspend his Succours from <hi>Candia,</hi> until at last it were beyond his power and wisdom to relieve. In the mean time the Ambassadour from the most Christian King was detained as a Hostage for the other, of whose return we shall speak in its due place.</p>

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:98602:183"/>
any parts of the City. The Enemy having by their great number of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1669"/> Pioniers elevated the confused Earth, they formed some Batteries, forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying them, and sheltering their people with Sacks of Wool, and a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth (as we may say) of Redoubts, they advanced foot by foot upon the Revelin of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> being destitute of all Mines to stop their proceedings; and having at length blown up the Revelin, and with fire and earth having taken the Out-work, they penetrated into the Ditch (which was not deep) with four Traverses, and came now to the very foot of the wall of the Bulwark, fortified with eighteen pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, six of which carrying fifty pound Bullet shot into the Ditch, eight flanked that side which was opposite to <hi>Panigra,</hi> and four on that part towards the Revelin of St. <hi>Spirito,</hi> notwithstanding which they stormed the Walls in nine places. And beginning to make a breach by firing certain Mines, which opened a wideness of forty two paces at the point of that Bulwark; and continuing their breaches towards the Sea, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their way the Front of the Fort <hi>Priulo,</hi> they proceeded almost to the Gate of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> and opened forty eight paces more, in all ninety paces. Afterwards they ruined the remainder of the Wall, and that which was called the Scotch Fort to the very Sea; so that the Christians were forced to retire from their Out-works, and contract their Precincts to the Walls of the City.</p>
                        <p>To add unto the misery of this place, an unfortunate shot from the Turks Camp entred that Magazine which was near St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church, where the artificial Fires were made; and meeting several shells of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoes already charged, with thirty Barrels of Powder; all took fire, and blew into the air, and burned all the houses which were near there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. At this unlucky accident the Besieged fearing a general assault, and seeing the Turkish Horse draw into a Body near <hi>Sabionera,</hi> the whole Garrison ran to the Walls; but no farther Attempt being made, towards evening they blew up a Lodge of the Enemy, with all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that were therein.</p>

                     <p>TOwards the end of the last Year, and at the beginning of this the Turks began to open their eyes, and find themselves defrauded with the grossest cheat that ever was imposed on a people who had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reason or humanity. For now three or four years had ran on, that the French, Dutch, Italians, and other Nations had introduced into all parts of the Turkish Dominions (unless in those East-ward, as <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and farther) a sort of small Money called by some <hi>Luigini,</hi> by others <note place="margin">The story of the false Reaux or Temins.</note> 
                        <hi>Ottavi,</hi> and by the Turks <hi>Temins,</hi> worth about five pence English; which appearing pleasant and bright to the eye, and commodious for change, and common expences, so bewitched the Commonalty, that Pieces of Eight, Zaichins, and other merchantable Money were laid aside, as neither currant or valuable. At first about nine years past they were of good and warrantable Silver, but afterwards with time by little and little grew worse, and of baser alloy: at length the people doting more and more upon them, they came coarser every day than other; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still currantly passable, every person that was failed, and of bad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation entred into the Trade, who knowing no bounds of honesty or of gain, composed their Money wholly of Copper or coarser Metals,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:98602:183"/>
with a fair gloss and resemblance of Silver, buying therewith the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of the Country; and at length amassed up all the Gold, Silver, and whatsoever came to hand was the price of their false and bastard Coin, with which they filled and abused all <hi>Asia:</hi> nor was this Money only of one Mint, but of divers Stamps and Mottoes reproachful to the Turks, and it is pity they had not wit enough to understand them, as namely, <hi>Voluit hanc Asia mercem De procul pretium ejus,</hi> and such like, which were so various, that many who had the curiosity to make a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of them, found no less than an hundred and twenty several Stamps. The Commonalty still enamoured with the brightness of their colour, and commodiousness of their change, little reflected on the ill consequence to the generality, having seldom more than to supply their daily wants. And the Officers of the Customs finding a benefit extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary to themselves upon the vast Sums of Money imported, little cared how it fared with the publick. In the mean time the whole cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Merchandise in the Levant was dispossessed of its ordinary and true chanel; for vast quantities or a glut of Turkish Goods filled all Christendom, the prices low and cheap, and no profit to any Merchant dealing upon the square, or upon the old and legal way of Traffick. At <hi>Ligorne</hi> and other parts of <hi>Italy</hi> complaints were made, That the Silver and Bullion of the Country were melted down to make a composition with baser Metals for <hi>Turkie,</hi> and exchanged for decaying and perisha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Commodities. In short, no man seemed satisfied with the Trade, and yet the World, like their sins, which they disapprove, pursued it with all heat and violence imaginable. This Trade being thus over-laid, and vast heaps of adulterate Money imported daily worse and worse, caused the Jews and other Merchants at first to except against some sorts, and admit of others. This seruple, together with the prohibition of them two years before by the English Factory at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> obliging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto the Levant Company under a considerable penalty not to receive this money for Cloth or other Commodities of the growth of <hi>England,</hi> together with the circumspection and contrivance of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Consul, awakened sirst the blind minds of the Turks, who having long been infatuated with this beloved money, began now to reject and abhor it like the false and farded countenance of a Courtisan: so that from eleven they fell to twelve, and so to thirteen and fourteen to the Lion-Dollars. In which conjuncture a Dutch Convoy arrived at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> importing vast Sums thereof; which for a Bribe to the Officers of the City, or what the Customer would ask, were permitted Licence to be landed; which overflowing in great abundance, and rather of a worse than better alloy, went declining to eighteen, and so to twenty, at which Rate for a short time they passed currant. And now at this price the Officers did what was possible to keep them up, conceiving it impossible, in a time of so much scarcity of all sorts of other Coins, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries could subsist, or that Trade in buying or selling could proceed, if this money should wholly lose its esteem and value: nor were the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple so much the care of the Governours, though for many years they had known no other price or reward of their labours, as were the vast da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of the Sultan, in whose Coffers were considerable Sums, which were never known to have been placed unto the loss of the Exchequer; for it is a Proverb amongst the Turks, <hi>That the Grand Signiors Lead can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not sink.</hi> But that which raised most of tumult was the rigour of the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:98602:184"/>
Tax-gatherers, who refused to take that money from the people for their Duties to the Grand Signior, but demanded of them Lion-Dollars, <hi>Sevil</hi> and <hi>Mexico</hi> Pieces of Eight, or the like; which they not being able to find, beat and imprisoned them in all places, where this question came into dispute: the people hereupon, though patient, and accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to violence and burden, could not yet support longer an oppression so unreasonable, but that Insurrection was made in all places where this came into dispute: and as injured patience turns to fury, at <hi>Prusa</hi> and <hi>Angora</hi> the torrent of the peoplesrage was not appeased without the blood and lives of some of their Officers, alledging with good reason, That their Ministers and Governours having introduced or permitted this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney amongst them, and allowed it as currant in that manner, as that they had for some years known no other, nor received other for all the fruits of their labour or possessions, they ought not now to refuse to receive that which they themselves had made passable; which argument and reason was pressed in sundry places with that violence, that the Officers were forced to submit to the necessity of the times, and the fury of the multitude. And now this money had wholly lost its repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and began to be refused generally at any rate whatsoever; so that though the Government thought fit to license them at thirty to the Dollar; yet the people prosecuting the abasement of it with a hate and disaffection equal to their former desires, refused generally and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely to accept them in payment. Wherefore the Sultan perceiving that the power of his Officers was not sufficient to render this money longer passable at any rate, at length he commanded, that every one should bring in his money of these sorts into the Mint where it should be melted down, and the Silver it produced should be delivered to the Proprietor. At which Summons several Great men voluntarily brought in their money, others had it seized and condemned to the Furnace, amongst which was a French Merchant ingaged to the import of sixty thousand Dollars. As yet the News of this alteration not having reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Christendom, divers Ships arrived at <hi>Constantinople</hi> with vast Sums of this money, which were all seized and forced to the Mint. In like manner other Ships arrived at <hi>Smyrna</hi> with the same Commodity, which my self would not suffer to be landed, and some of them having no other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Stock or Freight, returned empty, to the great loss of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployers. It was strange to see, how on a sudden all Trade ceased, no money being left in the Country, few Bargains were made but by Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and though all this ruine might wholly be attributed to the ill Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, yet the people were contented, and sate down with the loss. And thus concluded this extravagant Trade of false Money, being sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to have wrought more of destruction and loss at the end, than it brought of benefit at the beginning; memorable for nothing more than for expiring so quietly, though it had the chief part of the Turkish Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to support and defend it.</p>
                     <p>During these Troubles the Grand Signior passed his time in hunting near <hi>Larissa,</hi> where he ruined the Country round about, and tired the people with beating and driving the Woods for Game and wild Beasts to divertise him, in which, as formerly, he continued so excessively im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate, that without consideration of the heats, or colds, or moisture of the season, he compelled the people, but especially the Jews (of which great numbers inhabit that Country) to continual labours in the Woods
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:98602:184"/>
and Fields; by which many died through the rigid Frosts of the Winter and Calentures of the Summer. But yet notwithstanding these Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements, the Grand Signior could not easily cast off the melancholy apprehensions and fears he had for the state of his Affairs, imagining that the long delays and ill success at <hi>Candia,</hi> and defaults in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment had begotten in his Subjects a hate towards his Person, and a desire of alteration. Wherefore the Spring approaching, he retired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a solitary but pleasant shade amongst the Mountains, where sprang cool and crystalline waters, about sixteen hours Journey from <hi>Larissa.</hi> In this solitude his melancholy thoughts again disquieted him with a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie and suspicion, lest his Brothers now at <hi>Constantinople</hi> should take their advantage, and one of them be by the Peoples consent and assistance <note place="margin">The Grand Signior designs to cut off his Brothers.</note> placed in his Imperial Seat: which imagination made that impression in him, that he immediately dispatched away a trusty and valiant Officer with all secrecy, without making any noise, to bring him their Heads, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting his Commands to his Mother, in whose custody they were; and not doubting of her help and assent, as being most nearly concerned in his interest, expected every hour the return of his Messenger with that grateful Present, which could only cure the torture of his jealousie, and alleviate his cares. But no sooner was this fatal Command arrived the hands of the Queen, but she trembled so much, that she could scarce hold the Paper. At length considering, that (as hath been said before) she had given in caution to the Janisaries for the lives of these Princes, and that to her care they were committed, she immediately disclosed and published the design of the Grand Signior to the Janisar-Aga, craving his help and protection, protesting that she was resolved to maintain the faith she had given to those Princes, whose life she tendered equal with her own. This advice and resolution of the Queen-Mother being brought to the Janisaries, was heartily approved, and protestations gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that they would never abandon her, nor the lives she preserved. The rumour hereof in an instant flew through the streets; but with such variety of reports, that nothing of certainty was known, only in general some great ruine was apprehended to threaten the City; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a strange outcry was made to shut up the shops, and every one to consult the safety of the Publick. But some few hours after, it being more distinctly known, that the Grand Signior had sent for the Heads of his Brothers; the People of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> whose sole hopes of seeing the Royal City restored to its ancient Honour, was by the conservation of these Princes, were in a greater combustion than before; for every one then betook himself to his Arms: so that in a short time were assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled forty thousand men at <hi>Okmedon</hi> well appointed, where considing in the strength of a general Cause, in which they were ingaged, they vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many opprobrious speeches against the Government, calling the Chief Ministers <hi>Orsysler,</hi> which is unfortunate Fellows, a term amongst the Turks, of the greatest ignominy, especially to a Governour, and loudly exclaimed and wished for a reformation. In the mean time the Queen-Mother desired aid from the Janisaries, and Guards about the Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Princes, lest the Bostangees, who are the Creatures of the Grand Signior, should assault their Quarters. The Consultations also amongst the Janisaries were long and secret, and the Queen-Mother dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched several Messages to the Grand Signior, advising him to forsake the Mountains, and repair to one of his Imperial Cities, as became the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:98602:185"/>
Majesty of so great a Sultan, being the only means to secure to him the establishment of his Crown. And now the Reader will with impatience attend the conclusion and issue of so great rumours and disturbances; but it is now, as it hath been experienced in other Commonwealths, <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribus, ut fermè talia, initiis, incurioso sine,</hi> matters violent in their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, <note place="margin">Tac. Lib. 6.</note> spend themselves at first, and produce nothing remarkable in their end. And so was the effect of these recesses, and mutiny of the people at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> whose humour of novelty and change venting it self, and in four or five days tired with expectation; at length every one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to return to his dwelling and employment. The face likewise of things at <hi>Constantinople</hi> seemed quiet and appeased, carrying with it, as it were, a still modesty and shame for the late disorders; and nothing was heard or murmured for the space of twenty or thirty days after, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Grand Signior trembling with the fears of this confused Rebellion, kept more strict Guards than ordinary within his mountains, and after being better recollected, entered into Consultation, and being advised of the Heads and Leaders of the late Insurrection, proscribed such as were the prime Actors, and having dispatched away two or three Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers on this Errant, they entered secretly in the Night to their Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, where they quietly, and without noise, took off the heads of four or five of them, and banished as many without the least noise, or notice taken thereof by the Vulgar. And because this disorder happened at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> for which the chief Commander ought to answer, the Chimacam passed not without a jealousie either of negligence or consent; wherefore the Vizier sent for him and the Janisar-Aga to <hi>Candia,</hi> as if he had occasion of their service, though not without their own fears and suspicion of others, to answer and make satisfaction for the late mutiny. And thus for a while this Flame is extinguished, and the fire raked up in the Embers. We must expect a while, and observe when and where it will again burst forth.</p>
                     <p>The Spring now approaching, which supplies new Spirits, and warm and fresh bloud into the Veins of Man, as well as sap in Trees, and life in other Vegetables; let us return again to the Wars, and survey the Camp, and posture of Affairs before the walls in <hi>Candia.</hi> The Turkish Army, which, like worms benummed with the Cold of Winter, had lain immured between their Banks of Earth, did not ply their Assaults so frequently as they had done in Summer, only for a Winters exercise, battered the inward Works of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Andrea's</hi> Fort, which as we said before, they had hardly beset. And now the time for action being again come about, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed <note place="margin">The Turks storm again the Fort of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drea.</hi>
                        </note> their storm on that side so violently, pressing forward the least esteemed of their Souldiery, that with the help of Spade and Mattock, and blowing up of some Mines, they penetrated forty paces within the Walls of the City. But the Christians having long since foreseen the weakness of that side, made it part of their Winters labours to draw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Wall from the Fort <hi>Panigra</hi> (whose Revelin or Out-work was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore blown up) crossing over almost to the <hi>Tramata,</hi> which they forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as well as could be expected, and made constant and bold resistance against the Enemy. Notwithstanding which the Turks pressed so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly and boldly forward, that though the Christians were strong with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and provided with all sorts of provisions both of war and sustenance, yet nothing supported their Courages and Spirits more than the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of promised Succours from <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> it being reported, and
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:98602:185"/>
generally believed, that they would be so numerous as might be able to give Battel in the Field unto the Turk, and force them out of their Trenches; for by no other means was it possible for this City to be relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: for it might fare with this place, as it did formerly with <hi>Rhodes</hi> and <hi>Ostend,</hi> which, though wanting neither men nor provisions, were yet taken by palms and inches of ground, till not so much was left, as would hold men to defend them. A pregnant example (as S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>William Tample</hi> well observes) how impossible it is to defend any Town that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be relieved by an Army strong enough to raise the Siege. Whilst the Christians were entertained with these hopes, the Turks fortified themselves without as strongly as the besieged had within, heaving like Moles with their numerous Army of Pioniers, whose lives being not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, they were wholly intent unto Mines, blowing up all before them, in that manner that every day they gained a pace of ground within the City. So that in effect (as will be seen by the Sequel) this most impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Fort of the World was forced and taken by the Spade and Sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, and by a Crew of unarmed Labourers, who understood nothing more than the Plough and Harrow. So that now this Town seemed to be reduced to its utmost Crisis, either of being taken, or for ever freed of this malignant Enemy. And indeed the Turks had so far advanced upon the Bulwark of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Andrea,</hi> that now nothing remained of it, more than ruines, and undigested heaps of Earth and stone, in defence of which the chief Commanders applying themselves in person with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, the Marquess S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Andrea Montbrun</hi> was wounded by a stone in the face, the Cavalier <hi>de Bret</hi> was buried in the ruines to the very Neck, and with difficulty drawn out of the Earth by Assistants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him; two other Cavaliers were wounded with Granadoes, and the Cavalier <hi>Feuillere,</hi> who carried the Standard of <hi>Malta,</hi> was shot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Eye with a Musket. The Proveditor General <hi>Corndro</hi> serving at the repair of the Breach, was so wounded in the Belly by a Granado, that his Bowels burst, of which he died in three hours; and with a piece of the same Granado the Count <hi>Vignole,</hi> a French Gentleman of great Valour, was likewise slain: And so hotly the Turks plyed this Breach, that from the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> to the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>June</hi> they sprang five Mines, which brake all the Palisades of the Christians; the which the Turks seconded with that fury and mettle, as if they intended to win the place and make an end of their work, before the arrival of the Forces expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Christendom. And this Post was now grown so dangerous and weak, that the Captain General, the Marquess of <hi>Montbrun,</hi> and all the chief Officers took up their Quarters at this place, where his Excellency kept an open Table, and the Marquess took up his Lodgings at Night, that so the other Officers might have no excuse on account of attendan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or orders to abandon these Quarters.</p>
                     <p>The Princes of Christendom all this time forgot not their besieged <note place="margin">Succours sem out of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom.</note> Brethren in <hi>Candia.</hi> Popo <hi>Clement</hi> the IX. pressed the most Christian King to make ready his succours in due time, who had already himself prepared all things, and elected the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> his General of all the Forces by Sea, whether of French or other Nations. This Duke, like a couragious and brave Prince, thinking it little glory to command at Sea, where the Enemy was of an inferiour and unable Force to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter him, did therefore desire Licence from his King to make try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of his Fortune in the Field, where he might evidence his Valour in
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:98602:186"/>
the face of the Infidels, and signalize his Fame either by Death or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. The King, unwilling to hazard so worthy a person of his bloud out of his due Command in the rank of an ordinary Souldier, at first deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his requests; but the Pope interceding for him, whose General he was, with holy Arguments, and devout Contemplations of Martyrdom, and Glory of dying for the Christian Cause, at length obtained a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession from the King, who of himself was flexible to so pious a request, esteeming it unholy to deprive his Kinsman either of the Palm of a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, or the Lawrel of a Conqueror.</p>
                     <p>The Summer being come, and all things provided, the Duke ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Ship at <hi>Tolon</hi> a City in <hi>Provence,</hi> the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>June, New-style,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The French Fleet loose from <hi>Tolon.</hi>
                        </note> with about seven thousand Land Souldiers, commanded by the Duke of <hi>Navaille,</hi> with the Marshals <hi>Lebret</hi> and <hi>Golbert,</hi> and several other Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies and Heroes of undaunted Courage, and arrived before the Town of <hi>Candia</hi> the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the same Month, having casually encountred to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Seas on the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> with fourteen Sail of Venetian Ships, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with Horse and Ammunition to mount the Troops, and relieve the Town; which happy encounter and speedy passage, seemed a happy Omen of the future success. The appearance of this succour seemed to the Besieged as sent from Heaven, and administred unto them new hopes and courage; and the salutes passed between the Town and the Fleet with the usual Ceremonies, and all the imaginable testimonies of joy and triumph.</p>
                     <p>No sooner were they arrived than the two Generals, with other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <note place="margin">They arrive at <hi>Candia.</hi>
                        </note> Officers, immediately in their Shallops took the best view and survey they could of the Enemies Camp, and the Condition of the Besieged; in which whilst they entertained themselves, they espied a small Vessel making towards them with S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Mark's</hi> Colours, in which was the famous Engineer Signior <hi>Castellano,</hi> dispatched by the Captain General <hi>Moro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sini</hi> with an exact plat of the Town, and disposition of the Turkish Camp, which being particularly viewed and considered, it was evident, That if the Turks should make some very forcible Attempt before the new Forces could be landed (as it was very probable they might) they would put all in hazard of being lost; wherefore the Captain General pressed to have some succours immediately supplied to be assistant in that case of extremity; To which the Duke of <hi>Navailles</hi> immediately consented, and landed himself that Night in person with sufficient Force to mount the Guard on the Breach of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Andrea,</hi> whose first Retrenchment was continually battered by the Turks; and though there was a second Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment in hand, yet time being required for compleating thereof, that part of the Town would be reduced to its ultimate hazard; for should the Enemy spring a Mine (which they feared was already formed under the present Work) it would lay all open and naked, without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fortification. The Duke being ashoar, was received by <hi>Morosini</hi> with all demonstrations of Civility and Respect due to a personage of his Quality and Employment; and with a welcome suitable to the present extremity of his Affairs: all Ceremonies and Complements were soon passed over, the urgency of matters not permitting them time to be long impertinent; so that falling into the Discourse of the common safety, it <note place="margin">The French Forces landed.</note> was resolved that the succours should be immediately landed, which was performed with that diligence and expedition, that in two days the whole Army came safe on shore, excepting only some few, cut short by shot from the Enemies Camp.</p>

On the 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> the Generals and other Officers, held a Council of War, amongst whom was also the Marquess of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Andrea;</hi> and did unanimously conclude, that the Town was no longer tenable, or to be maintained, <note place="margin">A Council of War held in <hi>Candia.</hi>
                        </note> unless by some extraordinary enterprize attempted on the Enemy, and by some furious Sally performed with resolution, and stratagems of War, in order unto which it was resolved, That the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> should be the day of sally both with Horse and Foot, and that the Fleet not to lose their part in this action, should play with their great Guns on that side of the Turkish Army which lay incamped on the Quarters of St. <hi>Andrea.</hi> All <note place="margin">The order of the Christian Army to make their Saily.</note> the Forces were landed on the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and the whole night following was spent in preparations for the next days sally: the Army being drawn up made four Batalions, the first called the Admirals commanded by the Sieurs <hi>Martel, Vandre,</hi> and <hi>Gravier;</hi> the second was the Vice-Admirals commanded by the Sieurs <hi>de la Mothe</hi> and <hi>Planta;</hi> the third was the Rere-Admirals under Command of Chevalier <hi>de Bouillion, Gabaret,</hi> and the Chevalier <hi>Dailly;</hi> the fourth was the Batalion of the Sieur <hi>d'Alme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> commanded under him by the Sieurs <hi>Panetier, de la Rogue, Fontier, Bitault,</hi> and the Chevalier <hi>de Nemond;</hi> and on the left hand of these aforesaid Batalions, the Guards of the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> were disposed. The Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> unwilling to be a Spectator in this glorious Action, without bearing a part in his own person, after he had given order to the Fleet to accost the shore on the side of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> as near as consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their security, and from thence with their great Guns to annoy the Enemies Camp as much as was possible, came that night on shore, resolving to fight in the Head of the Forlorn Hope, from which hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous adventure no intreaties or counsel of his friends could prevail to disswade him.</p>
                     <p>The Forlorn consisted of 400 men, on the head of which marched fifty men with hand Granadoes, flanked with three Troops of Horse, Commanded by Count <hi>Dampiere:</hi> the Regiments of Guards, with four Troops of Horse for their Wings, flanked also with three Regiments of Foot, followed the Forlorn. The Reserve consisted of the Regiments of <hi>Harcourt, Conti, Lignieres, Rosan, Montpesat,</hi> and <hi>Vendosme,</hi> slanked with four Troops of Horse under Command of the Count <hi>Choiseul,</hi> which placed themselves on a rising ground, to hinder all Communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Vizier, whose Camp was before S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Andrea,</hi> and the Janizar Aga, who lay before <hi>Sabionera.</hi> Between the first and second line, were placed fifty Musketiers of the King, to be assistant on occasion; and the other Troops of Horse were to take the left hand along the Trench leading to the <hi>Sabionera:</hi> the Regiment of <hi>Montpeyroux</hi> was to mount the Guard on the Fort of St. <hi>Demetrius</hi> to secure the Retreat, if occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion should require. In like manner five hundred Pioniers were order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to level the Trenches of the Enemy on the Quarter of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> whilst the Body of the Turks Army was imployed in repulsing the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Sally.</p>
                     <p>Things being disposed in this manner, and the morn approaching, the Forces marched out by the Gate of St. <hi>George</hi> with all silence possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, covering their Matches, that the fire might not alarm the Enemy; the Onset was to begin with the dawning of the day, and the Signal was <note place="margin">The Christians sally at the Gate St. <hi>George.</hi>
                        </note> to be given by siring of the chief Mine Royal; which being large, and furnished with a great quantity of Powder, might (as was supposed) make way to the slaughter of the Turks whom the Christians might sind
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:98602:187"/>
terrified and disordered by such an unexpected accident. This Mine was reserved for the last extremity, but being low was full of water; so that the Powder was stowed on floats and rafts to support it, but yet received so great a damp and moisture, that when they came to spring it, the Powder took not fire, which was the first disappointment of this Enterprise. Though some are of opinion, that the Mine was so vast, and contained such a quantity of Powder, that the Engineers were ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous to spring it, lest it should reverse on the Besieged, as well as take effect on the Enemies Camp. But be it how it will, a quarter of an hour before day the Generals expecting no longer, the Forlorn Hope which lay within half a Musket-shot of the Enemy, assaulted two <note place="margin">The Christians fall upon the Turks.</note> Redoubts, took them, and put them all to the Sword: with the like courage the other Regiments entred the Line, and making themselves Masters of the Trenches after much blood and slaughter, and storming a Fort on which was the Battery directed against St. <hi>Demetrio,</hi> possessed themselves of it, and therewith of a great Magazine of Powder belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Enemy, spiking all the Cannon that were found therein.</p>
                     <p>The day by this time being clearly broken out, discovered the action; so that the Turks with all expedition put themselves into a Body on the Hill near New <hi>Candy,</hi> from whence observing and contemning the small number of the Christians, came thundring down in great numbers to regain their Trenches. The Duke of <hi>Navailles</hi> perceiving his Forlorn hardly beset, came in to their assistance with two Regiments of Foot, and two Troops of Horse, which behaved themselves with that gallantry, as ingaged the Turks again to quit their Trenches. But whilst success seemed thus to smile on the Christians, the Magazine of Powder which was newly won, containing an hundred thirty four Kintals of Powder (by what accident is not known) took fire, and blew up all into the air, by which many were destroyed and wounded, especially of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallion of the Guards, with many Officers. This fatal blow quite turned the Scale of Fortune. For the Souldiers hearing the dreadful clap, and feeling as it were the Earth to tremble under them, supposed it to be the eruption of some Mine near them, with which they were so amazed, that they began with confusion to disperse to the right and left, <note place="margin">The Christian Army in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>susion.</note> and put themselves into shameful flight. In like manner the Forces near the Sea sensible of the blow, began to retreat, and abandon their design, which no perswasions of their Officers, or other incouragement could animate them to prosecute; but that the faintness of a second At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt (an infirmity recorded of ancient Times to be incident to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the French Nation) prevailed upon their spirits, beyond any possibility of arrest, so that in a disorderly manner they fled into the Body of the first Battalion, where being now united with the Reserve, they for some time sustained the shock of the Enemy; until other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Turks from New <hi>Candia</hi> and St. <hi>Andrea</hi> over-powered them with greater multitudes, so that then they wholly abandoned the field, and every one as well as he could, sought his Sanctuary and refuge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Precincts of the Fortifications. Howsoever <hi>Choiseul</hi> and <hi>Lebret,</hi> each of which had a Horse killed under him, incouraging their Troops, disputed the case yet longer, and still with other Officers made head up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Enemy; but at length with the Duke of <hi>Navailles,</hi> and several other Gentlemen, who made their way through the Enemy with their Swords, they were forced to retreat honourably into the Town. The
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:98602:187"/>
Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> was said to have laboured much in resisting the shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful flight of his men, and venturing his Person into danger, from whence he resolved never to retreat, was overwhelmed with unequal numbers, and so fell amongst the common heaps: but his body, though much sought after, being not found, it was believed rather, that he perished by that fatal Magazine of Powder, which blowing up, affrighted and disordered the whole Christian Army.</p>
                     <p>But not only did misfortunes attend the Land-Forces, but the Fleet at Sea shared in the disasters. For some few days after the wind blowing hard from the Sea, caused the Ships to ride at a distance from the shore. The whole Fleet consisted of eighty Ships small and great, fifty Gallies, and six Galleasses, being the whole Force of that Year from <hi>France, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Malta.</hi> All which being at Anchor in due order as near the shore as was safe or convenient, made many shot into the Turks Camp, but with little execution: during which Action, the <hi>Santa Teresa,</hi> a French Ship of seventy Brass Guns blew up, and her whole Company lost, being about three hundred men, of which seven only were saved; the Admiral of <hi>France</hi> being near to this Ship, received five shot from her which passed through her, and by the Splinters and fall of Timbers; the Vessel called <hi>La Reale</hi> had six Cavaliers killed, and forty Souldiers Slaves were killed and wounded. After this it was proposed in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, That another Sally should be made of ten thousand French; to which the Duke <hi>De Navaille</hi> assented, on condition that they might be preceded in the Van by four thousand Venetians, who were well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted and versed in the nature of the place, and knew the several Redoubts, Galleries, and Trenches of the Enemy. But the Captain-General being desirous to reserve his own experienced Souldiers to the ultimate and last occasion of emergence, refused to assent thereunto.</p>
                     <p>The loss the Turks sustained that day was uncertain, of the French were only an hundred thirty five heads brought in by tale, as I was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from one who was present when they were counted, amongst which were many principal Officers.

Montpezat, Harcourt,</hi> and <hi>Conti</hi> were all wounded, with four other Captains of Horse, and four Lieutenants; also the Marquess of <hi>Uxelles,</hi> the Chevalier <hi>de la Haugette,</hi> the Count <hi>de Losse</hi> Captain of the Guards to the Duke of <hi>Navailles,</hi> the Count <hi>de Montbrun</hi> Commander of the Kings Musquetiers, and the Sieur <hi>de Tagni</hi> Quarter-master-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral were wounded: who being Persons of great Quality as well as Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage that left their Country, and exposed themselves to dangers, with no other motive than their own gallantry or defence of the Christian Cause, ought be numbred amongst the Heroes and Champions of our Age. Of Prisoners there were not above seven or eight taken, amongst which were the Sieur <hi>de Bois-Dauphin</hi> a Norman, and Son of a Marshal of <hi>France,</hi> and the Sieur <hi>de Chateau Neus,</hi> the first for his Youth, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Courage greatly esteemed by the Turks, and both entertained by the Vizier with more generosity than usually possesses the Nature of Turks: who after this success, having gathered and thrown the heads of the slain according to their manner into a heap, did one day in merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pitch them upon the points of their Lances, and ranking them in file and order, with Hats and Feathers on them, beat the French March amongst them with shouts and Vollies of Muskets.</p>
                     <p>Matters succeeding in this manner unhappily, and the Enemy already almost in the midst of the Town, being come to the last Retrenchment, beyond which could be raised no more inward Fortisications; the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers as in like cases of misfortune began to throw the blame upon each other, and the contest between the French and Italians grew as hot within the Town, as the War was without; so that the Duke of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailles</hi> appearing discontented, though in reality he might well be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, <note place="margin">The French leave the Town.</note> and might be apprehensive with due reason that the Town was in a desperate condition; howsoever he pretended, that the time was almost expired, which the King had prefixed for the continuance of his Forces in <hi>Candia,</hi> and that therefore he could not think of any other design for them, than that which was in order to their imbarking. The Captain-General being greatly surprised at this resolution, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to perswade him to the contrary, and being accompanied with the General of <hi>Candia</hi> and the Proveditor General waited on the Duke at his own Quarters, where he represented to him in the most efficacious terms possible the present dangerous condition to which the City was reduced; until which time, under the Providence of God, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the preservation thereof to the magnanimous Arms of their religious King; and therefore in such a conjuncture of misfortunes and extremity they knew not unto whom they might have recourse for assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but to the Generosity of his Excellency, and of those Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who for no other end but that of Religion and Honour, had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken so great a Voyage, and had voluntarily cast themselves into the hourly dangers of this Siege: That the Succour they demanded was really great and most important for defence of the place, in regard that thereon their whole safety depended. Howsoever it might have cost some labour, though not much blood to the French Forces, if they would have worked on a new Retrenchment with the same celerity and deligence, as they formerly used, whereby the Siege might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed until the Winter, or till the Christian Princes might take new measures, and send greater Recruits. Hereunto <hi>Navaille</hi> gave answer, That the zeal which the King his Master conceived for the conservation
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:98602:188"/>
of <hi>Candia,</hi> was evidenced by better effects, than the empty promises without fruit of other Princes; and that accounting the present number of Forces and Gentlemen of considerable Quality which were ingaged in this War, together with the great expence and charge his Majesty had been at in maintenance of a Fleet to transport them, his Majesties affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Republick was unquestionable: and that both he and his Officers who had the honour to command those Forces had undertaken a long Voyage, and entred into dangers with constancy and readiness of mind, and had assaulted the Enemy almost before they saw them, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven relief to the Town before they set their foot in it; but if the issue of affairs did not correspond with a success agreeable to their good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and the primary design of this Enterprise, they must have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, seeing that it cost no other than the slaughter of French-men, and that there had been a large effusion of the Noble and Illustrious as well as of the common blood. It was a species of ingratitude not to remain contented with such forcible arguments of friendship; and it was a breach of modesty to pretend, that because his King had lent them eight thousand men, that therefore they should continue in <hi>Candia</hi> so long as one remained alive. It was true, that besides the Kings service he was acted by some inward motives of Religion, but that he could not transgress the Commands and Instructions of his Majesty, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned him to imbark his Forces in order to their return about the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of that present month of <hi>August.</hi> In reply to which, though the Captain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>General and the other Venetian Officers, and also <hi>Bali Rospigliosi</hi> the Admiral of the Popes Gallies urged his stay with all the instances and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments imaginable, yet nothing could prevail to detain him until the arrival of other Forces, only he was contented to leave six hundred men in the Town during the time that he continued at <hi>Standia:</hi> so that by this time having imbarked his Forces, and lastly the six hundred men lest on the Works, the Duke took his farewel and departed: so that the Town being as it were deserted and forsaken of its chief hopes, all things were given for desperate, and men began to be weary of their lives, as well as of the War and of their labours; and whereas with the assistance of the French, (as it was said in the Council) the Town might have held out until the next Spring, it was now by this grand revul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion reduced to its last Crisis, and so weakened, as that no possibility of preservation remained but in honourable terms of Surrender. And though the French in their Voyage home about <hi>Malta</hi> encountred posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Orders to remain on the place, yet judging the Town might already be surrendered, and so the return disgraceful and in vain, proceeded not withstanding in their course for <hi>France,</hi> for which default and want of constancy the Duke of <hi>Navailles</hi> being arrived at <hi>Tolon,</hi> sustained the punishment of his Princes disfavour, and ordered for some time not to approach the Court.</p>
                     <p>The Turks, by departure of the French, increasing in hopes and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, made an assault on the Quarters of <hi>Sabionera</hi> and St. <hi>Andrea;</hi> and <note place="margin">The Turks make an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault.</note> first: attaquing some Souldiers to the number of about thirty, who were placed on the Guard at the Post of St. <hi>Pelagia,</hi> they cut most of them off, and put the rest to slight; with which the Turks being more ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, advanced to the Palisade of the new Retrenchment; but Vollies of Cannon, and showers of Musket-shot, and stones pouring on them, gave some stop to the sury of their career. <hi>Grimaldi</hi> observing that the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:98602:189"/>
Enemy was at a stand, brought up his Voluntiers and Cavalry which ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on Foot, and together with the Forces from <hi>Brunswick</hi> so plyed the Turks with stones, Granadoes, and shot, that the Fight was confused, bloody, and horrid; howsoever the Enemy so persisted, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders gave Order, That the gross of the Army should fall on; but the Souldiers were so broken and torn, that they refused to advance, though thrust forward with the point of Sword and Spear. The Captain-General in the mean time taking his course along the Marine, on which part also the Turks were far advanced, caused a Mine to be sprang un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the thickest crowd of the Turks: which consisting of an hundred Barrels of Powder, made such a destruction, as abated much of the storm, and induced the Enemy to retire within their Redoubts. The Marquess St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> in like manner performing the office of a valiant and experienced Souldier, applied himself to all places where danger most required his presence, and recovered certain Breast-works which the Enemy had gained in this Skirmish.</p>
                     <p>Nor was the storm less furious and bloody on the part of <hi>Sabionera,</hi> nor was the success and advantage on the Christians side less considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in all which the Souldiery deserved great commendations and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown; the two French Regiments of <hi>Perasi</hi> and <hi>Jonsac</hi> under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Sieur <hi>Choiseul</hi> did wonders; as also those few which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Regiments of <hi>Savoy</hi> commanded by Signior <hi>Arborio:</hi> Signior <hi>Rados, Nicolo Polani</hi> a Noble Venetian, the Proveditor <hi>Cornaro,</hi> the Colonels <hi>Gabriel, Givii,</hi> and the Sergeant Major of the Troops of <hi>Bruns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> and Sergeant Major <hi>Bellegarde,</hi> as also the Commander in chief of <hi>Malta</hi> gave honourable testimonies of their Bravery and Valour. In short the Captain-General praised them all, which was the best reward he could bestow on such generous Souls; and then sent Orders to <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> That the Forces arrived with the Duke <hi>Mirandola</hi> should imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately be landed: these Forces, which when they were first imbarked, amounted to the number of a thousand five hundred men, were now by Calentures and other sicknesses caused by the excessive heats of the season reduced to six hundred; and though they were unhealthy and unexperienced Souldiers, yet the extremity of Affairs was such, as called them to immediate service, and to be placed on the Guard of the new Retrenchment.</p>
                     <p>But all this could give little relief to the perishing condition of this miserable Town; which was not only weakened by departure of the French, but by at least five hundred others, such as Swedes and Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, and other Nations, who notwithstanding all care and endeavours to the contrary, crowded under the French Banner. Likewise the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion of <hi>Malta</hi> imbarked, which though reduced to a small Body, was yet very considerable for the Quality and Valour of the Cavaliers; which example all the Voluntiers followed, and thereby reduced the Town to a condition beyond all possibility of defence; for that in actual service not above four thousand men remained, and of these at least an hundred a day being killed, the Town must necessarily in a short time become a prey to the Enemy; wherefore the Captain-General <note place="margin">A Council held for to consider of the state of <hi>Candia.</hi>
                        </note> called a Council of the most eminent Officers; and because the matter was of great importance, he judged fit also to have the opinion of the Commanders of the Galleasses, and of the other Captains of the Fleet. At this Council were present

                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>All which having taken their places, the Captain General began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, That the extremity of the place was so well known and evident to them all, that there was no need for him to inform them of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; only that he had called them together to know their opinions and counsels in what manner the defence of the Town might be best prolonged, and what advice they would give him touching the present premures and emergency of Affairs. He added further, That he had by good experience proved them to be as well judicious and wise in their Counsels, as they were valiant in the Execution; and that now was the time to lay aside all ostentation of speech, and to attend unto that which was solid reason and advice, which he desired every one to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver freely with a clear and real sense and affection towards the grand Concernment. Then he ordered the Cancellier to read a short pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the matter on which they were to deliver their opinions, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring every one to express his judgment in Writing; But after some few had subscribed their Declaration, so much time was spent therein, that it was conceived more expedite for every person to declare his opinion by word of mouth.</p>
                     <p>As to the first point all generally concurred, that considering the small number of the Defendants, the Town could not hold out much longer; for that the Enemy on the side of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Andrea</hi> was arrived to the last Retrenchment, which being low, weak, and composed of bad matter, could not long resist their power; that on the side also of <hi>Sabionera</hi> they were so far advanced by the lower grounds towards the Arsenal, that in a short time they would block up the Port, and cut off all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions and succours from the Town; and that if the Enemy were resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to adventure the loss of two or three thousand men by a general storm, there would remain no possibility of withstanding their Force. This being generally assented unto, and concluded on all hands, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:98602:190"/>
Question was propounded; namely, That considering the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, what was to be done which might render the most effectual service to the Republick; it was well known how important that place was to the Publick, and what vast Treasures of Gold and Silver, and what plentiful Effusions of bloud had been expended and poured forth in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence thereof; and that therefore it ought to be maintained to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most and last gasp of strength; but that it ought also to be considered, That the Town being either taken by assault, or the Port blocked up, there would certainly ensue such deplorable Consequences as every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son may imagine; and the Republick be damaged by losing all that which is now in a possibility of being saved. It was therefore put to the Vote, beginning on the side of the Inferiours, as the custom is, and so ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the chief; and it was resolved that they should capitulate, and enter into a Treaty with the Turks. When it came to <hi>Grimaldis</hi> turn to speak, he confessed clearly, That the Town could not hold out for many days, and though it was more glorious to the Defenders to dye on the Walls of it, yet it would be of worst service to the Publick; howsoever, he was of opinion, that rather than surrender, it would be better to burn it, or blow it up with Mines; in execution of which, the wounded and unserviceable people should in the first place be shipped away, then taking the opportunity of a dark and quiet Night the Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try might be all embarked; it was true, as he confessed, that the action was difficult and full of hazard; howsoever, two things moved him to this Counsel; One was, The little assurance he conceived of the faith of the Turks; and the other was, The gloriousness of the action: for as this City had been in an extraordinary manner defended, and of which the World cannot give the like example; so the end thereof would not be less renowned and famous, it not being a greater triumph to drive the Enemy from the Walls, than being vanquisht to leave a bloudy Victory, and instead of a Palace a heap of stones and ashes. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Council, and amongst them Marquess S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Andrea Montbrun</hi> was of the same opinion, and the Commissary <hi>Minio</hi> endeavoured to second it with efficacious Arguments; But in fine, after a long Discourse, they all concluded that the resolution was more generous than practicable; by reason that so many people could not be embarked without knowledg of the Enemy, who was not only quartered near, but within the very Walls of the City.</p>
                     <p>The Captain General was of a different opinion; for that besides the difficulty of embarking the Souldiery, there were also some other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations which might disswade this resolution, and render it more prejudicial to the Publick than a Surrender by Composition. After some short debate, all at length concurred in the same sentiment, from which also <hi>Grimaldi</hi> did not much dissent, confessing that the proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he had made would prove difficult in the Execution; howsoever, considering the little faith which the Turks observe, he thought it more secure to confide their safety to Fortune and their own Swords, than to the engagements and moderation of a perfidious and enraged Enemy. In short, he submitted wholly to the better judgments of the Council, and more particularly to the Captain General, and the Marquess of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Andrea,</hi> who were best acquainted with what more nearly concerned the service and interest of the Prince.</p>
                     <p>In fine, the conclusion was, That they should enter into a Treaty
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:98602:190"/>
with the Vizier, and en leavour to obtain the most advantageous Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions possible. Howsoever, it was thought sit to advertise sirst this their determination to the Auxiliary Forces at <hi>Standia;</hi> and to renew the <note place="margin">Result of the Council.</note> instances they had formerly made to them for three thousand men, with which, and with two thousand Gally Slaves they would endeavour the making of another Retrenchment, whereby the Town might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for some time longer. Howsoever, in this Interim the Captain General being willing to touch the Viziers pulse, that he might better dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover in what manner he stood assected towards a Treaty, dispatched one Colonel <hi>Thomas Anand,</hi> an Englishman, of courage, and of able Parts, and of intire honesty, together with one <hi>Stefano Cordili,</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent young man to the Vizier's Camp; and that his design might not be discovered by those of the Town, they were ordered to pass from <hi>Standia</hi> with a white Flag up the River <hi>Giossiro;</hi> and that being come to a Treaty, they should only discover the mind and inclinations of the Turks, without making known their intentions, or entering into particulars.</p>
                     <p>Being come in this manner prepared to the Vizier's Camp, they told the Turks, That they were come to renew the Treaty begun by Signior <hi>Molino,</hi> which had been broken off by the Arrival of the French and Pope's Forcés; to which a Turk, then come srom the Vizier's Tent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely answered, That they should think of no Articles nor Treaty without a Surrender. To which <hi>Anand</hi> replyed, That they would do well to acquaint the Vizier so much, for that perhaps he might be of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother opinion; and so not urging farther they departed; but returning after Dinner the same Turk came down again, called <hi>Achmet</hi> Aga, a Confident of the Vizier's, together with <hi>Panaiotti</hi> the Vizier's Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and then with more earnestness declaring, That nothing would be heard, unless in the sirst place they were resolved to deliver the Town, and threatned them in case they returned without this Proposition: The Captain General being advised hereof, the next morning <hi>Anand</hi> and <hi>Scordili</hi> went again on the same message; and meeting the Turks under <hi>Paleocastro,</hi> they acquainted them that they had orders to treat about a Surrender; but sirst desired to know what Articles they would give them, and what Town in exchange for this. In this manner a Treaty being begun, it was resolved for better expedition to erect Tents nearer to the Town for the place of Conference, where the Plenipotentiaries on both sides were to meet. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> Pasha, late Pasha of <hi>Aleppo, Ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> Aga, the Kahya-begh of the Janisaries, the Spahyler <hi>Agasi,</hi> and the Interpreter <hi>Panaiotti,</hi> were the persons chosen by the Turks: on the part of the Christians, after some Debate, no other persons were chosen besides <hi>Anand</hi> and <hi>Scordili,</hi> who meeting the Turks at the time and place appointed, demanded of them some other place in exchange for that of <hi>Candia.</hi> To which the Turk's with some heat replyed, That it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their Law to deliver Towns where Moschs were built, into the hands of Christians. To which the others answered, That this could not be their Law, since that in a Treaty some months past begun by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier <hi>Molino,</hi> they had offered to deliver up into the hands of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians <hi>Candia Nuova, Silia,</hi> and <hi>Girapitra,</hi> all places where Mahometan Moschs were erected; and though the Turks might now imagine it easie to win the Town by sorce, they assured them that greater difficulties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained; and that if they remembred what bloud, what labours, and
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:98602:191"/>
what Treasures their small acquests and advance had cost them, they might thence calculate what Force still remained to conquer, and that the last gasp of this dying Fortress would spend it self with more ruine and destruction than they had felt in all the other approaches and assaults thereunto. In fine, the Turks seeming resolved to be fole Masters of the whole Kingdom of <hi>Candia,</hi> the Venetians began to condescend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive some compensation in another manner.</p>
                     <p>Howsoever, the difficulties were not yet ended but greater appeared, for the Turks demanded satisfaction for the charge of the War; and the Haratch or head-money, which for all those years of the Wars they had not received from the people of the Isles of the <hi>Archipelago;</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded also a Tribute for the Forts and Islands of <hi>Cerigo, Tino,</hi> and <hi>Clissa,</hi> and the other Conquests in <hi>Dalmatia;</hi> all which points caused new Disputes, which were maintained with those heats, and with that obstinacy, as if it had been impossible for both parties ever to meet in a conclusion. Notwithstanding, after long Debates, on the fourth of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> they came to agree of giving hostages, and to certain proposals concerning the manner of surrendring the place. The Turks demanded to have the Outworks put into their hands, with one of the Gates of the City, and the Palisade of the new Retrenchment: To which <hi>Anand</hi> and <hi>Scordili</hi> answered, That this was not a proposition to be made to the Captain General, for that they were assured, the Garrison would sooner suffer themselves to be cut in pieces, than to commit themselves to the mercy of the Turkish Souldiery; whose faith is recorded in the History of <hi>Famagusta,</hi> and may serve for a true example and mirroir of their treachery and faithlesness to all Ages. In this manner the Treaty had like to have been Broken off; but at length they concluded, That it was necessary to render an account to the Vizier of the particulars of this Conference, adjourning the Treaty until the next Morning.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding all which, the Turks did not abate in the least point their progress in the War, labouring in their Works, and fighting with more heat than ever. The Venetians on the other side were not less a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, firing continually their Cannon and Granadoes, and making some little Sallies, endeavoured as much as they were able to cover the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Forces. The Turks had raised a new Battery which broke a great part of the Palisade of the new Retrenchment, upon which it was expected that they should make a strong attempt, for whose better entertainment two Mines were prepared to receive them; but they deferring the assault, the Captain General gave orders to fire both the Mines at once, which consisting of a hundred and fifty Barrels of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, made the ground to tremble both in the City and in the Camp, overthrowing several works with miserable slaughter of the Enemy.</p>
                     <p>The Turks observing this resolution in the Defendants, became more tractable, and less severe in their demands; so that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> Pasha with the rest contented themselves with no other security for performances of Conditions than Hostages; of which three were consigned mutually on both sides. After which, other Articles were, with less difficulty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; so that in the morning of the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> the Turks de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that the Christians should give all their Articles in Writing; whereupon the Council ordered <hi>Grimaldi</hi> to draw them up; which were in substance as followeth.</p>
                     <p>First, That for obtaining a good and lasting Peace, it is agree'd, <note place="margin">The Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Peace.</note>
                        <pb n="275" facs="tcp:98602:191"/>
That the City of <hi>Candia,</hi> with all its Cannon which were planted there before the time of the War, be consigned into the hands of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That quiet possession be given to the Republick of <hi>Suda, Carabusa,</hi> and <hi>Spina Longa,</hi> with the Territories thereunto belonging, with the Fortress of <hi>Clissa</hi> in <hi>Dalmatia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That the Venetians may carry away all the Cannon which have been brought into the Town since the beginning of the War.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That for embarking the Souldiery, Pioniers, and Inhabitants of all Qualities and Conditions, with their Arms, Provisions, and Baggage twelve days time shall be granted and assigned.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, That what shall remain unshipped at the end of the twelve days aforesaid, the Vizier shall, with his own Boats, assist to the lading thereof.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, That during this time of truce, no person whatsoever shall transgress his Limits, or pass the bounds of his Station or Quarters; and that he who doth shall be treated as an Enemy.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, That so soon as these Articles shall be subscribed under the white Flag, all Acts of Hostility shall cease both on one side and the other.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, That for security of performance of these Articles, three Hostages be mutually given on one side and the other.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, That for better assurance, that the Venetians will use all their endeavours to embark their Men and Goods, the Turks may employ two Officers for Eye-witnesses of the same.</p>
                     <p>Tenthly, That for better effecting hereof, all Ships, Gallies, and other Vessels may freely approach near unto the shore, and enter into the Port both by Day and Night.</p>
                     <p>Eleventhly, That the Venetian Fleet may remain at <hi>Standia,</hi> or at any other Island in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> until such time as they are dispatched, or that things are duly prepared for their departure.</p>
                     <p>Twelfthly, That all Commissions given by one side and the other be revoked, and that whosoever shall after the space of forty days commit any Act of Hostility against the tenour of these Articles of Peace, shall be punished with capital punishment.</p>
                     <p>Thirteenthly, That so soon as an Ambassadour from <hi>Venice</hi> shall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the Port, all Slaves or Prisoners of War taken under the Venetian Colours shall be sreed and released.</p>
                     <p>Fourteenthly, That what depredations shall be made at Sea or Land after these Articles are subscribed, and before the publication thereof, shall be faithfully made good and restored.</p>
                     <p>Fifteenthly, That a general pardon be given to the Subjects of both sides, who have acted contrary to their Faith and Allegiance, during this War.</p>
                     <p>Sixteenthly, That in Virtue of these Capitulations the former Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles be likewise confirmed which were made in the Year 1571, and that no Tribute or Present be demanded from the Port, unless as hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been paid for such Islands as the Venetians hold in the <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelago.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Seventeenthly, That of these Articles two Copies be made, one in Turkish with its Translation into Italian, subscribed by the Vizier, and sealed with the Grand Signior's Signet; and the other in Italian under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrote
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:98602:192"/>
by the Captain-General, and sealed with the Seal of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
                     <p>These Articles being signed, the Hostages were given both on one side and the other. Those given by the Venetians were <hi>Faustino da Riva</hi> Lieutenant-General, <hi>Giovanni Battista Calbo</hi> Commissary, and <hi>Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caria Mocenigo</hi> who had been Duke of <hi>Candia.</hi> Those given by the Turks were <hi>Belir Assan</hi> Pasha, <hi>Mahomet</hi> Aga of the Janisaries, and <hi>Gurgi Bei</hi> Testerdar or Treasurer.</p>
                     <p>During this Siege, of the Venetians side there were killed and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thirty thousand nine hundred eighty five, of the Turks one hundred eighteen thousand seven hundred fifty four.</p>
                     <p>The Batteries which the Turks raised against <hi>Sabionera</hi> and St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> consisted of fifty nine Pieces of Cannon, carrying from fifty to an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty pound weight of Bullet.</p>
                     <p>The Storms which the Turks made upon the Town were fifty six.</p>
                     <p>The Combats under ground forty five.</p>
                     <p>The Sallies made by the Venetians ninety six.</p>
                     <p>The Mines and Fornelli sprang by the Venetians eleven hundred se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty three, by the Turks four hundred seventy two.</p>
                     <p>The Venetians spent Barrels of Powder fifty thousand three hundred and seventeen.</p>
                     <p>Bomboes of all sorts by the Venetians of fifty to five hundred weight, were forty eight thousand an hundred and nineteen.</p>
                     <p>Granadoes of Brass and Iron an hundred thousand nine hundred and sixty: Granadoes of Glass eighty four thousand eight hundred seventy four.</p>
                     <p>Cannon-shot of all sorts two hundred seventy six thousand seven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred forty three.</p>
                     <p>Pounds of Lead eighteen millions forty four thousand nine hundred fifty seven. Of Match pounds thirteen millions twelve thousand five hundred.</p>
                     <p>What quantities the Turks might consume of Ammunition is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; only it is observable, That the Brass taken up in the streets which came from the Enemies Bomboes was so much, that whole Ware-houses were filled with the Metal, and so much sold as yielded many thousand of Crowns.</p>
                     <p>The Articles being subscribed, and Hostages given, the Captain-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral attended with all application of mind and industry imaginable to imbark the Men and Ammunition, committing in the mean time the care of the City to <hi>Cornaro</hi> the Proveditor of the Fleet.</p>
                     <p>During these days that all things were providing in order to a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, there was great silence in the Turkish Camp, and no disorder in the City; the Souldiers on the Ramparts, and the Turks in their Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches saluted each other with civility, and entertained communication and discourses together with friendship and freedom of several passages relating to their War, nothing of quarrel, or scuffle, or rude words hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening out between them in all the term of the twelve days. The Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier sent divers times civil Messages and Presents of refreshment to the Captain-General and Marquess St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> which they returned with equal respect and generosity; and so excessive were the Turks in these offices, that the Venetians began to be jealous, left under this mark and guise of courtesie some fraud or design should be covered according to
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:98602:192"/>
their own Proverb: <hi>Chi ti fa piu carezze che suole; ó ti ha engannato ó enganar ti vuole.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In short, all things were dispatched with that diligence and care, that on the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> the City was consigned; all the Inhibitants de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted thence, not one remaining in the City, except only two Greek Priests, a Woman, and three Jews.</p>
                     <p>In this manner the whole Isle of <hi>Candia,</hi> the cause and occasion of all that Blood and Treasure that was spilt, and exhausted in twenty five <note place="margin">The War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in <hi>April</hi> 1645.</note> years Wars, fell at length to the fortune and increase of the Turkish Empire, with its most impregnable Fortress of the World, strengthened with as much Art and Industry, as the humane Wit of this Age was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to invent, after a strait Siege of two years, three months, and twenty seven days.

To <hi>Morosini</hi> also a Present was offered worthy his Quality; but he refused it, saying, That he would never give a seeming occasion to the malicious World to slander him with the least appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of having sold his important Charge. Whilst these things were transacting on the breach, some of the most cowardly and disorderly amongst the Janisaries pressed forward to have entred by force, in vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Articles so lately agreed and confirmed; but some of the Garrison not yet imbarked, keeping themselves still on the Guard, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed the most forward in the Riot by killing three or four of their Companions: which disturbance and insolence of the Souldiery, when made known to the Vizier, he assembled the disorderly together; and first upbraiding their cowardise, who durst not enter in the time of War, would now counterfeit Valour in the time of Peace, sentenced fifteen of them to be impaled on the breach, which piece of Justice and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry was immediately executed. This rumour being appeased, the <hi>Topegibashee</hi> and <hi>Gebegibashee,</hi> or the Generals of the Ordnance and Arms took quiet possession of the Forts and Cannon of the City, and whilst the Turks entred over the breach, the Christian Army withdrew and imbarked themselves as fast as convenience and decency would permit, who after the departure of the French, and of such who accompanied them, were not computed to be above two thousand five hundred men, and those sickly, ill accoutred, and half naked; and thus this City and whole Island became subject and a prey to the Ottoman Arms. Amongst the Officers which took possession of the Town were the Tefterdar and the Aga of the Janisaries. The Tefterdar as he passed over the breach of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> and observing how low and weak the Works were on that side, turned to the Aga of the Janisaries, and with some disdain said to him, We have here spent ten days in the Surrender of this Town which we might have taken in two hours.</p>

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:98602:193"/>
they had erected a triumphant Bridge over the breach of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> on which the Vizier entred into the Town, and passed directly to the Church of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> which was converted to a Mahometan Mosque, where having said his Namaz or Prayer, he went to the house where the Marquess St. <hi>Andrea</hi> was lodged, which was prepared for him, with a sumptuous Entertainment of five hundred Dishes at the expence of the Grand Signior.</p>
                     <p>This City in four parts of five was ruined and demolished in the time of the Siege, all the Bells and Ornaments of the Churches and Houses to the very Locks of the doors were carried away; the Arms remaining were old and rusty, and not above three hundred and fifty Pieces of Cannon left on the Walls, and those for the most part very small: the Inhabitants remaining were only five, as we have said before, unless some few decrepit Jews and Greeks, which might make up the number of about thirty; so that never could be a more sad spectacle of desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor a more clear Mirroir of the miseries of War.</p>
                     <p>The Great Vizier being possessed of the Town, dispatched away an Express with the good News thereof to the Sultan, who posted as fast as wind and weather would permit. And here the Reader may easily apprehend what joy possessed the minds of the Turks in all places where the rumour slew of this Cities Surrender, which had for so many years baffled and put a stand to the Ottoman Sword. And though the joyful tidings added wings to the Messengers haste, yet the uncertainty of the Grand Signiors abode retarded some days the arrival of the News: which will seem very strange to him that considers, that the motion of so great an Emperour in the Glory of his Fortunes should be less obscure than the light of the Sun, perceptible by all conditions, who inhabit that side of the Globe, where his rays are visible. At length the Messenger found the Sultan within the Woods and Mountains of <hi>Negropont</hi> where he had <note place="margin">The News brought to the Grand Signior at <hi>Negropont.</hi>
                        </note> passed the heats of the Summer, and some part of his discontent in those solitary retirements: it being now towards the end of <hi>September,</hi> and the Winter approaching, the Isle was incapable to entertain so great a Court, and to return back seemed as dishonourable as it was dangerous, the Souldiery and People being equally discontented, the one by the ill success and government of Affairs, and the other by oppression of Taxes: but this joyful News cleared all those clouds and ombrages of doubtful and disconsolate thoughts, which the Grand Signior received like a dream, being at first so surprised with such an unexpected happiness, that he could scarce believe it; but at length recollecting his scattered spirits, without delay returned the Messenger again with his Embrahore or Master of his Horse to the Vizier with the Present of a Sable Vest, a Dagger, and a Sword, being the usual signals of the Sultans favour, and with a Letter freighted with Encomiums and Praises of his Valour and Fortune. And whereas the Vizier had perswaded him to return to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> he answered, That he was resolved to winter at <hi>Salonica,</hi> where with the Spring he expected his presence, and from thence in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with him, should be ready to chuse any Seat, which in his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Vizier apprehended most conducing to the benefit of the Empire.</p>
                     <p>The Captain-General <hi>Morosini</hi> having in the mean time imbarked his Forces, failed to <hi>Suda</hi> to provide and fortifie that place, <hi>Spina Longa</hi> and <hi>Carabusa,</hi> poor Rocks and Appendages to the greater Isle of <hi>Candia,</hi>
                        <pb n="279" facs="tcp:98602:193"/>
with all necessary supplies of Victuals and Ammunition: which only serve for a Prospect into <hi>Candia,</hi> and to keep alive the Title of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian Republick to that Kingdom. <hi>Suda</hi> is the most considerable of the three, but yet not strong, the Sea being fordable between that and <note place="margin">The Venetians at <hi>Suda.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Candia,</hi> and not of long resistance, whensoever the Turk shall think it worthy his time to subdue. Here <hi>Morosini</hi> attended the Ratification of the Peace from <hi>Venice,</hi> and the disbanding of the Turkish Army, in which time four French Ships with Succours of Men and Ammunition ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Candia;</hi> but coming late were disappointed of their design, and so returned back into their own Country.</p>
                     <p>The Turks having now finished their work, dispeeded away their Janisaries and Pioniers by all occasions of shipping: those that remained were imployed all the Winter in filling the Trenches without the City, and many Slaves taken out of the Gallies to repair the breach of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drea:</hi> in which work, whilst they threw up the disordered rubbish, so poysonous a stench evaporated from the bodies of the slain, which lay buried in those ruines, as begat a Pestilence and other diseases in the City and in the Gallies; but labouring continually on that work, they soon acquitted themselves of the contagion, by help of the Winters cold which then approached.</p>
                     <p>In this manner expired the Action of this Year fortunate in its success to the Turks; for though they gained but thirty Acres of Land with expence inestimable of Blood and Treasure, yet the Glory and Fame which attended it, being the consummation of twenty five years Wars, and the Theatre where the whole World were Spectators, was of greater value to the Turks than any other consideration, and may with time prove a place of advantage to the farther increase of their Western Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, unless God Almighty by his Mercy and Providence give a stop to the progress of this Grand Oppressour.</p>
                     <p>But before this Year ended, behold the misery of Christendom, by reason of discontents and animosities in the Imperial Court, the Count <hi>Serini</hi> Prince of <hi>Croatia,</hi> the Marquess <hi>Frangipani</hi> and Count <hi>Nadasri,</hi>

                     <p>The Great Vizier imployed himself this whole Winter past in repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fortifications of <hi>Candia,</hi> regulating them in some measure accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Turkish Model, and in repairing and beautifying the Town, which was done with such admirable expedition, that in a few months most of the houses demolished in the time of the Siege were again erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Churches converted into Moschs and adorned, three of the principal whereof took the Names of the Grand Signior, Great Vizier and Captain Pasha, and were endowed by them with an honourable Revenue, sufficient to maintain them in Reparations, Lamps, and Talis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. But the Turks were not more pious towards their Mosehs than the Christians were careless and cold towards their Churches; for the Venetians inserted not one Article in favour of a Christian Church or a Religious House, which would have been granted as soon as demanded, only a Greek who was Interpreter to the Great Vizier called <hi>

                     <p>The Grand Signior in the mean time returned to <hi>Salonica</hi> to pass the remainder of the Winter, which place being famous for multitude of all sorts of Game, drew his heart, and made him impatient till he arrived those Plains, more desired by him than the Elysian fields; for having <note place="margin">The G.

But yet not to lose his hunting, at midnight he sent Officers to the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour to prepare for the next days Audience very early; and to gain time, ordered his Horses to be all ready, that so having dispatched that Ceremony, he might immediately mount into the Saddle and pursue his Game. Howsoever he was not in so much haste, but he testified due respect to His Majesty of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> and the esteem he had of the English Nation, ordering the Capitulations to be renewed; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the Chimacam, that if any one should break or insringe them, that he should cut him off without farther argument. But as to renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Capitulations, the Chimacam falling at the Grand Signiors feet, beseeched him, That that particular might be deferred until the arrival of the Great Vizier, whose proper power and act it was to make War and Peace; and therefore for him to intermeddle about Capitulations was to invade the Viziers Authority, which he durst not do without putting his life in danger, or at least rendring his Person obnoxious to his irreconcileable displeasure; with which the Grand Signior being sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, ordered that the renewing of the Capitulations should be defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red until the return of the Vizier, and so dismissed the Lord Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour from his Presence; but this work of renewing the Capitulations was reserved for the care and conduct of Sir <hi>John Finch,</hi> who succeeded in the Embassy after the death of Sir <hi>Daniel Harvey.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Grand Signior arising from his Throne mounted into his Saddle to follow his excessive delight in Hunting, which now he pursued every day without respect of cold or wet, or Horses or Attendants; but like an impetuous <hi>Nimrod</hi> raged amongst the timorous Hares and flying Harts, over-spreading the Woods with vast numbers of poor Jews and Peasants, which he had commanded sorth to drive for Game, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting the extreme rigour and Frosts of Winter, by which many of those poor Wretches, lying abroad in the nights, were benumbed, and dyed. And so far did his humour transport him in this Recreation, that he was discouraged at no inconvenience or labours which attended it; for one day appointing his Hunting at a certain place, which to pass on Horse-back was a great circuit, but a nearer cut over a Gulf or Arm of the Sea, he ordered his Horses round, whilst he in Person attended with the Chimacam and several of his Grandees, passed over to the other side in a Gally. But being impatient of his Sport, and not able to give time to his Horses to make their way, ascended his Gally, commanding them to row away with all speed; and arriving at the other side some hours before his Horses could come, would yet land: and being weary of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, resolved to meet them on foot through all the dirt and mire of a low and rich soil: where whilst he travelled heavily, and almost

tired, by good fortune they espied a Miller driving his Horse laden with two Sacks of Meal; whom when they had called, and made him to lighten his burden, and take off the Pack-saddle, the Chimacam himself stripped off his own Sables Vest, and covered the Horse with it, on which the Grand Signior mounting in great state, rode like a Prince till he met his own Retinue, which passage served to fill the discourse at night of that days Hunting, and deserves to be chronicled with our English Dialogue between the Miller and the King: howsoever we make use of it here to demonstrate the strange and passionate humour which posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed this Sultan in his Hunting.</p>
                     <p>Little other recreation did this Grand Signior take, unless it were in the Company of his chief Sultana, called the Hasaki Sultana, by whom <note place="margin">The G.

                        </note> all the Inhabitants which paid Harach, or Pole-money, found them not to exceed two and twenty thousand persons. For though in the time of <hi>Dellee Mehmet</hi> Pasha, who was the first that brought the Ottoman Sword into that Country, there were listed fifty five thousand, who paid duties of Harach; yet now the Plague, the Sword, and other miseries of War had reduced them to that small number, of whom ten thousand (as is reported) perished in the Mines, and before the Walls of their own
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:98602:195"/>
City; and great numbers of Olive-Trees being cut down and burned by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1670"/> the Souldiery in time of the War, is the reason that that Island yields not half the quantity of Oils as in former times.</p>
                     <p>The Ambassadour of <hi>Venice</hi> Signior <hi>Alivisé Molino,</hi> before mentioned, was now at <hi>Candia,</hi> designing to accompany the Vizier in his Voyage to the Grand Signior; for adorning which Embassy the Republick had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Ship to carry the Presents and several Persons of Quality for attendance of the Bailo (for so their Ambassadour is called;) and in regard in that passage the ship was to touch at <hi>Zant,</hi> they laded on her a hundred thousand Zechins for payment of that Souldiery, which with the Captain General were returned from <hi>Candia</hi> to that place, with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents for the Grand Signior and his Court; but it pleased God, that this Ship sailing down the Gulf, met with so furious a storm of Wind, that she suffered shipwrack on the Coast of <hi>Italy,</hi> where not only the ship and goods were lost, but every soul upon that ship perished; amongst which was <hi>Lorenzo Molino</hi> Son of the Ambassadour, and <hi>Ottavio Labia,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther noble Venetian.</p>
                     <p>The Great Vizier entertained himself so long in <hi>Candia</hi> that the month of <hi>May</hi> was well entered before he departed thence; and by the way <note place="margin">The Vizier de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts from <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives at <hi>Scio.</hi>
                        </note> touched at <hi>Scio,</hi> where he was met by all the Officers and Governours of the adjacent Jurisdictions, who came to make tender of their Presents and Services; but the Vizier in a plausible manner, accepted of their courteous Offers, but returned their Gifts, saying, That he was so sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the great oppressions and expences the neighbouring Countries had suffered by reason of the War, that he was resolved to superinduce no new Charge by Victory and Peace.</p>
                     <p>In like manner from all parts was a confluence of poor oppressed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who came to petition for justice and relief against the corruption and tyranny of their Governours in the respective Countries. But the Vizier admitted no Audience for Complaints, whether it were to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an apprehension of his clemency and gentleness, by acting nothing that was cruel or severe, or to enjoy himself after his cares and turmoils in the War; he almost for fourteen days continuance entertained him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in private by the cool and crystalline Fountains of <hi>Scio.</hi> Some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that he gave himself at that time so excessively to Wine, being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verjoyed at his success, and conclusion of the War, that he was never capable, during his abode there, of serious thoughts or counsels; so that his Kahya, or Secretary, could never be admitted access, unless he were called, though on the most urgent occasion of business. Others inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted his retirements to be in order to serious considerations about the mannagement of Affairs at his return; as how to satisfie the expectations of the Grandees, who patiently attended an amendment of abuses in the Government; how he might pacifie the minds of the Souldiery, who were jealous of Conspiracies against the lives of the Royal Brothers, and how to steer in an even course at Court between the security of his Master, and satisfaction of the Vulgar; for all the World lived in hope that alteration of times would amend abuses, and that the last remedy of all was the return of the Viziers Authority. Howsoever, it is certainly reported, That the Vizier was become exceedingly intemperate in wine, and drowned much of his cares in the fumes and vapours of it, supposing <note place="margin">The Great Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier persuaded to drink wine.</note> himself, as <hi>Tiberius</hi> did in <hi>Capreae,</hi> exempt from the eyes of the World, whilst he remained in <hi>Scio,</hi> which the Sea had separated from the greater
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:98602:195"/>
Continent. And yet the Vizier, is believed, never to have tasted Wine, or known whether it was bitter or sweet, till the pride of his success in <hi>Candia</hi> transported him to make his joy extravagant, to which the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers about his Person invited him, as that which cheared the spirits, strengthened the nerves, and induced a strange kind of delight and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in the fancy, beyond any thing of Poppies, or Opiate Compositions, or Biram-Pasha's Pills, or Berse, or a thousand other inventions, sit only to confuse mens reason, and stupifie the brain, and benumb all the senses, in which some, as I have heard, had so practised themselves by degrees, that they could swallow five drams in twenty four hours, though I never knew any, unless one Turk, whom I saw eat above three; but then they could eat nothing else, nor were they sit afterwards to receive or digest any other nourishment, Nature being used to that poyson, reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all other sounder nutriment. But Wine (they said) cheared the heart in that manner, and comforted the stomach, that the Turks began now generally to drink it; unless he were some Pharisaical Hypocrite of the Ulamah, or some superstitious aged and ignorant Profeslour. So that <note place="margin">The Souldiers' and other Turks drink Wine to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.</note> the vice of drunkenness became more common amongst the Turks than amongst the Germans, or our selves: I am sure more intolerable, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred to more mischiefs, by how much the Turks being unaccusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to Wine, knew less how to comport the heats of intemperance.</p>
                     <p>And here I shall make a little digression from my purpose in hand to acquaint my Reader of the effects which I have observed to be produced in those who accustom themselves to the use of Opium. In all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try <note place="margin">A digression a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Opium.</note> Villages amongst the Turks, the more aged sort of men who have most leisure, and least necessity to work, addict themselves to Opium for alleviation (as they say) of their cares, and to forget their sorrow, for pleasure in the taste there can be none, being very bitter to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late; which being taken in a morning in a small quantity, about the bigness of a Tare, superinduces at first a strange chearfulness about the heart, and thence raises a more pleasing vapour to the head, than any can proceed from the spirits of the best and the highest Wines: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards as it begins to digest, the vapour becomes more gross, and consequently a kind of stupefaction is induced over the brain and nerves, which with drowsiness and sleep passes away like a drunken fit. The Youth amongst them which drink Wine abhor Opium, until growing into years, and to the care of a family (as a sign of which they suffer their beards to increase) they are taught by their Imaum, and more by example of others, that Wine being against their Law, is only dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable in wild and unbridled Youth, but in those of riper age is a vice to be reproached by all sober and well-governed men. In the place of which they take up the lawful and innocent Pill of Opium, which makes men serious and setled (as they say) because that it operates not like Wine, which makes men mad, and rash, and violent, but disposes them to be Sots, and to sit grave and quiet without doing hurt to any man, which is a qualification accounted very laudable amongst them, and is one of the greatest Vertues which they endeavour to acquire in their Tekeés or Monasteries. This being the reason for which it is taken and allowed, it is grown a common custom almost amongst all the Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people, who in the morning before they go to work take first their Opium, and upon it three or four dishes of Coffee; for it is observable, that none eats Opium but who accompanies it with great quantities of
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:98602:196"/>
Coffee, which is doubtless a kind of Opiate in it self, and partakes very much of a Narcotick Quality; by this means and constant use some arrive to take strange quantities; the most that ever I knew any man take was three drams in twenty four hours, <hi>viz.</hi> a dram and an half or thereabouts in the morning, and as much an hour after noon: the which for more exactness I had the curiosity to see weighed. The same person offered for a small reward to take five drams in twenty four hours; but then he said, it required a long time to digest, and did not doubt but to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it: but I was too scrupulous to put a man into a sleep, from whence I feared he might never awake. This person was of a thin and livid complexion, his skin shriveled, no more beard than a few hairs, his mouth commonly open, because his chap was fallen; his countenance putting me osten in mind of the Picture I have seen of the <hi>Gorgons</hi> head; for had it been incompassed with Snakes instead of his Turbant, it might have served for a perfect Original. He had arrived to the years of forty eight, and from the years thirty he had entred into Opium from a great excess of Wine: in which condition he found that his stomach required little other nourishment, being content with a small quantity of bread and water for his other Diet, Opium supplying him with all the other Delicacies he could desire: he was the father notwithstanding of two or three children, which he confessed to have begot in the strength of his Opium, having no desire to accompany with his wife, until he was first invigorated with his usual Dose, being till then like a Trunk or Log, wanting spirits almost to turn his body. For his Opium was that only which could revive all, which about a quarter of an hour after it was taken began to operate, and then we discovered in his eyes, which before were dull and heavy, scarce opening, a certain quickness and sparkling, and then soon after he was sitted for the work of the day, and could labour as others, and take a journey on foot of seven or eight miles to Market, and return home at night: his body was always bound, or his belly constipated with the hardness of his excrement, and yet he was subject to no other sickness, unless his vitiated desire to this Poyson which can nourish no wholesom or healthful body. The Turks, as I have learned, make little other use of Opium than this; yet sometimes they will put it into their Camels ears, and the nostrils of their Horses, when faint and weary, wherewith they revive again, and soon recover their strength and force to travel.</p>
                     <p>The Vizier having thus passed some days of Entertainment at <hi>Scio,</hi> entred again his Gally, and passing through the Streights of the <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spont</hi> arrived at <hi>Rodesto,</hi> where having landed many of his Janisaries and such of the Army as remained with him, after a few days continuance he marched to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> where he was received by the Grand Signior with all evidences of satisfaction, and entred the City triumphant after the manner of the Turkish <hi>Allai.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Ceremonies and Complements being past, which usually inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene between Great Personages after a long absence, the grand Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was, In what manner to prevent the seditious irruptions of the Souldiery, and how to reconcile the Jealousies between the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior and his Brothers. For the former, two things were concluded ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary. First, to divide the Militia of the Janisaries, which was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately executed, and eight thousand of them, under pretence of Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, were sent through <hi>Moldavia</hi> to remain on the Frontiers of <hi>Poland.</hi>
                        <pb n="285" facs="tcp:98602:196"/>
Secondly, it being observed, that most of the Souldiery drank Wine, from whence in ancient times arose many Mutinies and Seditions of the Souldiery, dangerous to the Ottoman State, as namely in the time of <hi>Mahomet</hi> III. when the Janisaries in the heat of drunkenness entred the Seraglio by force, and demanded the Heads of the chief Favourites: And as then it was judged the best Expedient to cool the hot brains of the Janisaries, to proclaim a Prohibition of Wine at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and to command upon pain of death, That those who had any Wine in their Houses should bring it forth, and stave it; so now the use of it was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally forbidden in all the parts of the Grand Signiors Dominions, and a <note place="margin">Wine forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in all parts of the Grand Signiors Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</note> special Command was sent to all places respectively under the penalty of death, and a thousand maledictions, cursing Wine as come from Hell, and as a Liquor produced by the Devil to ensnare mens souls, and inebriate their heads, and confound States. And so generally was this Prohibition enjoyned, that his Majesties Ambassadour at <hi>Constantinople</hi> with long so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation and charge obtained licence for his Family, and the Merchants there to make Wine; but for the Merchants at <hi>Smyrna</hi> there was more difficulty, and this year Wine was not made in their Houses according to custom, and not without scruple permitted to be imported from the Greeks Islands and other parts where the Command extended not its force; for the Prohibition was to all places where were Moschs or Turks Inhabitants, the Villages or Isles where Christians only lived were not included. To this Prohibition were added on every Friday Sermons to the People inveighing against Wine, and cursing the Drinkers of it, in which affair <hi>Vanni Efendi</hi> the Grand Signiors Preacher was much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, from whom the Original of this Counsel was judged to proceed. And now to please the Reader, who perhaps may be curious to know the stile of this Prohibition, I have here inserted the Command <hi>verbatint</hi> as translated out of the Original, and directed to the Kadi of <hi>Smyrna.</hi>

the Musulmin Kingdoms of this prohibited and silthy abomination; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when this Royal Command comes to your hands, wheresoever there are Taverns of Wine, let them be rased and thrown down in all Cities and Towns ennobled with Musulmin Moschs, let the buying and selling thereof be prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, with all drinking and use of Wine; and likewise I command, That in <hi>Constantinople, Brusa,</hi> and <hi>Adrianople</hi> the Imposition thereupon be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken off. And that in all other Cities and Towns adorned with Musulmin Moschs, there be not a drop of Wine suffered or admitted in; and that Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulmins neither privately nor secretly drink Wine; and whosoever is or shall be Author of this sin, and to alter my Command in this particular, either now or hereafter, may he be punished by the Universal Lord of all the World. Likewise when this my Command of high Reputation appears, which is a Royal Writing, let it be annexed to the Decretal Rolls, and be put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution according as it is obligatory. And when this Command comes to your hands, you are to have all due care of this injoyned particular, That it ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate according to the Tenour of this Royal Injunction, participating of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity and Majestick Power, by virtue of which you are to reprove, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, hinder, and prohibit, according to the Law of God, the drinking of Wine; and that it may be wholly taken away, let the Tax and Revenue which proceeds front thence be taken off, and in all guarded and governed Cities and places of my Kingdoms, let the Taverns be ruined and overthrown. And therefore you are to make known and publish to all Citizens and Inhabitants the force of this my Royal Command, as well in the City of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> as in other Cities and Towns ennobled with Musulmin Moschs, and you are to ruine the Taverns which are found there. And you are to take away the Houses of Entertainment amongst the Franks which are in <hi>Smyrna</hi> that sell Wine, nor shall they sell Wine in their own houses, but you shall hinder and prohibit them: and if those Taverns shall be the Possessions of private men, you shall advise the Owners of them; or if they be bequeathed by Testament to the Deputies of the <hi>Muteveli,</hi> you shall admonish them with carnestness' and threats, That in the place of Taverns they raise other more profitable and lawful Buildings, and that they re-edifie them in a different form from the first. And the Taverns being ruined and demolished according to my Royal Command, and the Butts and other Utensils thereof taken away, you shall make a publick Arz thereos, and send it to my Royal Stirrup; and you being admonished thereof by my Royal Admonition, you are to have a care that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the City nor Suburbs thereof, nor in Cities adorned with Royal Moschs any person whatsoever bring in Wine, or one drop thereof, or that the buying or selling thereof be admitted, and that no Musulman drink Wine. For if aster this I come to understand, That any person have brought in Wine, though it be but one drop, I swear by the Holy Souls of my Grandfathers, and great Grandfathers, that those who bring it in, or sell it, or drink it, shall be punished with such tortures, as were never inflicted on any before. In short, this being a business so important as to the Faith, as to my Empire, my strong intention and firm resolution is to cleanse and purifie in the highest degree as well the Frontiers, as the Royal Seats of my Empire from so foul a sink of so much silthiness and dissention; and therefore do injoyn this Royal Writing of high felicity so far, that nothing shall be able to change or alter it, or revoke this Command of Majestick Reputation.

                     <p>The Relation of these disturbances was carried to the Port by the Bosnacs, who were concerned in these Affairs, with all circumstances of aggravation which might incense the Grand Signior, and move the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier to take part in their Quarrel; But he being desirous to maintain that Peace which he himself had concluded, moved the Grand Signior to dispatch a Hasacheé, or one of his Royal Officers, to render him an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act account of the true state of the Affairs of that Country. In which <note place="margin">Commissioners appointed for determining the differences of the Confines in <hi>Dalmatia.</hi>
                        </note> Interim <hi>Mahomet</hi> Pasha of <hi>Bosna,</hi> the Commissioner, happening to dye, the Vizier moved, That the Morlacchs should surrender up those places which they had lately possessed, and that new Commissioners should be again sent for adjusting the Limits of the Confines, and the Possessions of the Inhabitants. The Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> accepting this proposition, gave Orders to their General <hi>Barbaro</hi> to withdraw the people from the places in dispute, and in the Month of <hi>May</hi> 1671 made and constituted the Cavalier <hi>Nani</hi> Procurator of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Mark,</hi> their Plenipotentiary, with full authority to compose all differences touching the Frontiers. On part of the Turksone <hi>Mamut,</hi> once Pasha of <hi>Buda,</hi> and late Chimacam of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> was nominated and impowred with like faculty; he was a person with whom I was well acquainted, and of whom we have had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to discourse, when he was Kahya to old <hi>Kuperlee.</hi> He was a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the Country of <hi>Bosna,</hi> who are reputed for men of much more affable and courteous disposition, and of more pleasing Conversation, than the common temper of the Turks, who are for the most part of haughty, sullen, and saturnine Complexions.</p>
                     <p>These Commissioners, with <hi>Thomas Tarsia</hi> Interpreter, met about the end of <hi>July,</hi> in the plains of <hi>Island</hi> between <hi>Zara</hi> and <hi>Sebenico</hi> under Tents erected for that purpose: At this meeting were present also the Mufti, and Treasurer of <hi>Bosna,</hi> and all the Kadi's and Military Officers of that Province, which might make a Body of four or five thousand men, ill armed, and badly accoutred: With <hi>Nani</hi> the Commissioner for <hi>Venice,</hi> were present, <hi>Alberto Magno</hi> Captain of <hi>Zara, Farsetti</hi> Proveditor of <hi>Clissa;</hi> divers military Officers, such as the Cavalier <hi>Varisano, Grimal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di</hi> Serjeant General, Count <hi>Rados,</hi> the Count <hi>Scorto, Vimercato, Cesarini,</hi> with divers other Colonels, and Persons of Quality, and Nobles of the Province, some of which were Representatives for their principal Cities, such as <hi>Zara, Sebenico, Spalato,</hi> and <hi>Trau.</hi> His Excellency the Comis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner <hi>Nani</hi> had three Troops of Horse, and as many Companies of Foot, for his Guard, and at <hi>Possidaria</hi> were two Gallies and four Brigantines to attend him: so that his Equipage appeared as well Martial, as agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to a place ordained for a Treaty of Peace.</p>
                     <p>On the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> the Commissioners had their first Conference in the Pasha's Tent, the Debate continued many hours with much heat; which did not only relate to the late Conquests, but new difficulties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose, in regard that <hi>Ferat</hi> Aga, appointed Commissioner for the Port, had in the year 1573 assigned Bounds and Limits to the Confines, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his pleasure and arbitrary will, which not being assented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the Venetians, a new regulation was made by the said <hi>Ferat,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:98602:198"/>
with Cavalier <hi>Soranzo</hi> in the year 1576. Time afterwards, and the turbulent spirits of the Inhabitants had altered these Limits, and by reason of the long War the Land-Marks and Bounds of the Confines were removed or wholly destroyed. The original Copies of the Writings of Agreement were rotted, and much defaced, the names of the places and the scituations being wrote in divers Languages, were confused, 'and the reports of the people were so different, proceeding from the diversity of their Interests, that little of judgement could be founded on their rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. At length, as to the Consines of <hi>Zara,</hi> it was agreed, That they should be regulated according as they were limited by <hi>Soranzo</hi> and <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat;</hi> for better settlement of which, and to avoid all doubtfulness or mistake, the Commissioners took the pains to travel several days jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in person to erect the bounds and Limits of each people; in which though many contests and differences arose between particular persons, yet at length personal interests were forced to give way to publick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations.</p>
                     <p>In like manner the Consines of <hi>Sebenico</hi> were determined, being bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the River <hi>Checa,</hi> and being arrived at <hi>Scardona,</hi> the Pasha <hi>Mamut</hi> desired that he might have the convenience of passing in the Gally, and accordingly he was received aboard, and treated with that generous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment which is agreeable to the magnificence of the Republick; and landing at the River of <hi>Belulla</hi> on the Banks of the Vally <hi>Daniel,</hi> where the Pasha had placed his Tents, the Turks who with a greedy eye swallowed in their thoughts the possession and enjoyment of all these Plains, would have enlarged their Confines to those marks which <hi>Ferat</hi> Aga had singly placed according to his own arbitrary pleasure, including <note place="margin">The difference about <hi>Verpogly.</hi>
                        </note> also <hi>Verpogly</hi> within their Limits. This <hi>Verpogly</hi> was a small Redoubt on the top of a Hill once belonging to the Venetians, which at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the War they abandoned, as costing more to maintain and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, than the value or consideration of it; the Turks afterwards pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed it, when they had a design to besiege <hi>Sebenico,</hi> but afterwards for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook it, and retired; upon this place <hi>Mamut</hi> much insisted, producing a Command from the Grand Signior, ordering that it be taken in, fortified, and garrisoned. But <hi>Nani</hi> with more force of Argument insisted on the contrary, producing ancient Writings, and undeniable Testimonies to prove that this place did really, and of right belong to the Republick; by which though the Pasha was fully convinced in his own mind; yet being over-awed by the insolent importunities of the Inhabitants, he was cautious and fearful of declaring his true sense in the case; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther endeavoured to overcome the Venetians sometimes with flatteries, and anon with menaces, having to that purpose, besides his own For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ordered the Beglerbey of <hi>Greece</hi> to approach those Confines with an Army of about ten thousand men. But all this did not move the steddy Constancy of the Venetian Commissioner from his reason and right; for maintenance of which he appeared firm and resolute, and being necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated for convenience of Water to remove his Quarters to the Lake <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benich,</hi> gave some jealousie to the Pasha by this retirement of an intention to break the Peace; howsoever, <hi>Nani</hi> declared his meaning to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and that there might be no interruption to their proceedings, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that these differences might be remitted to the Supreme Powers; and that in the mean time, until answers came, they might proceed in the adjustment of other parts of the Confines. But the Pasha assented not
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:98602:199"/>
hereunto, but desired rather the dispute should be referred to the Port, and that in the mean time he himself should retire to <hi>Cettina,</hi> and the other to <hi>Spalato.</hi> Scarce were the Messages sent, and the Dispatches made (by <hi>Isaac</hi> Aga, a Person whom I well knew) before <hi>Mamut</hi> Pasha, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mamut</hi> Pasha dyes.</note> after a short indisposition ended his days: he was a man of about ninety two years of age, at which years I have admired to see him ride abroad, and transact his affairs with great dexterity, with a strong memory, and a sound judgment. And here it is admirable to observe with what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy and patience the Turkish Officers do usually support their labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious employments; they contemn all difficulties and incommodiousness of living, as if they did not feel them, inuring themselves to colds and heats, to watchings and labours, being abstemious in their diet, and as occasions require, not indulging to sleep: and no question but this aged man travelling in the scalding heat of the Sun, and suffering much for want of plenty, as well as of good water, dried up that little radical moisture which remained, and caused this Autumn-fruit to fall, which perhaps might have continued a short time longer on the tree, had it not been desiccated by drought, and shaken too hard by the motion of travels and labour.</p>
                     <p>The News of <hi>Mamut</hi> Pasha's death being arrived at the Port, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission was immediately granted to <hi>Chusaein</hi> Pasha Imbrahor, or Master of the Horse to the Grand Signior, to succeed in his government and business of Treaty concerning the Limits of the Consines; with which Authority and Instructions <hi>Chusaein</hi> posted away, and being well infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by <hi>Isaac</hi> Aga of the ill nature and rapacious disposition of those Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, arrived with intentions to agree, and with courteous and benign thoughts towards Cavalier <hi>Nani,</hi> who had gained an esteem and repute amongst the Turks of a generous and noble disposition.</p>

                        </note> laying aside all considerations concerning the Limits assigned by <hi>Ferat</hi> Aga, and the Contests about <hi>Verpoglie,</hi> the Line drawn from the Mountain <hi>Tartarus</hi> was agreed, and determined to be the true and undoubted Confines of <hi>Schenico.</hi> The Valley of St. <hi>Daniel,</hi> for the pleasure and fruitfulness of it, administred more of difficulty; but at length the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of <hi>Nani</hi> prevailed, and induced the Pasha to assent to those Bounds, which had been assigned by <hi>Soranço</hi> in the year 1576. giving, to avoid future mistakes, the true names to those places, which the Turks for their advantage, and to confuse things, had altered and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised, that they might not be known. Thence proceeding to the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory of <hi>Trau,</hi> where was less of difficulty or trouble; for the Wars not having made much alteration in that place, the Lines were evidently described by <hi>Soranço,</hi> according to whose description the Fields, Plains, Rocks, and Mountains were measured out and allowed.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, They came near to <hi>Spalato,</hi> where before the War there was little of any Territory assigned; but now by the Conquest of <hi>Clissa</hi> there was assigned unto it a spatious and fruitful Country, extending it self to the foot of the Mountains. As to <hi>Clissa</hi> there was no difference at all: howsoever the Turks would on no means admit, that the Venetians should keep <hi>Salona</hi> and <hi>Vragnizzo,</hi> because by that means they would cut off all communication between <hi>Clissa</hi> and <hi>Spalato,</hi> and thereby ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it a place useless, and of more charge than benefit; and because
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:98602:199"/>
those two places of <hi>Salona</hi> and <hi>Vragnizza</hi> had been the Dowry of a Sultana Wife of <hi>Russen</hi> Pasha, and by her given to endow a Mosch, which therefore according to their Religion could not be given away, nor alienated. But <hi>Nani</hi> insisting as vigorously on this, as on other points, shewed himself resolute to maintain this particular, as being that, which if not granted, would certainly in a short time be occasion of those quarrels and dissentions, which must necessarily break forth into an open War: for that there could be no security of Peace to the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Salona,</hi> whilst they lived amidst their Enemies, and just on the Skirts of <hi>Clissa, Spalato,</hi> and <hi>Sasso. Chusaein</hi> having well comprehended this consideration, and being desirous to dispose matters towards a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Peace, slighted the opinion and sense of the Borderers, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all matters, and in presence of <hi>Nani</hi> subscribed the Agreement on the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> in open Divan held in the Campagne of <hi>Salona;</hi> the which was also mutually subscribed, and Copies interchangeably gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And in this manner the difference about the Consines was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and the long War between <hi>Venice</hi> and the Turks had an end.</p>
                     <p>Whilst all things were reducing themselves into a posture of Peace, the Timariots disbanded, and the Janisaries retired to their Chambers, in the month of <hi>October</hi> returned the Turks Envoyé from <hi>France,</hi> bringing with him an Ambassadour from that King called Monsieur <hi>De Nointel,</hi> a Person of an excellent temper, grave and serious in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and comportment; and to give this Embassy the greater reputation, he was attended with three Men of War and a Fire-ship, which sailing along the <hi>Hellespont</hi> and <hi>Propontick</hi> without opposition, came to an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor near the seven Towers, from whence sending advice of their arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val to the Chimacam demanded to be resaluted by the Seraglio, they promising as they passed to shew the first demonstrations of courtesie; but that being denied, as not usual or customary, the French Ships passed the Seraglio silently without siring a Gun, or any significations on either side, whether of Friendship or Hostility: the Ships came to an Anchor at <hi>Fonduclé,</hi> where the Ambassadour remained aboard unsaluted and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acknowledged by the publick Ministers of the City; until the Great Vizier, who supposed that a breach with <hi>France</hi> ought to have better foundation than a meer Punctilio of Honour, seemed more to despise than take notice of the affront. For he who knew so well to dissemble, after he had seen the French Troops ranged both in <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Candia,</hi> against the Ottoman Forces, and yet politickly connived thereat, and accepted an excuse, did not esteem it prudence to ground a War for want of the smoke of a few Guns; but on the contrary ordered, That the Ambassadour should be received with the usual Form and Solemnity of Reception. The French having the advantage by this success, the Souldiers and Sea-men belonging to the Ships committed many insolencies in <hi>Pera</hi> and <hi>Galata,</hi> which never were revenged or accounted for; and when the Ships departed, above an hundred Slaves escaped from the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and parts of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and gained Sanctuary aboard: amongst the rest one Monsieur <hi>De Beau-jeu</hi> a Knight of <hi>Malta,</hi> who had for a long time been Prisoner in the seven Towers; but at length knocking off his Irons, and by help of a Cord letting himself down from one of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Towers in the night, recovered the Ships, and regained his liberty. Nor yet did this nor other affronts, whereby the French did really brave the Turks, administer sufficient subject of choler to the Vizier; for pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:98602:200"/>
all by, as if nothing had been done, or nothing worthy his notice, frankly gave his Orders to let the Ships pass the Castles, which upon the foregoing causes and pretences had been before detained: adding, That it was natural, as well for men as for birds, to endeavour to procure their liberty, and therefore were not blameable: but that those to whose care they were committed, wanting due circumspection and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance in their Office, should pay for the escape of their charge by the price of their own lives or liberties.</p>
                     <p>The French Ambassadour in the mean time proceeded in his Journey to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> where the Court resided; and having passed through the several degrees and Punctilio's of Visits and other Ceremonies, at length descending to matters of business, proposed the renovation of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Peace, with an addition of thirty two Particulars to be altered or adjoyned. The Vizier who all this time kept more in his heart than he evidenced in his countenance, refused to condescend to a concession of the most easie and reasonable of their demands, offering only to renew the Capitulations <hi>verbatim</hi> according to the Tenour of the ancient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, without other alteration than the Name of the present Sultan, and the Date of the Month and Year, and herein he was so constant and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that no arguments or colours of reason could seem to move him in the most minute and less important points of circumstances; and this perhaps lest the World should imagine, that the Turks were affrighted into Terms and better Treatments of Friendship, or that Immunities and Privileges in the Ottoman Court were acquired rather by rude usage adjoyned with menaces and neglects, than by more candid and fawning Addresses.</p>
                     <p>In this manner the French Affairs rather went back than forwards in the Ottoman Court, and it seemed that the Turks late Embassy into <hi>France</hi> and of the French to the Port served to augment the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences more than allay them. For the new Ambassadour falling short in his expectation, having obtained nothing of those many Particulars which he demanded, retired male-content from <hi>Adrianople</hi> to his usual Residence at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where he resolved to attend what farther Instructions should be given him from <hi>France;</hi> and supposing his Master would ill resent his usage so contrary to what was promised in general terms, did suppose, that his next Orders would be of revocation, and that those frequent disgusts and disrespects so often received, and given on one side and the other, would at length burst out into an open de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance. The Turks apprehended so much themselves, and as their afsairs and designs proved afterwards with <hi>Poland,</hi> they were displeased that they had given the most Christian King so just an occasion of quarrel: for understanding towards the latter end of the Year 1671. that great Preparations for War were making in <hi>France</hi> both by Sea and Land, they were conscious that their demerits had justly deserved the chastisement of the French Arms, in revenge of the many injuries they had offered that Nation, and therefore paused a while, and observed the motion of these Enemies, before they would engage themselves in a War with <hi>Poland.</hi> But at length the beginning of the Year 1672. having discovered the designs of <hi>France</hi> to be only intended against <hi>Holland,</hi> the Turks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assumed their purposes so long premeditated against <hi>Poland,</hi> with an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance natural to Turks, and with a scorn not only of <hi>France,</hi> but of all Christendom. For his most Christian Majesty judging perhaps, that
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:98602:200"/>
the rude treatment of an Infidel Prince so far remote, intrenched not so much on his Honour and Interest, as the quarrel he had with the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring States, seemed to contemn for the present, or rather to defer the revenge of former injuries until a more fit and commodious season; wherefore in the mean time his Ambassadour upon new Instructions from <hi>France</hi> brought purposely by a Man of War, repaired a second time to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> where he intimated unto the chief Ministers the great desire his Master had to maintain that League and Friendship, which for above an hundred years had continued inviolate and uninterrupted: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore waving all other former Particulars of demand, declared himself satisfied, only to renew the Capitulations, with that single alteration of their Customs from five to three in the hundred, according to that Priviledge which the English and all other Christian Merchants injoyed, whose League and Friendship was subsequent to that of others. The Great Vizier being now freed of that suspicion and fear he apprehended of the French Fleet, and being assured that their Arms were not now probable to disturb him in his designs intended, he seriously smiled in his sleeve at these Addresses, and with a kind of scorning neglect bid the Ambassadour welcome to the Court, saying, That he should have what he desired. Wherefore the Capitulations were transcribed, and the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration made in the value of their Customs; but the Vizier who meant nothing less than to yield them this Priviledge, deferred the signing thereof from day to day, pacifying the daily importunity of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour with dilatory excuses, until at length having protracted the time to the very day that the Grand Signior and he began their March towards <hi>Poland,</hi> without so much as granting the Ambassadour a perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Audience, did then with soft and gentle words signifie to the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters the grand pressures of his Affairs at present, that would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him time to perfect all matters with the Ambassadour, whom they should assure, that at his return with Glory and Victory from the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises in hand, those requests should be granted, and his promises perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; and in the mean time his Nation should remain secure in these Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, as in former times, and the League and Friendship continued and maintained. The Ambassadour was strangely surprised at this last Farewel; but being a Gentleman of great Morality and Vertue, knew, no doubt, how to bear such a disappointment with an equality of mind agreeable to the greatness of his Soul; and therefore with a due resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the injury received, he returned to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> whilst the Sultan and his Vizier proceeded in their March towards the Confines of <hi>Poland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But before I enter into a relation of the motives of that War, and the success thereof, which is the subject of the following Year, let us return to the place from whence we have digressed, and observe in this Year of Peace and repose of this Empire, what the Sultan contrived for security of himself by the death of his Brothers.</p>
                     <p>We acquainted you formerly in what manner the Sultan was disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in his designs against his Brothers, by means of his Mother, to whom the Janisaries had committed the care of their safety, which she according to her promise had maintained, and tendered equally with her own. But now the Vizier being returned from the Wars, and the most seditions amongst the Janisaries withdrawn from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> it was thought sit to make a new attempt on the Princes still residing in
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:98602:201"/>
the old Seraglio, which was performed with those due preparations and secrecy, that it took effect on Sultan <hi>Orchan,</hi> the eldest of the two, who in the month of <hi>September</hi> 1671. dyed by a draught of poyson, which <note place="margin">Sultan <hi>Orchan</hi> put to death by his Brother.</note> was administred to him as a Present from his courteous Brother; some say he was strangled, and that before he submitted his neck to the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string, he killed one of the Executioners with his Hanjarre. This Prince was reported by the people to be a comely Person, of a strong and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustious body, of large and black eyes like Sultan <hi>Morat:</hi> his death was lamented by all, and presaged as fatal to the Empire, in regard that that very night that he was murthered the Moon suffered a greater Eclipse than it had done for many years before, which happening out in this conjuncture was interpreted as ominous, and served to increase the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledictions and evil speeches, which the Turks in all places cast out upon those who gave this counsel to the Sultan.</p>
                     <p>About this time the State of <hi>Genoua</hi> desirous to change their Officers in <hi>Turkie,</hi> sent a new Resident to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and a Consul to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A new Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent sent from <hi>Genoua.</hi>
                        </note> which change was principally obtained at the request of the old Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, who weary of an employment so tedious, without a benefit cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>responding to their melancholy life, and perceiving their Trade decline before it was arrived to any tolerable state or degree of reputation, by the assistance and mediation of friends sollicited their Letters of Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. For the Trade of <hi>Genoua</hi> being chiefly founded on hopes of those advantages which they expected from a coarse or base alloy of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, did instantly decay so soon as the Turks discovered themselves to be abused by the vast quantities of Temins imported, as we have before related: after which their profit failing, the Consulage consequently decayed, which is the only subsistence and encouragement of such Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers as are necessary to reside for the continuance of that Peace, which but a few years before they unadvisedly made with the Turk. The new Resident had no sooner arrived at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and considered the poor and mean estate and ill foundation of their Trade, the growing charge of the Residency, and the great debts thereof that were to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve upon him from his Predecessour; but he perceived into what a Labyrinth of troubles he had ingulfed himself, instead of being preferred according to his hopes into a place of Honour and happy retirement. In which confusion of thoughts arising one morning before day from his bed, and sitting on his Close-stool (as the servants of the house report) reached at a Towel, which being intangled within the Lock of a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine that hanged always charged near his bed, unfortunately drew the Trigger too hard, which with that gave fire, and shot the poor Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man into the belly with a brace of Bullets, of which being mortally wounded, after Confession and some Prayers in a few hours he passed to another life: unhappy mischance, if it may be called a chance; for I have understood from a sober person of that Nation, that the anguish of mind which he conceived at the evil condition of his Affairs, wrought in him a deepness of melancholy and despair, under which languishing some days, did at last most miserably lay violent hands upon himself.</p>
                     <p>And now it is time to recal to mind the Conspiracy of Count <hi>Serini,</hi> Marquess <hi>Frangipani,</hi> and Count <hi>Nadasti,</hi> Persons of Quality and of great <note place="margin">The Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of <hi>Serini, Frangipani,</hi> and <hi>Nadasti.</hi>

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:98602:201"/>
News to the World to hear that the House of <hi>Serini</hi> should abandon the Christian Party, and those renowned Defenders of their Country should apostatize, though not from Christianity, yet from that Cause and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which their Ancestors and themselves had defended with Blood, Treasure, Valour, and Constancy. But dissentions and animosities sown by Satan, the Enemy of the Christian Church, did strangely corrupt the minds of those famous Persons, and raise in them a Spirit resolved to avenge the neglect and injuries put upon them by the Ministers of the Imperial Court, though at the expence and hazard of their fortunes and lives, and ruine and shipwrack of their Honour and Consciences: For the neglects and affronts undeservedly cast on <hi>Nicholas Serini</hi> during the late War (as before related) and the contempt and scorn put on the Croatian and Hungarian Nobility, was supposed to have fired the hot and ambitious Spirits of these Persons, who could more easily endure the slavery of the Turkish yoke, than condescend to the Government and prevalency of a contrary Party. Wherefore in prosecution of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, being resolved to submit to the Turk, they dispatched two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen to the Ottoman Court, who arrived at <hi>Adrianople</hi> the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> 167; demanding the protection of the Sultan, for which they promised a Tribute of thirty Purses, or fifteen thousand Dollars every year for those Lands they held in <hi>Croatia.</hi> To make Answer hereunto a Divan or Council was called, in which were weighed all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Reasons on one side and the other. The Muftee opposed their receiving into protection, as being against the Capitulations and Agreement so lately concluded with the Emperour, wherein the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or abetting of Rebels is expresly forbidden, and provided against by one side and the other; but <hi>Vanni Esendi</hi> the Preacher who used to be always of a different opinion to the Muftee, urged to have them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, because that the advancement of the Mahometan Cause, and enlargement of their Empire was more sacred than the conservation of their League with an Insidel Prince. And that the Ottoman Court was no longer to be termed the Refuge of the World, if it could not yield that protection which oppressed Kingdoms and distressed Princes peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to obtain. In this manner the matter being controverted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Agreement, it was in fine resolved to refer the matter to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Grand Vizier, who was now in a few months expected to return triumphant from <hi>Candia.</hi> But in that interim Intelligence coming by way of <hi>Bosna,</hi> that the Emperour had already entred <hi>Croatia</hi> with thirty thousand men, that he had taken <hi>Chiacheturno</hi> in <hi>Cotoriba,</hi> and that <hi>Serini</hi> and his Associates were already fled, either to <hi>Vienna</hi> to beg pardon of the Emperour, or <hi>Transylvania,</hi> or to some other place, that the Marquess of <hi>Bada</hi> had sortified <hi>Sequas</hi> and other Castles of <hi>Serini</hi> with German Garrisons; the Turks esteemed it too late to administer help to this desperate cause, and therefore refused to owne the Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of a People, to whom they could neither pretend by Reason, nor defend by Arms. The Vizier also being returned, like the Fox, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned those Grapes which he could not reach, and with an abhorrency as it were of the Revolt or the Rebellion, as a zealous Hater of all perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, refused to afford protection to any of the Complices in the late Confederacy, which he politickly designed in reference to the Emperour, whose friendship he would seem to conserve most faithfully, left he should interrupt him in the carrying on of that War, which he then
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:98602:202"/>
meditated against <hi>Poland.</hi> But what became afterwards of these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1672"/> is the subject matter of the German History, it is sufficient to acquaint the Reader here that their design being seasonably discovered, they were interrupted by the hand of Justice, and met that Fate which is due to Traitors and Rebels to their Country, having abused the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Prince, to whom clemency and mercy are connatural. We shall therefore leave these men to render the next account to the Judge of all things, and prosecute our Relation of the Wars of <hi>Poland,</hi> which now was the next prize held up to the Turkish Militia, and was that adventure which was to consummate the glories of the Great Vizier. Howsoever, this gave beginning to that Rebellion in <hi>Hungary,</hi> which to this Year 1679 hath been continued, without prospect how far it may proceed, and what may be the issue of such direful Effects.</p>

                     <p>WE have formerly acquainted you how coarsely the Chimacam of <hi>Adrianople</hi> had in the year 1667 treated the Ambassadour of <hi>Poland,</hi> who came to complain of the incursions made into their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try by the Tartars; desiring that not only satisfaction might be made for the late spoils, but that that unruly and savage people might be restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the like Attempt for the future. But the Vizier being now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in person it was thought necessary, That to preserve this gross Body of Empire from corruption, it should be exercised with motion, and the vigorous agitations of a new War. To what place they should <note place="margin">The Turks de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate of a War.</note> now convert or employ their Armes, was the important subject of a grand Consultation; they had lately made up a peace with the Venetians, so that on that side it was too early to make an irruption, the parts of <hi>Persia</hi> were too remote and distant to carry on a War with success and pleasure; the sields of <hi>Hungary</hi> had been lately traced, and they were sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated with the blood of <hi>Austria</hi> and <hi>Germany;</hi> something now of novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty must be proposed, and the forgotten ways of <hi>Poland</hi> must be again o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, there being something, it seems, of wantonness in prosperous Armes, which delight in variety, and abhor as much to fight often in the same Country, as Travellers do to see the same place twice. The Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers had unto this day so preserved the Limits of their Country with honour and gallantry, that the Turks could never secure to themselves one palm of Land within their Territories, until the civil and most dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable Discords of that Country laid them open to the fury of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, who embraced this most grateful opportunity, which facilitated their Design, and made that easie which they had so long desired, and with care studied and contrived. But for the better understanding of these Affairs it is convenient for us to take the Thread of History at some distance off, that so we may with better light comprehend the Causes, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal, and Occasions of this War.</p>
                     <p>The hatred and jealousies which the Ottoman Port hath always nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished and conserved against the Kingdom and Dominions of <hi>Poland,</hi> are ancient and inveterate, having their rise from the valiant opposition and successful repulses it always made against the various attempts of the Turks; whereby the Poles were animated to treat always at equals with <note place="margin">The Causes of the War with <hi>Poland.</hi>
                        </note> them, and with terms agreeable to that vain glory and swelling pride, which are natural to their Nation. But that which renewed the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:98602:202"/>
of past actions, and raised an expectation in the Turks to avenge the injuries by subjugating the Cosacks, was one <hi>Bogdan Chimilniczki</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Cosacks, who growing powerful in that Country, with the strength of a numerous Army, abhorring the Pride of the Polish Nobility, denied obedience to their Kingdom, resolving to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the absolute Prince of that Province, from whence various fortunes of War succeeding, he was at length forced to join himself to the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, and crave the protection of the Turkish Armes. In the mean time, <hi>Poland,</hi> invaded by the Swedes, Moscovites, and Transilvanians, was dismembred of <hi>Livonia,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Lituania</hi> and <hi>Verania,</hi> the first possessed by the Swedes, and the latter by the Czar of <hi>Moscovy,</hi> and the Rebel Cosacks; which confusions rejoiced the Turks, and gave them the first hopes, not only to free themselves from the frequent Piracies the Cosacks committed on them in the Black Sea, but to impose upon them the Ottoman Yoke; to which end they maintained a secret correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the Generals of that people, promising them the assistance of Men, Money, and Armes, but yet with that caution, that they would not seem unprovoked to quarrel with the Poles, or without just cause to violate the peace of <hi>Choccin,</hi> to which they pretended a most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and reverend regard.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, that they might not appear causeless Actors against that solemn League, they secretly encouraged those Incursions, which in the Years 1666 and 1667 we have already mentioned to have been made by the Tartars into <hi>Poland,</hi> as far as the Walls of <hi>Leopolis;</hi> which action, that the Tartars might not have occasion to abett and maintain, the Poles resolved to send a most splendid Embassy to the Turks, desiring that the Tartar <hi>Han</hi> might be deposed, for having unjustly violated the sacred peace of <hi>Choccin.</hi> For that as the Poles were obliged to restrain the Piracies and Depredations of the Cosacks in the Black Sea, so the Turks were become security against the incursions of the Tartars. Scarce had the Ambassadour <hi>Radiowski</hi> delivered this message, before he unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily died at <hi>Adrianople</hi> (as we have before signified;) to whose Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint and Demand, after many delays, no other answer was given, than that the Poles should sirst break their League which they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with <hi>Moscovy</hi> for thirteen years, without the consent, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the pleasure of the Port, and then after that they might expect and promise themselves all due satisfaction.</p>
                     <p>In this manner Affairs stood when King <hi>Casimir,</hi> weary of the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Discords of the Nobility, resigned up his Crown to retire unto a private life. And now it being necessary to proceed to a new Election we may consequently expect various Commotions and Disturbances in this State, sufficient to attract the eyes of the Turks, and encourage the Cosacks in their intended Revolt. At length Prince <hi>Michael Korebut Wisnowieski</hi> being elected King, it seemed agreeable to reason, that all <hi>Verania</hi> should have returned to obedience of him, to whom the best part of that Country did by right of patrimony, and natural inheritance belong; but the success thereof fell out contrary to all expectation, for <hi>Dorosensko,</hi> then General, designing to usurp that Government, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the project of uniting <hi>Verania</hi> to the Body of <hi>Poland,</hi> as a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Crown, by which means that Province would not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come free from its Vassalage to the Nobility, but obtain equal suffrages in the Diet, with all the other more free and priviledged Countries;
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:98602:203"/>
and in this manner he might not only compel <hi>Poland</hi> to condescend to his designs, but confirm himself in the absolute and supreme Authority of the Cosacks: This proposition therefore seemed so insolent, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring of Rebellion to the Polish Court, that a severe and menacing Message was dispatched to <hi>Dorosensko,</hi> threatning to take from him his Bulaua, or Truncheon of General, if ever he entertained any such ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination so highly derogatory to the Majesty of the Polish State; he therefore thought it his time to cast himself wholly into the protection of the Sultan, and accordingly dispatched Ambassadours to the Port to signifie their submission, begging to be received into the Arms of the Ottoman Power; and as an assurance thereof, that he might receive the (Tough) which is the Ensign of Authority, carried by Pashaws. The Vizier at the first motion hereof, reflecting on the evil consequences, in case the Grand Signior's honour should be foiled in this action, suspended a while a compleat answer thereunto; but at length being instantly solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, and perceiving the Disorders and Factions of <hi>Poland</hi> to encrease, the Cosacks were received for Subjects of the Empire, and obliged to wage War against all Enemies to the Ottoman Power.</p>
                     <p>Duke <hi>Michael</hi> being elected King, the first Act he performed was to send an Ambassadour extraordinary to the Grand Signior, with no other Design than to acquaint him of his Election to the Crown, only in case an opportunity presented, then to move for a ratification of the Articles concluded at <hi>Choccin.</hi> This Ambassadour, called <hi>Wisozki,</hi> being of a haughty and proud spirit, became the Authour of all the mischief which ensued; for being of a temper which could not equally bear the honour of his important Office, lanched out into matters beyond his Commission, and instead of imparting his Message, would become sole Arbitrator of all the differences between those two powerful Princes; for he being unacquainted with the Power or Affairs of the Turks, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed nothing in this World comparable to the number, richess, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of his own Nation, and therefore gave himself that liberty of arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Language, that by way of Command and Menaces he rather seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to act the part of a Governour or Umpire in the differences of State, than of an Oratour or Suppliant for peace. In his conceit the Turks wanted both courage and power to invade <hi>Poland,</hi> and therefore sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed he might safely brave them into a ratification of former Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, especially when he mentioned a hundred thousand Horse, which he undertook before the Vizier to be able on his own account to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct as far as the Walls of <hi>Adrianople.</hi> It was a strange humour of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domontado</hi> that inspired these two last Ambassadours, and if from them we may take a pattern of the disposition of the rest of the Polish Nobility, it will be no wonder to hear and read the Distractions that are amongst them, that they carry themselves with disrespect to their Prince, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulous and factious amongst themselves, and that their pride and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which have flattered their humour, and triumphed amidst their Tenants and Vassals, should betray them to all those evils which we may fear may be the consequences thereof.</p>
                     <p>The Great Vizier, considering the confidence which this person used in his Discourse, imagined that the differences in his Country might be composed, and therefore in compliance with his desire, offered in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral terms to confirm the peace made at <hi>Choccin,</hi> without Addition of any new Article in reference to the Cosacks, being a business of that nature
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:98602:203"/>
which admitted of no present determination; this, he said, was his ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate resolution, which if the Ambassadour approved not, he might then advise it home, and expect a farther result of their Counsels. <hi>Wisozki</hi> being really possessed in his fancy of the Turks weakness, gave way to his passion, and with little judgment replied, That he approved not of the Proposition, nor needed he to transmit any such advice into <hi>Poland,</hi> he himself being a Plenipotentiary of as full a Power as the King and Council; for being a Nobleman, he was by consequence that necessary Member of the Republick, that nothing could pass without his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage.</p>
                     <p>The Vizier amazed at this extravagant way of discourse, the which he supported with moderation and contempt, dispatched away a Chiaus into <hi>Poland</hi> with Letters, desiring that this Ambassadour should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, as being a Person unable to manage matters of the least concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and if they supplied his place with another, he should be received with due respect, and a plain way laid open to conclude his Negotiations to the satisfaction of both Parties.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Wisozki</hi> abounding in his own sense and humor, represented matters in a far different manner into <hi>Poland,</hi> alledging, That the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions was impeached by the violence offered to his Person, being impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned, and the usual Tain or Allowance of Ambassadours withheld from him; both which were not absolutely true: for the maintenance he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused as too mean for his Quality and Office; and for his Imprisonment, it was no other than a Confinement to the City of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> with a prohibition only from passing over unto <hi>Pera,</hi> where formerly in a house he had taken, he committed a thousand irregularities and disorders, which caused the Vizier to recal him again over to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the liberty of passing more to the other side. These were the injuries which he complained of into <hi>Poland,</hi> still fancying, That if the Nobility were assembled to consider of these matters, the Turk would be so afsrighted at it as to condescend unto any terms he should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound. These reports of <hi>Wisozki</hi> took that impression with the Court, that esteeming all authentick which he said or wrote, without farther examination issued out Orders for a general Insurrection, and that all people should prepare for the War, rendring the Vizier no other answer, than that when their Ambassadour was set at liberty, and had licence to depart, the like should be permitted unto theirs, and in the mean time the Chiaus was committed to safe custody. The Grand Signior highly angred at this obstinate misunderstanding, immediately ordered that <hi>Wisozki</hi> should depart, and at the same time commanded his whole Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia to rise and follow him to the War; and so much the rather was he animated by the reports sent him from <hi>Dorosenzko,</hi> seconded by the Vay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vods of <hi>Moldavia</hi> and <hi>Valachia,</hi> whose Letters declared the miserable confusions in <hi>Poland,</hi> divided into divers Factions and Parties, their want of money, and the mutiny of the Souldiery inclined rather to betray than defend <hi>Verania.</hi> And now a Sword and other Presents usual in these cases, being sent to the Tartar <hi>Han,</hi> he was ordered to unite with the Cossacks, and to invade <hi>Poland,</hi> where being encountred near <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towa,</hi> by a Body of Horse under the Command of <hi>Luzecki</hi> Governour of <hi>Podolia,</hi> the Poles were defeated, and was the first bad Omen of the ill success of this unhappy War.</p>
                     <p>To second these beginnings, the Grand Signior having raised an Army
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:98602:204"/>
of an hundred and fifty thousand men, marched towards <hi>Poland</hi> already sick and languishing with its own intestine distempers, and unable to contend with a Body united within it self, wanting neither internal vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, nor nourishment to maintain its strength; the first Enterprise was the impregnable Fortress of <hi>Caminiecz,</hi> which had often in former times baffled the Ottoman Arms; but now being ill provided, destitute of Arms, Ammunition, Provisions, and but weakly manned, and what was worst, despairing of any Relief, after eleven days Siege surrendered it self to the pleasure of the Conquerour. Hence the Turks had an open passage through all <hi>Podolia</hi> and <hi>Volhinia</hi> to the very Walls of <hi>Leopolis,</hi> which they passed over like Travellers rather than Enemies, there not appearing one person in Arms to oppose them, delighting and sporting themselves in these most fruitful and delicious Countries of <hi>Europe:</hi> thus had private animosities and civil rancour possessed the minds of the Poles one against the other, that they had rather yield themselves to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude of an Enemy, than condescend to the humor or counsel of a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen. Thus had the Turks passed all this Summer in the Plains and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Poland,</hi> where it seemed rather Peace than War, all places sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting without difficulty unto the Grand Signior as to their true and natural Lord and Soveraign, by which means the Inhabitants redeemed their Lives and Estates; for the Sultan willing to demonstrate his cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, and to spare those who voluntarily yielded, and encourage others to submit to so gentle a yoke, forbad all the common outrages of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, not permitting Plunder or Booty to be brought into the Camp; nor greater Spoils to be committed, than if his Army had passed through his own Dominions; whether this obliging or winning manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings overcame the stout hearts of the Polanders more than blows, will be experienced in the sequel of this story; it is certain the Militia returned home poor and weary, and more broken by this years Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than by the long and tedious March to <hi>Persia,</hi> and hazardous Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles during the Siege of <hi>Babylon;</hi> but the Sultan was desirous to return home, and give this first proof and testimony to the World of his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and invincible Spirit, of his clemency and of his success in Arms, that at his first appearing in the Field, all Armies and Fortresses submitted to his Power. The Poles on the other side being of an opinion and temper far different to that of their Ambassadour <hi>Wisozki,</hi> resolved to purchase the departure of their new Guests on any terms; so that these following Articles were agreed and concluded.</p>
                     <p>That the King of <hi>Poland</hi> should quit all Claim to <hi>Ukrain, Podolia,</hi> and <hi>Rusland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That for <hi>Leopolis</hi> and the Country thereabouts should be paid a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of seventy thousand Dollars a year; all other Capitulations for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly made were to stand in force and virtue.</p>
                     <p>These Articles being signed, the Grand Signior committed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Verania</hi> and <hi>Podolia</hi> to <hi>Dorosenzko,</hi> and the defence of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniecz</hi> to <hi>Chusaein</hi> Pasha with a Garrison of twelve thousand Janisaries; so that now being returned home, the Militia was permitted to repair to their several Countries and Dwellings, the following year being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to the repose and ease of the Souldiery.</p>
                     <p>Towards the end of this Year, when the Ships of <hi>Barbary</hi> returned home, those of <hi>Tripoli</hi> conceived a certain discontent against their Pasha named <hi>Osman</hi> for his covetous behaviour towards his Souldiers; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:98602:204"/>
that Summer taken very rich Prizes from the Venetians and other Nations, the Souldiers expected at their return home to receive a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their Spoils according to their just and equal shares. But the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sha grown old and covetous, getting the whole into his hands, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated the greatest part to his own Coffers, distributing to the Souldiers an inconsiderable proportion of what they had gained the year before. Hereupon the chiefest Commanders amongst them becoming greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged began to incense the Souldiery, which for interest or want of Pay, being always ready to mutiny, took fire immediately, and easily were blown into a Rebellion; so that first making Parties, and retiring into secret Junto's and Councils, they resolved to destroy the Pasha, and alter the Government, and thereby make themselves Masters of all the Treasure and Richess which <hi>Osman</hi> Pasha had in the space of thirty years amassed together. The Pasha having notice of all that passed, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the Conspiracies of this unbridled People to be dangerous, began to provide for his safety, and getting together so many as he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of his Party, and that were, or might be faithful to him, which joyned with his Slaves and Servants, made up a small Garrison, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to defend and preserve himself within his Castle, which being well provided of Ammunition and Victuals, he shut his Gates, denying access or admittance unto all persons upon any pretence and account whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. Hereupon the Mutiny appearing, the Souldiery drew into a Body in the open field, against whom several shot were made from the Castle; so that now the Civil War was begun, and the whole Force of <hi>Tripoli</hi> raised against the Pasha and his Castle, which being straitly besieged, the Defendants who were for the most part Servants and Slaves, failing in their courage, resolved to make Conditions for themselves to the best advantage; wherefore conspiring against their Master, entred his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and strangled him in the night; and the next morning opening the Castle-gates, received the Enemy within the Walls, making manifest the death of their Master and their own Treachery. <hi>Osman</hi> Pasha being dead, every one acted for a time what the wildness of an unruly multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude could suggest, till such time as the Heads of the Rebellion could frame themselves into some form of Government, which for the present was resolved to be by a <hi>Dei,</hi> as most convenient for commanding of the Souldiery, intending for the future to take the <hi>Algier</hi> Government by a Divan for their Pattern and Model of Rule, under which the people of that place had found and experienced the sweetness of liberty, richess, and success. These matters being agreed upon, some of their Men of War were sent to give advice unto the Grand Signior of the revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their City, supplicating him to pardon the violence used against their Pasha <hi>Osman,</hi> whose Covetousness and Tyranny forced them for self-preservation to precipitate that Authority, which they knew on their complaints, his Majesty would have granted them; and that he would be pleased to receive them into his protection and favour, as his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and humble Subjects and Slaves, and as an evidence thereof would grant them a Pasha confirmed by his Royal Signature. The Sultan, though at first shewed himself much displeased with this manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding against <hi>Osman</hi> Pasha; yet seeing that there was no remedy, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himself to be mollified by their Presents and submission, granting them a Pasha for their Governour, whose power proved as unsignificant as his doth, who bears that Title at <hi>Algier.</hi> Matters being thus redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

to some tolerable condition amongst them, they concluded, That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1673"/> the most beneficial course of life to render them considerable, as well as to amuse and divert the minds of their rude people from innovations against their Governours, was to grant free liberty to whomsoever plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to arm out Ships of War; which Priviledge <hi>Osman</hi> Pasha reserved to himself and his Confidents; and finding at present that they were able to set out six Sail from forty to fifty Guns, and four more from twelve to thirty, intending to accomplish in all the full number of fifteen Sail; those who traded in the Levant Seas began to apprehend, that this faithless and heady people would at a time, when they found their advantage and the temptation of a rich Prize, break their Peace with his Majesty our King, the which <hi>Osman</hi> Pasha had notwithstanding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for several years without violation, moved perhaps thereunto out of an apprehension, that in such troubles which a War with <hi>England</hi> might bring upon them, he might lose or impair his richess, and bring the like confusion on his people, as he had lately heard of in <hi>Algier</hi> on the like occasion: but how and in what manner these matters succeeded, and how at length this people broke their Peace and Faith, we reserve to be recounted at the end of the Year 1674.</p>

                     <p>BUT it seems the Turks had made too much haste in their return to digest a Conquest of so large Extent; so that they were scarce well warmed by their Winter-fires, before they were alarmed again with Jealousies of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the Seditions amongst the Cossacks, whom <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosenzko</hi> wrote he could not keep in subjection, unless he had some Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours sent him from the Port. The rumors likewise that the Muscovite armed, and was resolved to assist the Poles in recovery of their lost Country, increased the apprehensions of the Turks, who too late per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the errour they had committed in so soon disbanding their Army, which before some were scarce got home, they were forced to recal. But now the year was well begun, and no grand preparations made; so that it was impossible to collect an Army in so short a time considerable enough to be honoured with the Conduct of the Sultan; wherefore it was resolved, that all things this year should be disposed in a readiness against the next. But the Grand Signior had a project of his own to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part speedily with his Court, and to pass the heats of the Summer in the Mountains of <hi>Zegna</hi> about five or six days Journey on his way towards <hi>Poland,</hi> which being reported to be a place well planted with Trees, watered with cool and fresh Springs, and abounding with all sorts of Game, made him impatient to take up his Summer-quarters in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try so agreeable to his humor; and that he might cover the design of pleasure with that of profit and policy, he pretended that the report of his proceeding so far would both hasten the Army, and give a terrour to the Enemy. But the Great Vizier and his Council who weighed all
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:98602:205"/>
things better, were of another opinion, judging it neither honourable for the Court to be retired into Woods and Mountains, nor the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of such a surmise able to countervail the expences and inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of that Journey; and therefore it was concluded to stand unto the first resolution, That the Grand Signior with the main Body of his Army should not move until the following year, but that in this interim all preparations should be made for Provisions and Ammunition, in order unto which three thousand Janisaries were already sent away to <hi>Kemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niecz</hi> under the Command of the <hi>Sampsongibashee,</hi> and six thousand more under the <hi>Zagargibashee</hi> were to be landed on that <hi>Isthmus,</hi> which joyns the <hi>Crim</hi> Tartar unto the Main, from whence they had a short March to the assistance of <hi>Dorosenzko. Chasaein</hi> Pasha lately come from <hi>Damascus,</hi> was nominated for General to be sent into <hi>Silistria,</hi> and there to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in Chief over the Militia of <hi>Dobriza, Bosna,</hi> and <hi>Runtelia</hi> in case of any alteration and disturbance in <hi>Poland:</hi> this Person was always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a stout and valiant Souldier, though seldom fortunate, and was the same that lost the Battel before <hi>Lewa</hi> in the last German Wars, as we have before intimated: he was about this time grown infirm by a hepatical Dysentery, which reduced him to a weak condition of body, with little hopes of recovery.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time arrived at <hi>Adrianople</hi> an Ambassadour from the great Czar of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> bringing Letters dated in <hi>April</hi> of the preceding <note place="margin">The unseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Address of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour.</note> year, which was before the time that the Turks had entred <hi>Poland,</hi> the contents of which were, That the Grand Signior would do well to desist from his design against that Country; for that if he did proceed and invade those Dominions, he should find himself obliged to make War upon him, and with his mighty and puissant Power to drive him back to his own Jurisdiction. This Message appeared very unseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and caused much laughter at first; for that the Turk had since the Date of that Letter invaded <hi>Poland,</hi> and possessed himself of vast Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and yet neither encountred any opposition from the Muscovite, nor so much as heard any rumor of his Motion. Wherefore the Turks with scorn forbad the Ambassadour any farther Addresses, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to be gone speedily, saying, That his Master had neither courage nor force to maintain his word of War, nor wisdom to manage a Treaty of Peace.</p>
                     <p>The Reports now from the parts of <hi>Poland</hi> spake matters to be in a quiet posture, and not likely to concern the Turks much for this year; wherefore the Grand Signior began again to renew his purposes of pastime and pleasure in the Mountains of <hi>Zegna;</hi> but because no true or perfect account could be given of the delights, refreshments, and situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that place, the <hi>Olack Celebi</hi> or chief Postmaster was sent to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the Country, and to return with a relation of all matters: but in the interim the design was altered; for the Grand Signior having begun a Fabrick in which he had expended about eighty thousand Dollars, at a small Village about nine or ten miles from <hi>Adrianople;</hi> the place and novelty of the Building so well pleased him, that he sound in himself an inclination to pass the whole Summer there; and becoming likewise en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured of a young Lady in his Seraglio, notwithstanding his former tenderness to his Queen, and late aversion to all other Women, he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it was possible to divertise his time well in those parts, and more to his contentment, than in wild woods and uninhabited mountains. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:98602:206"/>
the intentions of <hi>Zegna</hi> were laid aside, and nothing thought of but the rest and quietness of the Court for this year.</p>
                     <p>But because it was reported, That the Czar of <hi>Muscovy</hi> made great Preparations for War, it was judged necessary to command the <hi>Crim</hi> Tartar to be watchful of his motion by Land, though the natural sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of that people gave them no apprehension of their Arms for this year: howsoever it being probable, that they might prove more active and forward in the Black Sea, than they were capable to do by Land, by sending forth their small Boats down the <hi>Volga</hi> to take and pillage the Saiks and Vessels belonging to <hi>Constantinople</hi> and other parts; the Captain-Pasha was ordered to pass into that Sea with thirty five or forty Sail of Gallies for defence of the Coast, and for fortifying and repairing <hi>Asac,</hi> and the Fortresses thereabouts: but whilst these Preparations were making for the Euxine or Black Sea, the other Seas were neglected and undefended; for the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Fleet consisting in all of eight Sail, were <note place="margin">The <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Fleet ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Malteses.</note> encountred not far from <hi>Rhodes</hi> by some Maltese and Ligornese Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saires: the Ships of the Turks were most of them very great and potent Ships, one of them was at least fifteen hundred Tuns, and was capable to carry an hundred Guns, the others, of eight hundred or a thousand Tuns, able to have resisted and overcome, had they been well armed, double the force that assaulted them; but being now engaged with an Enemy, though not so strong, yet better experienced in marine Affairs than themselves, they fought with them stoutly the first day; but the next day six Gallies coming to the Christians assistance, (which had been harboured in some Port not far distant, and led thither by the noise of the Cannon, to which also a calm giving the greater advantage) the Turks began to faint in their courage, so that four Gallions and two Saiks yielded to mercy, which was a Prize of so great value, that it was supposed never to have been equalled since the time of Sultan <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> when the loss of the grand Sultana and other Ships gave the first occasion of War with <hi>Venice.</hi> This great Ship which was reported by those who saw her to be both longer and broader than the Soveraign, carried only sixty Guns, and was manned accordingly only with about an hundred Seamen, and about two hundred more which were Land-men, wholly unacquainted with the Sea or with Naval Fights: the biggest Ship a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rest was belonging to the Queen-Mother, and the others to the Grand Signior, being freighted principally with Sugar, Coffee, Rice, and other Provisions for the proper maintenance of their Courts, which we may suppose will highly inflame these grand Personages with anger and disdain, when they reflect on their own proper losses which touch them so nearly as their peculiar Goods and the Furniture of their Kitchins.</p>
                     <p>The Turkish Court now angered with this loss, was more moved in the midst of <hi>May,</hi> when a Messenger from <hi>Poland</hi> arrived with Letters from the Grand Chancellour, declaring with modest terms, That their Kingdom was unable or unwilling for many respects to pay the promised <note place="margin">The Poles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to pay their promised Tribute.</note> Tribute; so that if they did not judge sit to wave or lay aside those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions, they should be forced to take up Arms in defence of their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Safety, and Priviledge of their Dominions. The Turks surprised with this unexpected Message, too late perceived the errour of the last years proceedings, which were carried on with a clemency and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence not agreeable to the disposition and humor of such an Enemy, as is
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:98602:206"/>
unacquainted with servitude, and so far from being able to fupport a Foreign Yoke, that they cannot endure subjection to their own Civil Government, every Nobleman (of which there are many in <hi>Poland</hi>) being ambitious to be a Prince, judges himself better than his elected King. Hence proceeded all those dissentions which laid them open to the late invasion of their powerful Enemy, the apprehension of whom ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obducted for a while those sores of Faction which festered amongst them, and that principle of self-conservation, which by a forcible nature inclined them to Union, at length armed them with a resolution to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the Liberties of their Country, and assured them of the Truth of that Saying, That <hi>a Kingdom divided against it self cannot stand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Turks now wished that they had either made a true use of their Victory, and the opportune Conjuncture of the last years Affairs to have setled and secured their Conquests, or that they had never begun the War; for now finding themselves engaged in it, they were in honour ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to proceed, and lose the fair opportunity which presented to make their advantage in <hi>Hungary;</hi> to which place they had been, and were still <note place="margin">The Rebels in <hi>Hungary</hi> renew their Petition to the Turks for assistance.</note> invited by the Rebels of that Country, who to revenge the Cause of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini, Nadasti,</hi> and some other Discontents and Aggrievances of which they complained, and to defend the Protestant Religion; in which by the zeal of some Churchmen, they were disturbed, resolved to abandon their Allegiance to their natural Prince, and rather seek a protection for their Estates, and allowance for their Religion under the Turk, than remain beholding for either to a prevailing party at the Imperial Court. The chief Authours of this Rebellion were <hi>Petrozy, Sepesi, Tende, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, Sutrey,</hi> and other principal persons amongst the Hungarians, who having on their own strength opposed themselves against the Emperour the last year were defeated in divers engagements, and at length redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to a very low and miserable condition. Wherefore they renew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain their Petitions and Presents to the Sultan, sent by their Agents about the beginning of this Month of <hi>April,</hi> begging his assistance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, representing the easiness of the Conquest, and how large a Gate they were able to open to his Armies, and make a plain way for him into the most fertile and opulent Countries of the World, of which he seemed already half possessed by reason of those Discontents and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that were amongst them.</p>
                     <p>The Turks though well satissied of the reasonableness of the design, yet being engaged in honour against <hi>Poland,</hi> knew not how to retract, and therefore dispatched away the Messengers for the present with fair hopes and secret promises, well treated in private, though they received rather a Denial than Encouragement in publick. For the expedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Poland</hi> was that which employed solely the wisest heads of the Empire, who as it were in fury issued out immediate Orders, That all those who eat the Grand Signior's Bread, should without farther delay <note place="margin">The rage of the Turks against <hi>Poland.</hi>
                        </note> prepare themselves for the Wars against <hi>Poland;</hi> and that Provisions and Ammunition should be supplyed in all places according to the usual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions; The Tugh, or Horse-Tail, (the Signal for departure) was set forth, the Tents ordered to be carried into the Field, and such haste made in all parts, as if the raising of an Army were the business but of one day; resolving immediately to proceed against their Enemies, to whom the Sultan returned a most dreadful and menacing Letter, full of expressions agreeable to the Turkish Style, which threatned Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb facs="tcp:98602:207"/>
 Sword, Famine, Fire, Destruction, and a thousand other more direful Judgments: but the Collection of this great Army, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages belonging thereunto, were not so suddenly provided as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of such a dispatch as the Sultan's fury pretended; wherefore in cooler blood it was concluded, That for this Summer they should not pass much beyond the other side of the <hi>Danube,</hi> that the Winter Quarters should be designed in <hi>Silistria,</hi> from whence they might more effectually threaten and affright their Enemies with their near approach.</p>
                     <p>About this time the French found an opportune season to accommodate all their Affairs with the Port, and to put a period to the several Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and particulars they had for many years demanded. For now the French King not only appeared very formidable by reason of his success against <hi>Holland,</hi> but likewise instrumental to promote the designs of the Port, whilst he kept the Brandenburghers employed, and diverted the whole Armies of the Empire; and now also that they might engage him not to contribute assistance to the Poles, they judged it reasonable policy to evidence to that Ambassadour more external demonstrations of kindness, and strain their courtesie beyond the terms which they could cordially, and in reality afford them. Wherefore, at length the Capitulations were renewed, and some Articles and Priviledges superad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which are these that follow.</p>
                     <p>First, That all religious Persons and Bishops of the French Church shall remain and continue quiet and unmolested in their respective ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations and dwellings, with liberty to perform all their Ecclesiastical Rites and Ceremonies.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That the religious of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and of <hi>Bethlem</hi> shall conserve those religious places which they have anciently possessed, and there may continue to celebrate their Worship of God, and all their Devotions, without any disturbance.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That if these Religious of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> or <hi>Bethlem</hi> have any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference or dispute with the Officers thereof, it shall be remitted to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision of the Port.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, All Frenchmen, and all under their Banner, shall safely at all times go to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and return without molestation.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The two Churches in <hi>Galata</hi> belonging to the Jesuits and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchins, and anciently possessed by them, are now again confirmed by these Presents; one of which belonging to the Capuchins having been burnt, free liberty is given for the rebuilding thereof, and to remain as formerly in the hands of the French; and in the Hospital in <hi>Galata,</hi> if they will read the Gospel after their fashion, none shall give them distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance or hinder them.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Whereas the French Nation formerly paid 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Custom, now in regard they have been ancient friends to the Port, and that they have renewed their Capitulations, they shall pay no more than 3 <hi>per Cent.</hi> and accordingly let no more be demanded.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, All Portugueses, Sicilians, Catelans, Messineses of <hi>Ancona, &amp;c.</hi> that have no Ambassadours at the Port, if they come under the French Banner, shall pay no more than 3 <hi>per Cent.</hi> according as the French pay.</p>
                     <p>Eightly, In payment of their Customs, they shall pay the Currant Money such as passes in our Treasury, and the Farmers of the Customs shall not refuse the same.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="307" facs="tcp:98602:207"/>
Ninthly, The Mesteria they shall pay according to what the English Merchants pay, and no more.</p>
                     <p>Tenthly, All the Merchandise they bring, or shall bring, shall be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued according to the present estimation, and no more pretended of them, and if the Customers will notwithstanding raise the esteem of the Goods above the value, then if the Merchant will pay his Custom in <hi>specie,</hi> it shall not be refused.</p>
                     <p>Eleventhly, The Custom of Silk being paid — a new Custom ought not to be demanded.</p>
                     <p>Twelfthly, The Custom being once paid, the Customer shall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to give his Teschare, and the Merchant being willing to transport his Goods to another Scale, another Custom shall not be demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>Thirteenthly, The Officers and Customers at <hi>Sidon, Birut, Aleppo,</hi> or <hi>Cairo</hi> shall not compel the Merchants to take Goods by Force, not under any pretence whatsoever take one Asper from them, nor demand mony to be lent unto them.</p>
                     <p>Fourteenthly, The French Vessels may bring Goods from the <hi>Indies,</hi> by way of the Red Sea, unto the Port <hi>Suucis,</hi> and having paid their Custom once there, whatsoever Goods they cannot sell in that Country, they may have liberty to transport over land to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lade them again on their own Vessels without paying another Custom, or receiving molestation from any person. Howsoever, this Capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to be understood with this condition, that this point shall be sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified to the chief Officers of <hi>Cairo,</hi> who having called a Council of the most knowing and experienced persons to consider hereof, and they concluding that this point is in no wife prejudicial to that Countrey, nor to the interest of the Believers, then this Article to be of force, but if they advise the contrary, then this to be of no effect.</p>
                     <p>Fifteenthly, If the Fryars, or Merchants, or Druggermen will make Wine, and transport it abroad, none shall hinder them.</p>
                     <p>Sixteenthly, The French Consuls, and all under their Banner, having a difference with any of, or above, four thousand Aspers, it shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided at our publick Divan.</p>
                     <p>Seventeenthly, If any man-slaughter shall happen in the street where French dwell, they shall not be liable to pay the price of the Bloud, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be proved before the Justice that a Frenchman was guilty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                     <p>Eighteenthly, The Druggermen in service of the French Nation shall enjoy the same priviledges, as before specified.</p>
                     <p>Nor was the French interest only available at that time to obtain the foregoing Articles, and renew their Capitulations with such Additions; but likewise to procure Licence for the Ambassadour to travel into the <note place="margin">The French Ambassadour obtains licence to travel.</note> remotest parts of the Ottoman Dominions; for though it were a thing never practised before, and denied (as is well known) to other Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Ambassadours; yet it was granted to Monsieur <hi>de Nointel</hi> with so much freedom, that first in a Brigantine he went to <hi>Scio,</hi> thence visited the chief Isles of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> thence crossed to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to <hi>Satalia, Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> so much confidence had the Turks, contrary to their custom, in this Ambassadour: for as they stile all Representatives from Foreign Princes their pawns or pledges of Peace, so had not the Turks in that conjuncture thought the interest of <hi>France</hi>
                        <pb n="308" facs="tcp:98602:208"/>
worth the obliging, they would never have deviated from their ancient Custom, and given an example for other Ministers to demand a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the like nature.</p>
                     <p>But to return again to the designs against <hi>Poland,</hi> the Sultan about <note place="margin">The Turks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve on a war against <hi>Poland.</hi>
                        </note> the end of <hi>July</hi> marched with such Forces as were then in a readiness towards the Confines of the Country; and though he had not with him above fifteen thousand men, yet it was concluded that the Fame and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Grand Signior's motion would either abate and bring low the spirits of the Poles, and induce them to dispatch an Ambassadour with terms of Peace, or at least this readiness of the Turkish Camp would be an early preparation for the designs of the next year, and put the whole Empire into a timely motion, and that uniting with the Forces of the Frontiers, they might make a Body sufficient to resist any sudden Incursion. This resolution being taken, the Great Vizier led the Van, and encamped on the Banks of the <hi>Danube</hi> near a place called <hi>Isacgee,</hi> where he with all diligence built a Bridg of Boats to pass his Forces with the greatest facility to the other side, on which lies the Country of <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davia.</hi> The Sultan about a days journey short of the Vizier, fixed his Court and Camp at a place called <hi>Babadog;</hi> with intention after some days to cross the River, and proceed as far as <hi>Kemenitz,</hi> that by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of his powerful Presence he might encourage his Army there, and provide all things necessary for security of that Garrison. But in the mean time advices coming that the Polish Army, consisting of about twenty thousand men, was roving about the Confines of <hi>Leopolis,</hi> under the Command of General <hi>Sobieski,</hi> and that a reconciliation was passed between the King and him; and that <hi>Zircha,</hi> Commander of the Cosacks, joined to considerable forces of the Moscovite and Calmuck Tartars, had made incursions into the parts about <hi>Osac,</hi> caused the Sultan to desist from his designed progress to <hi>Kemenitz,</hi> and to pass no farther than over the River into <hi>Moldavia</hi> for hunting or other pastimes. By these matters the Turks being fully convinced, that the Poles resolved not to pay their promised tribute, nor to send an Ambassadour with propositions, which were condescending or supplicating for Peace; the Sultan himself di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatched away an Aga with Letters into <hi>Poland</hi> full of threats, menaces, and protestations of bringing all that ruine, misery, and destruction on their Country, which always attends the most cruel and bloudy War, if they did not retrieve their errour by a speedy submission and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with those Articles which were the last year accorded. And this was the last motion the Turks made towards a Peace, which they were desirous to embrace on any terms honourable, that so they might have opportunity to divert their Arms to the more mild Climates of <hi>Hungary,</hi> where, besides the entertainment they expected to receive from friends, who invited them, they should not be liable to half those inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Cold, Frosts, and Famine, as they were probable to meet in the parts of <hi>Poland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Poles were so much in earnest, and so little esteemed the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces of the Sultan, that they anticipated his threats by some acts of hostility, and showed that they so much scorned his anger that they were resolved to be the first Aggressours. For the great Mareschal <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bieski</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The Poles pass the <hi>Niester.</hi>
                        </note> with his Lieutenant General <hi>Wisnowitzki</hi> marched forward, and boldly passed the <hi>Niester</hi> with fifty thousand select Souldiers. The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Turkish Army, <hi>Chusaein</hi> Pasha, alarmed hereat, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately

issued sorth such Orders for preparing and sitting his Camp as were agreeable to a speedy Battel; and that he might understand the state of his Camp, he called the Prince or Vayvod of <hi>Moldavia</hi> to examine him concerning the state and condition of his Forces; the answer he gave proving not satisfactory to the expectation of the Turk, who was enraged at the approach of the Enemy, with high and proud words insulted over the Prince, giving him no better terms than Dog and Insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, and at length struck him over the head with his Pole-Axe; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding which, and the disgrace he put upon him, imprudently that night committed unto him, and to the Prince of <hi>Valachia,</hi> the care of the Guards, which consisted of three thousand Men. The Valachians <note place="margin">The Prince of <hi>Valachia</hi> carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his own Souldiers to the Poles.</note> as near Neighbours and Associates with the others, seemed at first more grievously to resent the affront, than did the Moldavians, and therefore that Night took their Prince by force and carried him to the Polish Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. The Prince, that he might make a Vertue of Necessity, complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of no force or violence offered unto him by his Souldiers, but as if he had voluntarily revolted, showed outwardly a fair and serene coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance towards the Poles, until such time as with forty of his Men, he found an opportunity to escape; but being by next morning at break of day overtaken by five Troops of Polonian Horse, his whole Retinue was slain by them, excepting five of his men, who with himself, saved themselves by the swiftness of their Horses; Howsoever, the Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a wound on his left hand with a Sword, with which presenting himself before the Great Vizier, and by that testimony boasting of his Faith and Loyalty to the Ottoman House, was conducted by him to the presence of the Sultan, who, in reward of his fidelity and valour, vested him with a rich Coftan, and restored him again to his Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with addition of three hundred Aspers a day pay. His Wife and Children which remained as Hostages at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> being upon the News of the Princes Revolt clapt into the seven Towers, were again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased, and conducted to their house with all imaginable honour and magnificence.</p>
                     <p>But the Moldavian Prince was more in earnest, and heartily disdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the affront offered him by <hi>Chusaein</hi> Pasha, towards whom, and the other Turks, though he carried a serene and calm countenance, yet he nourished a secret flame and storm within himself; to vent which, and revenge the affront, he maintained a correspondence with <hi>Sobieski,</hi> giving <note place="margin">The Prince of <hi>Moldavia</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volts.</note> him intelligence of all matters in the Turkish Camp, how he might most easily surprize the Forces of the Pasha of <hi>Sivas,</hi> and the four Generals of the Spahees of <hi>Alchabolick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Christians made use of this intelligence accordingly, by making their assault on the enemy on the weakest side, when the Prince ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reserved his anger until an opportune Season, turned his face a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Turks, and with a courage agreeable to his spirit and command, he entered the Tabor, or Intrenchment of <hi>Chusaein</hi> Pasha, and wounded him with his own hand. The heat of the Fight continued fourteen hours, in which none behaved himself more valiantly than did <hi>Solyman</hi> Pasha the Beglerbeg of <hi>Bosna,</hi> who though he was as brave, and fought as stoutly as any man could, having six Horses that day killed under him, <note place="margin">The Turks o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow.</note> he was at length forced to fly and abandon the field, following <hi>Chusaein</hi> Pasha, and the Pasha of <hi>Sivas</hi> and <hi>Ciddi-ogla,</hi> who made better use, in saving themselves, of their horses heels, than their own Armes; But in
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:98602:209"/>
this Flight his Horse pitching his foot into the hole of a wooden Bridg, which he was to pass, was there stopped until he was overtaken by a Souldier with a Hat, who shot him through the Body; so that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his flight more faintly than before, he was overtaken by a Polonian Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar, who with a Lance bore him to the Ground, where he was trod un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot, and cut in pieces by the Enemy: The other three Pashaws were wounded; the Generals of the Green and Yellow Sangiacks of the Spahees were taken Prisoners, and two other principal Commanders of the Spahees were killed. The Zagargeebashee, who commanded eighteen Chambers of Janisaries, was taken prisoner, the Standard of the Janisaries taken, and they wholly cut in pieces and destroyed, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of eight thousand five hundred men; all the Troops and Attendants of those Pashaws, with four Sangiacks of Spahees, were slain upon the place, which in all were computed to be about twenty five thousand men. The booty taken was very considerable, for besides the ordinary Baggage they took two thousand purses of money, then newly brought for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Souldiery, and twenty five thousand Waggons of Provisions and Ammunition.</p>
                     <p>After this success and important Victory the Poles became Masters of the strong Fortress of <hi>Chotin,</hi> and other smaller Palanchas, on the Banks of the <hi>Niester,</hi> making their Incursions into <hi>Moldavia,</hi> as far as <hi>Jash,</hi> which is the principal City of that Country. And thus far was <hi>Kaplan</hi> Pasha proceeded with the Recruits of about four thousand men, when the News came of the fatal Rout, and the fame thereof encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing by the fearful Relations of such as fled from the Battel, alarmed the Turks with such frightful apprehensions, that they retreated back again to the other side of the <hi>Danube,</hi> and united themselves to the Forces of the Vizier. But <hi>Chusaein</hi> Pasha, though he saved his life, yet could not <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Chusaein</hi> Pasha imprisoned.</note> conserve the Air of the Sultan's favour; for so soon as he arrived at the Court, he received an ill welcome; for according to the manner of Turks, who punish the ill success of a General equal to Crimes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he was immediately put into Chains, deprived of his estate and honours, and sent prisoner with the attendance only of two servants un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Castles of the <hi>Dardanelli,</hi> where the disturbance and unquietness of his mind reduced him to an insirmity of Body; so that being sick, and without Friends or Physicians, he sent to Sir <hi>John Finch,</hi> his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Ambassadour, as he passed up the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> to afford him the use and assistance of his Physician; but the Ambassadour excused himself, letting him know, that his Retinue being passed before on another Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, he was sorry it was not in his power to accommodate him in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he desired.</p>
                     <p>The Winter being now well entered, which is very wet and cold in those Countries, caused the Armies on both sides to draw into their warmer Quarters, there to meditate and contrive their designs for the more active season.

The Turk on the other side though full of revenge and anger for their last mifortune, yet patiently took this loss as the paring only of his Nails, that his Claws might grow

the longer, and was so rowsed with this blow, that he summoned all the Nations of his large Empire to come in to his assistance, towards which forty thousand Carts laden with Provisions were appointed to rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous on the Banks of the <hi>Danube</hi> towards the end of the month of <hi>March.</hi> Yet in the mean time the Turks not having patience to see their perfidious Prince avail himself of his Revolt, and in despight of the Ottoman Power to seat himself in his Principality of <hi>Jash,</hi> were resolved to drive him thence; and in order thereunto not expecting a milder sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, immediately dispeeded some Troops of Tartars, and two thousand Spahees under the Command of a new Prince, to drive him out of the Country. In the mean time the Poles, since their late Victory, kept the Fortress of <hi>Kemenitz</hi> straitly blocked up on all sides, and thereby reduced them to such a want of food and other provisions, as might probably cause them to surrender before the Summer could open a way to their relief.</p>
                     <p>But before I conclude this Year, I must not omit to acquaint the Reader, that in the month of <hi>September</hi> an English Factor at <hi>Smyrna</hi> descended of good Parents, and educated under a severe and religious Master, one who had a reasonable Estate of his own, and in good bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness and employment, did notwithstanding in the absence of his Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with whom he was joyned in Commission, carry out of the house 215; fine Cloths belonging to several Principals of <hi>England,</hi> with a considerable Sum of ready Money, Jewels, and things of value: of which having possessed himself, he went before the Kadi, and there in presence of divers Officers of the City turned Turk, hoping by the Priviledge of the Mahometan Law, whereby no Christian testimony can pass against a Turk, to appropriate unto himself that whole Estate, which he had thus treacherously got into his sole custody. And it being impossible for Turks to attest the Marks, Numbers, or know the Estates of Persons being in <hi>England,</hi> he judged himself out of the reach of any Power or Art to dispossess him of his unjust and wicked acquests. Howsoever the Consul did so closely pursue him both at <hi>Smyrna</hi> and at the Turkish Court, that in the space of seven months he regained all the Cloth, and the best part of the Money and Jewels out of his hands: and in fine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced this Renegado to so low a condition, that he humbly supplicated the Consul to contrive a way for his passage into <hi>England:</hi> at which time His Majesties Frigate the <hi>Centurion</hi> being then in Port, he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked thereupon, and so returned into his own Country.</p>
                     <p>The Particulars of all which having been amply related in Writing and Letters to private Friends, I purposely omit the same in this place, that so I might cast a veil over the nakedness and shame of our Nation in that City. Howsoever I judge it requisite to recount this Story in brief and in general heads, That men may know there is a God who rules above, who rejects impious and licentious persons, confounding the designs of those who betraying their Trust, deviate from the common Rules of Morality and Honesty.</p>

                        </gap> rejoycing the English Factory with the sight of their new Ambassadour, (that Office having been now void for the space of sixteen months) who was welcome also to people of the Country, judging him fortunate for arriving at the Feast of their great <hi>Biram:</hi> nor less pleasing was the News thereof to the Court, especially to the late Pasha of <hi>Tunis,</hi> whose Goods and Monies taken by one <hi>Dominico Franceschi,</hi> out of an English Ship called the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> in her passage from <hi>Tunis</hi> to <hi>Tripoli,</hi> this Ambassadour had recovered from <hi>Ligorne</hi> and <hi>Malta;</hi> which being an action without example, was greatly admired and applauded by the Turks, and esteemed an evident demonstration of that great Interest and Power which the Glory of our King hath acquired in Foreign parts, and of the singular dexterity of such a Minister. But to proceed to the Wars.</p>
                     <p>The Polanders being thus prosperous, made use of their success, and the sharp cold of the Winter-season to make their Incursions, and Winter-quarters through all the Principalities of <hi>Moldavia;</hi> for they being born in cold Countries, and accustomed to the Snows and Frosts, were more patient and enduring of extremity of weather than were the Turks, who were brought forth from more mild and moderate Climates: so that neither could the Poles be driven out from those Countries, nor <hi>Kemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitz</hi> be relieved by them, until such time, that the Sun getting high, and thawing the Snows, and warming the Earth, prepared a season fit for return of the Turks again into those Countries; who marching ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their custom with an Army composed of great multitudes, quickly compelled the Poles to retire. For the Grand Signior and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier having both seated their Winter-quarters on the Banks of the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube,</hi> were ready at the sirst opening of the Summer to enter their Arms into the Enemies Countries; and having called the Tartars to their assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, did according to the usual custom make Incursions for depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Slaves, Cattel, and whatsoever else was portable in a running March.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chan</hi> or King of this People was at that time greatly indisposed in his health, of which he advised the Great Vizier, as if he intended thereby to obtain a release from his personal attendance that year in the War: But the Vizier, who either supposed this excuse to be only a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, or that he had a kindness for his Person, immediately dispatched away his own Physician called Signior <hi>Massellini,</hi> an Italian born, a worthy Learned man, a good Christian, and my intimate Friend: with whom maintaining a constant correspondence by Letters, he wrote me, That from the Grand Signiors Quarters which were at <hi>Batadog</hi> near the <note place="margin">A Journy into <hi>Tartary.</hi>
                        </note> Banks of the <hi>Danube,</hi> he arrived after seventeen days Journey in <hi>Chrim,</hi> where (he said) he was received with singular honour and kindness by the Great <hi>Chan,</hi> whom he found to be a Prince of admirable prudence, gentleness, and generosity, but greatly afflicted with a Hypochondriacal Melancholy; which being an infirmity of some years standing, was with the more difficulty removed; howsoever he was so far from being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable to follow his Army, that he advised him to divert his mind with the thoughts of War: which counsel having taken, after thirty days abode in the Camp, he found himself much more chearful than before, and greatly relieved of that pressure of Melancholy and caligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Vapours which offended his Brain. <q>We are now (said he) at <hi>Ussia</hi>
                           <pb n="313" facs="tcp:98602:210"/>
at the Mouth of the <hi>Boristhenes,</hi> which we have passed from the other side unto this, where the River is nine miles broad, from hence we are marching towards <hi>Bender</hi> upon the <hi>Niester</hi> to pass into <hi>Moldavia,</hi> and there to joyn with the Ottoman Army. The Poles have sent to demand Peace, but with condition, that <hi>Kemenitz</hi> be restored to them; which Proposition was with great disdain rejected, and will never be granted whilst this Emperour reigns. These people greatly desired a Peace with <hi>Poland,</hi> which the Election of <hi>Sobieski</hi> for King may probably facilitate; for not only they, but the Turks also dread a March into <hi>Poland,</hi> and are so inveterately bent to take revenge on the Muscovites and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And it is observed, That the Polish Gentlemen do rather trust the young Tartars, which are in their Service, with the keys of their Money and Jewels, than any of their Houshold.</p>
                     <p>The time for Armies to draw out of the Winter-quarters, and take the Field being now come, the Grand Signior and Vizier, with great numbers both of Horse and Foot passed the <hi>Danube,</hi> and prosecuting their March to the Confines of <hi>Poland,</hi> they relieved <hi>Kemenitz</hi> in the first place, the Poles at the News of their approach rasing the Siege. <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Kemenitz</hi> relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> Thence they proceeded to <hi>Chuozim,</hi> a strong Fortress on the <hi>Niester,</hi> taken from them the last year by the Christians, after the defeat given to <hi>Chusacin</hi> Pasha, as before related, the which was surrendred without much difficulty on Articles, which were ill observed, the whole Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son being afterwards put to the Sword. Nor had they worse success against the Muscovites, who retreated backward as the Turk advanced, leaving <hi>Asac,</hi> aster it had been sacked and almost destroyed, to be again rebuilt, which was speedily effected by the assistance of the Captain-Pasha, who was that year with thirty nine Gallies dispeeded into the Black Sea, and with great numbers of Slaves and Souldiers repaired the ruines which the Muscovites had made. In the mean time, whilst the chiefest strength of the marine Force was thus employed, a small Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of about ten Gallies were ordered for the <hi>Archipelago</hi> and the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, under the Command of one <hi>Mahomet</hi> Pasha, a Person that mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged sundry great Employments; but his prodigality and profuse way of living was the cause that he could thrive in none, only he thereby gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so much interest and credit with the Grandees and Monied men of the Court, who are the Pages and Eunuchs, as served him to contract a debt of a thousand Dollars without any ability of his own to give them satisfaction: of which these Creditors being assured, made it their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition

This Office being accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly conferred, <hi>Mahomet</hi> Pasha prepared himself to depart, whilst the Creditors remained in full expectation of a profitable Voyage and speedy returns; which to improve to the best advantage, the Pasha first visited the open and undefended Isles, from whence with the greatest severity and rapine imaginable he pillaged and plundered what he was able, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king some of them to ransom their whole Country with money. Thence he proceeded to <hi>Scala Nova,</hi> called by the Turks <hi>Koush-adasee,</hi> a place on the Coast of <hi>Asia,</hi> not far from <hi>Ephesus,</hi> where he demanded of the people (though all Turks) the Sum of five thousand Dollars, which they not finding to pay, were treated with all kind of force and violence, till at length paying down 1500, and engaging to pay the rest in a months time, the Pasha departed, leaving an Aga, a Servant of his, to receive the money at the time agreed. In that interim, the Kadi co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to be changed, and another of more courage and spirit succeeding in his place, believed that the best service at his beginning and entrance into Office which he could perform towards the people, was to relieve them from the oppression of the Pasha, and perswade them positively to refuse the payment; who taking courage from their Chief, drove the Aga out of Town, with a thousand menaces and reproaches. Upon this News <hi>Mehmet</hi> Pasha returned again full of anger and indignation, but found not that easie reception nor kind entertainment, as before; but on the contrary, the Gates were shut against him, and the people abandoning their Habitations, with common consent resolved to make a Journey to the Grand Signior; and to shew they were in earnest, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded so far in their way as to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> which is about ten miles distant from thence: the prejudice and danger of which complaint <hi>Mahomet</hi> Pasha greatly fearing, sent Messengers to pacifie them with good words and promises to relinquish his pretensions, in case they would return; but the uproar was so great, that they found as much difficulty to quiet it, as the Town-Cerk in ancient times had to appease the Tumult raised by the Silversmiths about <hi>Diana</hi> of the <hi>Ephesians.</hi> Being thus baffled at <hi>Koush-adasec,</hi> he vented his fury on some poor Islands which he could more easily master, and thence proceeded to <hi>Napoli di Romania,</hi> where the people being already alarmed with his behaviour, and violence of his actions in other places, and encouraged by the example of <hi>Koush-adasec,</hi> upon his arrival there, without farther ceremony shut their Gates, and appeared armed against him upon the Walls; at which entertainment and unexpected opposition, the Pasha fearing some evil consequences, set sail from thence, and crossing again the Seas into <hi>Asia,</hi> made <hi>Rhodes</hi> his next Port. Thence he passed to <hi>Satalia,</hi> to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Scanderone,</hi> and so again returned for <hi>Constantinople,</hi> taking <hi>Smyrna</hi> in his way, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting most extreme rapine and violence on the people, whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints having gone before him to the Court, he was immediately cut off at his arrival; but in the first place, his gains and ill gotten goods were seized on to satisfie the Grand Signior, and his Creditors of the Seraglio, who being sent to fish for Wealth, was served like the Cormo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:98602:211"/>
in the <hi>Indies,</hi> which being made tame, and taught to fish for the benefit of their Masters, have a Ring clapped about their necks to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them from swallowing the prey they take.</p>
                     <p>But to return to the Actions at Land, which were matters of the greatest importance. The Turks had no sooner relieved <hi>Kemenitz,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered <hi>Choczim,</hi> and caused the Muscovites to retreat, and draw their Forces into their Country; but being Masters of the Field, and having <note place="margin">The Turks se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.</note> the choice of acting according to their own pleasure, resolved to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the places they already possessed, esteeming it more wisdom to make sure their late acquisitions, than to add thereunto new conquesls, which they could not maintain. And therefore considering the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy of the Cosacks, who having abandoned their subjection to <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> had submitted themselves to their yoke; and also how unable <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosenzko</hi> their Governour was either to keep them in obedience, or else to defend them from the Polonian Incursions; they resolved for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of these inconveniences, and for a secure remedy against any sinister accidents of this nature, to make seisure of that Party of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacks, who had not submitted to them, and transport them into other parts, which they accordingly put into execution, and sweeping all the Countries as they passed, carried away men, women, and children into Captivity: part of which, such as belonged to the Grand Signior, had some Lands assigned them along the Coast near the Black Sea; the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians, who were a Trading people, and lived at <hi>Kemenitz,</hi> were transported to <hi>Philipopoli;</hi> of the Jews some were carried to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and others to <hi>Constantinople;</hi> but the younger sort of both Sexes were permitted to the Souldiery to carry them for Slaves to their own homes, and were in great numbers dispersed through all parts of the Empire: a Policy anciently used by <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to his Egyptian Subjects, who having bought their Lands of them, did afterwards transport them from one end of the Land unto the other, that so he might keep them in the greater servitude and subjection, <hi>Gen. 47. 21. And as for the people, he moved them from one end of the borders of Egypt to the other.</hi> And in this manner the success concluding the year, without any great Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise or Feats of Arms, the Sultan returned to his Court at <hi>Adrianople</hi> about the end of <hi>November,</hi> licensing all the Asian Horse and Souldiers of remotest parts to return to their own Countries, with liberty to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate the following year to their repose and care for their peculiar concernments.</p>
                     <p>To these Wars amongst secular Persons and men of Arms were added <note place="margin">The difference between the Latines and Greeks at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi>
                        </note> Differences, and never to be decided Controversies between the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious of the Roman and Greek Churches at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> who contending for the possession of the Holy Sepulchre of the King of Peace, rent that seamless Coat of Christ, and managed their Controversie with more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and rancour each against other, than Princes do, who invade one the other with Fire and Sword. For the Franks or Western Christians subjected to the Popes Dominion, had possessed for several Ages a right to the Holy Sepulchre, and enjoyed the honour of the custody thereof, notwithstanding the pretences of the Greeks thereunto, who for many years in vain attempted at the Ottoman Court to obtain that Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; for the Franks being ever more powerful by charitable contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions brought from Christendom, besides large Sums of Money from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> did always outbid the Market of the Greeks, and

consequently made use of stronger arguments, than the adverse Party could produce in defence of their cause. Until such time, that one <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naioti,</hi> a Greek born in the Island of <hi>Scio,</hi> having by his parts and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent address arrived to the honour of being Interpreter for the Western Tongues to the Great Vizier, at length obtained that favour with his Master, that he seldom refused whatsoever he with reason and modesty requested; and being a great Zelot in his Religion, and esteemed the chief Patron and Support of the Greek Church, he secretly begged in behalf of his Country, the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> out of the hands of the Franks; which the Vizier would not deny him, both to reward him for some services already performed, and likewise because he knew that a concession of this nature would again raise the spirits and animosities of Christians; the allaying and appeasing of which being an office solely in the power of himself, and the supreme Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, would certainly prove beneficial to the Ottoman Court. <hi>Panaioti</hi> having obtained this Command, and considering that the defence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would be a trouble to him, for that thereby he should create Enemies which were no less than Kings and Princes to contend with, and perhaps should live to see it reversed, wisely laid it by him, there to remain dormant until the time of his death; which happening the year past, the Command was produced and brought to light, and was before the <hi>Easter</hi> of this year set on foot at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and by virtue thereof the custody of the Sepulchre sentenced by the Pasha and Kadi of that place to belong unto the Greeks, the which was occasion of so great trouble and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as disturbed the Holy Feast, and polluted the Sacrifices with the blood of one or two persons, who most earnestly contended for the Priviledge of their Nation and Religion. Nor could this difference be decided here, but both sides appealed to the Court above; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard and debated in publick Divan, the possession of the Sepulchre was adjudged in favour of the Greeks; the Franks being only to injoy a precarious use thereof, as Pilgrims and Strangers to the Country. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the Fryers of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> would not tamely yield up their Right, but again resolved to try their Fortune at the Court, having by means of <hi>F. Canisares</hi> their Commissario with expence of a great Sum of Money obtained a review of the case, but without success; for all these endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and charge proved fruitless, the former sentence being confirmed in favour of the Greeks; and the Franks having no other Expedient, applied themselves to the assistance of the French Ambassadour, to whose protection the Holy places are assigned by Capitulations. But neither the power of the French Ambassadour, nor of any other Christian Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative was available; for the Vizier either mindful of his promise to <hi>Panaioti,</hi> or being resolute to maintain the Command he had given, would on no terms be perswaded to revoke it; the which intention of the Vizier being made known to the Greeks, their Patriarch earnestly pressed a hearing of the case; but the Fryers not willing to abide the shock, retired to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> lest the Greeks forcing them to Justice, they should be condemned <hi>in Judicio contradictorio,</hi> and a Hoget or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence passing, they should be condemned in Law as well as by Authority of the Hattelheriff. Which to put in execution, the Patriarch took out a Command whereunto was added, That the Fryers in token of their subjection, should pay a Drachm of Silver a head to the Patriarch, and hold all their places of them. This was the issue of the present controversies,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:98602:212"/>
which is certainly determined for the time of this Vizier with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1675"/> revocation, yet perhaps in the time of another, it may admit of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view for money, especially being received when as yet the new Minister hath not satiated his covetous desires; howsoever, the expence will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be chargeable, and the success uncertain. Thus have I seen and observed in this particular the effect and experience of two things; <hi>viz.</hi> The covetousness and pride of Fryars, and the conclusion of their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits before Infidels. The Franks, or the Western Christians, had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til this time the custody of the Holy Sepulchre, and the Greeks that of the Chappel of <hi>Bethlem,</hi> but the use was free to both; but the Franks not being able to enjoy the Sepulchre with contentment, whilst with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious eyes they beheld the Greeks in possession of <hi>Bethlem,</hi> were always contriving designs by force of money, and power of Christian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters to eject them from that Right; until that now in these contentions they have lost both; being neither able to recover the one, nor conserve the other.</p>

                     <p>PRopositions of peace not being so earnestly pressed, nor so advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageously proffered by the Poles, as the pride of the Turks did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, the War still continued, but not prosecuted either on the one side or on the other with the same violence with which it began. For the Sultan designing this year to circumcise his Son, the young Prince, now about twelve years of Age, and to marry his Daughter of seventeen to his Mosayp, or Favourite, Pasha of <hi>Magnasia,</hi> commonly called by the Name of <hi>Kul-ogli,</hi> which signifies the Son of a Slave, he resolved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate this whole Year to quiet repose, mirth, and jollity at home, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two thousand Janisaries were sent to <hi>Ibrahim</hi> Pasha to recruit the Souldiers on the Frontiers of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the Tartars were reinforced with some Turkish Troops under <hi>Usuff</hi> Pasha to assist <hi>Dorosensko</hi> against the Poles, who were with a considerable Army fallen into <hi>Ukrania;</hi> And the Captain Pasha, with twenty eight Sail of Gallies, was dispeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Black Sea for carrying of such Provisions and Ammunition for War as was necessary for supply of the Army; Besides which, no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations of War were designed, these being judged sufficient, though not to conquer, yet at least to repress the Incursions, and amuse or keep the Armes of the Enemy employed.</p>
                     <p>For at the Ottoman Court the face of all things was become serene and calm, no Seditions of great men, nor discontents of the people, nor <note place="margin">The happy state of the Ottoman Court.</note> black and cruel designs of State disturbed or clouded the splendour of the Solemnities, or the brows of the great Statists, but all matters ran in an uninterrupted course of Joy and Festivity. The Sultan, who in his actions shewed himself a most benign Prince, sparing and compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of the blood and misery of his Subjects, hath, since his arrival to a mature Age, exercised a wise manner of Government, severe and just, and yet void of the cruelty and tyranny of his Ancestors; under whom the trading Christians enjoyed the priviledge of their Capitulations with more justice, and less frequent Avanias. The Vizier also, and other great Officers, being sensible of the benefit which Trade begat, treated Merchants with more gentleness and respect than in former times, their Ships not being forced on every occasion into the Grand Signior's ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:98602:213"/>
 but rather perswaded to it by rewards and fair promises, otherwise than in the times of former Viziers; and it is to be wished also that the like might be said under the Government of those which are to succeed; though if we look forward to the years 1678 and 1679 we shall find the Scene of things altered, and not only Merchants, but even Ambassadors, and the Representatives themselves, remain under sad discouragements. Amongst these joys and gentle ways of Government, the manner of this Court was much altered; the Divan had not for two months space been opened for business, to the great prejudice and interruption of Justice; Wine, that great abomination to the Turkish Law, which four years past was by the Imperial Decree forbidden under pain of Death and a thousand Execrations and Curses, was now the common Drink, and divertisement in fashion, used immoderately by all, excepting the Grand Signior, the Mufti, and Reis Effendi; the Vizier himself having been excessively intemperate therein, had extinguished the natural heat of his stomach, which could be warmed by no less heat than what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from <hi>Aqua Vitae;</hi> by which debauchery and indisposition all busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses were slowly and negligently dispatched, and according to his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Officers and Ministers acted in their Affairs, which in former times being always dispatched by nine a Clock in the Morning, that became now the time and hour of rising.</p>
                     <p>The Grand Signior himself, though not taught by his Attendants to drink Wine, lest it should perhaps betray him to some actions dangerous to them, gave himself to Amours; for falling in love with a Polish Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, lately captivated at <hi>Kemenitz,</hi> he made her his Second Hasakee or Sultaness; for having had the good fortune to bring him a Son, that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was the reward of her fruitfulness; and that he might give other testimonies of his favour, he cast his eyes on a poor Chinganee, or Gipsy Boy, who with singing and dancing so pleased him, that he gave him six purses of money, containing three thousand Dollars, with Horses and Servants, and took him into the Seraglio. Amidst these Delights the Grand Signior gave order to the Vizier not to speak to him of three things, Neither of returning to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> nor against his Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, nor against his Hunting; in other matters he might use free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                     <p>Another alteration of a better nature, with reference to Learning and Knowledge, seems also remarkable in this Court; for the Grand Signior having been some years past presented by the Dutch Resident, with twelves large Volumes of the new <hi>Atlas,</hi> upon an accidental sight thereof was so pleased, that he commanded it should speedily be transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Turkish; to which Work Dr <hi>Alexandro Mauro Cordato,</hi> the Viziers Interpreter, who succeeded in the place of <hi>Panaioti</hi> deceased, was nominated; but he finding it too unweildy for him, desired the assistance of a French Jesuit, then at <hi>Scio,</hi> skilful in the Turkish and Arabick Languages, who was immediately sent for, and therein employed; and though it is thought, that this business is above their Element, and that it will soon cool and be neglected, yet it seems to be the first step which the Turks have made unto Learning, and therefore is the more observable.</p>
                     <p>And now the Festivals beginning on the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> we must for <note place="margin">The great Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivals in what manner cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated at the Turkish Court.</note> some days lay aside all business, and observe with what order and form these Solemnities were performed. In the first place, On this day the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:98602:213"/>
Grand Signior, with the young Prince his Son, went to their Tents, which were pitched very sumptuously in the Plain near the City, and indeed were truly stately and magnificent; all the great men, as the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier, Mufti, and others, having their Pavilions erected; amongst which was raised a very stately Throne, with a Canopy of Cloth of Gold, extended under the shady leaviness of two tall Elms, which, set off with many Lamps, in the Night represented a very pleasant and glorious Scene. On this Seat of State the Sultan placed himself in the morning, being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied thither by all the Pashaws then present, and by the Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of those who were absent; who according to their Degree, in order kissing his Vest, delivered in a Silk Purse a Note or Schedule of their Presents, which were afterwards put into the Tefterdar's or Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers hands to see and compare them with the particulars received; which were so great and considerable, that they far surpassed the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Disbursments of the Solemnity. Opposite to the Tents were several poles fixed, between which at Night were hung Lamps of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral shapes, which being varied every Night made a very pleasing and magnificent Object; by light of which in the Evening were exercised se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral tricks of Activity, as Wrestlings, Dancing, and Singing, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times were acted Turkish Comedies, which consist only of Farces, and some ridiculous Dialogues, and at last the divertisements of the night con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with Fire-works, which were so many, that (as reported) 240 men were employed for four months time in the making of them, and yet there are better made in Christendome; only one seemed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel the rest, being a sort of Rocket, which went up very high, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any tail of fire, like the common ones, carrying only a small com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted Globe of red fire like a Star, and making no noise in mounting, but raised to its height breaks. These were the pastimes of the Night; in the day time all the several Arts and Trades, some one day, and some another, passed before the Tents, every one offering their Presents, as they passed, representing by some kind of Pageant and Procession their diversities of Trade: this continuued for fifteen days. On the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of this instant <hi>May,</hi> was a solemn Cavalcade, in which marched the Janisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with all their chief Officers, Chiauses, and Mutafaracas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And of the Great Men, the Vizier, Mufti, and <hi>Kul-ogli</hi> the Favourite, the first on the right hand, and the second in the middle; after them followed the young Prince who was to be circumcised, extraordinary rich in the Furniture of his Horse, and the number and largeness of the Diamonds, which were on his Tulbant and Breast. In this Cavalcade were carried twenty four small Nachils, and two large ones, as high as the Mast of a Ship, which were carried by a hundred Slaves, and set before the Seraglio, which are in form of triumphant Pyramids, adorned with Tinsils in thirteen Divisions, according to this following Form or Description.</p>

On the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, being the day of <hi>Mahomet's</hi> Birth, the Grand Signior rode publickly to the Mosch of Sultan <hi>Selim,</hi> having no other attendance than the Retinue of his own Court; his Pages were very rich in Cloth of Gold, each carrying a Feather studded with a rich Jewel on his Head; after the Grand Signior rode the young Prince, who that Night was circumcised. During this Festival, a vast number of people was fed at the charge of the Grand Signior, and about two thousand circumcised, every one of which had a Quilt given him, with a small pay of three Aspers a day for his Life.</p>
                     <p>This Solemnity for the Circumcision being ended, on the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> began the Feast for the Marriage. The Kuzlir Aga, who is the black <note place="margin">The manner of the Marriage of the Grand Signior's Daughter,</note> Eunuch of the Women, was Brideman or Comparé to the young Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, and the Tefterdar or Lord Treasurer to <hi>Kul-ogli,</hi> both which in the name of the Bride and Bridegroom went before the Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice called the Kadelescher, and by him had the Articles of Marriage wrote, and passed into publick Act; which being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the Presents were sent, and sirst those from the Bridegroom to the Bride, which were these, a great number of Beasts and Birds ill-favouredly made in Sugar, thirty Mules laden with two Chests of Sweet-meats apiece, and about their necks each carried a Vest of Sattin for the Muletiers, then were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a great many Pots of Sherbet, then an hundred and twelve men car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying Vests of Silk, Cloth, Velvet, and Cloth of Gold, some had three, some five or six at least wrapt up in Linen; then went five Horses, one with rich Furniture; then followed a noble Vest of Cloth of Gold lined with Sables and nine Buttons and Loops on a side embroidered with large Pearl, on the top of which on the one side was a very large Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, and on the other a Saphire, with Shoes, Boots, and Pattents for the Bagno, all covered with Pearl; likewise two Dressing-boxes, with Looking-glasses, and a Cap in form of a Crown, a little Cabinet em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered all over with Pearl, eight Girdles set with Emeralds, Rubies, and Diamonds, a large Diamond-ring, a pair of Pendants of two great Emeralds, with many other particulars, which in passage were impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be remembred.</p>
                     <p>These Presents being thus performed on the part of the Bridegroom to his Bride, the next Presents concerned the Grand Signior to his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which were in place of her Dowry according to the custom of the Eastern Countries: wherefore the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of this month the Presents were ushered with a most solemn Cavalcade of all the Grandees of the Court to the House of the Bridegroom, which were two Gardens made of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, sorty little Nachils, eighty six Mules laden with Houshold-stuff, ten men with her Dressings, as Boots, Shoes, &amp;c. embroidered with Pearl as the former; then were carried her Jewels set in Girdles, Bracelets, &amp;c. promiseuously together, not in that rule as those were which were sent her by the Bridegroom. The Houshold-stuff was made up with coverts, yet howsoever some parts were left open on the sides, to shew that the Cushions were embroidered with Pearl, and others were of Velvet em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered with Gold. At last came twelve Coaches with Slaves and thirty six black Eunuchs. The 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> the Bride was conducted to her Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grooms Palace with a solemn Cavalcade, with two great Nachils of the same form and bigness as those carried at the Cavalcade of the Prince, with two smaller ones of Silver. The Bride was seated in a handsom Coach drawn with six Horses, and covered with Plates of Silver, and the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:98602:215"/>
sides adorned with long Streamers of Tinsel: before which went the Kuzlir Aga or chief black Eunuch of the Women: after followed four Coaches with six Horses apiece, and twenty one more with four Horses, each carrying two Eunuchs: then at some distance off came the Hasakee or Queen-Mother to the Bride in a Coach all covered with Plates of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and attended with ten other Coaches more: the night following the Bride was conducted to the Nuptial Chamber in ceremony only, she not being yet ripe for consummation of Marriage: all which Solemnity was attended at the Bridegrooms Court, with the same Sports and Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works which were made at the Tents, with an addition of dancing on the Ropes, and sliding down a Rope fastned to the top of the Steeple of the Mosch of Sultan <hi>Selim,</hi> which had like to have proved fatal to one who came down with a Boy at his back; for when he was about twenty yards from the ground, the Rope broke, but falling on a tree first, and then on a man, he was taken up with little hurt. The most remarkable of all these Shows, was a man that walked up a Rope as high as the second Balcony of the Menareh or Steeple of Sultan <hi>Selim,</hi> which is as high as commonly our Spire-Steeples are in <hi>England:</hi> And another hanging on a Rope with his hands, with his body extended, turned himself twelve times round with his hands: at all which Sights the Grand Signior was a constant Spectator. In this manner these So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities ended, the Mosayp or Favourite rich in the esteem of his Prince, and in high honour with all, had yet some allay to attemper and moderate his joy; for the Princess not yet fit for consummation, in case she dyed before that time, all her Jewels and Goods must return to the Grand Signior, notwithstanding which he would be obliged to pay her Dowry, which was said to be the Sum of two years Revenue of Grand <hi>Cairo;</hi> but let it be what it will, he will be insolvent, being, as reported, three hundred Purses already in debt. And now to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the uncertainty of the Courts of Princes, as well as of all other places and conditions of the World, the Great Tefterdar or Treasurer, who had for the space of thirteen years managed this Office with singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar industry and advantage, was now removed from thence, and under a specious shew of preferment, was advanced to the Dignity of Pasha of Grand <hi>Cairo:</hi> this change was the more wondered at, because he was a Person so acute and so proper for the Office, that no man that held the <note place="margin">The Tefterdar put out of his Ossice.</note> place did ever manage it with greater reputation, nor with greater be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to the Interest of his Prince; for besides his good husbandry in other matters, he was so skilful in knowing the price of Commodities, and so near in making his Bargains, that the Merchant could scarce live by him, which in that consumption of Goods made in the Seraglio, will produce a considerable abatement, when all things are bought at the best hand; considering which, many reasons were alledged, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures made of his removal: some said, That the Grand Signior having a liking to a young Man of his, to prevent his being taken into the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio, the Testerdar gave him a Wife, and thereby greatly displeased the Grand Signior, as if he had purposely contrived it, to defeat his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires: others said, That the Grand Signior would have borrowed money of him to pay the Arrears of the Spahees, which he refused to lend: but others talked, and that with best reason, That <hi>Kara Mustapha</hi> the old Chimacam, who is always with the Grand Signior, had found an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to represent him amiss, suggesting, that the Tefterdar should say,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:98602:215"/>
That want of money in the Treasury was caused by the vast Sums con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed in the fooleries of the late Feasts: and the Vizier, though he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained no personal animosity against him, yet was willing to sacrifice him to the friendship of <hi>Kara Mustapha.</hi> And so being dispossessed of his Office, thereunto succeeded the Janifary <hi>Esendi</hi> or Judge-Advocate of the Janisaries, a great Drinker of Wine, and one not to hold any comparison with the parts and abilities of his Predecessour. Money now wanting greatly in the Treasury, several ways were sought to bring it <note place="margin">Ways for ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Money.</note> in, and to save expences. The first of which was, that a review be made of all Otoraks, such as <hi>Milites emeriti,</hi> who are excused from the War, and yet receive their pay; from which number those were exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded who had bought it, or were not come legally by it, which would save the Grand Signior a vast Sum of Money yearly: and to help at this time of need, the late Treasurer must refund and ease himself of money, before he enters on that rich and important Office of Grand <hi>Cairo.</hi> And <hi>Chusaein</hi> Aga the chief Customer, who was a man that had inriched him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by many bad ways and arts, was displaced from his Office, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to disgorge great Sums of Money to add unto the Supplies of the Treasury. He was a Person of a subtle disposition, raised from the mean degree of a Shoemaker, and being well acquainted both with good and bad ways of gaining money, was a proper Instrument for the Turkish Government, it being his fortune to fish riches rather for others than himself. And now being deprived of his Office and the best part of his Wealth, he resolved, like all other discontented Ministers, to take a Pilgrimage to <hi>Mecha,</hi> and to that end made a solemn Visit to the Pasha of <hi>Cairo,</hi> then in his Tents near <hi>Scutari,</hi> acquainting him of his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to wait on him, and perform his Respects in his passage to the Holy <hi>Kebleh</hi> or <hi>Mecha.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Turks have not of late years been very prodigal of the blood of their Subjects, nor have those Executions been done of late on any Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, unless his Tyranny and Oppression of the people did justly draw due punishment upon himself. And such was the case of the Kahya or Secretary of the Chimacam or Governour in the Viziers absence of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> who taking on himself the management of all the Affairs of his Master, acted every thing according to his own pleasure; for finding that whatsoever he did or propounded, was always confirmed and assen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto by his easie Lord, he assumed a boldness to undertake any thing upon the proffers of mony, so the Sum was in any manner agreeable to the greatness of the matter required, or to the danger he incurred; by which means he involved his careless and unwary Master in such intrigues, <note place="margin">The Chima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam of <hi>

At this manner of administring Justice, the people being discontented, hastened the removal of the Chimacam: and now another entring on the Office, the Kahya remained exposed to the malice and complaints of all his Enemies, amongst which none was of greater force than an accusation laid against him, for having granted leave to the Armenian Christians at <hi>Constantinople</hi> for a Sum of Money to erect a Church; for which, though a Command was granted by the Great Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier, obtained at a good price, to build one there of Timber, but of a low and mean Fabrick; yet the Kahya for a greater Sum of twenty Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Money, or ten thousand Dollars, improved this Command, and changed their Materials from Timber to Stone and Mortar: the which
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:98602:216"/>
Building beginning to rise with some magnificence, offended the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Turks with so much scandal, that great numbers of them car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Complaints thereof to the Grand Signior; who calling the Vizier, and examining the Case, the Vizier would owne no other Command, than for repairing of an old Church, but not building one new. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Sentence of Death being passed on the Kahya, an Officer was sent to execute it. And in his way to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> at a place called <hi>Selebrea,</hi> meeting with the Offender, he caused him to return again with him to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where having strangled him, his Body was thrown into the Sea.</p>
                     <p>We have thus far discoursed of the Affairs at home, which consisted for the most part in jollities and divertisements; let us now look on the enterprizes and attempts abroad, and we shall find no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of action this year performed against <hi>Poland,</hi> more than some incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions made into <hi>Ukrania</hi> by the Turks and Tartars under the Conduct of <hi>Ibrahim</hi> Pasha, in which we have no Battels, nor great Skirmishes to recount, only a seizure or surprize of those Cosacks, which were not under the jurisdiction of <hi>Dorosensko,</hi> who like sheep were driven from their pastures, and Men, Women, and Children carried away into Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and transplanted into Countries, where they might better serve the purposes and designs of the Turkish Empire; to which ends also vast numbers of Tartars with their Families, were called to inhabit the circumjacent parts of <hi>Kemenitz,</hi> for better security of that Conquest, to which the Tartars most willingly concurred, esteeming it a happy Bargain to exchange the Soil of <hi>Tartary</hi> for the fruitful Plains, and more gentle Air of <hi>Poland.</hi> And thus we may consider what the intestine Discord of the Poles hath brought upon themselves; that they, who in former days maintained their honour and reputation with the Turks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any of the bordering Nations; not having ever suffered them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in their Country, much less to sojourn or possess one palm of Ground therein; can now more easily see them before the Walls of <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis</hi> or <hi>Cracovia,</hi> and planted in the very Bowels of their Countrey, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a King of their own Countrey set over them not agreeable to their own humour and fancy; or perhaps rather than behold the envied exaltation of some persons to dignity, or some little disorders in their Government; of which the Turk knows well to make use, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no new Lesson for him, to profit himself of the Discord and Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of the Christians.</p>
                     <p>In like manner the Marine Affairs of the Turks this year afforded lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle worthy of observation, unless it were, That the Captain Pasha was employed with about thirty Sail of Gallies into the Black Sea, for transporting of Ammunition and Provision to those Forces in <hi>Ukra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia;</hi> but he returned not with an equal number of Gallies, with which he departed, having lost five of them by storm, and then arrived at <hi>Constantinople</hi> on the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> called by the Greeks the Feast of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and by the Turks <hi>Cassim-gheun,</hi> a day which is commonly remarkable for Storms at Sea; of which the Turks and Greeks are so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive or superstitious, that on that day or near that time, either before or after, until the storm hath vented its fury, and taken its course, they will not adventure themselves unto the Sea, upon the most pressing occasion, or hopeful inducement whatsoever.</p>
                     <p>And here I judge it requisite to conclude this Year with two matters
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:98602:216"/>
very observable relating unto Trade: The first is with reserence unto the Genoueses, who in the Year 1666. first sent their Ambassador Signior <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razzo,</hi> with many Presents and great Magnificence to conclude a Peace with the Ottoman Empire, with the sole design and intention of Trade; which having been established on no other foundation at the beginning, <note place="margin">The Trade of <hi>

For these reasons, their Trade failing, the Duties of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulage on Goods appointed to maintain the Officers, and desray the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Expences, were consequently wanting; so that the Count <hi>Fieschi</hi> Rosident for that Republick at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> finding himself in great distresses and necessities, and unable to maintain himself and his Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants agreeable to his Character and Quality, often advised his Prince and the Senate of the unhappy state of their Affairs, desiring from them either to provide a Supply agreeable to the occasions, or to recal him from that Office, where he could no longer live in that Honour required. This importunity produced the exchange of Officers, and the Mission of Signior <hi>Giustiniano</hi> to reside at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and Signior <hi>

                        </hi> at <hi>Smyrna;</hi> the first of which, some few days after his arrival, being unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately killed with a Carabine in his Chamber at <hi>Consiantinople,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore related, the Office of Resident came to be still continued in the person of <hi>Fieschi,</hi> who remaining without provisions necessary to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his degree, and the annual Presents expected by the Turks, which they esteem as due as their Income, and as part of their Revenues, was forced to take up money on Pawns, and his own credit at the Interest of 20, 25, or 30 <hi>per cent.</hi> according as his necessities increased; and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions men conceived of an insufficiency and hazard in their secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, was the cause that the debt, which in the beginning was inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, increasing with Interest upon Interest, came at length to the Sum of sixty or seventy thousand Dollars, which the Republick of <hi>Genoua,</hi> attributing in a great measure to the ill Conduct of <hi>Fieschi,</hi> and judging the greatest part of this debt to be feigned, sent another Resident called Signior <hi>Spinola</hi> to succeed him in his Office, who arriving at <hi>Smyrna</hi> in the month of <hi>May</hi> of this present year, on a stout Ship hired of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians, and under the notion of a Man of War accompanied with a Merchant Ship, and a new Consul (the old one dying the year before) setled there such Orders, as were judged necessary for the government of their Affairs. But before these Genoueses arrived, a report had fore-ran them from <hi>Ligorne</hi> and other parts, that their Ships brought great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of false Gold and false Pieces of Eight: the which coming to the cars of the Turks, Commands were provided against their arrival to search their Ships, and try their Monies; to which the Genoueses not conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:98602:217"/>
Arz or testimony was made thereof by the Kadi unto the Grand Signiors Court. In the interim whilst this Arz went up, and the answer expected, the Genouese Resident designing to proceed forward on his Voyage to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> demanded the Kadi's Moraselau or Tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of Licence for the Man of War on which he came, to pass the Castle, (for that Ship had entred within the Port.) The Kadi judging it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, that both the Resident and Ship should attend the arrival of the answer from above, refused to grant this Licence; whereupon the Resident all in a rage imbarked himself, and immediately set sail, and having a fair Breez out of the Port, gently slided along by the side of the Castle without any stop or interruption.</p>
                     <p>This affront being put upon the Kadi, greatly displeased him; so that calling the Lieutenant and Gunner of the Castle into question, and not admitting of their Plea, that the Ship was a Man of War, and the person thereon a Resident, both which were priviledged, and both going up to the Grand Signiors Court, were to answer there for what was laid against them; but this I say, not being admitted for reason, the Kadi commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them both to Prison, from whence with some charge afterwards they released themselves.</p>
                     <p>The new Resident being arrived at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the Creditors of Count <hi>Fieschi</hi> demanded payment of the debts owing to them, which was given in, to amount to sixty thousand Dollars, and so much was to be paid before <hi>Fieschi</hi> should be permitted to depart, or at least that part thereof being satisfied in hand, the new Resident <hi>Spinola</hi> should give security for payment of the remainder: the which he refusing to do, as not owning the accounts which <hi>Fieschi</hi> had given in, in regard he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to be composed of extravagant Interests, and to arise on char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges not allowable by that Republick, who after the death of <hi>Giusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niano</hi> disowned <hi>Fieschi</hi> for their Minister; hereupon great disturbances and commotions arose amongst the Creditors, some of which being in great Power, as the Janisary-Aga and others, Sequestration was laid on their Man of War; so that she was toaed away to the Arsenal, and there laid up, and attached for payment of the debt: which arising on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Publick, the Goods of the Common-wealth was justly esteemed liable to the Sequestration: during which time the Pestilence, the Epidemical disease of that season at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> affecting with its contagion the Ships company, about eighteen or twenty of them dyed thereof, and all their affairs reduced to a strange consternation.</p>
                     <p>In this interim many and various were the disputes and contests be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Residents; sometimes they proposed to refer their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences to the decision of the English, French, and Venetian Ministers; sometimes again, finding the distance so wide and spatious between them, they resolved to have their matters determined by Turkish Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. At length the new Resident perceiving no end of this business, and that the Ship lay ingaged at a great charge, and as it were captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the great dishonour of the Republick, came to an agreement to pay thirty three thousand Dollars, one third whereof was to be paid in hand, and the other two thirds by equal portions in the space of one year; the first payment to be made after six months, and the other six months after; to which not only the Resident, but their Merchants also entred personally into obligation. In this manner the Ship being cleared, and taking such lading as offered for <hi>Genoua</hi> at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> sailed for
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:98602:217"/>
                        <hi>Smyrna;</hi> where taking another Ship of the same Country into her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, departed with the Dutch Convoy for Christendom. But having remained six months in Port, subjected to much charge and trouble, and not finding a Freight equal to the time and expence, was no great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the Genoueses to continue this Trade; which by good experience appears in no manner agreeable to their Country, nor yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing success answerable to the long expectation of ten years past.</p>
                     <p>In this Year it was, that the Grand Signior and Great Vizier at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigation of <hi>Chusaein</hi> Aga the chief Customer (whom we have before mentioned) casting their eyes on <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and finding it a place of great Trade, and a convenient Port, for which in ancient times it was always famous, and for the same cause was frequented by Merchants both from the Eastern and Western parts of the World; so that it was become the only great and considerable Mart or Scale within the Precincts of the Turkish Empire: considering it (I say) in this manner with a benign eye, as bringing great profit and advantage, they began to think it worthy the Ornament of some publick Edifices, founded with that Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence as might endure long, and renew the ancient Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of <hi>Smyrna:</hi> Hereupon they erected in the first place a Besasteen, <note place="margin">A Besasteen and new Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom-house, and a Royal Chan built at <hi>Smyrna.</hi>
                        </note> which is in the nature of our Exchange, where several Shops are made, and variety of Goods sold; and to make the better Front towards the Sea, it was founded therein on vast Stones and Piles, fit to support a weighty Building.</p>
                     <p>The next Edifice erected was a Custom-house built into the Sea only on Piles of Timber, with a handsom Front towards the Sea; and this the Great Vizier judged to be a work not only necessary, but also agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Majesty of his Master; for until this time the Customer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in a hired House, not unlike the others which Merchants inhabit. And now this House being compleated, a Hattesheriff or Royal Decree came down from the Court, commanding that all Ships that came into that Port either to lade or unlade, should lay their sides to that Custom-house Scale, and thereon discharge their Goods, and receive others.</p>
                     <p>And now whereas the Merchants injoyed at all times in former days the convenience of having their Goods landed on, and laden from their own Keys or Scales, they greatly resented this innovation; and as they unwillingly quit any Privlledge, so they judged this not unworthy to be contended for with singular constancy and resolution: the commodious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of which was thought so considerable, that it not only caused this place in former days to flourish, and to be distinguished from all the Marts in the World; but also the injoyment thereof invited the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants from the more elevated parts of <hi>Smyrna</hi> (where was health and pleasure) to the lower Bogs and Marishes, exchanging health and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful air for profit and convenience of Commerce. Hereupon applications were made by all the Consuls of the Frank Nations to their Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours and Ministers at the Grand Signiors Court. In the mean time Trade by common agreement was interdicted, at least as to the lading or unlading of Ships, which continued for several days, and touched somewhat grievously the English and Dutch Nations: the first having two Ships, and the latter six Merchant-ships in Port. The English Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour being then personally at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> was the first who without the assistance of any other Minister, moved in this affair, but found great opposition in it from the Turkish Officers; who with some resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:98602:218"/>
of the present reluctancy of the Merchants, declared not without pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1676"/> the resolution the Grand Signior had to conform the honour of the Custom-house in some semblance with those of Christian Princes; and therefore did wonder that the Christian Merchants could so easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend to the rules of those Custom houses in their own Countries, where they were Natives, and yet could not support the same in these parts where they were Aliens and Strangers. And as a farther evidence of the Turks resolution to maintain this point, it was said by the Vizier's Kahya, that the Grand Signior was resolved to blow up both Port and Town, rather than not be obeyed in his own Dominions; with this Answer, Merchants despairing of the success, began to unlade their ships at the Custom house, or to give an account there of the Goods in their Boats; for the Customer was become sensible, that there was not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Water for ships to ride at the Key of the Custom house, and did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so indulge unto the Merchants several other particulars herein, that so the innovation might sit the more lightly on them, which he perceived was so ill resented and taken to heart. And this was the first beginning in the Months of <hi>August</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> when this priviledge was taken from the Merchants. And in this Year also the Great Chan next to the Besasteen was in Building, and the first Foundation thereof laid, and the great Aquaduct brought from the Plains of <hi>Bogiaw,</hi> and little <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi-bonar.</hi>

                     <p>THis Year began with joyful News to the whole Turkish Empire, all places and Cities of less renown rejoycing to hear the intentions of the Sultan to refresh and adorn again his Capital Throne of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> with the Imperial Presence; for that City (which is the most proper Scituation of the World, to be made the head of a great Empire) having now almost for sixteen years wanted the Rays of Majesty, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Sultan, became almost abandoned and forsaken of its Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, so that the spacious Seraglios or Palaces of the chief Ministers and Officers of the Empire began to decay and run to ruine, and the Artisans and Shop-keepers to leave their dwellings, and to follow their Trade at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> or in the Camp. But now the News of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed <note place="margin">The G. Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or returns to <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
                        </note> return of the Grand Signior to his ancient Seat, filled all places with joy and triumph, especially at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which was not more satisfied with the consideration of the benefit and advantage it was likely to receive by the Royal Presence, than that those suspicious and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies which formerly possessed the mind of the Sultan with a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice against this place, did seem now to vanish, and that he reassumed a confidence of his Royal City equal to that love and esteem which his Ancestors had of it; so that the humour which then possessed <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> appeared like that of <hi>London</hi> at our Kings Restauration, all joy, even to transport, for this unexspected Return; the people in the streets congratulating their mutual happiness, thanked God, that they had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to see that happy day and blessed hour.</p>
                     <p>The occasion of this unexspected and sudden resolution caused many roving guesses and opinations of the reasons of it. Some said a Dream which the Grand Signior had, and which gave great disturbance to his thoughts, until he resolved for <hi>Constantinople.</hi> Others said, the revolt
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:98602:218"/>
and troubles at <hi>Cairo,</hi> of which we shall presently have occasion to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and some added certain Commotions at <hi>Bagdat,</hi> or <hi>Babylon;</hi> some reported, that <hi>Xeriff</hi> of <hi>Mecha</hi> wrote him a Letter, that he could not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <note place="margin">Conjectures concerning the reasons of the Grand Signiors return to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople.</hi>
                        </note> him the Head and Protector of the Mussulmin Faith, so long as he had abandoned his Imperial City, and lived in the mountains and unknown places. Others said, that the Janisaries and Militia murmured, and that his Coming to <hi>Constantinople</hi> was forced and not to be avoided; and that the Sultan being now out of love with <hi>Adrianople,</hi> had cursed it, and sworn never more to set foot in it, having ordered the Materials sent for the building of the Great Seraglio at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> to be stopped on the way, and returned back again. At this rate all the World talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and discoursed, joy and hopes made the people fancy every thing according to their wishes. The Grand Signior being approached near to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> fixed himself in his Camp in the Fields, near a small Seraglio of his own, called <hi>Daout Basha,</hi> from whence the people for many days expected, that he should, according to the Custom of his Ancestors, make a solemn Entry; instead whereof he made some Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies with a small Company through the Streets, as it were <hi>incognito,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his pastime on the Water, and on the sides of the <hi>Bosphorus</hi> in his Gallies and Boats, but most commonly frequented his Palace of <hi>Scuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri</hi> on the Asian side, where with much delight and confidence he lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reposed his Court, but made no solemn Entry through the City, nor frequented his great Seraglio; where though he might perhaps dine, and pass certain hours, yet he slept not one Night there; of which the people took especial notice, and thereby received consirmation of the jealousie their Soveraign had of them, to their extraordinary grief and dissatisfaction; however it was some contentment to the people, and renown unto the City to have their Emperour so near, though it was rumoured as if the Court towards the approach of Winter intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to return unto <hi>Adrianople.</hi> In the mean time the Grand Signior took his chief delight and divertisement on the Water, passing in his Gallies and Pleasure-Boats up the <hi>Bosphorus</hi> to the mouth of the Black Sea; and thence returning, much frequented the Gardens, and Houses of Delight upon the Banks of the River; and visiting all places, a Country House called <hi>Therapea,</hi> belonging to the Dutch Resident, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the honour of his Presence, which he liked so well, that he took it from the Proprietor, and conferred it without any consideration of money on one of his Courtiers, giving out a Proclamation, That no Christian Minister should possess any Seat or Habitation on the side of the <hi>Bosphorus.</hi> A strange thing, and what is not to be paralleled in any part of the World.</p>
                     <p>About the beginning of this Year the Captain Pasha died, and <hi>Zaid Ahmet</hi> Pasha-ogli, then at the Camp, succeeded him; his Father was a famous Man, and in the same Charge, but cut off by old <hi>Kuperlee.</hi> Soon after <hi>Ibrahim</hi> Pasha, General of the Army at <hi>Kemenitz,</hi> likewise died, and his Office was conferred on <hi>Ibrahim</hi> Pasha, that was Pasha of <hi>Candia,</hi> of whom we have had often occasion to speak, being a great friend to the English Nation. The Great Vizier also was not far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the Consines of Death, being now fallen, by reason of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate drinking of Wine, and chiefly of hot Cinamon Waters, into a formed Dropsie and Jaundice.</p>
                     <p>In the preceding year we touched on the removal of the Tefterdar
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:98602:219"/>
or Treasurer from his Office to the Government of Grand <hi>Cairo,</hi> and the reasons for it, which though it might be a preferment (being the richest and most important Charge of the Empire) to which the esteem the Sultan had of his parts and abilities, might probably advance him; yet the imploying of him at a distance so remote, was certainly an effect of some displeasure, whereby he or his Favourites judged him a Person not sit to remain longer near the Royal Presence. Wherefore having commenced his Journey (as before mentioned) he arrived at Grand <hi>Cairo,</hi> where he had not long continued before he began, according to the natural acuteness of his mind and hugstering manner, to pierce with a narrow inspection into all Affairs of that Government, and particularly into the Revenue and Treasure of the Country, contriving with himself by what means the disorders might be corrected, and the Revenue and Tribute improved; for he had an excellent Genius or Spirit in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Money, nothing in advantage of Interest could ever escape him; so that he began to lay a new foundation in all proceedings; he would not be contented with the old Taxes and Impositions, and where he found Lands improved, or the Customs augmented, he would put in for a share of the Benefits, and would reform every thing wherein he judged his Master to have been abused. But though he was acute and sharp-sighted in such matters as these, yet he wanted experience in the Government of <hi>Egypt;</hi> for the great Beghs of this Country being alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">The People in <hi>Egypt</hi> rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their new Pasha.</note> with these innovations, began to stand upon their Guard, and to enter into private Consultations, in what manner to oppose themselves to this new way of Government, which looked like slavery, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of bringing them into servitude, and a subjection unknown to them and their Fore-fathers. For indeed the Government of <hi>Egypt,</hi> if well considered, is rather Aristocratical than Monarchical; for though they acknowledge the Sultan to be their Head, and accept his Pasha for Ruler, and pay a yearly Tribute; yet the Beghs which are great Lords in their respective Countries, carry the sway and Dominion in all other matters, and will endure nothing which savours of oppression or inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; so that these persons grown jealous by the proceedings of the new Pasha, flew into open Sedition, and immediately to Arms, with force of which they assaulted the Pasha's Palace, took him and threw him into Prison. The News whereof flying with all haste to the Ottoman Court, appeared at the first apprehension or surprise as if all <hi>Egypt</hi> had revolted, and gave the World occasion to discourse, That the Wars were to be carried Eastward, and that the sudden resolution of removing the Court to <hi>Constantinople</hi> was in order to a farther March into those parts But frequent Messages with time making the business to be better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, caused the Grand Signior to dispeed with all haste another Pasha, with Commission to remove the former, and to continue all the ancient Customs and Priviledges from the beginning indulged to the Beghs of <hi>Egypt:</hi> with which Message and gentle words of grace and favour from the Sultan, all discontents being pacified, the former Pasha was released from his Imprisonment, and suffered to depart, and thence proceeded to the Island of <hi>Candia,</hi> where he entred on that Pashaluck, succeeding <hi>Ibrahim</hi> Pasha in Charge, who (as before related) was sent to <hi>Kemenitz</hi> to be General of the Army, in place of the Pasha lately deceased.</p>
                     <p>But here I must not forget a story which happened during the time of this Summer, whilst the Grand Signior had his abode and injoyed his
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:98602:219"/>
Recreations in the circumjacent parts of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> there was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Sultana which had been a cast Wench of Sultan <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> who after his death, having been married to some Pasha, obtained her release from the old Seraglio, and being also a Widow by the death of this Husband, had liberty to take her habitation on the Banks of the <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> or where she thought fit. This Lady was called <hi>Soltana Sporcha,</hi> in Turkish <note place="margin">The History of <hi>Soltana Spor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha.</hi>

                        <hi>Mordar:</hi> how she came to be so nominated I cannot tell, perhaps some Italian Pages of the Court might in respect to her way of living impose this Name upon her, for she was no other than a Bawd, or something worse, making it her Profession to buy young Girls, and to educate them in singing, dancing, and in all the ways which best accomplish Courtisans. Amongst this Train of Scholars, she had one more brisk and aery than the others which could sing, and dance, and prate incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and was so quick in her Reparties, that she greatly delighted the Pasha's and Lords, whose pleasures she attended, bringing from them considerable Gifts and Presents to the enriching of her self and Mistress; and became so much the talk of the Court, that at length the report of her arrived the ears of the Grand Signior, who being also desirous to injoy some divertisement by the pranks of this witty Girl, sent to the Sultana one of the black Eunuchs for her: which Imperial Command she not daring to disobey, consigned her with great submission into the hands of the Messenger; but with this caution, that she humbly desired the Sultan not to make any attempt on her Chastity, in regard she was both a Virgin and a Free-woman. The Grand Signior having pleased himself with the wantonness of this Wench, began to take a fancy to her, and resolved to take her into the Seraglio; but she shewing a kind of nicety and coiness, the Grand Signior, who perhaps was better accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated, sent her back again to her Mistress, reslecting (as was suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) with some disgust on the cautions which accompanied her. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened not long after, that this Girl exercising her Art in the presence of some great Persons, one <hi>Chesmé</hi> Aga, a Bosnian by Nation, Captain of the Great Viziers Guard, a stout and valiant man, happening to be a Spectator one night, became unfortunately enamoured of her, and from that time not being able to remove the impression she had made in his heart, resolved, if possible, to make her his Wife, and to that end made his affections known and his intentions of Marriage, both to her and to her Mistress. The Girl was well enough pleased to become the Wife of so honourable a Person; but the Sultana unwilling to lose the profit and benesit she daily brought her in, refused the Match, declaring, That she was a Slave, and not at her own disposal, and therefore in no capacity of bestowing her self any way without her consent. This impediment giving a stop to the Marriage, put the two Lovers on plots and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances in what manner to injoy each other, and Love being ingenious, quickly found out a means to bring them together; for the Girl esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping from her Mistress, lodged her self in those Chambers which her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had found for her. And being now missed, none but <hi>Chesme</hi> Aga was charged with her, of whom she complained to the Grand Signior, and cited him before his Master the Great Vizier to answer for her; but he denying to know any thing of her, and no witness appearing against him, all farther proceedings were superseded for the present: But <hi>Soltana Sporcha</hi> keeping watchful spies upon all the motions of <hi>Chesmé</hi> Aga, at length found him and his Mistress together, and by the Authority of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:98602:220"/>
brought them both before the Vizier: to whom the Sultana sent a rude message, That <hi>Chesmé</hi> Aga should be punished, and that her Slave should be returned. The Vizier hereof acquainted the Grand Signior, and gave him to understand the message which the Sultana had sent him, desiring to know what punishment he was pleased should be inflicted on them. In which interim <hi>Chesmé</hi> Aga told the Vizier, That he expected no other than a sentence of death from the Grand Signior, only he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired that his beloved Mistress might be spared, for he was sure he should live in her. It was not long before the fatal Decree came for putting <hi>Chesmé</hi> Aga to death, and sending the Woman to the Seraglio, which was immediately executed; which act might seem to denote a natural cruelty in the Sultan, being in reality very severe, though the whole course of his Reign hath been more gentle and mild than of any of the Ottoman Emperours; only this fact proceeded rather from disdain than thirst of blood, being angry that this Girl should prefer the Love of one of his Vassals before the Honours of the Seraglio, and that her Mistress the Soltana should charm him with a lye of her being free, when she was no other than a slave, and not long before bought for an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable price.</p>
                     <p>Not long after this, and towards the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> or 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> when the Sun was come to the Equinoctial, the Grand Signior prepared to depart. The rumour of which displeasing and making sad the peoples <note place="margin">The Grand Signior returns again to <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anople.</hi>
                        </note> hearts, as much as his presence before comforted them, it was given out, That the Grand Signior intended to return with the Spring, and divide the consolation, which his residence produced, between the two Regal Cities, and for an evidence thereof, he ordered a Platform to be laid for erecting a new Seraglio at <hi>Scutari,</hi> and the Vizier designed another at <hi>Bezick-rash,</hi> and the Palaces of the Pasha's and great Men were all putting into a way of Reparation, which for some time amused and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented the minds of the Commonalty.</p>
                     <p>About the beginning of <hi>October</hi> the Grand Signior set forward towards <hi>Adrianople,</hi> being accompanied with the Mosayp, which is his Favourite, and <hi>Kara Mustapha</hi> who was his Chimacam, taking his recreation by the way in Hunting; but the Great Vizier <hi>Achmet</hi> Pasha continuing still sick of his Dropsie and Jaundice, took his Journey by Water as far as <hi>Selebrea</hi> for his better ease, and thence proceeding in a Horse-litter to <hi>Churlu,</hi> which is the half-way to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> on the 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>October</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired his last; his Disease, though heightned by Wine and hot Spirits, <note place="margin">The Death of the Great Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier <hi>Achmet.</hi>
                        </note> yet was in some part hereditary, his Father dying of the Dropsie. His Body was on the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> brought back again in a Coach to <hi>Constantinople</hi> with a small Attendance, and buried in the same Sepulchre with his Father. He <note place="margin">His Character.</note> was a Person (for I have seen him often, and knew him well) of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle stature, of a black beard, and brown complexion, something short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sighted, which caused him to knit his brows and pore very intently when any strange person entred to his presence: he was inclining to be fat, and grew corpulent towards his latter days. If we consider his age when he first took upon him this important Charge, the Enemies his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had created him, the contentions he had with the <hi>Valede Sultana</hi> or the Queen-Mother, and the Arts he had used to reconcile the affections of these great Personages, and conserve himself in the unalterable esteem of his Soveraign to the last hour of his death, there is none but must judge him to have deserved the Character of a prudent and politick
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:98602:220"/>
Person. If we consider how few were put to death, and what inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Mutinies or Rebellions happened in any part of the Empire du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Government, it will afford us a clear evidence and proof of his gentleness and moderation beyond the example of former times; for certainly he was not a Person who delighted in bloud, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of an humour far different from the temper of his Father; He was generous, and free from Avarice, a rare Vertue in a Turk! He was educated in the Law, and therefore greatly addicted to all the Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of it, and in the Administration of that sort of Justice very pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual and severe; He was very observant of the Capitulations between our King and the Grand Signior, being ready to do Justice upon any corrupt Minister, who pertinaciously violated and transgressed them, of which I could give several instances, but these being improper for this place, are only in general to be mentioned with due gratitude in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to his Memory. As to his behaviour towards the neighbouring Princes, there may, I believe, be fewer examples of his breach of Faith, than what his Predecessours have given in a shorter time of Rule. In his Wars abroad he was successful, having upon every expedition en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged the Bounds of the Empire; He overcame <hi>Newhawsel</hi> or <hi>Oywar,</hi> and laid thereunto a considerable part of <hi>Hungary,</hi> which to this day continues subject, and pays contribution to the Turk.</p>
                     <p>He concluded the War with <hi>Venice</hi> after twenty seven years continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, by an intire and total subjection of the Island of <hi>Candia,</hi> having sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued that impregnable Fortress, which by the rest of the World was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed invincible.</p>
                     <p>He won <hi>Kemenitz,</hi> the Key of <hi>Poland,</hi> where the Turks had been frequently baffled, and laid <hi>Ukrania</hi> to the Empire; reducing the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacks, those mortal Enemies, to subjection, and to a desire of taking on them the Ottoman Yoke: and finally, ho imposed a new Tribute on all <hi>Poland.</hi> After all which Glories he dyed in the 47<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of his Age, and 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year and 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of his Government; a short time, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider it, for such great actions; howsoever, if we measure his triumphs, rather than count his years, though he might seem to have lived but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to his Prince and People, yet certainly to himself he could not dye more seasonable, nor in a greater height and eminency of Glory. <hi>Vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque Principi, &amp; Reipublicae parum, sibi certè satis suae<expan>

                     </p>
                     <p>The Great Vizier having in this manner expired his last breath, the Seal was immediately carried by his Brother to the Grand Signior, who upon Receipt thereof, according to common expectation, conferred the same on <hi>Kara Mustapha</hi> Pasha, who had for so many years formerly exercised the Office of Chimacam, which is as much as Deputy to the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Kara Mustapha</hi> made Vizier.</note> Great Vizier, of whom in other places we gave a Character of being a wise and experienced Person, of a smooth behaviour, and a great Courtier; agreeable to which temper of mind, so soon as he attained this promotion, he sent an obliging and courteous Message to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the deceased Vizier, condoling with them the death of their Master, promising to take them and their Concernments into his Care and Protection; according whereunto he advanced <hi>Solyman</hi> Kahya (who was the late Vizier's Substitute, and for some years had managed all Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs) to the Office of Embrahore, which is chief Master of the Grand Signiors Horse, and is a place not only of honour, but of great security.
<pb facs="tcp:98602:221"/>
He that was his own Kahya he made a Vizier of the Bench, and Chima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam in the same manner as he was to <hi>Achmet</hi> Vizier; by which point of policy he seemed to have strengthened himself against all Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, for having two Creatures of his own so well disposed; one near the Person of his Prince, who would be able to do him all good Offices; and the other (whensoever the Wars or other occasions should cause him to be absent from the Royal Presence) might supply his place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out attempting to supplant him. The Kapisler-Kahyasee, or Master of the Ceremonies to the late Vizier, he made his own Kahya, and all the other Agas which depended on that Court, he received into his own ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; so that in effect there seemed, by this great chance of Mortality, to be little other alteration in the Court, than of the single person of the deceased Vizier; of whose Memory, that the Grand Signior might evidence the love and esteem that he retained, he did not intermeddle or appropriate unto himself any part of his Estate, or disanulled his Testament; but resigned all into the hands of his Relations, challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging no share or proportion thereof: And whereas the Vizier left no Children, the Estate fell to his Brother and Sisters, who to evidence their Devotion to Religion, and good will to the Publick, and to please the eyes of the envious World, conferred on <hi>Mecha</hi> the Rent of the new Custom house, the Besasteen, and new Chan built at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and finished in the year 1677.</p>
                     <p>At this first change there were rumours, that the new Vizier had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun his Government in blood, having cut off several Heads lately in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; but all was false, and only grounded on a displeasure which he was known to have conceived against certain persons. Only one act he performed rather of justice than severity, having cut off one of the Pay-masters of the Exchequer for false Money. The occasion was this: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Muletiers having received money from the Exchequer in Venetian Zechins, and finding several of them false, returned them again, but could not prevail to have them changed; whereupon having made their Memorial thereof, they carried them to the Vizier, and upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, the Pay-master declared, That he received them from the Great <hi>Ibrahim</hi> Han-ogli, who being for that Cause sent for and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, was put into a fear, which proved as dangerous to him as a Disease, the apprehensions of Death being worse than the reality; but the Great Tefterdar soon cleared him of this Accusation, having attested, That to his knowledge the money received from him was good, and disposed on other occasions; so that the whole blame lying now on the Pay-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and upon farther search more of the same stamp being found in his hands, he deservedly suffered the punishment of Death, the which had likewise been inflicted on another Officer of the same rank, but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found so culpable as the other, he was permitted to redeem his life with forty Purses of Money, or twenty thousand Dollars.</p>
                     <p>Thus far we have seen the gentle and smooth behaviour of the present <note place="margin">Alterations with the new Vizier.</note> Vizier towards the Friends, Relations, and Servants of the deceased, and with what Acts of Justice he began his Government. But, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, on a sudden the face of the whole Court was changed, every Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer thereof putting on a Countenance of fierceness, pride, and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, beyond the manner and custom lately practised. For the Great Vizier took on himself the State and Grandeur of the Sultan, (the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess being as difficult to him as to his Master) his Kahya that of the
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:98602:221"/>
Vizier, and so every inferiour Officer advanced himself into a fancy of possessing the next and immediate Degree above him. This haughty behaviour had a more particular influence on the Ministers and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives of Foreign Princes, whose Interpreters were not admitted, as formerly, to private Audiences or Conferences about their Affairs, but only at the Publick Divan, where their Arzes or Memorials were to be preferred in the same manner as was practised by the Subjects of the Countrey, and those of conquered Nations, who petition for Justice. The which abasement was not only cast on the Interpreters, but on the Persons of the Representatives themselves: an example of which we have in the French Ambassadour; who coming at the time appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to receive his Audience of the Vizier, was forced to expect a long time before he could have admittance, and then entering into the Chamber of Audience, was rudely crouded, and rushed upon by a Crew of unmannerly Chaouses, who no otherwise regarded the Person of the Ambassador, than if he had been one of the Grooms or Lacquies. Being come to the Seat of Audience, the Ambassadour observed, That the Stool for the Great Vizier was set upon the Soffrá, and that for Him below, or at the foot of it; the which being an unusual and unpractised diminution of the ancient honour given formerly to Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours, he ordered one of his Servants, To set it again on the Soffrá equal with that of the Vizier's; the which being done, was again brought down by one of the Vizier's Pages, and placed as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; whereupon, the Ambassadour seizing the Stool with his own hand, carried it on the Soffrá, and sate upon it; which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to the Vizier, then in his retiring Chamber, he sent twice to him to remove, letting him know, That unless the Stool were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into the Place appointed by him, he would not appear in the Chamber of Audience. Whereunto his Excellency returned this pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Answer, That the Vizier might dispose of his Chair as he pleased, but not of his Person. In which Interim the Chaous-bashee came in, roaring out, <hi>Calder, Calder,</hi> which is, Take it away, Take it away, (meaning the Stool) at which noise the Ambassadour arising to see what the matter was, had the Stool taken from under him; whereat being greatly enraged, he threw out of the Room in a high passion, and causing the Presents which he brought to be again returned with him, he mounted his Horse, and departed.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards it was intimated unto the English Ambassadour, That he might, if he pleased, receive Audience of the Great Vizier; But his Excellency, understanding in what manner the French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour had been treated, excused his Going, on pretence of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition of health. Howsoever, the Venetian Bailo, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Genoua</hi> were contented to be admitted unto Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience on those terms which the Vizier was pleased to allow. And though during the time that he was Chimacam, and bore other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Offices, and Charges of Trust, his behaviour was gentle, affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and civil; yet I fear, that now having changed his Office, he will have altered his humour, and that his Greatness will have encreased his Pride, Avarice, and Fierceness: thus, no man knows what another will be, when he shall enter into power.

And as <hi>Magistratus indicat Virum,</hi> so in the actions of his management the temper and constitution of this great Person will be discovered.
