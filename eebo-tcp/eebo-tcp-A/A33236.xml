            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Hobbes</hi> hath publish'd in
his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> (p. 114.)
<hi>That a banished Subject,
during the Banishment, is
not a Subject. And</hi> (pag.
165.) <hi>that a banish'd man is
a lawful Enemy of the Common-wealth that banish'd
him, as being no more a member of the same.</hi> I
thank God, from the time that I found my self
under the insupportable burden of Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
<pb facs="tcp:60912:3"/>
displeasure, and under the in famous brand
of Banishment, I have not thought my self one
minute absolv'd in the least degree from the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the strictest duty to your Person, and of
the highest gratitude that the most oblig'd Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
can stand bound in, or from the affection
that a true and faithful Englishman still ow's and
must still pay to his Country. And as I have
every day since praied for the safety of your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and he prosperity of your Affairs, with
the same devotion and integrity as for the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my own Soul; so I have exercis'd my
thoughts in nothing so much, as how to spend
my time in doing somwhat that may prove for
Your Majesties Service and Honor. And therefore
assoon as I had finished (as far as I am able, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the supply of those Memorials and Records
which are fit to be enquired into) a work at least
recommended, if not enjoin'd, to me by your
Blessed Father, and approv'd, and in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
perus'd by Your Majesty, (which I hope
will be to the Honor of His Majesties memory,
and your own magnanimous Sufferings) I could
not think of any thing in my power to perform of
<pb facs="tcp:60912:3"/>
more importance to your Majesties service, then
to answer Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s <hi>Leviathan,</hi> and confute the
doctrine therein contain'd, so pernicious to the
Soveraign Power of Kings, and destructive to the
affection and allegiance of Subjects; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
which, by the protection the Author hath
from the Act of Indemnity, and I know not what
other connivance, it is manifest enough, that many
odious Opinions, the seed whereof was first sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in that Book, have bin since propagated, to the
extreme scandal of the Government in Church
and State. I have often heretofore, when I had
liberty for that presumtion, advertis'd Your
Majesty, of the wickedness of very many of the
Principles upon which that whole Book is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
and was not without some hope of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
with Your Majesty to give your Self the
leisure, and the trouble, to peruse and examine
some parts of it, in confidence that they would
no sooner be read, then detested by you; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the frequent reciting of loose and disjointed
Sentences, and bold Inferences, for the novelty
and pleasantness of the Expressions, the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Gentleman for parts and Learning,
<pb facs="tcp:60912:4"/>
with his confidence in Conversation, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the humor and inclination of the Time to all
kind of Paradoxes, have too much prevail'd with
many of great Wit and Faculties, without read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the context, or observation of the consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to believe his Propositions to be more inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
or less mischievous, then upon a more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate
perusal they will find them to be; and the
love of his person and company, have rendred
the iniquity of his Principles less discernible.
Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> consulted too few Authors, and made
use of too few Books; the benefit of which my
present condition has also depriv'd me of; altho
the want which I complain most of, is of Friends
to examine and controul, upon the reading any
impropriety or indecency in my Expressions, or
defect of vigor in my Ratiocination; towards
the weighing whereof I have had little contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
However, I presume to think, that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote,
how weak spirited soever, is seasonable
to be administred, to expel or allay the poison that
is still working very furiously. And if I know any
thing of the constitution of the Government of
<hi>England,</hi> and of the nature and temper of that
<pb facs="tcp:60912:4"/>
faithful Nation, the publishing of his poor Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
may be of some use and service to your
Majesty; that all the World may know, how much
you abhor all those extravagant and absurd Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges,
which no Christian Prince ever enjoied or
affected. The consideration of this only, hath
dispos'd me to expose my self to the licence of
the Tongues and Pens of all those, who will never
be without inclinations rather to insult upon my
Fortune, and to reproch my Person, then to
pity my Weakness, or rectifie my Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
If the prefixing your Majesties Name be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it, as if you would countenance so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced
and degraded a Person, or give any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
to a Work of which he is the Author,
doth not find your Majesties approbation; I have
appointed that presumtion to be declin'd, being
stedfastly resolv'd, by Gods Blessing, never to
displease You whil'st I live, or after I am dead;
and retaining still a hope, with some confidence
(which sustains my weak decaied Spirits) that
your Majesty will at some time call to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
my long and incorrupted Fidelity
to your Person, and your Service: and that tho

and to the advantage of their Antagonists;
since there are few Books which do not contain ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things which are true, and cannot, or need not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60912:6"/>
be contradicted. And considering withall, that those
Books have in all times don most mischief, and scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
abroad the most pernicious errors, in which the
Authors, by the Ornament of their Style, and the
pleasantness of their method, and subtilty of their
Wit, have from specious Premises, drawn their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful
and unwary Readers into unwarrantable O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
and Conclusions, being intoxicated with
terms and Allegorical expressions, which puzzel
their understandings, and lead them into perplexities,
from whence they cannot disentangle themselves;
I have proposed to my self, to make some Animad-versions
upon such particulars, as may in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
produce much mischief in the World; in a
Book of great Name, and which is entertain'd and
celebrated (at least enough) in the World; a Book
which contains in it good Learning of all kinds, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litely
extracted, and very wittily and cunningly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested,
in a very commendable method, and in a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
and pleasant Style: which hath prevailed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
too many, to swallow many new Tenets as
Maximes without chewing; which manner of diet
for the indisgestion Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> himself doth much
dislike. The thorough novelty (to which the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Age, if ever any, is too much inclin'd) of the
work, receives great credit and autority from the
known Name of the Author, a Man of excellent
parts, of great wit, some reading, and somwhat more
thinking; One who has spent many years in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
parts, and observation; understands the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as well as modern Languages, hath long had
the reputation of a great Philosopher and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematician,

with very many worthy and extraordinary Men,

to which, it may be, if he had bin more indulgent
in the more vigorous part of his life, it might have
had a greater influence upon the temper of his
mind, whereas age seldom submits to those que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,
enquiries, and contradictions, which the

in the company of other Men of the same, or
of as good faculties; for want whereof his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
constitution, with age, contracted such a
morosity, that doubting and contradicting Men
were never grateful to him. In a word, Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>
is one of the most ancient acquaintance I have in
the World, and of whom I have alwaies had a great
esteem, as a Man who besides his eminent parts
of Learning and Knowledg, hah bin alwaies look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

and I had the honor to introduce those, in
whose perfections he seemed to take much delight,
and whose memory he seems most to extol, first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his acquaintance. In all which respects, both of
the Author and the work, it cannot reasonably
be imagined, that any vanity hath transported me,
who know my self so incompetent for the full

read several Answers and Reflexions, made by Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

(though they have very pregnantly discover'd
many gross errors, and grosser over-sights in those
parts of Science in which Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> would be
thought to excel, which are like to put him more

for many years in the public Administration of

an invitation and obligation upon me, to give a

for my King and Country, is not less then
it hath ever bin, when it was better interpreted,
by giving warning to both, of the danger they are
in, by the seditious Principles of this Books, that
they may in time provide for their Security by
their abolishing and extirpating those, and the
like excesses. And as it could not reasonably be
expected, that such a Book would be answer'd in
the time when it was published, which had bin to

afterwards men thought it would be too much ill
nature to call men in question for what they had said
in ill times, and for saying which they had a plenary
Indulgence and Absolution. And I am still of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that even of those who have read his Book, and
not frequented his Company, there are many, who
being delighted with some new notions, and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
and clear Style throughout the Book, have not
taken notice of those down-right Conclusions, which
overthrow or undermine all those Principles of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
which have preserv'd the Peace of this
Kingdom through so many Ages, even from the
time of its first Institution; or restor'd it to Peace,
when it had at some times bin interrupted: and
much less of those odious insinuations, and pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some Texts of Scripture, which do dishonor,
and would destroy the very Essence of the Religion
of Christ. And when I called to mind the good
acquaintance that had bin between us, and what
I had said to many who I knew had inform'd him of
it, and which indeed I had sent to himself upon
the first publishing of his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> I thought

why I had entertained so evil an opinion of his

               <p>When the Prince went first to <hi>Paris</hi> from <hi>Ier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey,</hi>
and My Lords <hi>Capel</hi> and <hi>Hopton</hi> stayed in

that Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> who was then at <hi>Paris,</hi> had
printed his Book <hi>De Cive</hi> there. I writ to D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Earles,</hi>
who was then the Princes Chaplain, and his Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
to remember me kindly to Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> with
whom I was well acquainted, and to desire him to

                  <hi>Sid. Godolphin</hi> (who had bin kill'd in the late War)
had left him a Legacy of two hundred pounds. The
Book was immediately sent to me by Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi>
with a desire that I would tell him, whether I was sure
that there was such a Legacy, and how he migh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
take notice of it to receive it. I sent him word that
he might depend upon it for a truth, and that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
that if he found some way secretly (to the
end there might be no public notice of it in regard
of the Parliament) to demand it of his Brother
<hi>Francis Godolphin,</hi> (who in truth had told me of it)
he would pay it. This information was the ground
of the Dedication of this Book to him, whom Mr.
<hi>Hobbes</hi> had never seen.</p>
               <p>When I went some few years after from <hi>Holland</hi>
with the King (after the Murder of his Father) to
<hi>Paris,</hi> from whence I went shortly his Majesties
Ambassador into <hi>Spain,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> visited me, and
told me that Mr. <hi>Godolphin</hi> confessed the Legacy,
and had paid him one hundred pounds, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to pay the other in a short time; for all which
he thank'd me, and said he owed it to me, for he had
never otherwise known of it. When I return'd
from <hi>Spain</hi> by <hi>Paris</hi> he frequently came to me,
and told me his Book (which he would call <hi>Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than)</hi>
was then Printing in <hi>England,</hi> and that he
receiv'd every week a Sheet to correct, of which
he shewed me one or two Sheets, and thought it
would be finished within little more then a moneth;
and shewed me the Epistle to Mr. <hi>Godolphin</hi> which
he meant to set before it, and read it to me, and
concluded, that he knew when I read his Book I
would not like it, and thereupon mention'd some
of his Conclusions; upon which I asked him, why
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60912:9"/>
he would publish such doctrine: to which, after a
discourse between jest and earnest upon the
Subject, he said, <hi>The truth is, I have a mind to
go home.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Within a very short time after I came into
<hi>Flanders,</hi> which was not much more then a moneth
from the time that Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> had conferred with
me, <hi>Leviathan</hi> was sent to me from <hi>London;</hi> which
I read with much appetite and impatience. Yet
I had scarce finish'd it, when Sir <hi>Charles Cavendish</hi>
(the noble Brother of the Duke of <hi>Newcastle</hi> who
was then at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and a Gentleman of all the
accomplishments of mind that he wanted of body,
being in all other respects a wonderful Person)
shewed me a Letter he had then receiv'd from Mr.
<hi>Hobbes,</hi> in which he desir'd he would let him know
freely what my opinion was of his Book. Upon
which I wished he would tell him, that I could not
enough wonder, that a Man, who had so great a
reverence for Civil Government, that he resolv'd
all Wisdom and Religion it self into a simple
obedience and submission to it, should publish a
Book, for which, by the constitution of any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
now establish'd in Europe, whether Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical
or Democratical, the Author must be
punish'd in the highest degree, and with the most
severe penalties. With which answer (which Sir
<hi>Charles</hi> sent to him) he was hot pleased<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and found
afterwards when I return'd to the King to <hi>Paris,</hi>
that I very much censur'd his Book, which he had
presented, engross'd in <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>llam</hi> in a marvellous
fair hand, to the King; and likewise found my
judgment so far confirmed, that few daies before
I came thither, he was compell'd secretly to fly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60912:9"/>
out of <hi>Paris,</hi> the Justice having endeavour'd to
apprehend him, and soon after escap'd into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
where he never receiv'd any disturbance.
After the Kings return he came frequently to the
Court, where he had too many Disciples; and
once visited me. I receiv'd him very kindly, and
invited him to see me often, but he heard from
so many hands that I had no good opinion of his
Book, that he came to me only that one time:
and methinks I am in a degree indebted to him, to
let him know some reason, why I look with so much
prejudice upon his Book, which hath gotten him
so much credit and estimation with some other
men.</p>
               <p>I am not without some doubt, that I shall in
this discourse, which I am now engaged in, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
in a way I do very heartily dislike, and
frequently censure in others, which is sharpness
of Language, and too much reproching the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
against whom I write; which is by no means
warrantable, when it can be possibly avoided with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
wronging the truth in debate. Yet I hope no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
hath fallen from my Pen, which implies the
least undervaluing of Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> his Person, or his
Parts. But if he, to advance his opinion in Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
too imperiously reproches all men who do
not consent to his Doctrine, it can hardly be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided,
to reprehend so great presumtion, and to
make his Doctrines appear as odious as they ought
to be esteemed: and when he shakes the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Christian Religion, by his new and bold
Interpretations of Scripture, a man can hardly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
saying, He hath no Religion, or that he is
no good Christian; and escape endeavouring to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60912:10"/>
and expose the poison that lies hid and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celed.
Yet I have chosen, rather to pass by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his enormous sayings with light expressions, to
make his Assertions ridiculous, then to make his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
odious, for infusing such destructive Doctrine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the minds of men, who are already too licentious
in judging the Precepts, or observing the Practice of
Christianity.</p>

               <head>The Survey of Mr. Hobbes's Introduction.</head>
               <p>IT is no wonder that Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> runs into so
many mistakes and errors throughout his
whole discourse of the nature of Government
from the nature of Mankind, when he laies so wrong
a foundation in the very entrance and Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Book, as to make a judgment of the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and Nature of all other Men, by his own ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
of himself; and believes, (pag. 2.) <hi>that
by looking into himself, and considering what he doth
when he do's think, opine, reason, hope, fear, &amp;c.
and upon what grounds,</hi> he shall thereby read, and
know what are the thoughts and passions of all
other men upon the like occasions. And indeed by
his distinction in the very subsequent words (pag.
2.) between <hi>the similitude of passions; and the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
of the object of the passions,</hi> and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
that <hi>the constitution individual and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
education</hi> do make so great a difference and
disparity, he reduces that general Proposition to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnify
so very little, that he leaves very little to be
observed, and very few Persons competent to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve.
We have too much cause to believe, that
much the major part of mankind do not think at all,
are not endued with reason enough to opine, or
think of what they did last, or what they are to do
next, have no reflexion, without which there can
be no thinking to this purpose: and the number is
much greater of those who know not how to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<hi>the smilitude of the objects from the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:60912:11"/>
nor enough understand the nature of fear,
as it is distinguish'd from the object that is fear'd:
so that none of these Persons (which constitute a
vast number) are capable to make that observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which must produce that knowledg which may
enable them to judg of all the World. And how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
there are left, who are fit from their <hi>individual
constitutions or particular educations,</hi> and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the corruption introduced <hi>by dissembling,
lying, counterfeiting, and erroneous Doctrine,</hi> to make
that judgment, I leave to Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> to determine.
And 'tis probable, that those very few may conclude,
that what they do <hi>when they think, opine, reason,
hope, fear,</hi> contributes very little to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>what the thoughts and passions of other men
are.</hi> And they may the rather be induced to make
that conclusion, since there are so very few who
think and opine as Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> doth, and whose
hopes and fears are like his, with reference to the
objects, or the nature it self of those passions, and
that the dissimilitude is greater between the passions
themselves, then between the objects; and that men
are not more unlike each other in their faces, or in
their clothes, then in their thinking, hoping, and
fearing. Since then Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> founds so much
of his whole discourse upon the verity and Evidence
of this first Proposition, that we shall very often
have occasion to resort to it as we keep him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
and since the same seems to me to be very far
from being <hi>the true Key to open the cipher of other
mens thoughts;</hi> it will not be amiss to examine, and
insist a little longer on this Conclusion, that we
may discern whether all, or any of us are endued
with such an infallible Faculty, that we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60912:11"/>
what the thoughts and passions of other
men are, by a strict observation and consideration
of our own thoughts and passions; which would
very much enable us to countermine and disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
each others thoughts and passions, and would
be a high point of wisdom. In the disquisition
whereof, that we may not entangle the passion and
the object together, for want of skill to severe them,
it may not be amiss to suppose the same passion
to be in two several men whose passions have the
same object, and then consider whether they are
like to discover each others thoughts and passions,
their hopes and their fears, by each mans looking
into himself, and considering what he do's when he
thinks, hopes, or fears. If Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> loved, to as great
a height as his passion can rise to, the same object
that is likewise loved by another, he would hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be able to make any judgment of the others love
by his own; and upon a mutual confession and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
their passions would not be found to be
the same. If Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> and some other man were
both condemn'd to death, (which is the most for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
thing Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> can conceive) the other
could no more by looking into himself know Mr.
<hi>Hobbe</hi>'s present thoughts, and the extent of his
fear, then he could, by looking in his face, know
what he hath in his Pocket. Not only the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
complexions, and constitutions of the body,
the different educations, and climates dispose the
affections and passions of men to different objects,
but have a great influence upon the passions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
As the fears, so the hopes of men are as
unlike as their gate, and meen. If a Sang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ine,
and a Melancholic man hope the same thing, their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60912:12"/>
hopes are no more alike each others, then their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions
are; the hope of the one retaining still som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
like despair, whilst the hope of the other
looks like fruition: so little similitude there is in
the passions themselves without any relation to their
objects. That a man of great courage, and a very
cowardly man have not the same countenance, and
presence of mind in an approch of danger, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
not from the ones liking to be killed more
then the others, but rather from the difference of
their natural courage. But let us suppose a man
of courage, and a coward equally guilty, or equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
innocent (that there may be no difference from
the operation of conscience) to be brought to die
together by a judgment which they cannot avoid,
and so to be equally without hope of life (and death
in Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s judgment is equally terrible to all,
and with equal care to be avoided, or resisted.) How
comes it to pass, that one of these undergo's death
with no other concernment, then as if he were going
any other journy, and the other with such confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and trembling, that he is even without life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he dies; if it were true that all men fear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
upon the like occasion? There will be the
same uncertainty in concluding what others do, by
observing what we our selves do, when we think,
opine, or reason. How shall that man, who thinks
deliberately, opines modestly, and reasons dispas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionately,
and by his excellent temper satisfies his
own judgment in a conclusion, in which at the same
time he discerns others may differ from him: I say,
how shall such a man by his own way of reasoning
judg another mans, who usually thinks precipitately,
opines arrogantly, and reasons superciliously, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60912:12"/>
concludes imperiously that man to be mistaken, who
determines otherwise then he do's? To conclude,
Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> might as naturally have introduced his
unreasonable Doctrine of the Similitude of the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
from the wisdom that he saies is acquired by
the reading of Men, as from his method of reading
ones self. That saying of <hi>Nosce teipsum,</hi> in the sense
of <hi>Solon</hi> who prescribed it, was a sober truth, but
was never intended as an expedient to discover the
similitude of the thoughts of other men by what he
found in himself, but as the best means to suppress
and destroy that pride and self-conceit, which might
temt him to undervalue other men, and to plant that
modesty and humility in himself, as would preserve
him from such presumtion.</p>

where somwhat else is talk'd of: for thereby he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
and disposes the fancy to be pleased with them
in a more proper and important place. No man
would have imagin'd, that in a Philosophical Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of Dreams, and Fayries, and Ghosts, and
Goblins, Exorcisms, Crosses, and Holy-water, he
would have taken occasion to have reproved <hi>Iob</hi> for
saying, that <hi>the inspiration of the Almighty giveth
men understanding,</hi> Job 32. 8. which can be no good
expression, if it be incongruity to say, <hi>that good
thoughts are inspired into a man by God:</hi> and 'tis pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not better weigh his words,
when he said, <hi>that we are not sufficient of our selves
to think any thing of our selves, but our sufficiency is of
God,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 5. or when he said to the <hi>Philippians,
that it is God which worketh in you both to will, and to do
of his good pleasure,</hi> Phil. 2. 13. and that St. <hi>Iohn</hi> had
not bin better advised, when he said, <hi>He that commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
sin, is of the Devil,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 8. Upon any of which
Texts a man can hardly enlarge in discourse, without
saying, that good thoughts <hi>are inspir'd, or infus'd</hi>
(which he thinks he hath made the more ridiculous,
by turning into other words of the like signification)
<hi>by God, and evil thoughts by the devil,</hi> which in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
are <hi>amongst the many words making nothing
understood;</hi> whereas there are few expressions in which
the sense of the speaker is better understood, or by
which the sense of the Apostles can be made more
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60912:14"/>
clear then by those expressionss But this momical
mention of the power and goodness of God, and of
the Devils activity and malignity, in a place so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
and unnatural for those reflexions, will the
more incline his Disciples to undervalue those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
notions of the goodness and assistance of God,
and of the malice and vigilance of the Devil; and
by making themselves merry with that proper and
devout custom of speaking, and the natural results
from thence, by degrees to undervalue those other
conceptions of Religion and Piety, which would
restrain and controul the licentious imagination of
the excellency of their own understandings; and
prepare them to believe, that all the discourses of
Sanctity, and the obligations of Christianity, and
the essentials of a Church, Faith, and Obedience to
the dictates of Gods Spirit, are but the artifice and
invention of Church-men, to advance their own
pomp and worldly interest, and that Heaven and Hell
are but words to flatter or terrifie men; at least, that
the places of either are so situated, and have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
extent or degree of pain and pleasure, then he
had thought fit to assign to them towards the end of
his <hi>Leviathan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is his instance of the train of imaginations,
in his third Chapter, less wonderful. And indeed,
Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> had the more reason for his opinion of the
similitude of thoughts, and that by looking into
himself when he thinks, and upon what grounds, he
can thereby know the thoughts of other men, when
he was with the velocity of a thought, in a moment
of time, able to decipher that impertinent Question,
What was the value of a Roman penny; and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
a succession of thoughts in the Enquirer, the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60912:14"/>
last of which determined in the resolution of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
up the King: which was so rare a faculty,
that such a similitude of thoughts cannot be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be in other men. And since erroneous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
have so great an influence upon the minds of
men, as to corrupt the natural motives, he knows
best whether he had not before this formed his new
Scheme of Loyalty, and digested all those imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
towards the dissolution of Allegiance, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding
the obligation of all Oaths; which if he had
don, he had the Key ready to decipher by, and
might easily discover that which no man in <hi>England</hi>
could discover who had not the same Key.</p>

very little more to the advancement of any

<hi>Hobbes</hi> hath don to the reformation or improvement
of Philosophy and Policy. Yet I may reasonably
say so much on their behalf, that if Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> may
take upon him to translate all those terms of Art (the
proper signification whereof is unanimously under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
and agreed between all who use them, and
which in truth are a cipher to which all men of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60912:16"/>

Language by the assistance of <hi>Ryders Dictionary,</hi> he
hath found a way to render and expose the worthiest
Professors of any Science, and all Science it self to
the cheap laughter of all illiterate men; which is
contrary to Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s own rule and determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>(pag. 17.)</hi> where he saies, <hi>That when a man upon
the hearing any Speech, hath those thoughts which the

it.</hi> And surely the signification of words and terms,
is no less ordain'd and constituted by custom and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation,
then by Grammar and Etymologies. If
it were otherwise, Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> himself would be as
much exposed to ignorant Auditors, when he reads
a Lecture upon the Optics, or even in his ador'd Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry,
if a pleasant Translator should render all his
terms as literally, as he hath don the Title of the
sixth Chapter of <hi>Suarez:</hi> for every Age, as new
things happen, finds new words in all Languages to
signifie them. The Civilians, who are amongst the

               <p>I Do acknowledg, that in the tenth, eleventh, and

said: and tho somethings as ill, with reference to

between the Priests of the Gentiles, <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi>
the Schole-men, and the Clergy of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions,
to defame, pervert, and corrupt Religion:
yet he resumes that Argument so frequently, that
I shall chuse to examine the reason and justice of all
his Allegations rather in another place, then upon
either of these three Chapters; to which I shall only
add, that according to his natural delight in Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of all kinds, in Religion as well as Policy, he
hath supplied the Gentiles with a new God, which
was never before found in any of their Catalogues,
<hi>The God Chaos,</hi> (pag. 55.) to which he might as war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably
have made them an additional present of
his own Idol, <hi>Confusion.</hi> And he will as hardly find a
good autority for the aspersion with which he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
the Policy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Common-wealth in
all its greatness and lustre, <hi>(pag. 57.) that it made no
scruple of tolerating any Religion whatsoever in the City
of</hi> Rome <hi>it self, unless it had somthing in it that could
not consist with their Civil Government.</hi> Which how
untrue soever, was a very unseasonable intimation of
the wisdom of <hi>Olivers</hi>'s Politics, at that time when he
published his <hi>Leviathan:</hi> whereas in truth, that great
People were not more solicitous in any thing, then
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60912:17"/>
in preserving the unity and integrity of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
from any mixtures: and the Institution of the
Office of <hi>Pontifex Maximus</hi> was principally out of
that jealousie, and that he might carefully watch
that no alteration or innovation might be made in
their Religion. And tho they had that general awe
for Religion, that they would not suffer the Gods of
their Enemies, whom they did not acknowledg for
Gods, to be rudely treated and violated; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they both punished their Consul for having
robb'd the Temple of <hi>Proserpine,</hi> and caused the full
damages to be restored to the injur'd Goddess: yet
they neither acknowledg'd her Divinity, nor suffer'd
her to have a Temple, or to have any Devotion
paid to her within their Dominions; nor indeed any
other God or Goddess to be ador'd, then those to
whom Sacrifices were made by the Autority of the
State. Nor will Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> be able to name one
Christian Kingdom in the World, where it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
that the King hath not his Autority from
Christ, unless a Bishop Crown him; tho all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Kingdoms have had that reverence for Bishops,
as to assign the highest Ecclesiastical Functions to be
alwaies perform'd by them: but they well know the
King to have the same Autority in all respects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is crown'd, as after. And what extravagant
Power soever the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> hath in some evil
Conjunctures heretofore usurp'd, and would be as
glad of the like opportunities again; yet in those
Kingdoms where that Autority is own'd and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd,
there want not those who loudly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test

by a Pope, or that the Clergy and Regulars
shall be exemt from the Jurisdiction of their King.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60912:17"/>
And yet upon these unwarrantable suggestions, he
presumes to declare, That all the changes of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
may be attributed to one and the same Cause,
and that is, <hi>unpleasing Priests; and those not only amongst
Papists, but even in that Church that hath presumed most
of Reformation,</hi> by which he intends the Church of

               <p>THE thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and
sixteenth Chapters, will require a little more
disquisition, since under the pretence of
examining, or rather (according to his Prerogative)
of determining what the natural condition of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
is, he takes many things for granted which are
not true; as (<hi>pag.</hi> 60.) that <hi>Nature hath made all men
equal in the faculties of body and mind,</hi> and imputes
that to the Nature of Man in general, which is but
the infirmity of some particular man; and by a mist
of words, under the notion of explaining common
terms (the meaning whereof is understood by all
men, and which his explanation leaves less intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
then they were before) he dazles mens eies
from discerning those Fallacies upon which he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
his Structure, and which he reserves for his second
part. And whosoever looks narrowly to his prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory
Assertions, shall find such contradictions, as
must destroy the foundation of all his new Doctrine
in Government, of which some particulars shall be
mentioned anon. So that if his Maxims of one kind
were marshalled together, collected out of these
four Chapters, and applied to his other Maxims
which are to support his whole <hi>Leviathan,</hi> the one
would be a sufficient answer to the other; and so
many inconsistencies and absurdities would appear
between them, that they could never be thought
links of one chain; whereas he desires men should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60912:18"/>
all the Propositions in his Book to be a chain
of Consequences, without being in any degree wary
to avoid palpable contradictions, upon the presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Readers total resignation to his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
If it were not so, would any man imagine
that a man of Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s sagacity and provoking
humor, should in his fourth Page so imperiously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch

himself should in his sixty second Page, describing
the nature of foul weather, say, <hi>That it lieth not in
a shower or two of rain, but in an inclination thereto of

inanimate a thing as heavy Bodies, and inclination
did not imply as much of knowledg as appetite
doth? In truth, neither the one or the other word sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
in the before-mention'd instances, more then a
natural tendency to motion and alteration.</p>
               <p>When God vouchsafed to make man after his own
Image, and in his own Likeness, and took so much
delight in him, as to give him the command and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over all the Inhabitants of the Earth, the
Air, and the Sea, it cannot be imagin'd but that at
the same time he endued him with Reason, and all
the other noble Faculties which were necessary for
the administration of the Empire, and the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the several Species which were to succeed
the Creation; and therefore to uncreate him to such
a baseness and villany in his nature, as to make man
such a Rascal, and more a Beast in his frame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
then those he is appointed to govern, is a
power that God never gave to the Devil; nor hath
any body assum'd it, till Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> took it upon

him. Nor can any thing be said more contrary to
the Honor and Dignity of God Almighty, then that
he should leave his master workmanship, Man, in a
condition of War of every man against every man,
in such a condition of confusion, <hi>(p. 64.) That every
man hath a right to every thing, even to one anothers
body;</hi> inclin'd to all the malice, force and fraud that
may promote his profit or his pleasure, and without
any notions of, or instinct towards justice, honor,
or good nature, which only makes man-kind superior
to the beasts of the Wilderness. Nor had Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>
any other reason to degrade him to this degree of
Bestiality, but that he may be fit to wear those
Chains and Fetters which he hath provided for him.
He deprives man of the greatest happiness and glory
that can be attributed to him, who divests him of
that gentleness and benevolence towards other men,
by which he delights in the good fortune and
tranquillity that they enjoy, and makes him so far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

               <p>After such positive and magisterial Assertions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the dignity and probity of man-kind, and the
honor and providence of God Almighty, the instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and arguments given by him are very unweighty
and trivial to conclude the nature of man to be so
full of jealousie and malignity, as he would have it
believed to be, from that common practice of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection
and providence, which custom and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
hath introduced in human life. For men
shut their Chests in which their mony is, as well that
their servants or children may not know what they
have, as that it may be preserved from Thieves; and
they lock their doors that their Houses may not be
common; and ride arm'd, and in company, because
they know that there are ill men, who may be incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to do injuries if they find an opportunity. Nor
is a wariness to prevent the damage and injury that
Thieves and Robbers may do to any man, an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that mankind is in that mans opinion inclin'd
and disposed to commit those out-rages. If it be
known that there is one Thief in a City, all men have
reason to shut their doors and lock their chests: and
if there be two or three Drunkards in a Town, all
men have reason to go arm'd in the streets, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul
the violence or indignity they might receive
from them. Princes are attended by their Guards
in progress, and all their servants arm'd when they
hunt, without any apprehension of being assaulted;
custom having made it so necessary, that many men
are not longer without their Swords then they are
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60912:20"/>
without their Doublets, who never were jealous that
any man desir'd to hurt them. Nor will the instance
he gives of the Inhabitants in <hi>America,</hi> be more to
his purpose then the rest, since as far as we have any
knowledg of them, the savage People there live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a most intire subjection and slavery to their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Princes; who indeed for the most part live in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stility
towards each other, upon those contentions
which engage all other Princes in War, and which
Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> allows to be a just cause of War, jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
of each others Power to do them harm. And
these are the notable instances by which Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>
hath by his painful disquisition and investigation, in
the hidden and deep secrets of Nature, discover'd
that unworthy fear and jealousie to be inherent in
mankind, (<hi>pag.</hi> 63.) <hi>That the notions of right and wrong
have no place, that Force and Fraud are the two cardinal
V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or thine distinct, but that only to be every mans that he can
get, and for so long as he can keep it,</hi> and this struggle
to continue, till he submits to the servitude to which
he hath design'd him for his comfort and security.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> would do very much honor to <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi>
and repair much of the injury he hath don to him,
if he can perswade men to believe, (<hi>pag.</hi> 59) that
the <hi>bringing in his Philosophy and Doctrine, hath bin a
cause to take away the reputation of the Clergy,</hi> and to
incline the People to the reformation of Religion;
and yet he hath more autority for that, then for
most of his Opinions, tho it may be he doth not
know it. For in the year a thousand two hundred
and nine, <hi>Aristotles</hi> Metaphysics, which had bin
lately brought from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> were condemn'd,
and forbidden to be read by a Council in <hi>Paris,</hi> upon
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60912:20"/>
a supposition or apprehension, that that Book had
contributed very much to the new Heretical opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>Albigenses.</hi> So far the French Clergy of
that Age concurred in opinion with Mr. <hi>Hobbes:</hi> but
we may much more reasonably conceive, that it
hath bin illiterateness, stupid ignorance, and having
never heard of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that may at any time have
brought contemt upon the Clergy: and tho men
may too unreasonably, it may be, adhere to <hi>Aristotle</hi>
in some particulars, and so may be reasonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted,
yet no man of the Clergy or Laity was
ever contemned for being thought to understand <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle.</hi>
Indeed Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> may easily refute <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi>
and all who have writ before or since him, if
he be the Soveraign Magistrate, not only to enact
what Laws he pleases, and to interpret all that were
made before according to his pleasure, but to adopt
them to be the Laws of Nature, which he declares
(<hi>pag.</hi> 79.) to be <hi>immutable and eternal.</hi> And we have
great reason to watch him very narrowly, when his
Legislative fit is upon him, least he cast such a net
over us, knit by what he calls the Law of Nature,
or by his Definitions, that we be deprived of both
the use of our liberty, and our reason to oppose him.
He is very much offended with <hi>Aristotle,</hi> for saying
in the first Book of his Politics, That by Nature
some are fit to command, and others to serve; which
he saies, (<hi>pag.</hi> 77.) is not only against reason, but also
against experience, for <hi>there are very few so foolish, that
had not rather govern themselves, then be governed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
Which Proposition doth not contradict any
thing said by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> the Question being, Whether
Nature hath made some men worthier, not whether
it hath made all others so modest as to confess it; and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60912:21"/>
would have required a more serious Disquisition,
since it is no more then is imputed to Horses, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Beasts, whereof men find by experience, that
some by nature are fitter for nobler uses, and others
for vile, and to be only Beasts of burden. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
he had the less need of reason to refute him,
when he had a Law at hand to controul him, which
he saies, is the Law of Nature, (<hi>pag.</hi> 77.) <hi>That every
man must acknowledg every other man for his equal by
nature;</hi> which may be true as to the essentials of
human Nature, and yet there may be inequality e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
as to a capacity of Government. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
his opinion is, we have <hi>Solomons</hi> judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, <hi>Insipiens erit servus sapientis,</hi> Prov. 11. 29.
And many Learned men are of opinion, that the
<hi>Gibeonites,</hi> who by the help of an impudent lie found
the means to save their lives, were a People by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of low and abject spirits, fit only to do the low
and mean services for which they were prepared.
And some of the Fathers believe, That when the
Patriarch <hi>Iacob,</hi> in his dying Prophesie of <hi>Issachar,</hi>
declar'd <hi>Issachar is a strong ass, couching down between
two burdens. And he saw that rest was good, and the land
that it was pleasant, and bowed his shoulder to bear, and
became a servant unto tribute, Gen. 49. 14. 15. Iacob</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw
that in that Tribe there would be <hi>depressio intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus,</hi>
and that they would be only fit to servants. And
'tis very true, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> did believe, that Divine
Providence doth shew and demonstrate who are fit
and proper for low and vile offices, not only by very
notable defects in their understandings, incapable of
any cultivation, but by some eminent deformity of
the body (tho that doth not alwaies hold) which
makes them unfit to bear rule. And without doubt,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60912:21"/>
the observation of all Ages since that time hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
very much to that Conclusion which Mr.
<hi>Hobbes</hi> so much derides, of Inequality by nature,
and that Nature it self hath a bounty which she ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to some men in a much superior degree then
she doth to others. Which is not contradicted by
seeing many great defects and indigencies of Nature
in some men, wonderfully corrected and repair'd
by industry, education, and above all, by conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation;
or by seeing some early blossoms in others,
which raise a great expectation of rare perfection,
that suddainly decay, and insensibly wither away by
not being cherished and improved by diligence, or
rather by being blasted by vice or supine laziness:
those accidents may somtimes happen, do not very
often, and are necessary to awaken men out of the
Lethargy of depending wholly upon the Wealth of
Natures store, without administring any supply to
it, out of their industry and observation. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
mans experience will afford him abundance of
examples in the number of his own acquaintance, in
which, of those who have alwaies had equal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of Education, Conversation, Industry, and
it may be of virtuous Inclinations, it is easie to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
very different parts and faculties: some of
quick apprehension, and as steady comprehension,
wit, judgment, and such a sagacity as discerns at
distance as well as at hand, concluding from what
they see will fall out, what is presently to be don:
when others born, and bred with the same care, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness,
and attention, and with all the visible advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
and benefits which the other enjoied, remain
still of a heavier and duller alloy, less discerning to
contrive and fore-see, less vigorous to execute, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60912:22"/>
in a word, of a very different Classis to all purposes;
which can proceed from no other cause, but the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
that Nature her self made between them, in
the distribution of those Faculties to the one with a
more liberal hand then to the other.</p>
               <p>Did not all the World at that time, and hath it not
ever since believed, that <hi>Iulius Cesar</hi> had from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
a more exalted Spirit and Genius, then any of
those who were overcome by him; tho some of them
appear'd or were generally believ'd to be superior
in the conduct of great Affai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s? There is judgment
gotten by experience very necessary, but the first
attemt and direction of the mind, the first daring
proceeds purely from Nature and its influence. When
we see a <hi>Marius</hi> from a common Soldier, baffle the
Nobility of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in despight of opposition,
make himself seven times Consul: or a <hi>Dioclesan,</hi>
from a mean and low birth, and no other advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of Education then every other common Soldier
had with him, nor countenance or assistance from any
Superior, but what his own Virtue purchased, to
raise himself to the full state and power of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Emperor, and to govern as great, or a greater
part of the World, then ever <hi>Cesar</hi> did; and after
having enjoied that Empire above eighteen years in
the highest glory, to give it over, and divest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of it, merely for the ease and pleasure of retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to his private House and Garden, and to die in
that repose after he had enjoied it some years; must
we believe such a man to have no advantages by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
above all other men of the same time? When
<hi>Marmurius,</hi> or <hi>Vecturius</hi> (for he went by both names)
one of the thirty Tyrants, from a common Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith
who made arms (for the man who killed him,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60912:22"/>
having bin before his servant, and wrought under
him, told him, <hi>Hic est gladius quem ipse fecisti)</hi> rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
himself, not by a suddain mutiny and insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but by passing all the degrees of a Soldier, during
many years in a regular and disciplin'd Army, to be
Emperor by a common voice and election, as a Man
the fittest for the Command; is it possible for us to
believe, that this Man received no other talent from
Nature, then she afforded to every other Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finith?
Besides many particulat Examples of this
kind in every particular Kingdom, in most of which
the visible advantages of Friends, Patrons, and other
accidental Concurrences have not at all contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to the preferment of them before other
men, the World hath yielded us an example near
our own time (for it is little more then two hundred
years since) of such a prodigious progress and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
in the power of one Man, that there is nothing
of Story ancient or modern that is parallel to it,
The great <hi>Tamberlane,</hi> who (tho not so mean a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in his original, as he is vulgarly conceived to
have bin) was born a poor Prince over a contem'd
and barbarous Country and People, whose manners
he first cultivated by his own native justice and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and by the strength of his own Genius, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
his own Faculties and Understanding to a
marvellous Lustre and Perfection, towards which
neither his Climate nor his conversation could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute.
Upon this stock he rais'd and led an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of his Subjects, into the better Dominions of
their Neighbors who contemned them. With these
he fought, and won many Battels, subdued and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
many Kingdoms; and after the total defeat
of the greatest Army that was then in the World,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60912:23"/>
he took the greatest Emperor of the World Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and for the contemt that he had shew'd towards
him, treated him as his vilest Slave. And it hath bin
as notorious, that after the death of these, and the
like such extraordinary Persons, the Forces by which
they wrought those wonders, and the Counsellors
and Officers whose administration co-operated with
them, suddainly degenerated; and as if the Soul
were departed from the Body, became a Carcass
without any use or beauty. And can we believe, that
those stupendous men had no talent by nature above
others? And are we bound to believe, (<hi>pag.</hi> 77.)
<hi>that by the Law of Nature every man is bound to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
other for his equal by nature?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But where are those Maxims to be found which
Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> declares, and publishes to be the Laws of
Nature, in any other Author before him? That is only
properly call'd the Law of Nature, that is dictated
to the whole Species: as to defend a mans self from
violence, and to repel force by force; not all that
results upon prudential motives unto the mind of
such as have bin cultivated by Learning and Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which no doubt can compile such a Body of
Laws, as would make all other useless, except such as
should provide for the execution of, and obedience
to those. For under what other notion can that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Conclusion, which is a necessary part of the
Law of Nations, be call'd the Law of Nature, which
is his fifteenth Law, (<hi>pag.</hi> 78.) <hi>That all men that
mediate Peace be allowed safe conduct?</hi> And of this
kind much of the Body of his Law of Nature is
compil'd; which I should not dislike, the Style being
in some sense not improper, but that I observe that
from some of these Conclusions which he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60912:23"/>
to be (<hi>pag.</hi> 57.) <hi>immutable, and eternal as the Laws
of Nature,</hi> he makes deductions and inferences to
controul Opinions he dislikes, and to obtain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions
which are not right, by amuzing men with
his method, and confounding rather then informing
their understandings, by a chime of words in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions
and pleasant instances, which seem not easie
to be contradicted, and yet infer much more then
upon a review can be deduc'd from them. And it
is an unanswerable evidence of the irresistible force
and strength of Truth and Reason, that whilst men
are making war against it with all their power and
stratagems, somwhat doth still start up out of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
and confessions of the Adversary that deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
the Controversie, and vindicates the Truth
from the malice that would oppress it. How should
it else come to pass, that Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> whilst he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molishing
the whole frame of Nature for want of
order to support it, and makes it unavoidable neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
for every man to cut his neighbors throat, to
kill him who is weaker then himself, and to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
and by any fraud destroy him who is stronger,
in all which there is no injustice, because Nature
hath not otherwise provided for every particular
mans security; I say, how comes it to pass, that at
the same time when he is possessed of this frenzy, he
should in the same, and the next Chapter, set down
such a Body of Laws prescribed by Nature it self, as
are <hi>immutable aud eternal?</hi> that there appears, by
his own shewing, a full remedy against all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
for avoiding whereof he hath devis'd all that
unnatural and impossible Contract and Covenant? If
the Law of the Gospel, <hi>Whatsoever you require that
others should do to you, that do ye to them,</hi> be the Law
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60912:24"/>
of all men, as he saies it is (<hi>pag.</hi> 65.) that is, the Law
of Nature, <hi>Naturâ, id est jure gentium,</hi> saies <hi>Tully,</hi>
it being nothing else but <hi>quod naturalis ratio inter
omnes homines constituit;</hi> If it be the Law of Nature
that every man strive to accommodate himself to
the rest, as he saies it is <hi>(pag.</hi> 76.) and <hi>that no man by
deed, word, countenance or gesture, declare hatred or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temt
of another;</hi> If all men are bound by the Law of
Nature, (<hi>pag.</hi> 78.) <hi>That they that are at controversie, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
their right to the judgment of an arbitrator,</hi> as he
saies they are: If Nature hath thus providently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for the Peace and Tranquillity of her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
by Laws immutable and eternal, that are written
in their hearts: how come they to fall into that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of war, as to be every one against every one,
and to be without any other cardinal Virtues, but of
force and fraud? It is a wonderful thing, that a man
should be so sharp-sighted, as to discern mankind so
well inclosed and fortified by the wisdom of Nature,
and so blind as to think him in a more secure estate
by his transferring of right to another man, which
yet he confesses is impossible intirely to transfer;
and by Covenants and Contracts of his own devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
and which he acknowledges to be void in part,
and in other parts impossibe to be perform'd.</p>
               <p>But I say, if in truth Nature hath dictated all those
excellent Conclusions to every man, without which
they cannot be called the Laws of Nature; and if it
hath farther instituted all those duties which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in the Second Table, all which he saies were
the Laws of Nature: I know not what temtation or
autority he could have, to pronounce mankind to
be left by Nature in that distracted condition of war,
except he prefer the autority of <hi>Ovids Metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:60912:24"/>
of the sowing of <hi>Cadmus</hi>'s teeth, before any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Scripture, Divine or Humane: And it is as
strange, that by his Covenants and Contracts which
he is so wary in wording (as if he were the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
of Nature) that they may bind that man fast
enough whom he pleases to assign to those Bonds;
and as if he were the Ple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>potentiary of Nature too,
to bind and to loose all he thinks fit: he hath so ill
provided for the Peace he would establish, that he
hath left a door open for all the Confusion he would
avoid, when, notwithstanding that he hath made
them divest themselves of the liberty they have by
Nature, and transfer all this into the hands of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Person, who thereby is so absolute Soveraign,
that he may take their Lives and their Estates from
them without any act of Injustice, yet after all this
transferring and divesting, every man reserves a
right (as unalienable) to defend his own life, even
against the sentence of Justice. What greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
can there be to the Peace, which he would
establish upon those unreasonable conditions, then
this Liberty, which he saies can never be abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and which yet may dissolve that peace every
day? and yet he saies, (<hi>pag.</hi> 70.) <hi>This is granted to be
true by all men, in that they lead Criminals to execution
and prison with armed men, notwithstanding such Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals
have consented to the Law by which they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</hi>
Which indeed in an Argument, that men
had rather escape then be hanged, but no more an
Argument that they have a right to rescue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
then the fashion of wearing Sword is an
argument that men are afraid of having their throats
cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> by the malice of their neighbors: both which,
are Arguments no man would urge to men, whose
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60912:25"/>
understandings he did not much undervalue. But
upon many of these Particulars there is a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
occasion hereafter for enlargement. And so we
pass through his Prospect of the Laws of Nature,
and many other Definitions and Descriptions, with
liberty to take review of them upon occasion, that
we may make hast to his Second Part, for which he
thinks he hath made a good preparation to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
upon us in this First; and he will often tell us,
when he should prove what he affirms, that he hath
evinc'd that Point, and made it evident in such a
Chapter in his First Part, where in truth he hath said
very much, and proved very little. I shall only
conclude this, with an observation which the place
seems to require, of the defect in Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s
Logic, which is a great presumtion, that from very
true Propositions he deduces very erroneous and
absurd Conclusions. That no man hath power to
transfer the right over his own life to the disposal of
another man, is a very true Proposition, from whence
he infers, that he hath reserved the power and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
of it to himself, and therefore that he may defend
it by force even against the judgment of Law and
Justice: whereas the natural consequence of that
Proposition is, That therefore such transferring and
covenanting (being void) cannot provide for the
peace and security of a Common-wealth. Without
doubt, no man is <hi>Dominus vitae suae,</hi> and therefore
cannot give that to another, which he hath not in
himself. God only hath reserv'd that absolute Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
and Power of life and death to himself, and
by his putting the Sword into the hand of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Magistrate, hath qualified and enabled him to
execute that justice which is necessary for the peace
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60912:25"/>
and preservation of his People, which may seem in
a manner to be provided for by Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s Law of
Nature, if what he saies be true, (<hi>pag.</hi> 68.) <hi>That
right to the end containeth right to the means.</hi> And
this sole Proposition, that men cannot dispose of
their own lives, hath bin alwaies held as a manifest
and undeniable Argument, that Soveraigns never
had, nor can have their Power from the People.</p>

               <p>MR. <hi>Hobbes</hi> having taken upon him to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
God, and created Man after his own
likeness, given him all the passions and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
which he finds in himself, and no other,
he prescribes him to judg of all things and words,
according to the definitions he sets down, with the
Autority of a Creator. After he hath delighted
himself in a commendable method, and very witty
and pleasant description of the nature and humor
of the World, as far as he is acquainted with it, (upon
many particulars whereof, which he calls Definitions,
there will be frequent occasion of reflexions in
this discourse, without breaking the thred of it by
entring upon impertinent exceptions to matters po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively
averred without any apparent reason, when
it is no great matter whether it be true or no,)
He comes at last to institute such a Common-wealth
as never was in nature, or ever heard of
from the beginning of the World till this structure of
his, and like a bountiful Creator, gives the Man
he hath made, the Soveraign command and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of it, with such an extent of power and
autority, as the Great <hi>Turk</hi> hath not yet appear'd
to affect. In which it is probable he hath follow'd his
first method, and for the Man after his own likeness
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60912:26"/>
hath created a Government, that he would himself
like to be trusted with; having determined Liberty,
and Propriety, and Religion to be only emty words,
and to have no other existence then in the Will and
Breast of his Soveraign Governor; and all this in
order to make his People happy, and to enjoy the
blessing of Peace. And yet with all this, his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
would quickly find his power little enough, that
is, of little continuance, if his Government be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon no other security then is provided in his
Institution: and the justice he assigns will be as
weak a support to his Governor, as he supposes a
Covenant would be to the peoples benefit; the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
whereof he conceives to be so ridiculous,
that it can only proceed form want of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that Covenants being but words and breath,
have no force to oblige, contain, constrain, or
protect any man, but what they have from the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
Sword, that is from the untied hands of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Man: as if Justice, which is the support of
his Governor when he breaks and violates all the
Elements of Justice, because all men are in justice
bound to observe contracts, were more then a word,
or a more valiant word and stronger breath to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain,
and protect any man, when that Sword is
wrested from his Soveraign Man, or his hand is
bound by the many hands which should be govern'd
by him. But the People need not be offended with
him, for giving so extravagant a Power to a Person
they never intended should have such an Empire over
them; if they will have patience till he hath finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Scheme of Soveraignty, he will infeeble it
again for them to that degree, that no ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man would take it up, if he could have it
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60912:27"/>
for asking. But to prosecute the Argument in his
own order.</p>
               <p>As he hath made a worse man by much, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him too like himself; so he hath made a much
worse Common-wealth then ever yet was known in
the World, by making it such as he would have: and
nothing can be more wonderful, then that a man of
Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> his sagacity, should raise so many conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of a very pernicious influence upon the Peace
and Government of every Kingdom and Common-wealth
in Europe, upon a mere supposition and
figment of a Common-wealth instituted by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and without any example. He will not find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one Government in the World, of what kind
soever, so instituted, as he dogmatically declares all
Government to be; nor was mankind in any nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
since the Creation upon such a level, as to insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
their Government by such an assembly and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and covenant, and consent, as he very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantably
more then supposes. And it was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
of the more impertinence, since by his
own rule, (pag. 95.) <hi>where there is already erected a
Soveraign power,</hi> which was then, and still is in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Kingdom and State in Europe, and for ought
we know in the whole world, <hi>there can be no other
Representative of the same People, but only to certain
particular ends limited by the Soveraign.</hi> So that he
could have no other design, but to shake what was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
and the Government was not at that time
in any suspence but in his own Country, by the
effect of an odious and detestable Rebellion; which
yet could not prevail with an effective Army of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
one hundred thousand men, with which the
Usurper had subdued three Nation, to submit to the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60912:27"/>
Usurper in such a new model, and to transfer their
right by such Covenants, as he conceives mankind
to be even oblig'd to do by the Laws of Nature; and
to induce them to do which, I do heartily wish that
Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> could truly vindicate himself from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing,
when he publish'd his <hi>Leviathan;</hi> upon which
disquisition we cannot avoid enlarging hereafter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
further provocation.</p>
               <p>It had bin kindly don of Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> if according
to his laudable custom of illustrating his definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by instances, as he often doth with great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnancy,
he had to this his positive determination
added one instance of a Government so instituted.
There is no doubt there are in all Governments ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things don by, and with the consent of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
nay all Government so much depends upon the
consent of the People, that without their consent
and submission it must be dissolved, since where no
body will obey, there can be no command, nor can
one man compel a million to to do what they have no
mind to do: but that any Government was original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
instituted by an assembly of men equally free, and
that they ever elected the Person, who should have
the Soveraign power over them, is yet to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
and till it be proved, must not be supposed, to
raise new doctrines upon, which shake all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
How Soveraign power was originally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted,
and how it came to condescend to put
restraints upon it self, and even to strip it self of
some parts of its Soveraignty for its own benefit and
advantage, and how far it is bound to observe the
Contracts and Covenants it hath submitted to, I
shall deliver my opinion before this Discourse is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd;
and shall refer the approbation of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60912:28"/>
                  <hi>Hobbes,</hi> supposing he will never think all the reason
in the world to be strong enough to prove, that what
all men see is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cannot be. But by the way, he had
dealt more like the Magistrate he affects to be, if
he had founded his Government upon his own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious
averment, and left every man to question it
that dares; then to take notice, and fore-see an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
which he saies is the strongest he can make,
and make no better an answer to it, then to answer
one question with another. He sees men will ask,
(and it is not impossible they can avoid it) Where,
and When such power hath by Subjects bin acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd?
which he would have us believe is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially
answered by his other Question, When,
or Where has there bin a Kingdom long free from
Sedition and Civil War? which might receive a
very full Answer, by assigning many Governments
under which the Subjects have enjoied very long
Peace, Quiet, and Plenty, which never was, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
can be enjoied one hour under his (as shall be
proved when we examine it.) But it will serve his
turn, if it hath once bin disquieted by a Sedition or
Civil War; and so all Government that is known
and established, must be laid aside and overthrown,
to erect another that he supposes will cure all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.
If Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> had thought fit to write pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blematically,
and to have examin'd, as many have
don, the nature of Government, and the nature of
Mankind that is to be govern'd, and from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of both, had modestly proposed such a
form, as to his judgment might better provide for
the security, peace, and happiness of a People,
(which is the end of Government,) then any form
that is yet practic'd and submitted to; he might well
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60912:28"/>
have answered one objection of an inconvenience in
his new form, with another of a greater inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in all other forms. But when he will intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a Government of his own devising, as founded
and instituted already, and that not as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
new, but submitted to by the Covenants, and
Obligations, aud Election our selves have made,
and so that we are bound by the rules of Justice
founded upon our own consent, to pretend neither
to liberty, or property, other then our Governor
thinks fit to indulge to us; he must be contented not
to be believed, or must vouch-safe to tell us when,
and where that consent of ours was given, and we
submitted to those obligations: and it will be no
kind of answer of satisfaction, to say magisterially,
that if it be not so, it should be so for our good,
which we clearly find will turn to our irrepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
dammage and destruction. And it is a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
thing, that he should hope to support his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
right in so unlimited an extent upon the Law
of Nature, because (p. 176.) <hi>that forbids the violation
of Faith,</hi> without being pressed to tell us when, and
where that Faith was given, that is so obligatory, and
the violation whereof must be so penal. But it is
more prodigiously bold, to confess upon the matter,
that there hath not hitherto bin any Common-wealth,
where those rights have bin acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or challeng'd, and to undervalue the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by making it as ridiculous, as if the Savage
People of <hi>America</hi> should deny there were any
grounds or principles of reason so to build, as their
Architecture is not yet arrived at: So he thinks,
that tho his Savage Country-men, and Neighbors,
have yet only bin accustomed to Governments im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60912:29"/>
&amp; apt to relapse into disorders, he hath found
out principles by <hi>industrious meditation,</hi> to make
their constitution everlasting. And truly he hath
some reason to be confident of his Principles, if tho
they cannot be proved by reason, he be sure they
are Principles from autority of Scripture, as he
professes them to be, and which must be examin'd
in its course. In the mean time he may be thought
to be too indulgent to his Soveraign Governor, and
very neer to contradict himself, that after he hath
made the keeping and observation of promises to
be a part of the Law of Nature, which is <hi>unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and eternal,</hi> and so the ground and foundation
of that obedience which the Subject must render,
how tyrannically soever exacted, yet <hi>all Covenants
entred into by the Soveraign to be void; and that to
imagine that he is or can be bound to perform any
promise or covenant, proceeds only from want of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</hi>
And it would be worth his pains to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
whether the assigning such a power to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor,
or the absolving him from all Covenants
and promises, be a rational way to establish such a
Peace as is the end of Government: and since he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
the justest Government may be overthrown by
force, it ought prudently to be considered, what is
like to prevent that force, as well as what the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
is bound to consent to; and whether the people
may not be very naturally dispos'd to use that force
against him that declares himself to be absolv'd
from all Oaths, Covenants, and Promises, and
whether any obligation of reason or justice can
establish the Government in him, who founds it upon
so unrighteous a determination.</p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> did not affect to be of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60912:29"/>
of those unreasonable Gamesters, which he
saies (pag. 19.) <hi>is intolerable in the society of men,
who will after trump is turned, use for trump, upon
every occasion, that suit whereof they have most in
their hand,</hi> whom he likens to those men who cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
and demand right reason for Judg, yet seek
no more, but that things should be determined by no
other mens reason then their own; I say, if Mr.
<hi>Hobbes</hi> were not possessed by his supercilious spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
which he condemns, since this his Institution
of Soveraignty is a mere imagination, he might
with as much reason, if he would have bin pleased
to have called it so, because it would have carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with it more equality, and consequently more
security, have supposed a Covenant to be on the
Soveraigns part: which that he may not do, he
will not admit that they who are his Subjects make
any Covenant with their Soveraign to obey him;
which if he did, he could as well covenant again
with them to govern righteously, without making
them the Judges of his justice, or himself liable to
their controul and jurisdiction. So that the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
hath no security for the obedience of his
People, but the promise they have made to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and consequently if they rebel against him,
he cannot complain of any injustice don to him,
because they have broke no promise they made to
him. And truly, by his own Logic, they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease
to one another when they think it convenient:
whereas if the promises be mutual, I do not say
conditional, the Soveraign must not be at the
mercy of his Subjects; but as they put themselves
under his power, so he promises them not to use
that power wantonly or tyrannically (which will
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60912:30"/>
be a proper and significant word against all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation;)
by which they have as much obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon him to be just, as he hath upon them to
be obedient, which is no other, then that they swarve
from justice, if they withdraw their obedience from
him. This had bin a more natural and equitable
Institution, and more like to have lasted, having
in it the true essential form of contracts, in which
it will never be found that one party covenants, and
the other not; which is the reason Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
gives, why no Covenant can be made with God,
and that (pag. 89.) <hi>the pretence of Covenant with
God, is so evident a lye, even in the pretenders own
consciences, that it is not only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n act of an unjust, but
also of a vile and unmanly disposition;</hi> which asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is destructive of our Religion, and against the
express sense of Scripture.</p>
               <p>The impossibility alledg'd for such a Covenant,
because it could not be don before he was Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
for that the Subjects who submit to him
were not yet one person, and after he is Soveraign
what he doth is void, is but a fancy of words which
have no solid signification. Nor is the instance
which he gives of the popular Government, by which
he would make the imagination of such a Covenant
ridiculous, of any importance, for he saies (pag.
90.) <hi>No man is so dull as to say, that the People of</hi> Rome <hi>made a Covenant with the Romans to hold the
Soveraign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y on such or such conditions, which not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
the Romans might lawfully, depose the Roman
People;</hi> which is, according to his usual practice, to
put an objection into the mouth of a foolish Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to make his Readers merry. And yet he laies so
much weight upon it, that he saies it is only over
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60912:30"/>
inclination to a popular Government, that men do
not see that there is the same reason with reference
to Monarchy. And so there is, and the reason good
to either. For doth not every man know, that knows
any thing of the Government of <hi>Rome,</hi> that when
the Soveraignty was intirely vested in the Senate, and
had long bin so, the People of <hi>Rome</hi> made a great
alteration in the Soveraignty by making Tribunes
(by which <hi>Machiavel</hi> saies their Government was the
more firm and secure) and afterwards by introducing
other Magistrates into the Soveraignty? Nor were
the Admissions and Covenants the Senate made in
those cases ever declared void, but observed with all
punctuality: which is Argument enough, that the
Soveraign power may admit limitations without any
danger to it self or the People, which is all that is
contended for.</p>
               <p>As there never was any such Person (pag. 88.)
<hi>of whose acts a great multitude by mutual Covenant
one with another, have made themselves every one
the author, to the end he may use the strength and
means of them all, as he shall think expedient for
their peace, and common defence,</hi> which is the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
he gives of his Common-wealth: So if it
can be supposed, that any Nation can concur in such
a designation, and divesting themselves of all their
right and liberty, it could only be in reason obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
to the present contractors, nor do's it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to us, that their posterity must be bound by so
unthrifty a concession of their Parents. For tho
<hi>Adam</hi> by his Rebellion against God forfeited all
the privileges which his unborn posterity might
have claimed if he had preserved his innocence,
and tho Parents may alienate their Estates from
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60912:31"/>
their Children, and thereby leave them Beggars; yet
we have not the draught of any Contract, nor is
that which Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> hath put himself to the
trouble to prepare, valid enough to that purpose, by
which they have left impositions and penalties upon
the Persons of their posterity: nor is it probable
that they would think themselves bound to submit
thereunto. And then the Soveraign would neither
find himself the more powerful, or the more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
for his cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>tors having covenanted one
with another, and made themselves every one
the author of all his actions: and it is to be doubted,
that the People would rather look upon him as the
<hi>Vizier Basha</hi> instituted by their Fathers, then as
Gods Lieutenant appointed to govern them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him.</p>
               <p>It is to no purpose to examine the Prerogatives he
grants to his Soveraign, because he founds them all
upon a supposition of a Contract and Covenant that
never was in nature, nor ever can reasonably be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be; yet he confesses it to be <hi>the generation</hi>
(pag. 87.) <hi>of the great Leviathan,</hi> and which falling
to the ground all his Prerogatives must likewise fall
too; and so much to the dammage of the Soveraign
power, (to which most of the Prerogatives are
due) that men will be apt to suppose, that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from a ground which is not true, and so be the
more inclined to dispute them. Whereas those
Prerogatives are indeed vested in the Soveraign by
his being Soveraign; but he do's not become So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
by vertue of such a Contract and Covenant,
but are of the Essence of his Soveraignty, founded
upon a better title then such an accidental conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and their designing a Soveraign by their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60912:31"/>
with one another, and none with or to
him, who is so absolutely to command them. And
here he supposes again, that whatsoever a Soveraign
is possessed of, is of his Soveraignty; and therefore
he will by no means admit, that he shall part with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his power which he calls <hi>essential and insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Rights,</hi> and that whatever grant he makes of
such power, the same is void: and he do's believe
that this Soveraign right was at the time when he
published his Book so well understood (that is, <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
liked his Doctrine so well) that it would be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
acknowledged in <hi>England</hi> at the next re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of peace. Yet he sees himself deceived: it hath
pleased God to restore a blessed and a general peace,
and neither King nor People believe his Doctrine to
be true, or consistent with peace. How, and why
the most absolute Soveraigns may, as they find oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
part with, and deprive themselves of many
branches of their power, will be more at large dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
in another place: yet we may observe in
this the very complaisant humor of Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> and
how great a Courtier he desir'd to appear to the
Soveraign power that then govern'd, by how odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and horrible a usurpation soever, in that he
found a way to excuse and justifie what they had
already don in the lessening and diminution of their
own Soveraign power, which it concern'd them to
have believ'd was very lawfully and securely don.
For, they having, as the most popular and obliging
act they could perform, taken away <hi>Wardships</hi> and
Tenures, he confesses after his enumeration of
twelve Prerogatives, which he saies (pag. 92.) <hi>are
the rights which make the essence of the Soveraignty,</hi>
for these, he saies, <hi>are incommunicable, and inseparable,</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:60912:32"/>
I say, he confesses <hi>the power to coin mony, to dispose of
the estates and persons of infant heirs, and all other
Statute Prerogatives may be transferred by the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign;</hi>
whereas he might have bin informed, if he
had bin so modest as to think he had need of any
information, that those are no Statute Prerogatives,
but as inherent and inseparable from the Crown,
as many of those which he declares to be of the
Essence of the Soveraignty. But both those were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
entred upon, and he was to support all their
actions which were past, as well as to provide for
their future proceedings.</p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> had known any thing of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the Monarchy of <hi>England,</hi> supported by
as firm principles of Government as any Monarchy
in <hi>Europe,</hi> and which enjoied a series of as long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,
he could never have thought that the late
troubles there proceeded from an opinion receiv'd of
the greatest part of England, <hi>that the power was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
between the King, and the Lords, and the House
of Commons,</hi> which was an opinion never heard of in
<hi>England</hi> till the Rebellion was begun, and against
which all the Laws of <hi>England</hi> were most clear, and
known to be most positive. But as he cannot but
acknowledg, that his own Soveraignty is obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the Lusts, and other irregular passions of the
People; so the late execrable Rebellion proceeded
not from the defect of the Law, nor from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of the just and ample power of the King, but
from the power ill men rebelliously possessed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of, by which they suppressed the strength of
the Laws, and wrested the power out of the hands
of the King: against which violence his Soveraign
is no otherwise secure, then by declaring that his
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60912:32"/>
Subjects proceed unjustly; of which no body doubts
but that all they who took up arms against the King,
were guilty in the highest degree. And there is
too much cause to fear, that the unhappy pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
of this doctrine against the Liberty and
propriety of the Subject (which others had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
to declare before Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> tho they had
not the good fortune to escape punishment as he
hath don, I mean Dr. <hi>Manwaring,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorpe</hi>)
contributed too much thereunto. For let
him take what pains he will to render those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
words unvaluable, and of no signification;
a better Philosopher then he, and one who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the rules of Government better, having lived
under just such a Soveraign as Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> would
set up, (I mean <hi>Seneca,</hi>) will be believed before
him, who pronounces, <hi>Errat siquis existimat tutum
esse ibi Regem, ubi nihil à Rege tutum est; Securitas
securitate mutua paciscenda est.</hi> And he go's ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
far himself towards the confessing this truth,
when he is forced to acknowledg, (pag. 96.) <hi>That
the riches, power, and honor of a Monarch, arise only
from the riches, strength and reputation of his subjects;
for no King can be rich, nor glorious, nor secure,
whose Subjects are either poor or contemtible:</hi> which
assertion will never be supported, by saying, that
that condition shall be made good, and preserv'd
to them by the justice and bounty of the Soveraign.
For riches, and strength, and reputation, are not
aëry words, without a real and substantial significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
nor do consist so much in the present enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
especially if it shall depend upon the casual
pleasure of any man, as in the security for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that being a mans property, that cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60912:33"/>
from him, but in that manner, and by those
Rules, as are generally looked upon as the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals
of Government. And when he is transported
by his passion and his appetite, and for making
good his Institution, to cancel and tread under
foot all those known obligations, and make the
precious terms of Property and Liberty absurd
and insignificant words, to be blown away by the least
breath of his monstrous Soveraign, without any
violation of justice, or doing injury to those he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts;
I say, when he is thus warmed by the flame of
his passions, which he confesses (pag. 96.) <hi>alwaies
dazles, never enlightens the understanding,</hi> he is so
puzled by his own notions, that he make himself a
way out by distinctions of his own modelling and
devising: and so he is compell'd to acknowledg, that
tho his illimited Soveraign, whatsoever he doth, can
do no injury to his Subjects, nor be by any of them
accused of injustice, yet that he (p. 90.) <hi>may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
iniquity, tho not injustice or injury in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per signification,</hi>
which is far more intelligible
then the Beatifical vision, for the obscurity and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity
whereof he is so merry with the Schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p>As Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> his extraordinary and notorious ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
in the Laws and constitution of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>England</hi> makes him a very incompetent judg
or informer of the cause or original of the late woful
calamities in <hi>England,</hi> of which he knows no more
the every other man of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> doth, and upon
which there will be other occasion hereafter to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large;
so his high arrogance and presumtion that he
doth understand them, makes him triumph in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
and wonder that so manifest a truth should
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60912:33"/>
of late be so little observed, that in a Monarchy, he
that had the Soveraignty from a descent of six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years,
was alone called Soveraign, had the title
of Majesty from every one of his Subjects, and was
unquestionably taken by them for their King, was
notwithstanding never considered as their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative,
that name without contradiction, passing
for the title of those men, which at his command
were sent up by the People to carry their Petitions,
and give him, if he permitted it, their advice; which
he saies (pag. 95.) <hi>may serve as an admonition for
those that are the true and absolute Representative of
a People</hi> (which he hath made his Soveraign to be)
<hi>to take heed how they admit of any other general
Representative upon any occasion whatsoever:</hi> all
which is so unskilful and illiterate a suggestion,
as could not fall into the conception of any man who
is moderately versed in the principles of Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And if Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> did not make war against
all modesty, he would rather have concluded, that
the title of the Representative of the people was
not to be affected by the King, then that for
want of understanding his Majesty should neglect
to assume it, or that his faithful Counsel, and his
Learned Judges, who cannot be supposed to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the Regalities of the Crown, should fail to
put him in mind of so advantageous a Plea, when his
fundamental rights were so foully assaulted, and in
danger. But tho the King knew too well the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of his own power, to be contented to be
thought the Representative of the People, yet if
Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> were not strangely unconversant with
the transactions of those times, he would have known,
which few men do not know, that the King
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60912:34"/>
frequently, and upon all occasions reprehended the
two Houses, both for assuming the Style and appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Parliament, which they were not, but in,
and by his Majesties conjunction with them, and for
calling themselves the Representative of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which they neither were, or could be to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
purpose then to present their Petitions, and
humbly to offer their advice, when and in what his
Majesty required it, and this was as generally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
by men of all conditions in <hi>England,</hi> as it
was that Rebellion was Treason. But they who
were able by false pretences, and under false prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations
to raise an Army, found it no difficult mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to perswade that Army, and those who concured
with them, that they were not in rebellion.</p>

and security, never so far to lessen himself, as to be
considered as the peoples Representative, which
would make him a much less man then he is. His
Majesty is inherent in his office, and neither one or

those who are indeed the Deputies of the people, in

right of being Monarch.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> was too mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
a man to hope that his <hi>Leviathan</hi> would have
power to perswade those of <hi>Poland</hi> to change their
form of Government; and what <hi>Denmark</hi> hath
gotten by having don it since, cannot in so short a
time be determin'd; or that the Emperor would
dissolve and cancel the Golden Bull, and invest
his Posterity in the Empire in spight of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors;
or that the Papacy should be made Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary,
since <hi>Cesar Borgia</hi> was so long since dead,
and he had carried that spirit with him: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I must appeal to all dispassion'd men what
Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> could have in his purpose in the year
One thousand six hundred fifty one, when this Book
was printed, but by this new Doctrine scarcely
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60912:35"/>
heard of till then, to induce <hi>Cromwell</hi> to break
all the Laws of his Country, and to perpetuate
their slavery under his Progeny, in which he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
his advice to the utmost of his power, tho
his Doctrine proved false and most detested. And
tho Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> by his presence of mind, and
velocity of thought, which had inabled him to
fore-see the purpose of rebelling, and taking the
King Prisoner, and delivering him up, from that
question proposed to him, concerning the value
of a Roman penny, might at that time discern
so little possibility of his own Soveraigns recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that it might appear to him a kind of absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
to wish it; yet methinks his own natural fear
of danger, which made him fly out of <hi>France,</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soon
as his <hi>Leviathan</hi> was publish'd and brought
into that Kingdom, should have terrified him from
invading the right of all Hereditary Monarchies
in the World, by declaring, that by the Law of
Nature which is immutable, it is in the power of
the present Soveraign to dispose of the succession,
and to appoint who shall succed him in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
and that the word <hi>Heir</hi> doth not of
it self imply the Children or nearest Kindred of
a man, but whomsoever a man shall any way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
he would have succeed him, contrary to the
known right and establishment throughout the
World, and which would shake if not dissolve the
Peace of all Kingdoms. Nor is there any danger
of the dissolution of a Common-wealth by the not
nominating of a Successor; since it is a known ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime
in all Hereditary Monarchies, That the King
never dies, because in the minute of the exspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the present, his Heir succeeds him, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60912:36"/>
is in the instant invested in all the dignities, and
preheminences of which the other had bin possessed:
and if there were no other error or false doctrine
in the <hi>Leviathan</hi> (as there are very many of a
very pernicious nature) that would be cause e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to suppress it in all Kingdoms.</p>

               <p>IT is modestly don of Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> at last, after
so many Magisterial determinations of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of Soveraignty, and the rights and auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of it, and what is not it, to confess that all these
Discourses <hi>(pag. 105.)</hi> are only <hi>what he finds by spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
and deduction of Soveraign Rights from the
nature, need, and designs of man in erecting of Common-wealths,
and putting themselves under Monarchs, &amp;c.</hi>
and therefore if he finds that all his speculation is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively
contradicted by constant and uncontrovert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
practice, he will believe that his speculation is
not, nor ought to be of autority enough to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
new Laws and Rules of Government into
the World. And it is high time for the Soveraign
Power to declare, That it doth not approve those
Doctrines, which may lessen the affections and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
of Princes towards their Subjects, and even
their reverence to God himself, if they thought
that they could change Religion, and suppress the
Scripture it self; and that their power over their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
is so absolute, that they give them all that they
do not take from them; and that Property is but a
word of no signification, and lessens the duty and
obedience of Subjects, and makes them less love the
constitution of the Government they live under;
which may prove so destructive to them, if they
have temtation from their passions or their appetite
to exercise the autority they justly have. It is fit
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60912:37"/>
therefore that all men know, that these are only his
speculations, and not the claim of Soveraign Power.</p>
               <p>It had bin to be wished, that Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> had first
taken the pains to have inform'd himself of the
p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>wer and autority exercised by Elective Princes
over their Subjects, and their submission rendred to
them by their subjects, before he had so positively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd,
that Elective Kings are not Soveraigns, at
least that he had given a better reason for his asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
He that hath supreme autority over all, and
against whom there is no Appeal, may very justly
and lawfully be called a Soveraign. And if he would
enquire into the autority of the Emperor, in the
proper Dominion of the Empire, he would find that
he hath as Soveraign a power as any Prince in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom
claims, and yet he is Elective. And it is a
more extravagant speculation to conclude, That
because the Electors have the absolute power to
chuse the Emperor, that the Soveraignty is in them
before they chuse him, and that they may keep it
to themselves if they think good, because none have
a right to give that which they have no right to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess;
when it is known to all the World that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors
have a right to chuse the Emperor, and yet
that till they have chosen him, the Soveraignty is
not in them, nor that they can possess it them selves,
and chuse whether they will give it to another; and
that when they have chosen him, he is a Soveraign
Prince, and superior to all those who have chosen
him, by all the marks of Soveraignty which are
known in practice, tho not possibly in speculation.
And he knows well there is another Soveraign
Prince greater then the Emperor, and almost as
great as he would have his Soveraign to be in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60912:37"/>
of his power, who is likewise El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ctive, and
that is the Pope, and that the Conclave cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that Soveraignty to themselves, but having
by their Election conferr'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t upon him, he is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
become as absolute a Monarch as Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> can
wish. And truly, if he would rectifie his specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that is, his conceptions and imaginations, by
examining those of other men (a fatal neglect he
hath bin guilty of throughout his whole life) he
could hardly have avoided the knowing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that on
every <hi>Michaelmas</hi> day the whole common People of
<hi>London</hi> chuse the Lord Major, and yet the Office is
not in them till they do chuse him, tho his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
were dead, nor can they keep it to themselves;
and so they can give that which they cannot possess,
which is diametrically contrary to his speculation,
which would likewise have bin controuled by all
Elections of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>He might have saved himself much labor (since
he agrees that a Soveraign by acquisition, which is
somwhat we understand, hath the same full Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty

all that which is mere speculation; and I will grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie

till farther deliberation;</hi> which Doctrine, found
only as he confesses by speculation, served to confirm
that Tyrannical Power in a Judgment they had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
when three great and noble Persons, who were
Prisoners of War, were contrary to all form and rule
condemn'd to be murder'd; which Sentence was bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barously
executed, and afterwards reiterated upon
others, the rather probably upon his speculative de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination.</p>
               <p>And since we are now come to the Chapter of
Dominion Paternal and Despotical, in which he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
of his Government by acquisition, which
he will have by force; or by institution, which he
calls by consent, and confesses, that the rights<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and consequences of Soveraignty are the same in
both; it may not (I conceive) be unseasonable to state,
and lay down that Scheme of Government, which
men reasonably believe was originally instituted, and
the progress and alterations which were afterwards
made, and all those Covenants, Promises, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
which were annexed to it, and by the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of which it hath alwaies acquired strength
and lustre, and bin as much impair'd, when endeavors
have bin used to extend it beyond its bounds and
just limits, and to make it more absolute, then is
consistent with the Peace and Happiness of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which was, and is the end of its Institution.
And in the first place we must deny, as we have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
don, Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> his ground work, upon
which, with many ill consequences even from thence
his foundation is supported, aad that is, that War
is founded in Nature, which gives the stronger a
right to whatever the weaker is possessed of, so that
there can be no peace, or security from oppression,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60912:38"/>
till such Covenants are made, as may appoint a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
to have all that power which is necessary to
provide for that peace and security; and out of, and
by this Institution, his Magistrate grows up to the
greatness and size of his <hi>Leviathan.</hi> But we say, that
peace is founded in nature; and that when the God
of nature gave his Creature, Man, the dominion
over the rest of his Creation, he gave him likewise
natural strength and power to govern the World
with peace and order: and how much soever he lost
by his own integrity, by falling from his obedience
to his Creator, and how severe a punishment soever
he under-went by that his disobedience, it do's not
appear that his dominion over Man-kind was in any
degree lessened or abated. So that we cannot but
look upon him during his life, as the sole Monarch
of the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that lasted so long, as we may
reasonably compute, that a very considerable part of
the World, that was peopled before the Flood, was
peopled in his life, <hi>since it lasted upon the point of two
parts of that term;</hi> so that his Dominion was over a
very numerous People. And during all that time,
we have no reason to imagine that there was any
such Instrument of Government by Covenants and
Contracts, as is contain'd in this Institution. And
yet we do acknowledg, that he was by nature fully
possessed of all that <hi>plenitudo potestatis,</hi> which doth
of right belong to a Magistrate; and we may very
reasonably believe, having no color to think the
contrary, that his Son <hi>Seth,</hi> who was born a hundred
and thirty years after him, and lived above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years after he was dead, govern'd his descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
with the same absolute Dominion, which
might well be continued under his Successor to the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60912:39"/>
very time of the Flood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for we may very reasonably
believe that <hi>Noah</hi> conversed with <hi>Seth,</hi> since it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
they lived one hundred years together in the
same Age. Nor have we the least color to believe,
that there was either S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dition or Civil War before
the Flood; their rebellion against God in a univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal

amongst themselves, being in the opinion of
most Learned men, the crying Sin that provoked
God to drown the World.</p>
               <p>After the Flood, we cannot but think that <hi>Noah</hi>
remain'd the sole, Monarch of the World during his
life, according to that model with which he had bin
very well acquainted for the space of five hundred
years; and he lived long enough after to see a very
numerous increase of his Children and Subjects, who
after his death, when the multiplication was very
great, came from the East into the Land of <hi>Shinar,</hi>
the pleasant v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ly of <hi>Shinar,</hi> where God, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
had plac'd the Father of man-kind, <hi>Adam;</hi>
and Learned men are of opinion, that the great and
principal end of the building of <hi>Babel,</hi> over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the high Tower for their fame and renown to
posterity, was, that they intended it for the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis
of an Universal Monarchy; so little doubt
there was yet made of an entire subjection and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
Sure we are, that the Generations of <hi>Noah,</hi>
when man-kind was exceedingly increas'd, did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the Nations in the Earth; and Mr. <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

us, that the word which we translate <hi>divided,</hi>
signifies not <hi>a scattering,</hi> or any thing of confusion,
but a <hi>most distinct partition.</hi> So that this great divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Earth being perform'd in this method
and order, there is no room for the imagination and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60912:39"/>
dream of such an irregular and confus'd dispersion,
that every man went whither he listed, and setled
himself where he liked best, from whence that Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of Government might arise which Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>
fancies. Under this Division, we of the Western
World have reason to believe our selves of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
of <hi>Iapheth,</hi> and that our Progenitors did as
well know under what Government they were to
live, as what portion they were to possess: and we
have that blessing of <hi>Iapheth,</hi> that God would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
him into the Tents of <hi>Shem,</hi> and that <hi>Cham</hi>
should be his servant, to assure and confirm us, that
the Inundation, which almost cover'd us, of the <hi>Gothes</hi>
and <hi>Vandals</hi> from <hi>Scythia,</hi> and other Northern Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
(whose original habitations we cannot to this
day find) were not of the Children of <hi>Cham,</hi> which
we might otherwise have suspected.</p>
               <p>As Man-kind encreas'd, and the age of man
grew less, so that they did not live to see so great
a Progeny issue out of their own loins as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and their subjects growing less, their kindred
also grew at so great a distance, that the account
of their relations was not so easily or so carefully
preserv'd; hereby they who had the Soveraign
Power, exercis'd less of the Paternal Affection in
their Government, and look'd upon those they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
as their mere Subjects, not as their Allies:
and by degrees, according to the custom of exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Power, considering only the extent of their
own Jurisdiction, and what they might do, they
treated those who were under them not as Subjects,
but as slaves, who having no right to any thing but
what they gave them, would allow them to possess
nothing but what they had no mind to have them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Estates they had none that they could call
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60912:40"/>
their own, because when their Soveraign call'd for
them, they were his; their persons were at his command
when he had either occasion or appetite to use them,
and their Children inherited nothing but the subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of their Parents: so that they were happy or
miserable, as he who had the power and command
over them exercised that power with more or less ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor
or indulgence, they submitting to both, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
the dominion to be naturally absolute,
and their subjection and obedience to be as natural.
Kings had not long delighted themselves with this
exorbitant exercise of their power (for tho the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
had bin still the same, the exercise of it had bin
very moderate, whilst there remain'd the tenderness
or memory of any relation) but they begun to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
(according to their faculties of discerning, as
their parts were better or worse) that the great
strength they seem'd to be possess'd of, must in a
short time end in absoulte weakness, and the plenty
they seem'd to enjoy, would become exceeding want
and beggary; that no man would build a House that
his Children should not inherit, nor cultivate Land
with good husbandry and expence, the fruit and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
whereof might be taken by another man; that
whilst their Subjects did not enjoy the convenience
and delight of life, they could not be sure of the
affection and help of them, when they should enter
into a difference with one who is as absolute as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but they would rather chuse to be subject to
him, whose Subje<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts liv'd with more satisfaction un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him: in a word, that whilst they engross'd all
power, and all wealth into their own hands, they
should find none who would defend them in the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of it; and that there is great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the subjection that love and discretion paies,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60912:40"/>
and that which results only from fear and force; and
that despair puts an end to that duty, which nature,
and it may be Conscience too, would still perswade
them to pay, and to continue; and therefore that it
was necessary that the Subjects should find profit and
comfort in obeying, as well as Kings pleasure in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding.
These wise and wholsom Reflexions
prevail'd with Princes for their own benefit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
themselves, to make their Power less abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
that it might be more useful; to give their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
a property that should not be invaded but in
such cases, and with such and such circumstances, and
a liberty that should not be restrain'd, but upon such
terms as they could not but think reasonable. And
as they found the benefit to grow from those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descentions
in the improvement of Civility, and
those additions of delight which makes Life and
Government the more pleasant, they inlarg'd the
Graces and Concessions to their Subjects, reserving
all in themselves which they did not part with by
their voluntary Grants and Promises. And if we
take a view of the several Kingdoms of the World,
we shall see another manner of beauty, glory and
lustre in those Governments, where those conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scentions,
concessions, and contracts have bin most
or best observ'd, then in those Dominions where the
Soveraigns retain to themselves all the Rights and
Prerogatives which are invested in them by the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
nature of Government; upon which we shall
inlarge hereafter.</p>
               <p>This is the original and pedigree of Government,
equally different from that which the levelling fancy
of some men would reduce their Soveraign to, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an imagination that Princes have no autority or
power but what was originally given them by the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60912:41"/>
People, and that it cannot be presumed that they
would give them so much as might be applied to their
own destruction, and from that which Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>
hath instituted, by framing formal Instruments by
which an assembly of mankind (which was never
heard of, nor can be conceiv'd practicable) hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd
from themselves into one man of their own
choice, an absolute Power by their own consent, to
exercise it in such a manner as to his pleasure is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
without the observation of the common rules
of Justice or Sobriety; whereas it cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
possible in nature, that ever such an assembly
of men of equal autority in themselves, will ever
agree to make one Man their Soveraign with such
an absolute Jurisdiction over the rest, as must devest
them of all property as well as power for the future;
and whereas in truth all power was by God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
invested into one Man, where still as much of
it remains as he hath not parted with, and shar'd
with others, for the good and benefit of those (and
the mutual security of both) for whose benefit it was
first intrusted to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the rest, which is enough, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
still in him, and may be applied to the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the whole, against the fancies of those
who think he hath nothing but what they have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him; and likewise against those who believe
that so much is given him, that he hath power to
leave no body else any thing to enjoy; the last of
which are no less enemies to Monarchy then the
former.</p>

from them; insomuch as no man can
think he is really in earnest, when, to prove that the
Kings word is sufficient to take any thing from any
Subject when there is need, and that the King is
Judg of that need, he alledges the example of our
Saviour, who, he saies, as King of the Jews (p. 106)
<hi>commanded his Disciples to take the Asses Colt to carry
him to Ierusalem,</hi> which he saies the owner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<hi>and did not ask whether his necessity was a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
title, nor whether he was Iudg of that necessity,
but did acquiesce in the will of the Lord:</hi> which is a
very bold and ungrave wresting of Scripture to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
it could not intend; since our Saviour did not
profess to do one act as a King of the Jews, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
<hi>that his kingdom was not of this world.</hi> And
at the time he told the Messengers who were sent
for the Ass, that if they were ask'd what they meant
by it, they should answer, that the Lord had need of
him, upon which he knew, and he said, that they
would let him go, and upon that he grounded their
Commission. If the owner would not permit them
to take it, the Messengers had no autority to have
brought it to him. And his inference from, and
the gloss he makes upon the question that God asked
of Adam, (p. 106.) <hi>Hast thou eaten?</hi> hath as little
warrant from that text, as the other improper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of our Saviour. And sure when Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>
thought fit by this example of our Saviour in this
place to wrest all property from the Subject, he did
not intend in any other place so far to devest him
of any autority, that men were not <hi>bound to believe
any thing he said, or to do any thing he commanded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had no Commission which required obedience,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60912:42"/>
his Kingdom being not yet of this world.</hi> So unwary
he is in the contradicting himself; as all men are, who
first resolve what they are to prove, before they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what it is that is true.</p>
               <p>We are not oblig'd, nor indeed have any reason
to believe, that God was offended with the Children
of Israel for desiring a King, which was a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
himself had instituted over them, and to
which they had bin long accustomed, and had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergon
much misery, and confusion whilst there was
no King in Israel; but for their mutinous manner of
asking it, and the reason they gave for it, that they
might be like other nations, which God had taken
all possible care that they should not be, and enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to learn nothing of them. And the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
which <hi>Samuel</hi> made of the exorbitant pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Kings, which indeed the Kings of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
did exercise, by whose example they desir'd to
be govern'd, was rather to terrify them from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
their foolish demand, then to constitute such
a Prerogative as the King should use whom God
would appoint to go in and out before them; which
methinks is very manifest, in that the worst Kings
that ever reign'd over them, never challeng'd or
assum'd those Prerogatives. Nor did the people
conceive themselves liable to those impositions; as
appears by the application they made to <hi>Rehoboam</hi>
upon the death of <hi>Solomon,</hi> that he would abate
some of that rigor his Father had exercised towards
them; the rough rejection of which, contrary to
the advice of his wisest Counsellors, cost him the
greater part of his Dominions: and when <hi>Rehoboam</hi>
would by Arms have reduc'd them to obedience,
God would not suffer him, because he had bin in the
fault himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:60912:42"/>
I am willing to take an occasion in this place to
wish, that no better Divines then Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> had from
this place in <hi>Samuel,</hi> presum'd very unwarrantably
to draw inferences, to lessen the Subjects reverence
and obedience to Kings, and to raise a prejudice
and disesteem in Kings towards their Subjects, as
people whose affections and good will are of no
use to them, since they can present nothing to them
that is their own, nor have any thing to give, but
what they may take from them; which two very
different rather then contrary Conclusions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Devines (and some of parts) according to their
several inclinations and appetites, have presumed to
wrest from that place of Scripture; the one party
of them, as is said before, endeavouring malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to render Monarchy odious and insupportable,
by the unlimited affections, and humors, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
and power of a single uncontroulable person;
the other believing as unreasonably, that the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
natures, and hearts of the people, cannot be
appli'd to the necessary obedience towards their
Princes, nor their reverence and duty be so well fix'd
and devoted to them, as by thinking that they have
nothing of their own, but whatsoever they enjoy
they have only by the bounty of the King, who can
take it from them when he pleases: and to this
last party Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> his speculation hath for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
disposed him to adhere, tho in any other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
opinion he doth not concur with any Divine
of any Church in Christendom. For the first, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
doth well consider the wonderful confused Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
that was exercised over the Children of
Israel from the death of <hi>Ioshua,</hi> when the Monarchy
was interrupted, under the Judges for the space of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60912:43"/>
three hundred years, the barbarous negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
in the instructions of the people in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of God, and of their duty to him, insomuch
that the very next generation after the death of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shuah</hi>
had lost, or was without the whole History of
what God had don for them, and of what he expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from them; so unfaithful a guide, or remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer
is Tradition, when the Scripture it self is not
to be found: I say, whosoever considers likewise the
quality, and talent, and humor of many of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Judges who had bin over them, as the repeted Acts
of indiscretion and folly in <hi>Sampson,</hi> which could not
but make his judgment to be in the less reverence, &amp;
the strength of his arms to be more admir'd then that
of his head; with the present state they were then in
under the sons of <hi>Samuel,</hi> who were no better then the
Sons of <hi>Ely</hi> had bin, will not perhaps so very much
blame them for desiring a King: and tho the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of their asking it might, as hath bin said, offend
<hi>Samuel,</hi> and in some degree displease God, yet he
might not be offended absolutely with the thing it
self, since it was no more then God himself had in a
manner prescrib'd to them, as well as foretold, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any kind of disapprobation. <hi>When thou art
come into the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>and shalt say, I will set a King over me, like as
all the Nations which are about me, Thou shalt in any
wise set him a King over thee, whom the Lord thy God
shall chuse.</hi> Deut. 17. 14, 15, 16, 17. God was well
content that they should have a King, but reserv'd
the election of him to himself: he would have no
transferring of rights, or covenanting for one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he would chuse his own Representative. Nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
all the customs of the Nations, which he
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60912:43"/>
orbad them to follow, did God ever shew the least
dislike of their Government by Kings, which had
bin instituted originally by himself, and probably
bin continued by them even from the time of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
however their manners were degenerated
and the knowledg of him totally forgotten. And in
what degrees of grace and favor that high calling
hath bin ever since with him, appears by the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them throughout the whole current of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
by the Prerogatives he hath granted to
them, and by his imparting to them even his own
appellation.</p>
               <p>They who will in the next place, deduce the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of the absolute and illimited power of Kings
from that declaration by <hi>Samuel,</hi> which indeed seems
to leave neither Property, or Liberty in their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and could be only intended by <hi>Samuel</hi> to terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
them from that mutinous and seditious clamor,
since it hath no foundation from any other part of
Scripture, nor was ever practic'd or exercis'd by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
good King who succeeded over them, and was
blessed, and approv'd by God: and therefore when
those State Empirics, of what degree or quality so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
will take upon them to prescribe a new diet
and exercise to Soveraign Princes, and invite them
to assume new power and prerogatives over the
people, by the Precepts, Warrants, and Prescripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Scripture, they should not presume to
make the sacred writ subject to their own private
fancies. And if according to the more authentic
method of interpreting doubtful places, they had
recourse to that place, where the same matter is first
handled, they would then have found, by resorting
to the before mention'd place in Deuteronomy, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60912:44"/>
their kind of Scheme for the power, and government
of Kings. There, when God intended that they
should be governed by a King whom he would him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
chuse, he prescrib'd what he should not do and
what he should do. <hi>He should not multiply Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to himself,</hi> &amp;c. which only concern'd that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that they might have no temtation to return to
Egypt, <hi>Ye shall henceforth no more return that may,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Nor shall he multiply Wives,</hi> &amp;c. Tho multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
of Wives seem'd to be permitted, yet he was
to have a care that the number of them did not turn
his heart away. <hi>Nor should he greatly multiply unto
himself Silver, and Gold,</hi> &amp;c. not so affect, and set
his heart upon being rich, to be temted to oppress
his Subjects, or to injure his Neighbors; and so far
the negative directed. Then for the affirmative, <hi>That
he should write a copy of the Law in a Book,</hi> &amp;c.
Deut. 17. 18, 19, 20. <hi>that it should be with him, and he
should read therein all the daies of his life, that he
might learn to fear the Lord his God, and to keep all
the words of the Law, and these Statutes to do them;
that his heart be not lifted up, and that he turn not
aside from the Commandment to the right hand, or to
the left;</hi> and from this Text the <hi>Rabbins</hi> concluded,
that he was to write a Book of the Law for himself,
and if he had none before he was King, he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
assoon as he was King to have two, one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he was to have alwaies whith him, <hi>sive cum vadit ad

                     </gap>ut in mensa, &amp;c,</hi>
Those were the injunctions which God prescrib'd
to his King, and were observ'd by all those who were
bless'd and approv'd by him, for <hi>David</hi> seems by the
words of <hi>Nathan</hi> to have some particular allowance
for the great number of his Wives; and multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60912:44"/>
gold, and silver, was for the building of the
Temple, and no private use of his one; and <hi>Solomons</hi>
excessive greatness, was from the immediate boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of God himself; but he no sooner violated those
Precepts, and exceeded that moderation that was
prescrib'd to him towards his Subjects, and with
reference to the multiplying Wives; then his heart
turn'd away from God, and God turn'd away from
him.</p>
               <p>This pleasant suggestion by which he would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance
that importunate and impertinent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of an example of such a Government as he
would institute, that tho <hi>in all places of the world
men should lay the foundation of their houses in sand,
it could not thence be inferr'd that so it ought to be,</hi> will
never perswade men to change a Government they
have bin for many hundred years happy under
(tho with some vicissitudes of fortune) for an
imaginary Government by his Rules of Arithmetic
and Geometry, of which no Nation hath ever yet
had the experiment: and if there be any Country
where is a Sand of that nature, that hath support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the greatest edifices for hundreds of years, against
all the storms of wind and rage of tempests, he
shall be much too nice and scrupulous a person, who

21.</head>
               <p>MR. <hi>Hobbes</hi> is so great an enemy to freedom
that he will not allow Man that which God
hath given him, the Freedom of his Will,
but he shall not entangle me in that Argument, which
he hath enough exercis'd himself in with a more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
Adversary, who I think hath bin much too hard
for him at his own weapon, Reason, the Learned
Bishop of <hi>Derry,</hi> who was afterwards Arch-Bishop
of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and by which he hath put him into
greater choler then a Philosopher ought to subject
himself to, the terrible strokes whereof I am not
willing to undergo, and therefore shall keep my self
close to that freedom and liberty only that is due to
Subjects, and of which, his business in this Chapter,
is to deprive them totally.</p>
               <p>A man would have expected from Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory
of the several rights and powers of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
in his eighteenth Chapter, of which one
was to prescribe Rules <hi>(pag. 91.) whereby every man
might know what goods he may enjoy, and what actions he
might do without being molested by any of his fellow Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi>
which he saies, <hi>Men call Propriety,</hi> that some
such Rule should be established as might secure that
Porpriety, how little soever: but he hath now bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
explain'd himself, and finds, that Liberty and
Property are only fences against the Invasion or
force of fellow Subjects, but towards the Soveraign
of no use or signification at all. No man hath a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60912:45"/>
in any thing, that can restrain the King from
taking it from him, and the liberty of a Subj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eth only in those things, which in regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
their actions, the Soveraign hath pretermitted, such
as is the liberty to buy and sell, and otherwise contract
with one another; to chuse their own abode, their own
diet, their own trade of life, and to institute their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
as they think fit, and the like.</hi> I wonder he did
not insert the liberty to wear his Clothes of that
fashion which he likes best, which is as important as
most of his other Concessions. And yet he seems to
be jealous, that even this liberty should make men
imagine, that the Soveraign power should be in any
degree limited, or that any thing he can do to a
Subject, and upon what pretence soever, may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
injustice or injury, the contrary whereof he
saies he hath shewed already; for he takes it as grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that all that he hath said he had proved: and if
he hath not, he hath don it now substantially by the
example of <hi>Iepthah,</hi> in causing his daughter to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crific'd
(of which he is not sure) and by <hi>Davids</hi> kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<hi>Vriah,</hi> which he saies, tho it was against equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
yet it was not an injury to <hi>Vriah,</hi> because the
right was given him by <hi>Vriah,</hi> which I dare swear
<hi>Vriah</hi> never knew he had don. And by such unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Arguments he would perswade men to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to be undon; very like those which the <hi>Stoics</hi>
as obstinately maintain'd, That a wise man could
not be injur'd because he was not capable nor sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of it. But I wonder more, that he doth not
discern what every other man cannot but discern,
that by his so liberal taking away, he hath not left
the Subject any thing to enjoy even of those narrow
concessions which he hath made to him. For how
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60912:46"/>
can any man believe that he hath liberty to buy and
sell, when the Soveraign power can presently take
away what he hath sold, from him who hath bought
it, and consequently no man can sell or buy to any
purpose? Who can say that he can chuse his own a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode,
or his own trade of life, or any thing, when
assoon as he hath chosen either, he shall be requir'd
to go to a place where he hath no mind to go, and to
do somwhat he would not chuse to do? for his person
is no more at his own disposal then his goods are; so
that he may as graciously retain to himself all that he
hath granted.</p>
               <p>Whether the Soveraign Power, or the Liberty of
the Subject receive the greater injury and prejudice
by this brief state and description he makes of the
no liberty, that is, the portion he leaves to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
would be a great question, if he had not bin
pleas'd himself to determine, that his Subject (for God
forbid that any other Prince should have such a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject)
is not capable of an injury; by which the
whole mischief is like to fall upon the Soveraign.
And what greater mischief and ruine can threaten
the greatest Prince, then that their Subjects should
believe, that all the liberty they have, consists only
in those things which the Soveraign hath hitherto
pretermitted, that is, which he hath not yet taken
from them, but when he pleases in regulating their
actions to determine the contrary, they shall then
have neither liberty to buy or sell, nor to contract
with each other, to chuse their own abode, their
own diet, their own trade of life, or to breed their
own children; and to make their misery compleat,
and their life as little their own as the rest, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
the Soveraign can do to his Subject, on what
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60912:46"/>
pretence soever, as well in order to the taking away
his Life as his Estate, can be called injustice or inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
I say, what greater insecurity can any Prince be
in or under, then to depend upon such Subjects?
And alas! what security to himself or them can the
Sword in his hand be, if no other hand be lift up on
his behalf, or the Swords in all other hands be
directed against him, that he may not cut off their
heads when he hath a mind to it? and it is not
Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s autority that will make it believ'd,
that he who desires more liberty, demands an exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from all Laws, by which all other men may be
masters of their lives; and that every Subject is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of every act the Soveraign doth, upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
supposition of a consent that never was
given; and if it were possible to have bin given, must
have bin void at the instant it was given, by Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s
own rules, as shall be made out in its place.
He himself confesses, <hi>(pag. 295.)</hi> and saies it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to the meanest capacities, that <hi>mens actions are
deriv'd from the opinion they have of the good and evil
which from those actions redound unto themselves, and
consequently men that are once possessed of an opinion that
their obedience to the Soveraign power will be more hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to them then their disobedience, will disobey the Laws,
and thereby over-throw the Common-wealth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
confusion and civil War, for the avoiding where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
all civil Government was ordained.</hi> If this be true,
(as there is no reason to believe it to be) is it possible
that any man can believe, that the People, for we
speak not of convincing the Philosophers and the
Mathematicians, but of the general affections of the
People, which must dispose them to obedience, that
they can be perswaded by a long train of Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60912:47"/>
from the nature of man, and the end of
Government, and the institution thereof by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
and Covenants, of which they never heard, to
believe that it is best for them to continue in the
same nakedness in which they were created, for fear
their clothes may be stoln from them, and that they
have parted with their liberty to save their lives?
There is no question, but of all calamities the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of War is greatest, and the rage and uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of civil War most formidable of all War. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
foreign War seldom destroies a Nation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
domestic Combinations and Conspiracies, which
makes a complication with civil War; and sure no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can more inevitably produce that, then an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
opinion in the People, that their Soveraign
can take from them all they have whenever he hath a
mind to it, and their lives to, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice,
and consequently that their obedience to
him will be more hurtful to them then their disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
so well hath he provided for the security of
his Soveraign, if his doctrine were believ'd.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> is too much conversant in both those
learned Languages, to wish that the Western World
were depriv'd of the Greek and Latine Tongues,
for any mischief they have don; and upon my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
what ever errors may have bin brought into
Philosophy by the autority of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> no man
ever grew a Rebel by reading him; and if the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Monarch that hath ever bin in the World, except
the Monarch of the World, had thought his Tutor
<hi>Aristotle</hi> had bin so great an enemy to Monarchy
(yet he knew he was born and bred in a Republic)
and that his Works contribute so much to sedition,
as Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> supposes, he would not have valued
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60912:47"/>
his Person so much, nor read his Works with such
diligence as he did. And if Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> would take a
view of the Insurrections, and the civil Wars which
have at any time bin stirr'd up in the Western parts,
he will not find that they have bin contriv'd or fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by men who had spent much time in the
reading Greek and Latin Authors, or that they have
bin carried on upon the Maxims and Principles
which they found there. <hi>Iack Straw</hi> and <hi>Wat Tyler,</hi>
whose Insurrection, in respect of the numbers and
the progress it made, was as dangerous as hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
in any Age or Climate, had never read <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
or <hi>Cicero;</hi> and I belive, had Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> bin of
this opinion when he taught <hi>Thucydides</hi> to speak
English, which Book contains more of the Science
of Mutiny and Sedition, and teaches more of that
Oratory that contributes thereunto, then all that
<hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> have publish'd in all their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
he would not have communicated such ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
to his Country-men. But if this new Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
and Doctrine of Policy and Religion
should be introduc'd, taught, and believ'd, where <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
and <hi>Cicero</hi> have don no harm, it would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
Monarchy more in two months, then those
two great men have don since their deaths; and men
would reasonably wish, that the Author of it had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
bin born in the English Climate, nor bin taught
to write and read.</p>
               <p>It is a very hard matter for an Architect in State
and Policy, who doth despise all Precedents, and
will not observe any Rules of practice, to make such
a model of Government as will be in any degree
pleasant to the Governor, or governed, or secure
for either; which Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> finds; and tho he
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60912:48"/>
takes a liberty to raise his Model upon a supposition
of a very formal Contract, that never was, or ever
can be in nature, and hath the drawing and preparing
his own form of Contract, is forc'd to allow such a
latitude in obedience to his Subject, as shakes the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
pillars of his Government. And therefore, tho
he be contented that by the words of his Contract,
<hi>(pag. 112.) Kill me, and my fellow if you please,</hi> the
absolute power of all mens lives shall be submitted
to the disposal of the Governors will and pleasure,
without being oblig'd to observe any rules of Justice
and Equity; yet he will not admit into his Contract
the other words, <hi>(pag. 112.) I will kill my self, or my
fellow,</hi> and therefore that he is not bound by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of his Soveraign to execute any dangerous or
dishonorable office; but in such cases, men are not
to resort so much to the words of the submission, as
to the intention: which distinction surely may be as
applicable to all that monstrous autority which he
gives the Governor to take away the Lives and
Estates of his Subjects, without any cause or reason,
upon an imaginary Contract, which if never so real,
can never be supposed to be with the intention of
the Contractor in such cases. And the subtle Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
he finds out to excuse Subjects from yielding
obedience to their Soveraigns, and the Prerogative
he grants to fear, for a whole Army to run away
from the Enemy without the guilt of treachery or
injustice, leaves us some hope, that he will at last
allow such a liberty to Subjects, that they may not
in an instant be swallowed up by the prodigious pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
which he pleases to grant to his Soveraign. And
truly, he degrades him very dishonorably, when he
obliges him to be the Hang-man himself, of all those
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60912:48"/>
Malefactors, which by the Law are condemn'd to die;
for he gives every man autority, without the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his duty, or swerving from the rules of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
absolutely to refuse to perform that office. Nor
hath he provided much better for his security, then
he hath for his honor, when he allows it lawful for
any number of men, <hi>(pag. 112.) who have rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Soveraign, or committed some capital crime, for
which every one of them expects death, then to join toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and defend each other, because they do but defend
their lives, which the guilty man,</hi> he saies, <hi>may do as
well as the innocent.</hi> And surely, no man can legally
take his life from him who may lawfully defend it;
and then the murderer, or any other person guilty
of a capital Crime, is more innocent, and in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
condition then the Executioner of Justice, who
may be justly murdered in the just execution of his
office. And it is a very childish security that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
for his Soveraign against this Rebellion, and
defence of themselves against the power of the Law,
<hi>(pag. 113.)</hi> that he declares <hi>it to be lawful only for the
d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fence of their lives, and that upon the offer of pardon
for themselves, that self-defence is unlawful:</hi> as if a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
that is lawfully drawn together, with strength e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to defend their lives against the power of the
Law, are like to disband and lay down their Arms,
without other benefit and advantage then only of
the saving of their lives. But tho he be so cruel as
to devest his Subjects of all that liberty, which the
best and most peaceable men desire to possess, yet he
liberally and bountifully confers upon them such a
liberty as no honest man can pretend to, and which
is utterly inconsistent with the security of Prince
and People; which unreasonable Indulgence of his
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60912:49"/>
cannot but be thought to proceed from an unlawful
affection to those, who he saw had power enough to
defend the transcendent wickedness they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
tho they were without an Advocate to make
it lawful for them to do so, till he took that office
upon him in his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> as is evident by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
he gives in the next Paragraph, that he thinks
it lawful for every man to have as many wives as he
pleases, if the King will break the silence of the
Law, and declare that he may do so; which is a
Prerogative he vouchsafes to grant to the Soveraign,
to balance that liberty he gave to the Subject to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
himself and his companion against him, and is
the only power that may inable him to be too hard
for the other.</p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> did not believe that the autority of
his Name, and the pleasantness of his Style, would
lull men asleep from enquiring into the Logic of his
Discourse, he could not but very well discern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
that this very liberty which he allows the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to have, and which he doth without scruple en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,
to sue the Soveraign, and to demand the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his Cause, and that Sentence be given ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Law, results only from that conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scention
and contract which the Soveraign hath
made with his Subject, and which can as well secure
many other Liberties to them, as their power to sue
the King; for there could be no Law precedent to
that resignation of themselves and all they had, at
the institution of their supreme Governor; and if
there had bin, it had bin void and invalid, it being
not possible that any man who hath right to nothing,
and from whom any thing that he hath may be taken
away, can sue his Soveraign for a debt which he
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60912:49"/>
might take, if it were due from any other man,
but can by no means be due from him to whom
all belongs, and who hath power to forbid any Judg
to proceed upon that complaint, or any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to presume to make that complaint, were it not
for the subsequent contract which he calls a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Law, by which the Soveraign promises and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges
himself to appoint Judges to exercise Justice
even where himself is party, and that he will be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before those Judges, if he doth not pay what he
ow's to his Subjects. This is the Contract which
gives that capacity of suing, and which by his own
consent and condescention lessens his Soveraignty,
that his Subjects may require Justice from him. And
yet all these promises, and lessenings, he pronounces
as void, and to amount to contradictions, that must
dissolve the whole Soveraign power, and leave the
people in confusion and war. Whereas the truth is,
these condescentions, and voluntary abatements of
some of that original power that was in them, have
drawn a cheerful submission, and bin attended by a
ready obedience to Soveraignty, from the time that
Subjects have bin at so great a distance from being
consider'd as Children, and that Soveraigns have bin
without those natural tendernesses in the exercise
of their power, and which in the rigor of it could
never have bin supported. And where these obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are best observ'd, Soveraignty flourishes with
the most lustre, and security; Kings having still
all the power remaining in them, that they have not
themselves parted with, and releas'd to their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Subjects having no pretence to more
liberty or power then the King hath granted and
given to them: and both their happiness, and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60912:50"/>
consists in containing themselves within their
own limits, that is, King, not to affect the recovery
of that exorbitant power, which their Ancestors
wisely parted with, as well for their own as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
benefit; and Subjects to rejoice in those liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which have bin granted to them, and not to
wish to lessen the power of the King, which is not
greater then is necessary for their own perserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And to such a wholsom division, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of power as this is, that place of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
(with which Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> is still too bold) <hi>a
Kingdom d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>vided in it self cannot stand,</hi> cannot be
applied.</p>
               <p>But that this Supreme Soveraign, whom he hath
invested with the whole property and liberty of all
his Subjects, and so invested him in it, that he hath
not power to part with any of it by promise, or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
or release, may not be too much exalted with
his own greatness, he hath humbled him sufficiently
by giving his Subjects leave to withdraw their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
from him when he hath most need of their
assistance, for <hi>the</hi> (pag. 114.) <hi>obligation of Subjects to
the Soveraign is understood</hi> (he saies) <hi>to last as long, and
no longer, then the power lasts to protect them.</hi> So that
assoon as any Town, City, or Province of any
Princes Dominions, is invaded by a Foreign Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
or possessed by a Rebellious Subject, that the
Prince for the present cannot suppress the Power
of the one, or the other, the people may lawfully
resort to those who are over them, and for their
Protection perform all the Offices and duties of
good Subjects to them, (pag 114.) <hi>For the right
men have by nature to protect themselves when none
else can protect them, can by no covenant be relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish'd,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60912:50"/>
and the end of obedience is protection, which
wherever a man seeth it either in his own, or in an
others sword, nature applieth his obedience to it and
his endeavours to maintain it.</hi> And truly it is no
wonder if they do so, and that Subjects take the
first opportunity to free themselves from such a
Soveraign as he hath given them, and chuse a
better for themselves. Whereas the duty of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
is, and all good Subjects believe they owe
another kind of duty and obedience to their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,
then to withdraw their subjection because
he is oppress'd; and will prefer poverty, and death
it self, before they will renounce their obedience
to their natural Prince, or do any thing that may
advance the service of his Enemies. And since Mr.
<hi>Hobbes</hi> gives so ill a testimony of his Government
(which, by the severe conditions he would oblige
mankind to submit to for the support of it, ought
to be firm, and not to be shaken) (pag. 114.)
<hi>that it is in its own nature not only subject to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
death by foreign war, but also from the ignorance
and passion of men, that it hath in it from the very
institution many seeds of natural mortality by inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine
discord,</hi> worse then which he cannot say of
any Government, we may very reasonably prefer
the Government we have, and under which we
have enjoi'd much happiness, before his which we
do not know, nor any body hath had experience
of, and which by his own confession is liable to
all the accidents of mortality which any others
have bin; and reject his that promises so ill, and
exercises all the action of War in Peace, and
when War comes, is liable to all the misfortunes
which can possibly attend or invade it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:60912:51"/>
Whether the relation of Subjects be extinguisht
in all those cases, which Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> takes upon him
to prescribe, as Imprisonment, Banishment, and
the like, I leave to those who can instruct him better
in the Law of Nations, by which they must be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
notwithstanding all his Appeals to the Law of
Nature; and I presume, if a banish'd Person (p.
114) <hi>during which,</hi> he saies, <hi>he is not subject,</hi> shall
join in an action under a Foreign power against his
Country, wherein he shall with others be taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner,
the others shall be proceeded against as Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of War, when he shall be judg'd as a Traitor
and Rebel, which he could not be, if he were not
a Subject: and this not only in the case of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile
action, and open attemt, but of the most secret
conspiracy that comes to be discover'd. And if this
be true, we may conclude it would be very unsafe to
conduct our selves by what Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> (p. 105.)
<hi>finds by speculation, and deduction of Soveraign rights
from the nature, need<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and designs of men.</hi> Surely
this woful desertion, and defection in the cases above
mention'd, which hath bin alwaies held criminal by
all Law that hath bin current in any part of the
World, receiv'd so much countenance and justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
by Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> his Book, and more by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
that <hi>Cromwel</hi> found the submission to
those principles produc'd a submission to him, and
the imaginary relation between Protection and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
so positively proclam'd by him, prevail'd
for many years to extinguish all visible fidelity to
the King, whilst he perswaded many to take the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
as a thing lawful, and to become Subjects
to the Usurper, as to their legitimate Soveraign;
of which great service he could not abstain from
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60912:51"/>
bragging in a Pamphlet set forth in that time,
that he alone, and his doctrine had prevail'd with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to submit to the Government, who would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
have disturb'd the public Peace, that is, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
their fidelity to their true Soveraign, and to
be faithful to the Usurper.</p>
               <p>It appears at last, why by his institution he would
have the power, and security of his Soveraign, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and only to depend upon the Contracts, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants
which the people make one with another,
to transfer all their right to a third person (who
shall be Soveraign) without entring into any Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with the Soveraign himself, which would have
devested them of that liberty to disobey him, which
they have reserv'd to themselves; or receiving any
Covenant from him, which might have obliged him
to have kept his promise to them; by which they
might have had somewhat left to them which they
might have called their own, which his institution
will not bear, all such promises being void. But if
he be so tender-hearted, as to think himself oblig'd
to observe all the promises, and make good all the
Grants he hath made, by which he may be disabled
to provide for their safety, which is the ground that
hath made all those Grants and Promises to be void,
he hath granted him Power to remedy all this, by
(P. 114.) <hi>directly renouncing, or transferring the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty
to another: and that he might openly, and in
plain terms renounce, or transfer it, he makes no doubt;</hi>
and then he saies, <hi>if a Monarch shall relinquish the
Soveraignty both for himself, and his heirs, his subjects
return to the absolute liberty of nature. Because tho na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
may declare who are his sons, and who are the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of his kin, yet it dependeth on his own will who
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60912:52"/>
shall be his Heir: and if he will have no Heir, There is
no Soveraignty, or Subjection.</hi> This seems the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
condition for the poor Subject that he can be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
unto, that when he hath devested himself of all
the right he had, only for his Soveraigns protection,
that he may be redeem'd from the state of War and
confusion that nature hath left him in, and hath paid
so dear for that protection, it is left still in his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns
power to withdraw that protection from
him, to renounce his subjection, and without his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to transer the Soveraignty to another, to whom
he hath no mind to be subject. One might have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
that this new trick of transferring, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting,
had bin an universal remedy, that being once
applied would for ever prevent the ill condition and
confusion that nature had left us in, and that such
a right would have bin constituted by it, that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty
would never have fail'd to the Worlds
end: and that when the subject can never retract,
or avoid the bargain he hath made, how ill soever he
likes it, or improve it by acquiring any better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
in it, it shall notwithstanding be in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns
power without his consent, and it may be
without his privity, in an instant to leave him with
out any protection, without any security, and as a
prey to all who are too strong for him. This indeed
is the greatest Prerogative that he hath conferr'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Soveraign, when he had given him all that
belongs to his Subjects, that when he is weary of
Governing, he can destory them, by leaving them to
destory one another. For Kings and Princes to resign
and relinquish their Crown and Soveraignty, is no
new transaction, nor, it may be, the better for being
old. Some have left them out of Melancholy, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60912:52"/>
and when they have ceased to be Kings
made themselves Monks, and repented the change
of their conditions afterwards. Some out of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and bodily infirmities, have not bin able to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
the fatigue that the well exercising the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
required, and therefore have desir'd to see those
in the quiet possession of it, to whom it would of
right belong when they were dead; and the more
reasonably, if they fore-saw any difficulties like to
arise about their admission in those seasons; as
<hi>Charles</hi> the fifth apprehended with reference to some
of his dominions in <hi>Italy,</hi> if his Son <hi>Philip</hi> was not
in possession of them, before his Brother <hi>Ferdinando</hi>
came to be Emperor. Some Princes have bin so hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous,
as upon the frowardness and refractorines<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
of their Subjects, and because they could not govern
in that manner they had a mind to do, to abdicate
the Government, and would have bin glad after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to have resumed it. And others have bin to
wanton, as to relinquish their Crown because they
did not like the Climate in which their Dominions
lay, and only that they might live in a better Air,
and enjoy the delights and pleasures of a more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Situation. But all these generally never attemted
it, or imagin'd they could do it, without the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
and consent of their Subjects, which was
allwaies desir'd, and yielded to, with great formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And it is very strange that in those seasons of
Abdication, which supposes a suspension of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,
especially in Elective Kingdoms, for in
Hereditary the immortality of the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
dies, may make a difference, this invention
of Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> of transferring one anothers right,
and covenanting with one another, hath never bin
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60912:53"/>
heard of; and tho the Soveraignty is invested by
election, the People have very little share in that
election.</p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> would have exercis'd his Talent in
that spacious field, as he might have don with more
innocence, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it may be, more success, and have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
<hi>by his speculation and deduction of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
rights, from the nature, need, and designs of
men,</hi> to prove that it is not in the just power of a
Monarch to relinquish and renounce his Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
with what formality and consent soever; nor
more in the autority and power of the King to
abdicate and relinquish his Soveraignty over his
people, then it is in the autority of the people to
withdraw their submission and obedience from him;
and that the practice of such renunciations, tho ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
very frequent, hath bin the original and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of that mischeivous doctrine sow'd amongst
the people, of their having a co-ordinate power with
the Soveraign, which will be much cherished by his
new institution, since men are easily perswaded to
believe, that they can mar what they can make, and
may lawfully destroy what they create, that is, the
work of their own hands; I say, if he would have
laid out his reason upon that argument, he could
have made it shine very plausibly, and might have
made many Proselytes to his opinion; since ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Learned men are so much in their judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
that right of relinquishing and transferring
in Princes, that they believe it to be the only cause
wherein Subjects may lawfully take up defensive
Arms, that they may continue Subjects, and to
preserve their Subjection and Obedience from being
alien'd from him to whom it is due; and that no
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60912:53"/>
consent or concurrence can more make such an alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
lawful, then it can dissolve the bonds of Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,
and qualifie both parties to make a new choice
for themselves, that may be more grateful to them.

is a title as difficult to be understood by a literal
translation as most of those to any Chapter in <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez;</hi>
as few Congregations, when they meet in a
Church to pay their devotions to God Almighty, do
know that they are an irregular systeme: in which,
besides vulgar notions well worded, every man will
discover much of that which he calls signs of error,
and misreckoning, to which, he saies, (page. 116.)
<hi>all mankind is too prone,</hi> and with which that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter
abounds, and will require no confutation, but
that I find, and wonder to find mention of Laws,
and Letters Patents, Bodies Politic, and Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
as necessary Institutions for the carrying on,
and advancement of Trade, which are so many li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations
and restraints of the Soveraign power,
and so many entanglements under Covenants and
Promises, which as they are all declar'd to be void,
it is in vain to mention. I did not think Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>
had desir'd to establish trade, or any industry for the
private accumulation of riches in his Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
For is it possible to imagine, that any Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
will send out Ships to Sea, or make such a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of his Estate, if it may be either seized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
before it go's out, or together with the benefit
of the return when it comes home? If trade be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to the good of a Nation, it must be founded
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60912:54"/>
upon the known right of Propriety, not as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
other Subjects only, but against the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
himself; otherwise trade is but a trap to
take the collected wealth of particular men in a
heap, and when it is brought into less room, to
have it seized on, and confiscated by the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
word of the King with less trouble, and more
profit. And if any Laws, Letters Patents, Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
or any other obligations or promises, can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
the Soveraign power in these cases which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to trade and foreign adventures, why should
they not be equally valid for the securing all the
other parts and relations of Propriety? However,
whatsoever rigor Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> thinks fit to exercise
upon the Nobility and Gentry of the Nation,
he must give over all thoughts of trade, if he doth
not better provide to secure his Merchants both of
their liberty, and propriety.</p>
               <p>It is a good observation, and an argument for
the preference of Monarchy before any other
form of Government, in that where the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is popular, and the depressing the interest
and reputation of particular Subjects is an essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
policy of that Government, yet in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
the affairs of their Colonies and Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
at a distance from them, they chuse to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the same to a single person, as they do the
Government and conduct of their Armies, which
are to defend their Government; which is a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
implication, if not confession, that in their
own judgment they think the Monarchical the
best form of Government. But he might have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
likewise, that in all those Monarchical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions,
at what distance soever, there are limits
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60912:55"/>
and bounds set, by referring to instructions for the
punctual observation and performance of what that
State or Government hath bin bound by promise and
contract to perform; which hath the same force to
evince, that the performance of promises and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
is very consistent with Monarchical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:
for the hazards that may arrive from

               <p>It is a wonderful latitude that Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> leaves
to all his Subjects, and contradictory to all the
moral precepts given to the World, and to all
the notions of Justice, that he who hath his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
interest depending, and to be debated and
judg'd before any Judicatory, may make as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Friends as he can amongst those Judges, even
by giving them mony; as if, tho it be a crime
in a Judg to be corrupt, the person who corrupts
him may be innocent, because he thinks his own
cause just, and desires to buy justice for mony
which cannot be got without it; and so the grossest
and most powerful Bribery shall be introduc'd,
to work upon the weakness and poverty, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of a Judg, because the party thinks his cause
to be just, and chuses rather to depend upon the
affection of his Judg whom he hath corrupted,
then upon the integrity of his cause, and the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of the Law. But he doth not profess to be
a strict Casuist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor can be a good observer of the
Rules of moral honesty, who believes that he may
induce another to commit a great Sin, and remain
innocent himself. Nor is he in truth a competent
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60912:55"/>
Judg of the most enormous crimes, when he rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons
(pag. 56.) <hi>Theft, Adultery, Sodomy, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other vice that may be taken for an effect of power,

23.</head>
               <p>I Should with as little trouble have passed by his
twenty third Chapter of his Public Ministers,
and the fanciful Similies contain'd therein, not
thinking it of much importance what public or
private Ministers he makes for such a Soveraignty as
he hath instituted; but that I observe him in this
place (as most luxurious Fancies use to do) demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
and pulling down, what he had with great
care and vigilance erected and establish'd as undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
truth before. And whereas he hath in his eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Chapter, <hi>(pag. 91.)</hi> pronounced <hi>the right of
Iudicatory, of hearing and deciding all Controversies
which concern Law, either Civil or Natural, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Fact,</hi> to be inseparably annexed to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty,
and incapable of being aliened and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
by him; and afterwards declares, <hi>That the
judgments given by Iudges qualified, and commission'd
by him to that purpose, are his own proper Iudgments,
and to be regarded as such,</hi> which is a truth generally
confess'd; in this Chapter, against all practice and
all reason, he degrades him from at least half that
Power, and fancies a Judg to be such a party, that if
the Litigant be not pleased with the opinion of his
Judg in matter of Law, or matter of Fact, he may
therefore <hi>(pag. 125.) (because they are both Subjects to
the Soveraign)</hi> appeal from his Judg, and ought to be
tried before another: for tho the Soveraign may
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60912:56"/>
hear and determine the Cause himself if he please,
yet if he will appoint another to be Judg, it must
be such a one as they shall both agree upon; for as
the Complainant hath already made choice of his
own Judg, so the Defendant must be allow'd to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
against such of his Judges, whose interest
maketh him suspect them; which was never heard
of before this Institution, and the consequence of
it will best appear by an instance to be very ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
Let us suppose that an Information were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
in the Kings Bench (as it may well be) against
Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> for writing and publishing such a sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Book against the establish'd Government of
Church and State, as his <hi>Leviathan</hi> is; because the
Soveraign Judg will not hear &amp; determine this him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
but refers it those Judges who are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and commission'd by him to examine and punish
Crimes of such a nature, would it be reasonable that
Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> should except against his Judges, because
by their knowing the Law he may suspect them, and
refuse to be tri'd before any but those whom he shall
agree upon? and <hi>(pag. 125) can those be the properties
of just and rational Iudicature?</hi> He hath forgotten,
that before he erected his Soveraignty, when there
could be no Judicature, he saies, <hi>(pag. 78.) it is of
the Law of Nature, That they who are at Controversie,
submit their right to the judgment of an Arbitrator;</hi>
there indeed, for want of Judicature, there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of a mutual consent, without which no man
could take upon him to be an Arbitrator. If a man
hath a Suit upon matter of Title or Interest with a
Judg, notwithstanding that he is sworn to do right,
he is so far from being bound to bring his Action be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60912:57"/>
that Judg, that he may chuse whether it shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
in that Court of which that Judg is a Member,
tho the major part be unconcern'd, but may have
his Right tried in another Court: but if he should
have any part in the choice of his own Judg, especially
if he be criminal, Justice would be well administred.
Himself acknowledges, that the judgment of such
Judges, is the judgment of the Soveraign; and a
greater Person then the Soveraign hath given a fair
warning to those Judges; <hi>Take heed what ye do, for ye
judg not for man, but for the Lord, who is with you
in the judgment,</hi> 2 Chron. As it is the Kings judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he will punish it severely if it be corrupt; and
if he cannot discover it to be corrupt, for want of
complaint, or want of evidence, God will punish it
because it was his judgment: a corrupt Judg, of all
guilty persons, can never escape punishment.</p>
               <p>I am very glad that Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> is pleas'd with any
part of the administration of Justice in his own
Country (which he would hardly like if he were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to it:) and he might have observ'd that great
Priviledg of the Lords in <hi>England,</hi> of being tried
in all capital Crimes by their Peers, by Men of their
own quality and condition, to be a greater Priviledg
then the Nobility of any Nation in Europe enjoy.
The Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Dukes, and Peers,
and Mareschals of <hi>France,</hi> in those Transgressions
undergo the same forms of Justice, and are tried
before the same Judges, as the meanest Peasant is for
the like or the same Crime: and tho he calls it, and
saies it hath bin ever acknowledg'd as a Priviledg of
Favor, yet they look upon it as a Priviledg of
Right, of which they cannot be deprived by the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60912:57"/>
Word and Autority of the King. And it may be he
would be hardly able to bring this Priviledg under
his original Institution of Government, since pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
men being then all equal, they would never
have consented to such a difference, rather then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality,
in the form of Justice that was to be exercis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

towards them: and he values it too lightly, who
thinks it can be taken from them by any Arbitrary
Power.</p>
               <p>I cannot comprehend what Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s meaning
is, in making an Embassador sent from his Prince,
to congratulate, or condole, or to assist at a Sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnity,
to be but a private Person, because he saies,
<hi>(pag. 126.) the business is private, and belonging to him
in his natural capacity:</hi> whereas, his being sent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador,
and having in the performance of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of congratulating or condoling, or in his assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
at the Solemnity, the respect shew'd to him,
and the priviledg and precedence of the Person
of his Master, he cannot but be a public Person.
Nor can an Embassador come to be but a private
Person any other way, then by presuming to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
some unlawful thing, which he is not warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his Commission to do; and even in that case
he expects to be treated as a public Person, as well
by the security that Prince gave him by his Rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
as by the autority of the Prince who sent
him, and expects to be sent to, and tried before
his own Master: which depends much upon the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and circumstances of the Transgression. But
I wonder how Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> could bring the Rights and
Privileges of Embassadors under his disquisition,
since they cannot depend upon his Institution: for
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60912:58"/>
they neither do nor can proceed from the Covenant,
or Contracts, or teansferring of Rights between pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
persons; but he must make a new Institution for
Soveraigns, in which he will hardly be able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
them without some Covenants, which he hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
so much abhors.</p>

               <head>The Survey of Chapter
24.</head>
               <p>IT is the custom and delight that Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> takes
in the frequent repeting, almost in every Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter,
the lewd principles in his Institution, with
some variety of pleasant expressions and instances,
which he would have understood to add new vigor
to his former Arguments, that obliges me by Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tologies
to put the Reader in mind of what I have
said before, and to repete the same that hath bin
said; and so I must say again upon this Chapter of
the nutrition and procreation of a Common-wealth,
that he hath propos'd a very ungracious method to
himself in forming his Government, by assigning
a greater power and autority to his Soveraign, then
any honest Magistrate desires, or will ever exercise,
or can think himself secure in; and such a liberty and
property to the Subject, as they can take no delight
in, and consequently can never wish well to that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
under which they shall enjoy no more.
Nor will they ever believe themselves to be in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of liberty or plenty, when it is in the power of
any one man to dispossess them of both, or either, at
his good will and pleasure, without any violation of
any Justice that they can resort to, or complain of. It
is a very uncomfortable Propriety that any man can
have in his Lands and Goods, because his Neighbor
cannot take them from him, if his Prince can justly
take them from him, and give them to his Neigbor.
Princes have their particular Affections and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60912:59"/>
which sway them as much as other men, and
are prevail'd upon by the same strong motives and
impulsions; and if they may take away all from those
they do not like, and as much as they think fit from
those they like less, to give to those they love, and
to such as they like better, there can be no valuable
propriety in any body but the Soveraign alone: and
when it is once found to be in him alone, he will not
be long able to defend his own Propriety, or his own
Soveraignty. It is <hi>Machiavels</hi> exception against the
entertaining of foreign Forces, that they are only
mercenary, and therefore indifferent in their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which party wins or loses; and no doubt those
Soldiers fight most resolutely, who fight to defend
their own. And surely they who have nothing of
their own to lose but their lives, are as apt to throw
those away where they should not, as where they
should be exposed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it is the usual Artifice in all
Seditions, for the Leaders and Promoters of them,
to perswade the People, that the tendency and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of such and such actions don by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
extends to the depriving them of all their
propriety, the jealousie of which hurries them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all those acts of rage and despair, which prove
so fatal to Kingdoms. And there was never yet a
wise and fortunate prince, who hath not enervated
those Machinations, by all the professions, and all
the vindications of that Propriety, which they are
so vigilant to preserve and defend. And therefore it
is a wonderful propesterous foundation to support a
Government, to declare that the Subject hath no
propriety in any thing that excludes the Soveraign
from a right of disposing it; and it may be easily
believ'd, that there is not one Prince in Europe, I
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60912:59"/>
mean that is civiliz'd (for of the absolute power of
the Great Turk, from whence Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> hath bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
his Model, we shall have occasion to discourse
in another place) would be able to retain his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
one whole year, after he should declare, as
Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> doth, that his Subjects have no propriety
in any thing they possess, but that he may dispose of
all they have. For tho they do too often invade that
propriety, and take somwhat from them that is not
their own, they bear it better under the notion of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
and rapine, and as they look upon it as the
effect of some powerful Subjects evil advice (which
will in time be discover'd, and reform'd by the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of the Prince, as hath often fallen out) then they
would ever do under a claim of right, that could justly
take away all they have, because it is not the Subjects
but their own. And if Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> had taken the pains,
and known where to have bin inform'd of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
and Transactions of <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he would have found cause to believe, that that great
King did ever dexterously endeavor, from the time
that he was assured that his Possession would not be
disturb'd, to divest himself of the Title of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror,
and made his Legal Claim to what he had
got by the Will of <hi>Edward the Confessor,</hi> whose
Name was precious to the Nation, and who was
known to have a great Friendship for that Prince,
who had now recover'd what had bin his. And he
knew so well the ill consequence which must attend
the very imagination that the Nation had lost its
Propriety, that he made hast to grant them an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
that they should still enjoy all the benefits and
priviledges which were due to them by their own
Laws and Customs, by which they should be still go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60912:60"/>
as they were during that Kings whole Reign,
who had enough of the unquestionable Demesnes
and Lands belonging to the Crown, of which he was
then possessed without a Rival, and belonging to
those great men who had perish'd with their Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in the Battel with <hi>Harold,</hi> to distribute to those
who had born such shares, and run such hazards in
his prosperous adventure. And those Laws and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
which were before the Conquest, are the same
which the Nation and Kingdom have bin since go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
by to this day, with the addition of those
Statutes and Acts of Parliament, which are the Laws
of the successive Kings, with which they have grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd
their Subjects, in providing such new security
for them, and advantages to the public, as upon the
experience and observation of the Ages and Times
when they were made, contributed to the honor and
glory of the King, as well as the happiness of the
People; many of which are but the Copies and
Transcripts of ancient Land-marks, making the
Characters more plain the legible of what had bin
practic'd and understood in the preceding Ages, and
the observation whereof are of the same profit and
convenience to King and People.</p>
               <p>Such were the Laws in <hi>Tullies</hi> time, which Mr.
<hi>Hobbes</hi> wonderfully cites, to prove that which <hi>Tully</hi>
never heard of, and which indeed is quite contrary
to the end of his Discourse. <hi>(Pag. 127.)</hi> Is it possible
that <hi>Tully</hi> could ever have said, <hi>Let the Civil Law be
once abandoned, or but negligently guarded (not to say
oppressed) and there is nothing that any man can be sure
to receive from his Ancestor, or to leave to his Children?</hi>
and again, <hi>take away the Civil Law, and no man knows
what is his own, and what another mans?</hi> I say, he
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60912:60"/>
could never have mention'd and insisted upon this
grand security of man-kind, if he had understood
the Law to be nothing but the breath of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
who could grant, and dissolve, or repeal this
Law, with the speaking a word that his will or fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
dictates to him. How can any man receive from
his Ancestor, or leave to his Children, if he ben o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
sure that his Ancestor had, and that his Children shall
have a propriety? It was the importance of, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in this propriety, that produc'd that happy
and beneficial agreement between the Soveraign
power and the naked Subject, which is mention'd
before; that introduc'd the beauty of Building,
and the cultivating the Earth by Art as well as
Industry, by securing men, that they and their
Children should dwell in the Houses they were at
the charge to build, and that they should reap the
harvest of those Lands which they had taken the
pains to sow. Whatsoever is of Civility and good
Manners, all that is of Art and Beauty, or of real
and solid Wealth in the World, is the product of this
paction, and the child of beloved Propriety; and
they who would strangle this Issue, desire to demolish
all Buildings, eradicate all Plantations, to make the
Earth barren, and man-kind to live again in Tents,
and nurish his Cattle by successive marches into
those Fields where the grass grows. Nothing but the
joy in Propriety reduc'd us from this barbarity; and
nothing but security in the same, can preserve us
from returning into it again. Nor will any man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
so great prejudice and damage by this return, as
the Kings and Princes themselves, who had a very
ample recompence which they still enjoy, by divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60912:61"/>
their unprofitable propriety with their Subjects,
having ever since receiv'd much more profit from the
propriety in the hands of the Subjects, then they did
when it was in their own, or then they do from that
which they reserv'd to themselves; and they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
to have the more, or less upon a true account, as
this paction is the more or less exactly observ'd and
compli'd with.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> is much mistaken in his Historical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions,
as for the most part he uses to be, when he
saies, (<hi>pag.</hi> 129.) that the <hi>Conqueror, and his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
have alwaies laid arbitrary Taxes on all Subjests
Lands:</hi> except he calls what hath bin don by the free
consent of the Subject, which is according to the
paction, to be the arbitrary Tax of the Soveraign,
because the Law is the stamp of his own Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority.
And if such arbitrary Taxes have in truth
at any time bin laid upon the Subjects, he might have
observ'd (for somtimes it hath bin don) that the
Soveraign hath receiv'd much more dammage then
profit by it, and the Kingdom bin in a worse state of
security then it was before. Nor can any Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be made from the glory and prosperity of some
Crowns, which have somtimes exercis'd that arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Power, and reduc'd the Rules they ought to
govern by, to the standard of their own Will; which
yet they have don with such formality, as implies the
consent of their Subjects, tho they dare not but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
It hath bin too frequently seen too, that the
hurt and wounded patience of the People, hath, when
it may be it was least apprehended, redeem'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

refused to give any assistance to their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
when he hath real need of it, because he hath
wantonly extorted it from them when he had no
need. And then men pay too dear for their want of
providence, and find too late, that the neglect of
Justice is an infallible underminer, how undiscern'd
soever, of that security which their Policy would
raise for themselves, in the place of that which Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Justice had provided for them. I agree,
that it being impossible to fore-see what the expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which a Soveraign may be put to, will amount to,
it is as impossible by land, or otherwise to set aside
such a proportion as is necessary; but those extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
occasions must be supplied by such extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
waies, and with those formalities which
the Soveraign obliges himself to observe; by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving

can require very little deliberation. And the truth
is, the discourse of this Chapter, with the differences
between Command and Counsel, is more vulgar and
pedantic then he is usually guilty of, and it is easie
to be observ'd, that in his description of the office of
a Counsellor, and of the ability of c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>unselling,
(<hi>pag.</hi> 134.) that it <hi>proceeds from experience and long
study, and that it requires great knowledg of the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of man-kind; of the rights of Government, and
of the nature of Equity, Law, Iustice, and Honor, not
to be attain'd without study: and of the strengths, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
places bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k of their own Country and their
Neighbors; as also of the inclinations and designs of all
Nations that may any way annoy them, and this,</hi> he
saies, <hi>is not attained without much Experience;</hi> he
makes so lively a representation of that universal
understanding, which he would be thought to be
possessed with, that he could not be without hope
that <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>omwell</hi> would think him worthy to be a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor,
who had given him such an earnest that he
would serve him with success, and without hesitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60912:63"/>
Yet I see no reason (if to ask Counsel of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
is to permit him to give such Counsel as he
shall think best; and if it be the Office of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor,
when an Action comes into deliberation, to
make manifest the consequence of it in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as he that is counselled may be truly and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
inform'd) why he is so very angry with those
two words, <hi>exhort</hi> and <hi>dehort,</hi> as to brand those who
use either, with the style of corruption, and being
brib'd by their own interest; since it is very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the faith and integrity of a Counsellor, to
perswade him that asks his advice to do that which he
thinks best to be don, and to disswade him from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that which he thinks to be mischievous, which
is to exhort and dehort; and the examples of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and the autority of Books, may be pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
applied to either: since few accidents fall out in
States and Empires, which have not in former times
happened in such conjunctures: and then if the same
hath bin faithfully represented to posterity, with all
the circumstance and successes, which is the natural
end of all good Histories to transmit; nothing can
more properly be reflected on, or bring clearer light
to the present difficulties in debate, then the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of what was upon those occasions don fortunatly,
or unhappily left undon, which surely cannot but
introduce useful and pertinent Reflexions into the
consultation. And it is not easie to comprehend
what that great ability is, which his Counsellor is
to attain to by long study, and cannot be attain'd
without, if that study be not to be conversant with
Books, and if neither the examples in, or autority
of Books be in any degree to be consider'd. Nor are
such expressions which may move the affections or
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60912:63"/>
passions of him who asks Counsel, or of those who
are to give it, repugnant to the office of a Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
since the end of Counsel is to lead men to chuse
that which is good, and avoid that which is worse;
and he to whom the Counsel is given, will best judg
whether it tends to others ends rather then his own,
and will value it accordingly. And he is much a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Counsellor, who by his experience and observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the nature and humor of the People who
are to be govern'd, and by his knowledg of the Laws
and Rules by which they ought to be govern'd, gives
advice what ought to be don, then he who from his
speculative knowledg of man-kind, and of the Rights
of Government, and of the nature of Equity and
Honor, attain'd with much study, would erect an
Engine of Government by the rules of Geometry,
more infallible then Experience can ever find
out.</p>
               <p>I am not willing now, or at any time, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
him in his sallies which he makes into the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
and which he alwaies handles, as if his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
power had not yet declared it to be the word
of God; and to illustrate now his Distinctions, and
the difference between Command and Counsel, he
thinks fit to fetch instances from thence, <hi>Have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

hanging over us for our sins;</hi> as if the latter were
not drawn from the will of God as much as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
or as if the former tended more to the benefit
of God then the latter. An ordinary Grammarian,
without any insight in Geometry, would have
thought them equally to be commands: But Mr.

their understanding, and another subjection to his
dictates.</p>

From which definition his first deduction is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the
Soveraign is the sole Legislator, and that himself is
not subject to Laws, because he can make, and repeal
them: which in truth is no necessary deduction from
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60912:65"/>
his own definition; for it doth not follow from
thence, tho he makes them Rules only for Subjects,
that the Soveraign hath the sole power to repeal
them; but the true definition of a Law is, that it is
to every Subject the rule which the Common-wealth
hath commanded him by word, writing, or other suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
sign of the Will made, and publish'd in
that form and manner, as is accustomed in that
Common-wealth to make use of for the distinction
of right, that is to say; of what is contrary, and
what is not to the Rule? and from this definition,
no such deduction can be made, since the form of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and repealing Laws is stated, and agreed upon
in all Common-wealths.</p>
               <p>The opinions and judgments which are found in
the Books of eminent Lawyers, cannot be answer'd,
and controuled by Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> his wonder, since the
men who know least are apt to wonder most; and
men will with more justice wonder, whence he
comes by the Prerogative to controul the Laws and
Government establish'd in this, and that Kingdom,
without so much as considering what is Law here
or there, but by the general notions he hath of Law;
and what it is by his long study, and much cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And it is a strange definition of Law, to make
it like his propriety, to be of concernment only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Subject and Subject, without any rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of security as to the Soveraign, whom he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emts
from any observation of them, and invests with
autority by repealing those which trouble him,
when he thinks fit, to free himself from the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof, and by making new: and consequently
he saies, he was free before, for he is free that can be
free when he will. The instance he gives for his
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60912:65"/>
wonder, and displeasure against the Books of the
Eminent Lawyers, is, that they say, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law hath no controuler but the Parliament,
that is, that the Common Law cannot be chang'd
or alter'd but by Act of Parliament, which is
the Municipal Law of the Kingdom. Now me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
if that be the judgment of Eminent Lawyers,
Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> should be so modest as to believe it to
be true, till he hears others as Eminent Lawyers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the contrary: for by his instance, he hath
brought it now only to relate to the Law of <hi>England,</hi>
and then methinks he should be easily perswaded,
that the Eminent Lawyers of <hi>England</hi> do know
best whether the Law be so, or no. I do not wish
that Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> should be convinc'd by a judgment
of that Law upon himself, which would be very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,
if he should be accused for declaring, that the
King alone hath power to alter the descents
and inheritances of the Kingdom; and whereas the
Common Law saies the Eldest shall inherit, the
King by his own Edict may declare, and order, that
the younger Son shall inherit: or for averring, and
publishing, that the King by his own autority can
repeal and dissolve all Laws, and justly take away
all they have from his Subjects; I say, if the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Law was pronounc'd upon him for this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
discourse, he would hardly perswade the
World, that he understood what the Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
is, better then the Judges who condemn'd him,
or that he was wary enough to set up a <hi>jus vagum</hi>
and <hi>incognitum</hi> of his own, to controul the establish'd
Government of his own Country. He saies the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
is the only Legislator: and I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
him in that. It is the Soveraign stamp, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60912:66"/>
Royal consent, and that alone, that gives life, and
being, and title of Laws, to that which was before
but counsel and advice: and no such constitution
of his can be repeal'd and made void, but in the
same manner, and with his consent. But we say, that
he may prescribe or consent to such a method in
the form, and making these Laws, that being once
made by him, he cannot but in the same form re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,
or alter them; and he is oblig'd by the
Law of Justice to observe and perform this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
and he cannot break it, or absolve himself
from the observation of it, without violation of
justice: and any farther obligation upon him then
of justice, I discourse not of. For the better
cleering of this to that kind of reason by which Mr.
<hi>Hobbes</hi> is swai'd, let us suppose this Soveraignty
to reside, and be fix'd in an assembly of men; in
which kind of Government it is possible to find
more marks and foot-steps of such a deputing,
and assigning of interests, as Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> is full of,
then we can possibly imagine in the original insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of Monarchy. If the Soveraign power be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
into the hands of fifteen, and any vacant place
to be suppli'd by the same Autority that made choice
of the first fifteen, may there not at that time of the
election certain Rules be prescrib'd (I do not say
conditions) for the better exercise of that Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
power? and by the accepting the power thus
explain'd, doth not the Soveraign, tho there should
be no Oath administred for the observation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
which is a circumstance admitted by most Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs,
tacitly covenant that he will observe those
Rules? and if he do's wilfully decline those Rules,
doth he not break the trust reposed in him? I do not
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60912:66"/>
say forfeit the trust, as if the Soveraignty were at an
end, but break that trust, violate that justice he
should observe? If the Soveraign power of fifteen,
should raise an imposition for the defence of the
Common-wealth, if they should appoint this whole
imposition to be paid only by those whose names
are <hi>Thomas</hi> (when <hi>Thomas</hi> was before in no more
prejudice with the Common-wealth, then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
appellation in Baptism) may not this inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
be call'd a violation of Justice, and a breach of
trust, since it cannot be suppos'd that such an irregular
autority was ever committed to any man, or men by
any deputation? Of the Prerogative of necessity to
swerve from Rules prescrib'd, or to violate Laws tho
sworn to, shall be spoken to in its due time.</p>
               <p>It needs not be suppos'd, but must be confess'd, that
the Laws of every Country, contain more in them
concerning the rights of the Soveraign, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
administration of Justice to the people, then
can be known to, and understood by the person of
the Soveraign, and he can as well fight all his Battels
with his own hand and sword, as determine all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of right by his own tongue and understanding.
The consequence of any confusion which Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>
can suppose, would not be more pernicious, then
that which would follow the blowing away all these
maxims of the Law, if the Kings breath were
strong enough to do it. It is a maxim in the Law
(as is said before) that the eldest Son shall inherit,
and that if three or four Females are heirs, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
shall be equally divided between them.
Doth Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> believe that the word of the King
hath power to change this course, and to appoint
that all the Sons shall divide the Estate, and the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60912:67"/>
Eldest Daughter inherit alone? and must not all the
confusion imaginable attend such a mutation? All
Governments subsist and are establish'd by firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and constancy, by every mans knowing what
is his right to enjoy, and what is his duty to do: and
it is a wonderful method to make this Government
more perfect, and more durable, by introducing
such an incertainty, that no man shall know what he
is to do, nor what he is to suffer, but that he who is
Soveraign to morrow, may cancel, and dissolve all
that was don or consented to by the Soveraign who
was yesterday, or by himself as often as he changes
his mind. It is the Kings Office to cause his Laws
to be executed, and to compel his Subjects to yield
obedience to them, and in order thereunto, to make
choice of Learned Judges to interpret those Laws,
and to declare the intention of them, who (pag.
140) <hi>by an artificial perfection of reason gotten by
long study, and experience in the Law,</hi> must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
to be more competent for that determination,
then Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> can be for the alteration of Law
and Government, by the artificial reason he hath
attain'd to by long study of Arithmetic and Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry.</p>
               <p>No Eminent Lawyer hath ever said that the two
Arms of a Common-wealth are Force and Justice,
the first whereof is in the King, the other deposited
in the hands of the Parliament; but all Lawyers
know, that they are equally deposited in the hands of
the King, and that all justice is administred by him,
and in his name; and all men acknowledg that all the
Laws are his Laws; his consent and autority on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
giving the power and name of a Law, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence,
or formality soever hath contributed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60912:67"/>
it: the question only is, whether he can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,
or vacate such a Law, without the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
and formality. And methinks the instance
he makes of a Princes (<hi>pag.</hi> 139.) <hi>subduing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
people, and consenting that they shall live, and
be govern'd according to those Laws under which they
were born, and by which they were formerly govern'd,</hi>
should manifest to him the contrary. For tho it be
confess'd, that those old Laws become new by this
consent of his, the Laws of the Legislator, that is
of that Soveraign who indulges the use of them; yet
he cannot say that he can by his word vacate and
repeal those Laws, and his own concession, without
dissolving all the ligaments of Government, and
without the violation of faith, which himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
to be against the Law of Nature.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding that <hi>the Law is reason,</hi> and
(pag. 139.) <hi>not the letter, but that which is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the intention of the Legislator (that is of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign)
is the Law,</hi> yet when there is any difficulty
in the understanding the Law, the interpretation
thereof may reasonably belong to Learn'd Judges,
who by their education, and the testimony of their
known abilities before they are made Judges, and by
their Oaths to judg according to Right, are the
most competent to explain those difficulties, which
no Soveraign as Soveraign can be presum'd to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
or comprehend. And the judgments and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisions
those Judges make, are the judgments of the
Soveraigns, who have qualified them to be Judges,
and who are to pronounce their sentence according
to the reason of the Law, not the reason of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign.
And therefore Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> would make a
very ignorant Judg, when he would not have him
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60912:68"/>
versed in the study of the Laws, but only a man of
good natural reason, and of a right understanding
of the Law of Nature; and yet he saies, (pag. 154.)
<hi>that no man will pretend to the knowledg of right and
wrong without much study.</hi> And if that power of
interpretation of Law be vested in the Person of the
Soveraign, he may in a moment overthrow all the
Law; which is evident enough by his own instances,
if, to use his own expressions, <hi>his understanding were
not dazled by the flame of his passions.</hi> For to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
is all the distinction and division of Laws
into human and divine, into natural and moral, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
distributive and penal, when they may be all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
and made null by the word, or perverted by
the interpretation of the Soveraign? to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
is a penalty of five shillings put upon such an
action, if the Soveraign may make him who doth
that action, by his interpretation, or omnipotence,
to pay five hundred pounds? Nor by his rule, is his
ador'd Law of Nature of any force, which he saies,
(pag. 144) <hi>is the Law of God immutable and eternal,
nay Heaven and Earth shall pass away, but not one
title of the Law of Nature shall pass, for it is the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Law of God;</hi> He, I say, hath as much subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
that to the arbitrary power and discretion
of his Soveraign, as he hath don the Liberty and
property of the Subject; for he saies, (pag. 138.)
<hi>the Law of Nature is a part of the Civil Law in all
Common-wealths in the World,</hi> and that tho <hi>it be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
reasonable, yet it is by the Soveraign pow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r that
it is Law,</hi> and he saies likewise, <hi>that all Laws writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and unwritten, and the Law of Nature it se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>f,
have need of interpretation:</hi> and then he makes his
supreme Soveraign the only legitimate interpreter.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60912:68"/>
So that he hath the Law of Nature as much in his
power, and under his jurisdiction, as any other part
of the Civil Law: and yet he confesses his subject is
not bound to pay obedience to any thing that his
Soveraign enjoins against the Law of nature. In
such Labyrinths men entangle themselves, who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately
engage in opinions relating to a science
they do not understand; nor was it possible for him
to extend the Prerogative of his Soveraign to such
an illimited greatness, without making some invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon the Prerogative of God himself. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
every man who reads Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> observes
that when he entangles himself in the Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and affects to be more learned in them then
the Chief Justice <hi>Cook,</hi> the natural sharpness and
vigor of his reason is more flat and insipid then
upon other Arguments, and he makes deductions
which have no coherence, involves himself in the
terms without comprehending the matter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
the Law saies that which it do's not say, and
that the Law hath made no provision in cases which
are amply provided for, and in a word loses him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in a mist of words that render him less intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
then at other times. Nor hath he better luck,
when out of <hi>Iustinians</hi> Institutions, he would make
a parallel between the Imperial Laws and the Laws
of <hi>England,</hi> and resolves that the Decrees of the
Common People, which were put to the question
by the Tribune, and had the force of Laws, were
like the Orders of the House of Commons in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
whereas no Orders made by a House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
in <hi>England,</hi> are of any validity or force, or
receive any submission longer then that House of
Commons continues: and if any order made by
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60912:69"/>
them be against any Law or Statute, it is void when
it is made, and receives no obedience. Indeed when
Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> publish'd his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> he might have
said that it had the autority and power of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
or of the whole People of <hi>Rome,</hi> and which
would have lasted till this time, if he had bin believ'd,
and his doctrine could have bin supported by him, or
them for whom it was provided.</p>
               <p>Probably Mr. <hi>Mobbes</hi> did take delight in being
thought to confute a great Lawyer in the Common
Law of <hi>England</hi> 'tis certain he hath bin transported to
slight usage of him, by that delight or some like passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
more then by the defect of reason in that which
he would contradict. He saies 'tis against the Law of
Nature to punish the innocent; that he is innocent
that acquits himself judicially, &amp; is acknowledg'd for
innocent by the Judg: and yet he saies, when a man is
accus'd of a Capital crime, and seeing the power of
the Enemy, and the frequent corruption of Judges,
runs away for fear of the effect, yet being taken
and brought to Tryal, maketh it appear that he was
not guilty of the crime, and is acquitted thereof,
however is condemn'd to lose his goods, this
he saies, is a manifest condemnation of the innocent.
He confesses afterwards, that the Law may forbid an
innocent man to fly, and that he may be punished
for flying; but he thinks it very unreasonable, that
flying for fear of injury, should be taken for presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of guilt, whereas it is taken only for the guilt of
flying, when he is declar'd innocent for the other.
And methinks he confesseth, that a man, who must
know his own innocence better then any body else,
and knows that he must lose his Goods, if he flies
his trial, hath no reason to complain, if after he be
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60912:69"/>
cleer'd from the crime, he be condemned to lose his
goods, which he knew he must lose when he fled;
and therefore tho he be judicially acquitted for the
crime, he is not innocent, but as judicially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to lose his goods for his guilt in flying,
the Law and penalty of flying being known to him,
whether written, or not written, as well as the
Law against the crime was. To his other dictates of
the Office of a Judg, that he needs not be learn'd in
the Laws, because he shall be told by the Soveraign
what judgment he shall give; and of the Laws of
<hi>England,</hi> that the Jury is Judg of the Law, as well
as of the fact, there needs no more be said, then that
he is not inform'd, nor understands what he delivers;
and whether his notions of the divine positive Law

That the pleasure a man may have in imagining the death

so adherent to the nature of man, and every other
living creature, as to make it a sin, were to make a sin
of being a man,</hi> is a Body of Mr. <hi>Hobbes's</hi> Divinity, so
contrary to that of our Saviour and his Apostles, that
I shall without any enlargement leave it to all men to
consider, which of them they think most fit to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and follow. Yet methinks he gives some en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to those who might expect Justice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, by his own judgment (pag. 152.) upon
the man that <hi>comes from the</hi> Indies <hi>hither, and perswades
men here to receive a new Religion, or teach them any
thing that tends to disobedience to the Laws of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
tho he be never so well perswaded of the truth of
what he teacheth, he commits a crime, and may be justly
punished, not only because his Doctrine is false, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he do's that which he would not approve in another,
that coming from hence should endeavor to alter Religion
there.</hi> And how far this Declaration of his own
judgment, may operate to his own condemnation,
and to the condemnation of most of his Doctrines
in his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> which are so contrary to all the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60912:70"/>
Laws established in his Country, he should have don
well to have consider'd before he committed the
transgression; for he doth acknowledg, that in a
Common-wealth, where by the negligence or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfulness
of Governors and Teachers, false Doctrines
are by time generally receiv'd, the contrary truths
may be generally offensive; and prudent men are
seldom guilty of doing any thing, at least when it
is in their own election to do it or not to do it, which
they foresee will be offensive to the Government, or
Governors whom they are subject to and must live
under; especially when he confesses, (pag. 91.) <hi>that
tho the most suddain and rough bustling in of a new truth
that can be, do's never break the peace, yet it doth som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
wake the war:</hi> and if the secure and sound sleep
of Peace be once broken, and that fierce and brutish
Tyger War is awakened, when, or how he will be
lulled into a new sleep, the wisest Magistrate cannot
fore-tell, and therefore will with the more vigilance
discountenance and suppress such bustlers, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently
make their way with their elbows into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
company, to dispose them to suspect, and then
to censure the wisdom of their Fore-fathers, for
having bin swaied by their own illiterate experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
so as to prefer it before the cleer reason of
thinking and Learned Men, who by cogitation
have found a surer way for their security: and there
cannot be a more certain Expedient found out for
the dissolving the Peace of any Nation, how firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
soever establish'd, then by giving leave, or permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
men of parts and unrestrain'd fancy, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine

their wit and inventions may suggest to them, upon
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60912:71"/>
or against the same, which would expose the gravity
and wisdom of all Government, the infallibility of
Scripture, and the Omnipotence of God himself, by
their light and scurrilous questions and instances, to
the mirth and contemt of all men, who are without
an awful veneration for either; of which there needs
not be a more convincing evidence, then the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumtion
of Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> throughout his <hi>Leviathan;</hi> of
which it will not be possible not to give some in the
progress we shall make.</p>
               <p>He is over subtle in his Distinction, that every crime
is a sin, but not every sin a crime; that from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of sin to the Law, and of crime to the Civil
Law, may be inferr'd, that where the Law ceaseth,
sin ceaseth, that the Civil Law ceasing, crimes
cease; and yet that violation of Covenants, Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
Arrogance, can never cease to be sin, yet
are no crimes, because there is no place for accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
every man being his own Judg, and accused
only by his own conscience, and cleer'd by the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightness
of his own intention; and when his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is right, his fact is no sin; if otherwise, his
fact is sin but no crime: that when the Soveraign
power ceaseth, that is, when the King is so oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that he cannot exercise his power, crime also
ceaseth, there being no protection where there is
no power, which he is careful to repete, whether it
be to the purpose, or, as sure it is not, very pertinent
in the difference between sin and crime. And to all
that huddle of words in that whole Paragraph, I
shall say no more, but that it looks like the Discourse
of some men, which himself saies (pag. 39.) <hi>may
be numbred amongst the sorts of madness, namely, when
men speak such words, as put together, have in them no
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60912:71"/>
signification at all,</hi> by their non-coherence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</p>
               <p>False Principles of right and wrong cannot but
produce many crimes, and the greater the presumti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of those is who publish them, the confusion that
results thereby must be the greater: and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
this bundle of false Principles which
are contain'd in this Book, the strength of the Laws,
and the good constitution of the Government, hath
hitherto, for ought appears, resisted the operation and
malignity of the Institution of his Soveraignty,
with how much confidence soever offered by him,
and a true and lawful Soveraign could never be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to affect that power which Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> so frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
assign'd to the Soveraign whom he intended to
institute. And without doubt that unreasonable
Proposition, That Justice is but a vain word, can
never be established for Reason, so unanswerably as
by the establishment of his Principles, which would
make all Laws Cobwebs, to be blown away by the
least breath of the Governor; nor by his ratiocina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
did <hi>Marius,</hi> or <hi>Sylla,</hi> or <hi>Cesar,</hi> ever commit any
crime, since they were all Soveraigns by acquisition,
and so in his own judgment possessed of all those
powers which arise from his Institution, whereby
they might do all those acts which they did, and no
man could complain of injury or injustice, every
man being the Author of whatever dammage he su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain'd
or complain'd of; nor will he be able to lay
any crime to any of their charges (tho he seems to
condemn them) and at that same time to support
his Institution of a Common-wealth. But it is the
less wonder, since from his own constitution, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his first model, and knowing from whence
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60912:72"/>
his own obedience proceeds, he concludes, that of
all passions, that which least inclines men to break
the Laws, is fear. He provides such terrible Laws
as no body can love, and must fear too much to be
willing to be subject to them; which want of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness
must make them glad of any alteration,
which can bring no security to the Soveraign. And
I cannot enough recommend to Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> that he
will revolve his own judgment and determination in
this Chapter, (pag. 158.) <hi>That he, whose error pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
from a peremtory pursuit of his own Principles
and reasonings, is much more faulty then he whose error
proceeds from the autority of a Teacher, or an Interpreter
of the Law publicly autoriz'd; and that he that ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his actions on his private judgment, ought, according
to the rectitude or error thereof, to stand or fall.</hi> And if
his fear be so predominant in him, as he conceives it
to be in most men, it will dispose him first to enquire
what the opinion of the Judges is, who are the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriz'd
Interpreters of Law, before he publishes his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
Principles against Law, least he be obliged to
stand or fall according to the rectitude or error there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Tho every Instance he gives of his Soveraigns ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
power, makes it the more unreasonable, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable,
and odious, yet he gives all the support to
it he can devise. And indeed, when he hath made
his Soveraigns word, a full and enacted Law, he hath
reason to oblige his Subject to do whatsoever he
commands, be it right or wrong, and to provide for
his security when he hath don; and therefore he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
(pag. 157.) <hi>That whosoever doth any thing that
is contrary to a former Law by the command of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,
he is not guilty of any crime, and so cannot be
punished, because when the Soveraign commands any
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60912:72"/>
thing to be don against a former Law, the command as
to that particular Fact is an abrogation of the Law;</hi>
which would introduce a licence to commit Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
or any other crime most odious, and against
which Laws are chiefly provided. But he hath in
another place given his Subject leave to refuse the
Soveraigns command, when he requires him to do
an act or office contrary to his honor: so that tho
he will not suffer the Law to restrain him from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what the Soveraign unlawfully commands, yea
his honor, of which he shall be Judg himself, may
make him refuse that command tho lawf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l: as if
the Soveraign commands him to Prison, as no doubt
he lawfully may for a crime that deserves death, he
may in Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s opinion refuse to obey that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
Whereas Government and Justice have not a
greater security, then that he that executes a verbal
command of the King against a known Law, shall
be punished. And the Case which he puts in the
following Paragraph, that the Kings Will being a
Law, if he should not obey that, there would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
two contradictory Laws, which would totally
excuse, is so contrary to the common Rule of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
that a man is obliged to believe, when the
King requires any thing to be don contrary to any
Law, that he did not know of that Law, and so to
forbear executing his Command. And if this were
otherwise, Kings of all men would be most miserable,
and would reverse their most serious Counsels and
Deliberations, by incogitancy, upon the suggestion
and importunity of every presumtuous Intruder.
Kings themselves can never be punished or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
publicly (that being a reproch not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
with the reverence due to Majesty) for their
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60912:73"/>
casual or wilful errors and mistakes, let the ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of them be what they will; but if they
who maliciously lead, or advise, or obey them in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
resolutions and commands, were to have the
same indemnity, there must be a dissolution of all
Kingdoms and Governments. But as Kings must be
left to God, whose Vice-gerents they are, to judg
of their breach of Trust; so they who offend against
the Law, must be left to the punishment the Law
hath provided for them, it being in the Kings power
to pardon the execution of the Sentence the Law
inflicts, except in those cases where the Offence is
greater to others then to the King; as in the murder
of a Husband or a Father, the offence is greater to
the Wife and to the Son for their relation, then to
the King for a Subject; and therefore, upon an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
by them, the Transgressor may suffer after the
King hath pardon'd him.</p>
               <p>It is a great prerogative which Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> doth
in this Chapter indulge to his fear, his precious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
fear of corporal hurt, that it shall not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate
an ill action, but totally excuse and annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the worst he can commit, that, if a man by the
terror of present death be compelled to do a Fact
against the Law, he is wholly excused, because no
Law can oblige a man to abandon his own preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and supposing such a Law were obligatory, yet
a man would reason, (pag. 157.) <hi>If I do it not I die
presently, if I do it I die afterwards, therefore by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it there is time of life gain'd, Nature therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels
him to the Fact:</hi> by which a man seems by the
Law of Nature to be compell'd, even for a short re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve,
and to live two or three daies longer, to do
the most infamous and wicked thing that is imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60912:73"/>
upon which fertile soil he doth hereafter so
much enlarge, according to his natural method, in
which he usually plants a stock, supposes a principle,
the malignity whereof is not presently discernable,
in a precedent Chapter, upon which in a subsequent
one he grafts new and worse Doctrine, which he
looks should grow and prosper by such cultivation as
he applies to it in Discourse; and therefore I shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
my Considerations to the contrary, till I wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>THe eight and twentieth Chapter being a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of Punishments and Rewards, it was
not possible for him to forget in how weak a
condition he had left his Soveraign, for want of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to punish; since want of power to punish, and
want of autority to cause his punishment to be infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
is the same thing; especially when the guilty
person is not only not oblig'd to submit to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
how just soever, but hath a right to resist it,
and to defend himself by force against the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
and the Law: and therefore he thinks it of
much importance, to enquire, by what door the right
and autority of punishing in any case came in. He
is a very ill Architect, that in building a House,
makes not doors to enter into every office of it; and
it is very strange, that he should make his doors large
and big enough in his institution, to let out all the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and propriety of the Subject, and the very end
of his Institution being to make a Magistrate to
compel men to their duty (for he confesses, they
were before obliged by the Law of Nature to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it one towards another, but that there must be
a Soveraign Sword to compel men to do that which
they ought to do) yet that he should forget to leave a
door wide enough for this compulsion to enter in at
by punishment, and bringing the Offender to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice;
since the end of making the Soveraign is
disappointed, and he cannot preserve the peace, if
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60912:74"/>
guilty persons have a right to preserve themselves
from the punishment he inflicts for their guilt. It
was very improvidently don, when he had the
draught of the whole Contracts and Covenants, that
he would not insert one, by which every man should
transfer from himself the right he had to defend
himself against public Justice, tho not against pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
violence. And surely reason and Self-preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that makes a man transfer all his Estate and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
into the hands of the Soveraign, and to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed
by him, that he may be secure against the rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery
and rapine of his neighbors &amp; companions, will
as well dispose him to leave his life to his discretion,
that it may be secure from the assault of every other
man, who hath a right to take it from him. But he
thinks life too pretious to part with willingly, and
therefore cares for no more then to invest his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
with a just title to punish, how unable soever
he leaves him to execute it. And truly his fancy is
very extraordinary in bringing it to pass. He will
not suffer his power to punish to be grounded upon
the concession or gift of the Subjects, from which
fountain all his other extravagant powers flow,
which are as unnatural for them to give, but saies it
was originally inherent in him by the right of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
by which every man might subdue or kill an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
man, as he thought best for his own preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
which right still remain'd in him, when all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men transferred all their rights to him, because
he never contracted with them to part with any
thing, and so he comes (pag. 162.) <hi>to a right to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,

only, as entire as in the condition of mere nature.</hi> Is
not this mere fancy without any reason? which he
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60912:75"/>
needed not have exercis'd to so little purpose, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
a lawful Power, which any man may lawfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
and oppose. Nor is the right much greater that
is left him, then what, it seems, is tacitly reserv'd to
every man, who notwithstanding all transferring,
hath still right to resist the Sword of Justice in his
own defence, and for ought appears, to kill him that
carries it. So that in truth, his Soveraign is vested
in no other autority, then lawfully to fight so many
Duels as the Law hath condemned men to suffer
death, since he can command none of his Subjects to
execute them, and they have all lawful power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
their own lives. How this right and autority of
punishing came into the hands of the Soveraign, we
shall not follow his example in repeting, having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
confessed, that it neither is nor can be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on any concession or gift of the Subject, but is
indubitably inherent in the office of being Soveraign,
and inseparably annexed to it by God himself.</p>
               <p>Corporal, or Capital punishment, Ignominy, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment,
or Exile, are not better understood then
they were before his Definitions and Descriptions
which he makes of them, and in which he doth not
so much consider the nature of a Definition, as that
he may insert somwhat into it, to which he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
to prove somwhat, which men do not think of
when they read those Definitions: and assuming to
himself to declare what will serve his turn to be the
Law of Nature, or the Law of Nations, he makes
such Inferences and Consequences, as he thinks ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to prove his desperate Conclusions. There
cannot be a more pernicious Doctrine, and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to Peace and Justice, then that all men who
are not Subjects are enemies; &amp; that against enemies,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60912:75"/>
whom the Common-wealth judges capable to do
them hurt, it is lawful by the original right of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to make War; which would keep up a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
War between all Princes, since they are few
who are not capable to do hurt to their Neighbors.
Nor can this mischief be prevented by any Treaty or
League; for whil'st they are capable of doing hurt,
the lawfulness still remains, and being the original
right of Nature, cannot be extinguished. But the
wisest and most Learned who have wrote of the Law
of Nature and of Nations, abominate this Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;

punishment, or rather an escape, or a public com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

probably then be of opinion, that the mere change
of air is a very great punishment. And if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members
his own Definition, (pag. 108.) <hi>That a
free man is he, that in those things which by his strength
and wit he is able to do, is not hindred to do what he hath

from him, and the restraining that liberty, is a
very severe punishment, whether justly or unjustly
inflicted, and is in no degree mitigated by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring,
(pag. 165.) that <hi>a banish'd man is a lawful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
of the Common wealth that banished him, as being

the mercy of the Victor, who may take his life, and
inflict any other punishment upon him arbitrarily,
and according to his own discretion. In the last
place, he hath very much obliged his Soveraign, in
telling him so plainly why he hath compared him to
<hi>Leviathan,</hi> because he hath raised him to the same
greatness, and given him the same power which <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan</hi>
is described to have in the 41 Chapter of
<hi>Iob, There is nothing on Earth to be compared with him,
he is made so as not to be afraid, be seeth every high thing
to be below him, and is King of all the children of pride,</hi>
Job. 41. 33, 34. And if he had provided as well to
secure his high station, as he hath for the abatement
of the pride of the Subject, whom he hath suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
humbled, he might more glory in his work:
but the truth is, he hath left him in so weak a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
to defend himself, that he hath reason to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of every man; and the remedies he prescribes
afterwards to keep his prodigious power from disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
are as false and irrational as any other advice
in his Institution, as will appear hereafter.</p>

               <head>The Survey of Chapter
29.</head>
               <p>MR. <hi>Hobbes</hi> takes so much delight in reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
the many ill things he hath said, for
fear they do not make impression deep e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in the minds of men, that I may be pardon'd
if I repete again somtimes what hath bin formerly
said; as this Chapter consisting most of the same
pernicious doctrines which he declar'd before, tho
in an other dress, obliges me to make new, or other
reflexions upon what was I think sufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
before, and it may be repete what I have said
before. He is so jealous that the strength of a better
composition of Soveraignty may be superior,
and be preferr'd before that of his institution, that
be devises all the way he can to render it more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to dissolution, and like a Mountebank Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
accuses it of diseases which it hath not, that he
may apply Remedies which would be sure to bring
those or worse diseases, and would weaken the
strongest parts, and support of it, under pretence of
curing its defects. So in the first place he finds fault
(pag. 167.) <hi>that a man to obtain a Kingdom is
sometimes content w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and defence of the Common-wealth is necessarily requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
that is, that he will observe the Laws and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
of the Kingdom, which by long experience
have bin found necessary for the Peace and defence
of it. And to this he imputes the insolence of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Beckett</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (pag. 168.)
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60912:77"/>
                  <hi>who was supported against</hi> Harry <hi>the Second by the
Pope, the Subjection of Ecclesiastics to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
having,</hi> he saies, <hi>bin dispensed with by</hi> Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
<hi>the Conquerour at his reception, when he took an
Oath, not to infringe the liberty of the Church.</hi> And
this extravagant power of the Pope he imputes to
the Universities and the doctrine taught by them;
which reproch to the Universities being in a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph
of his next Chapter, I chuse to join in the
answer with the case of <hi>Thomas Beckett</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi>
the Second.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> hath so great a prejudice to the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Histories (as if they were all enemies to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment)
that he will not take the pains carefully
to peruse those, from which he expects to draw some
advantage to himself; presuming that men will not
believe, that a man, who so warily weighs all he saies
in the balance of reason, will ever venture to alledg
any matter of fact that he is not very sure of. But
if he had vouchsafed to look over the Records of his
own Country before the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the
Eight, he would have found the Universities alwaies
opposed the power of the Pope, and would have no
dependance upon him, and that the Kings alone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd
his autority, and made it to be submitted
to by their Laws. Nor did the Church of <hi>England</hi>
owe their large priviledges to any donation of the
Popes, whose jurisdiction they would never admit,
but to the extreme devotion and superstition of the
People, and the piety and bounty of the Kings,
which gave greater donatives and exemtions to the
Church and Clergy, then any other Kingdom en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joied,
or then the Pope gave any where. Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in the infancy of it wrought such prodigious
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60912:78"/>
effects in this Island upon the barbarous affections
of the Princes and People who then were the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of it, that assoon as they gave any belief to
the History of our Saviour, they thought they could
not do too much to the Persons of those who preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, and knew best what would be most accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to him. From hence they built Churches, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd
them liberally, submitted so entirely to the
Clergy, whom they look'd upon as Sacred persons,
that they judged all differences, and he was not
look'd upon as a good Christian who did not entirely
resign himself to their disposal: they gave great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emtion
to the Church and Church men, and annex'd
such Priviledges to both, as testified the veneration
they had for the Persons, as well as for the Faith.
And when they suspected that the Licentiousness
of succeeding ages might not pay the same devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to both, they did the best they could to establish
it, by making Laws to that purpose, and obliging
the several Princes to maintain and defend the
rights and priviledges of the Church; rights and
priviledges which themselves had granted, and of
which the Pope knew nothing, nor indeed at that
time did enjoy the like himself. It is true, that by
this means the Clergy was grown to a wonderful
power over the People, who look'd upon them as
more then mortal men, and had surely a greater au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority
then any Clergy in Christendom assum'd in
those ages, and yet it was generally greater then
in other Kingdoms, then it hath ever bin since.
Nor could it be otherwise during the Heptarchy,
when those little Soveraigns maintain'd their power
by the autority their Clergy had with their people,
when they had little dependence upon the Prince.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60912:78"/>
But when by the courage and success of two or three
couragious Princes, and the distraction that had bin
brought upon them by strangers, the Government
of the whole Island was reduced under one Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
the Clergy, which had bin alwaies much better
united then the Civil state had bin, were not willing
to part with any autority they had enjoied, nor to
be thought of less value then they had bin formerly
esteemed, and so grew troublesom to the Soveraign
power, somtimes by interrupting the progress of
their Councils by delaies, and somtimes by direct
and positive contradictions. The Princes had not
the confidence then to resort to Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
institution of their right; the manners of the
Nation still remained fierce and barbarous, and
whatsoever was pliant in them, was from the result
of Religion, which was govern'd by the Clergy.
They knew nothing yet of that primitive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
that introduced Soveraignty, nor of that Faith
that introduced subjection: they thought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it would
not be safe for them to oppose the power of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Clergy, with a mere secular, profane force,
and therefore thought how they might lessen and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
their own troublesome Clergy, by a conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with some religious and Ecclesiastical combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> of that age had a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great name and autority in <hi>France,</hi> where there
being many Soveraign Princes then reigning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he exercis'd a notable Jurisdiction under
the Style of Vicar of Christ. The Kings in <hi>England</hi>
by degrees unwarily applied themselves to this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Magistrate; and that he might assist them to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
a power that was inconvenient to them at
home, they suffer'd him to exercise an autority that
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60912:79"/>
proved afterwards very mischievous to themselves,
and for which they had never made pretence before,
and which was then heartily opposed by the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,
and by the whole Clergy, till it was impos'd
upon them by the King. So that it was not the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversities,
and Clergy, that introduc'd the Popes
autority to sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ke and weaken that of the King,
but it was the King who introduc'd that power to
strengthen, as he thought, his own, howsoever it
fell out. And if the precedent Kings had not call'd
upon the Pope, and given him autority to assist them
against some of their own Bishops, <hi>Alexander</hi> the
Third could never have pretended to exercise so wild
a jurisdiction over <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, nor he ever
have submitted to so infamous a subordination; nor
could the Pope have undertaken to assist <hi>Beckett</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the King, if the King had not first appeal'd to
him for help against <hi>Beckett.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the better manifestation of that point, which
Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> his speculation and Geometry hath not
yet made an enquiry into, it will not be amiss to
take a short Survey of the Precedent times, by
which it will be evident how little influence the
Popes autority had upon the Crown, or Clergy,
or Universities of <hi>England;</hi> and how little ground
he hath for that fancy, from whence soever he took
it, (pag. 168.) <hi>that</hi> William <hi>the Conquerour at his
reception had dispens'd with the subjection of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastics,
by the Oa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h he took not to infringe the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of the Church:</hi> whereas they who know any
thing of that time, know that the Oath he took
was the same, and without any alteration, that all
the former Kings, since the Crown rested upon a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
head, had taken, which was at his Coronation,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60912:79"/>
after the Bishops and the Barons had taken their
Oath to be his true and faithful Subjects. The
Arch-Bishop, who crown'd him, presented that
Oath to him, which he was to take himself, which he
willingly did, to defend the Holy Church of God,
and the Rectors of the same, To govern the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
people subject to him, justly, To establish
equal Laws, and to see them justly executed. Nor was
he more wary in any thing, then (as hath bin said
before) that the people might imagine, that he
pretended any other title to the Government, then by
the Confessor: tho it is true, that he did by degrees
introduce many of the <hi>Norman</hi> Customes which were
found very useful, or convenient, and agreeable
enough, if not the same, with what had bin for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
practis'd. And the common reproch, of the
Laws being from time to time put into <hi>French,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
no weight with it: for there was before that
time so rude a collection of the Laws, and in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
as foreign to that of the Nation, British,
Saxon, Danish, and Latine, almost as unintelligible
as either of the other, that if they had bin all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
into the <hi>English</hi> that was then spoken, we
should very little better have understood it, then we
do the <hi>French,</hi> in which the Laws were afterwards
render'd; and it is no wonder, since a reduction into
Order was necessary, that the King who was to look
to the execution, took care to have them in that
Language which himself best understood, and from
whence issued no inconvenience, the former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
still in the Language in which they had
bin written.</p>
               <p>Before the time of <hi>William</hi> the First, there was
no pretence of jurisdiction from <hi>Rome</hi> over the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60912:80"/>
Clergy, and the Church of <hi>England;</hi> tho the
infant Christianity of some of the Kings and Princes
had made some journies thither, upon the fame of
the Sanctity of many of the Bishops who had bin the
most eminent Martyrs for the Christian Faith, and
when it may be they could with more ease and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
make a journy thither, then they could have
don to any other Bishop of great notoriety out of
their own Country; for Christianity was not in
those times come much neerer <hi>England</hi> then <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine,
Provence,</hi> and <hi>Languedoc</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and those
Provinces had left their bountiful testimonies of
their devotion, which grew afterwards to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd
with the same piety in Pilgrimages first, and
then expeditions to the Holy Land, without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
purpose of transferring a Superiority over the
<hi>English</hi> Nation, to <hi>Rome,</hi> then to <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> And
after the arrival of <hi>Austin</hi> the Monk and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
who were sent by Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> and who
never enjoy'd any thing in <hi>England</hi> but by the dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Kings, the <hi>British</hi> Clergy grew so jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of their pretences, that tho the Nation was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
corrupted by the person and the doctrine
of <hi>Pel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gius,</hi> which had bin spred full two hundred
years before <hi>Austin</hi> came, the reformation and
suppression of that Heresy was much retarded by
those mens extolling or mentioning the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority,
which the <hi>Brittish</hi> Bishops were so far from
acknowledging, that they would neither meet with
them, nor submit to any thing that was propos'd
by them, and declar'd very much against the pride
and insolence of <hi>Austin,</hi> for assuming any autority,
and because when any of them came to him, he
would not so much as rise to receive them. I can
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60912:80"/>
hardly contain my self from enlarging upon this
subject at this time, but that it will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eem to many to
be foreign to the argument now in debate, and Mr.
<hi>Hobbes</hi> hath little resignation to the autority of
matter of fact, by which when he is pressed, he hath
an answer ready, that if it were so, or not so, it
should have bin otherwise, I shall therefore only
restrain my discourse to the time of <hi>William</hi> the
Conqueror, and when I have better inform'd him
of the State of the Clergy, and Universities of that
time, I shall give him the best satisfaction I can
to the instance of <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Beckett,</hi> in which
both the Clergy, and the Universities will be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
absolv'd from the guilt of adhering to the
Pope.</p>
               <p>When <hi>William</hi> found himself in possession of
<hi>England,</hi> whatever application he had formerly
made to the Pope (who was then in <hi>France)</hi> and as
some say had receiv'd from him a consecrated Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
with some other relique, beside one single hair
of St <hi>Peter,</hi> for the better success of his expedition,
he was so far from discovering any notable respect
towards him, that he expresly forbad all his Subjects
from acknowledging any man to be Pope, but him
whom he declar'd to be so. And there was a Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of such a nature in his Reign by <hi>Lanfranke</hi> the
Arch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>B. of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who had the greatest credit
and autority with him, as cannot be parallell'd by the
like don, or permitted in any State, and impossible
to be don, or permitted in any State that was in any
degree subject to the Pope, which was the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization
of a Saint. There being at that time very
great fame of <hi>Aldelmus,</hi> who first brought in the
composition of Latine verse into <hi>England,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60912:81"/>
his eminent Piety, had so great a faculty in sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that by the music of his voice he wrought won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
effects upon the barbarous and savage humor
of that People, insomuch as when they were in great
multitudes engag'd in a rude or licentious action,
he would put him self in their way and sing, which
made them all stand still to listen; and he so captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them by the melody, that he diverted them from
their purpose, and by degrees got so much credit
with them, that he reduc'd them to more civility,
and instructed them in the duties of Religion, into
which, tho they had bin baptiz'd, they had made little
enquiry. He lived a little before the time of <hi>Edward</hi>
the Confessor, and the general testimony of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity
of his Life, and some miracles wrought by him
(which it may be were principally the effects of
his Music) being reported, and believ'd by <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frank,
Edicto sancivit, ut per totam deinde Angliam
Adelmus inter eos, qui civibus coelestibus ascripti erant,
honoraretur &amp; coleretur,</hi> as by the authors neerest
that time is remembred, and at large related by <hi>Harps-Field</hi>
in his Ecclesiastical History of <hi>England</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any disapprobation. Nor is it probable, that <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frank</hi>
who was an <hi>Italian,</hi> born and bred in <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardly,</hi>
and of great reputation for learning and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
would have assum'd that autority, if he had
believ'd that he had intrenched upon the Province of
the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> The truth is, Canonizations
in that age were not the chargeable commodities
they have since grown to be, since the Pope hath
engross'd the disposal of them to himself; and it is
very probable, that the Primitive Saints, whose me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories
are preserv'd in the Martyrologies very er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneously,
were by the joint acknowledgment of the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60912:81"/>
upon the notorious sanctity of their lives, and of
their deaths, not by any solemn declaration of any
particular autority of <hi>Rome;</hi> otherwise we should
find the Records of old Canonizations there, as well
as we do of so many new. But of so many of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who suffer'd in the ten first persecutions under
the Roman Governors more then of any other,
especially if St. <hi>Vrsula,</hi> and her Eleven thousand
Virgins be reckon'd into the number, there is no
other Record but of the daies assign'd for their Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivities.
And in their whole <hi>Bullarium,</hi> which for
these latter hundred years so much abounds in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonizations,
the first that is extant is of <hi>Vldricke</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Ausburg,</hi> by <hi>Iohn</hi> the Fifteenth, <hi>Anno</hi> Nine
hundred ninety three, in a very different form, and
much different circumstances from those which are
now used. Finally, if the Popes inhibition or
interposition could have bin of any moment in that
time of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, he would have bin
sure to have heard of it, when he seiz'd upon the
Plate and Jewels of all the Monasteries, and laid other
great impositions upon the Clergy, which they had
not bin accustom'd to, and of which they would
have complain'd, if they had known whither to
have addressed their complaints.</p>
               <p>The two next Kings who succeeded him, and
reigned long (for <hi>Henry</hi> the First reigned no less
then five and thirty years) wore not their Crowns
so fast on their heads, in respect of the juster title
in their Brother <hi>Robert,</hi> as prudently to provoke
more enemies then they had; and therefore they kept
very fair quarter with <hi>Paschal,</hi> who was Pope like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
many years, and were content to look on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd
in the fierce quarrels between the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60912:82"/>
and him, for he was very powerful in <hi>France</hi>
tho not in <hi>Italy.</hi> And <hi>Anselme</hi> the Arch-bishop of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> had great contests with them both upon
the priviledges of the Clergy, and had fled to <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal</hi>
to engage him in his quarrel; yet the Pope pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to no jurisdiction in the point, but courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
interceded so far with <hi>Henry</hi> the First on the
behalf of <hi>Anselme,</hi> that he made his peace with the
King: but when he afterwards desir'd to send a
Legate into <hi>England,</hi> the King by the advice of the
Bishops, and Nobles, positively refus'd to admit him.
And whosoever takes a view of the constitution of
Christendom, as far as had reference to <hi>Europe</hi> at
that time, how far the greatest Kingdoms and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities,
which do now controul and regulate that
ambition, were from any degree of strength and
power; that <hi>Italy</hi> was then crumbled into more
distinct Governments, then it is at present; that
<hi>France,</hi> that is now intire, was then under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of very many Soveraign Princes, and the
Crown it self so far from any notable superiority,
that the King himself was somtimes excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
by his own Bishops and Clergy, without, and
against the Popes direction, and somtimes excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated,
and the Kingdom interdicted by the
Pope, even whilst he resided in <hi>France,</hi> and in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
assembled by them there, as in the Council of
<hi>Clermont;</hi> that <hi>Spain,</hi> that is now under one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
was then divided into the several Kingdoms
of <hi>Castile, Arragon, Valentia, Catalonia, Navarr,</hi>
and <hi>Leon,</hi> when the Moors were possess'd of a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of the whole, then all the other Christian
Kings, the whole Kingdom of <hi>Granada</hi> with the
greatest part of <hi>Andoluzia,</hi> and <hi>Estremadura,</hi> and a
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60912:82"/>
great part of <hi>Portugal</hi> being then under the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of those Infidels; that <hi>Genmany</hi> was under
as many Soveraign Princes as it had names of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Provinces; and that <hi>England,</hi> which hath
now <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> annex'd to it, was then,
besides the unsettlement of the <hi>English</hi> Provinces
upon the contests in the <hi>Norman</hi> Family, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
pretence to the Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> at least
without any advantage by it: I say, whosoever consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
this, will not wonder at the starts made by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Popes in that Age, into a kind of power and
autority in many Kingdoms, that they had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and which was then still interrupted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted;
and that when <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third came
to be Pope, who reigned about twenty years, he
proceeded so imperiously with our <hi>Henry</hi> the Second
upon the death of <hi>Thomas Beckett,</hi> even in a time
when there was so great a Schism in the Church,
that <hi>Victor</hi> the Fifth was chosen by a contrary par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and by a Council called at <hi>Pavia</hi> by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
there own'd, and declar'd to be Canonically
chosen, and <hi>Alexander</hi> to be no Pope, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
fled into <hi>France:</hi> so that if our King <hi>Henry</hi> the
Second had not found such a condescention to be
very suitable to his affairs both in <hi>England,</hi> and in
<hi>France,</hi> it is probable he would have declin'd so unjust
and unreasonable an imposition.</p>
               <p>I am afraid of giving Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> an occasion to
reproch me with impertinency in this digression, tho
he hath given me a just provocation to it: and since
the <hi>Roman</hi> Writers are so solicitous in the colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
and publishing the Records of that odious
Process, and strangers are easily induc'd to believe,
that the exercise of so extravagant a jurisdiction
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:60912:83"/>
in the Reign of so Heroical a Prince, who had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
his Dominions farther by much then any
of his Progenitors had don, must be grounded upon
some fix'd and confess'd right over the Nation, and
not from an original Usurpation entred upon in that
time, and when the Usurper was not acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by so considerable a part of Christendom; it
may not prove ungrateful to many men, to make a
short view of that very time, that we may see what
unheard of motives could prevail with that high
spirited King to submit to so unheard of Tyranny.
That it was not from the constitution of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
or any preadmitted power of the Pope for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
incorporated into the Laws and Customs of
the Kingdom, is very evident, by the like having
bin before attemted. For tho the Clergy enjoied
those great priviledges and immunities which are
mention'd before, whereby they had so great an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon the hearts of the people, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror
himself had bin glad to make use of them,
and <hi>William</hi> the Second, <hi>Henry</hi> the First, and King
<hi>Stephen</hi> had more need of them to uphold their U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation;
yet those priviledges how great soever,
depended not at all upon the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor
was any rank of men more solicitous then the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
to keep the Pope from a pretence of power in
the Kingdom. And the Bishops themselves had in
the beginning of that Arch-bishops contumacious
and rebellious contests with the King, don all they
could to discountenance and oppose him, and had
given their consent in Parliament, that for his diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
all his goods and moveables should be at
the Kings mercy; and it was also enacted with their
consent (after the Arch-bishop had fled out of the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60912:83"/>
Kingdom, and was known to make some applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Pope) that if any were found carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Letter or Mandate from the Pope or the Arch-bishop,
containing any interdiction of Christianity
in <hi>England;</hi> he should be taken, and without delay
executed as a Traitor both to the King and Kingdom;
that whatsoever Bishop, Priest, or Monk should
have, and retain any such Letters, should forfeit all
their Possessions, Goods, and Chattels to the King,
and be presently banish'd the Realm with their kin;
that none should appeal to the Pope; and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
particulars, which enough declare the temper of
that Catholic time, and their aversion to have any
dependance upon a foreign jurisdiction. And after
the death of <hi>Beckett,</hi> and that infamous submission
of the King to the Popes Sentence thereupon (which
yet was not so scandalous as it is vulgarly reported,
as if it had bin made and undergon by the King in
Person) when the same King desir'd to assist the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
of that Pope, <hi>Lucius</hi> the Third, who was driven
out of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to that purpose endeavour'd to
raise a collection from the Clergy, which the Popes
<hi>Nuntio</hi> appear'd in, and hoped to advance, the
Clergy was so jealous of having to do with the
Pope, or his Ministers, that they declar'd, and
advised the King, that his Majesty would supply the
Pope in such a proportion as he thought fit, and
that whatever they gave might be to the King
himself, and not to the Popes <hi>Nuntio,</hi> which
might be drawn into example to the detriment of
the King.</p>
               <p>The King himself first shewed the way to <hi>Thomas
a Beckett</hi> to apply himself to the Pope, till when
the Arch-bishop insisted only upon his own Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:60912:84"/>
rights and power, in which he found not the
concurrence of the other Bishops or Clergy, and
the King not being able to bear the insolence of the
man, and finding that he could well enough govern
his other Bishops, if they were not subjected to the
autority and power of that perverse Arch bishop,
was willing to give the Pope autority to assist him,
and did all he could to perswade him to make the
Arch-bishop of <hi>York</hi> his Legate, meaning thereby
to devest the other. Arch-bishop of that Superiority
over the Clergy that was so troublesom to him,
and which he exercis'd in his own right as Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan.
But the Pope durst not gratifie the King
therein, knowing the spirit of <hi>Beckett,</hi> and that
he would contemn the Legate, and knew well the
Ecclesiastical superiority in that Kingdom to reside
in his person as Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who,
had bin reputed <hi>tanquam alterius Orbis Papa,</hi> yet he
sent to him to advise him to submit to the King;
whereupon the haughty Prelate then fled out of the
Kingdom, and was too hard for the King with the
Pope, who was perswaded by him to make use of
this opportunity to enlarge his own power, and to
curb and subdue that Clergy that was indevoted to
him; and so by his Bull he suspended the Arch-bishop
of <hi>York,</hi> and the other Bishops who adher'd to the
King in the execution of his commands; which so
much incens'd the King, that he let fall those words
in his passion, that encouraged those rash Gentlemen
to commit that assassination, that produc'd so much
trouble. It must also be remembred, that the King,
when he bore all this from the Pope, was indeed but
half a King, having caused his son <hi>Henry</hi> to be
crown'd King with him, who thereupon gave him
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:60912:84"/>
much trouble, and join'd with the <hi>French</hi> King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him: and that he had so large and great Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories
in <hi>France,</hi> that as the Popes power was very
great there, so his friendship was the more behove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and necessary to the King. Lastly, and which
it may be is of more weight then any thing that hath
bin said in this disquisition, it may seem a very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
judgment of God Almighty, that the Pope should
exercise that unreasonable power over a King, who
had given him an absurd and unlawful power over
himself, and for an unjust end, when he obtain'd
from our Country-man Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
preceded <hi>Alexander,</hi> a Dispensation not to
perform the Oath which he had taken, that his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Geoffery</hi> should enjoy the County of <hi>Anjoy</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Will and desire of his Father, and by
vertue of that Dispensation, which the Pope had
no power to grant, defrauded his Brother of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,
and broke his Oath to God Almighty, and
so was afterwards forced himself to yield to the next
Pope, when he assum'd a power over him in a case
he had nothing to do with, and where he had no
mind to obey. And this unadvised address of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Princes to the Pope, for Dispensations of
this kind to do what the Law of God did not permit
them to do hath bin a principal inlet of his Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
to make them accept of other Dispensations
from him, of which they stand not in need, and to
admit other his incroachments from him, which
have proved very mischievous to them. Of the
condition of King <hi>Iohn</hi> we need not speak, whose
Usurpation, Murders, and absence of all Virtue,
made him fit to undergo all the reproches and
censures which Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third exercis'd
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60912:85"/>
him with, when he usurped upon <hi>France</hi> with equal
Tyranny.</p>
               <p>The succeeding Kings no sooner found it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to expel, or restrain that power which the Popes
had so inconveniently bin admitted to, and which
they had so mischievously improv'd, but the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities
not only submitted to, but advanced those
Acts which tended thereunto; as appears by the
Writings of <hi>Occam,</hi> and other Learned men in the
University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> in the Reigns of those Kings
both <hi>Edward</hi> the First and <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, in
which times as much was don against the power of
the Pope, as was afterwards don by <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth
himself. And the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church would not at this
time have preserved their liberties and priviledges
to that degree, as to contemn the power of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Bishop, if the University of the <hi>Sorbone</hi> had not
bin more vigilant against those incroachments then
the Crown it self. So far have the Universities bin
from being the Authors, or promoters of those
false doctrines, which he unjustly laies to their charge.
And I presume they will be as vigilant and resolute,
to preserve the Civil Autority from being invaded
and endangered, by their receiving and subscribing
to his pernicious and destructive principles, which
his modesty is induced to believe may be planted in
the minds of men, because whole Nations have bin
brought to acquiesce in the great mysteries of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion which are above reason, and millions
of men have bin made to believe, that the same bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
may be in innumerable places at one and the same
time, which is against reason: and therefore he
would have the Soveraign power to make his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
so consonant to reason, to be taught and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60912:85"/>
preached. But his Doctrine is fit only to be taught
by his own Apostles, who ought to be looked upon
as Seducers, and false Prophets; and God forbid
that the Soveraign powers should contribute to the
making those principles believed, which would be
in great danger to be destroied, if it were but sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
that they affected to have that power, which
he would have to belong to them. And such Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
who have bin willi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g to believe they have it,
have bin alwaies most jealous that it should be
known, or thought, that they do believe so; since
they know there would be a quick determination of
their power, if all their Subjects knew, that they
believed, that all they have doth in truth belong to
them, and that they may dispose of it as they
please.</p>
               <p>(Pag. 168.) <hi>He saies a Common-wealth hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
diseases, which proceed from the poison of Seditious
doctrines, whereof one is, That every private man is
Iudg of good and evil actions,</hi> which is a doctrine
never allow'd in any Common-wealth, the Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the measure of all good or evil actions under
every Government; and where that Law permits
a liberty to the Subject to dispute the commands
of the Soveraign, no inconvenience can arise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by:
but if the Soveraign by his own autority shall
vacate and cancel all Laws, the Common-wealth
must need be distracted, or much weakned.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> will have too great an advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
any adversary, if he will not have his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
tried by any Law, nor his Religion by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Scripture: and he could never think, that the
believing, that (pag. 168.) <hi>whatsoever a man doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his conscience is sin,</hi> is a Doctrine to civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60912:86"/>
repugnant, if he thought any of the Apostles
good Judges of Conscience, who all, upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
and in all actions, <hi>commend themselves to
every mans conscience,</hi> 2. Cor. 4. 2. as also, <hi>Our rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is this, the Testimony of our conscience</hi> 2 Cor.
1 12. and throughout the whole New Testament
the conscience is made the Judg of all we do. And
if Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> had not so often excepted against
Divines for being good Judges in Religion, I could
tell him of very good ones, who are of opinion, that
it is a sin to do any thing against an erroneous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
which is his own best excuse, that he will
not depart from his own judgment, which is his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
how erroneous soever it is. But this liberty of
Conscience is restrain'd only to those Cases where
the Law hath prescribed no rule; for where the Law
enjoins the duty, no private conscience can deny o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.
In case of misperswasion, it looks upon the
action as sinful in him, and so chuses to submit to the
penalty, which is still obedience, or removes into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Climate as more agreeable to his constitution.</p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> proposes to himself to answer all
extravagant discourses or private opinions of sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
men, which have no countenance from public
Autority, he will be sure to chuse such as he can easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confute. All sober men agree, that tho Faith
and Sanctity are not to be attain'd only by study
and reading, yet that study and reading are means
to procure that grace from God Almighty that is
necessary thereunto. And himself confesseth, that
with all his education, discipline, correction, and
other natural waies, it is God that worketh that
Faith and Sanctity in those he thinks fit. So that
if he did not think men the more unlearn'd for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60912:86"/>
Divines, it is probable that there is very little
difference between what those unlearned Divines,
and himself say upon this point, saving that they
may use <hi>inspiring</hi> and <hi>infusing,</hi> which are words he
cannot endure as <hi>insignificant speech,</hi> tho few men
are deceiv'd in the meaning of them.</p>
               <p>If all Soveraigns are subject to the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(as he saies they are) because such Laws are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
and cannot by any man or Common-wealth be
abrogated, they then are oblig'd to observe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
those Laws which themselves have made, and
promised to observe, for violation of faith is against
the Law of Nature by his own confession. Nor
doth this obligation set any Judg over the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
nor doth any civil Law pretend that there
is any power to punish him; it is enough, that in
justice he ought to do it, and that there is a
Soveraign in Heaven above him, tho not on
Earth.</p>
               <p>The next indeed is a Doctrine that troubles him,
and tends, as he saies, (pag. 169.) <hi>to the dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Common-wealth, That every private man has
an absolute propriety in his goods, such as excludes
the right of the Soveraign,</hi> which if true, he
saies, <hi>(p.</hi> 170.) <hi>he cannot perform the Office they have
put him into, which is to defend them both from Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Enemies, and from the injuries of one another,
and consequently there is no longer a Common wealth.</hi>
And I say, if it be not true, there is nothing worth
the defending from Foreign Enemies, or from one
another, and consequently it is no matter what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
of the Common-wealth. Can he defend
them any other way, then by their own help, with
their own hands? and it is a marvellous thing that
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60912:87"/>
any man can believe, that he can be as vigorously
assisted by people who have nothing to lose, as by
men who defending him defend their own Goods
and Estates, which if they do not believe their own,
they will never care into what hands they fall. Nor is
the Soveraign power divided by the Soveraigns con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
that he will not exercise such a part of it, but
in such and such a manner, and with such circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
for he hath not parted with any of his Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
since no other man can exercise that which he
forbears to exercise himself; which could be don, if he
had divided it. And it is much a greater crime in
those who are totally ignorant of the laws, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
by their wit and presumtion to undermine
them, then that they who are learn'd in the study
and profession of the Law, do all they can to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
that, which only supports the Government.
Much less is the Soveraign power divided by the
Soveraigns own communicating part of it to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
in his name, to those who, by their educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and experience, are qualified to do it much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then he himself can be presumed to be able to
do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to appoint Judges to administer Justice to
his people, upon all the pretences of right which may
arise between themselves, or between him and them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
according to the Rules of the Law, which are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
to them, and must be unknown to him; who
yet keeps the Soveraign power in his hands to
punish those Deputies, if they swerve from their
duty.</p>
               <p>To the mischiefs which have proceeded from
the reading the Histories of the ancient Greeks and
Romans, I shall say no more in this place, then that
if Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> hath bin alwaies of this opinion, he
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60912:87"/>
was very much to blame to take the pains to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
<hi>Thucyd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>des</hi> into <hi>English,</hi> in which there is so
much of the Policy of the <hi>Greeks</hi> discovered, and
much more of that Oratory that disposes Men to
Sedition, then in all <hi>Tullies,</hi> or <hi>Aristotles</hi> works. But
I suppose he had then, and might still have more
reason to believe, that very few who have taken
delight in reading the Books of Policy and Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> have ever fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
into Rebellion; and there is much more fear,
that the reading this and other Books writ by him,
and the glosses he makes upon them in his conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
may introduce thoughts of Rebellion into young
men, by weakning, and laughing at all obligations of
conscience, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> only can dispose men to obedience:
and by perswading Princes, that they may safely and
justly follow the extent of their own inclinations and
appetites in the Government of their Subjects, which
must tire and wear out all Subjection, at least the
cheerfulness, which is the strength of it, by lessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the reverence to God Almighty, which is the
foundation of reverence to the King; and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing
all Religion, as no otherwise known, and
no otherwise coustituted then by the arbitriment
of the Soveraign Prince, whom he makes a God of
Heaven, as well as upon the Earth, since he is upon
the matter, the only author of the Scripture it self;
the swallowing of all which opinions, must be the
destruction of all Government, and the ruine of all
obedience.</p>
               <p>Tho most of his reflexions are reproches upon
the Government of his own Country, which he
thinks is imperfectly instituted; yet he cannot im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
the doctrine of killing Kings, whether Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60912:88"/>
or Tyrannicide, to that Government, nor the
unreasonable distinction of Spiritual and Temporal
jurisdiction, to rob the Soveraign of any part of his
Supremacy, and divide one part of his Subjects
from a dependance upon his justice and autority.
God be thanked the Laws of that Kingdom admit
none of that doctrine, or such distinctions to that
pernicious purpose. Nor do the Bishops, or Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
of that Kingdom (however they are fallen from
Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> his grace) use any style or title, but
what is given or permitted to them by the Soveraign
power. And therefore this Controversy must be
defended by those (who justly lie under the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch)
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who, it may be, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
him the less, because, tho they know him not
to be of theirs, they think him not to be of any
Religion.</p>
               <p>The power of levying Mony, which depending
upon any general assembly, he saies, (pag. 172.)
<hi>endangereth the Common-wealth, for want of such nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment,
as is necessary to life and motion,</hi> shall be
more properly enlarg'd upon in the next Chapter,
when, I doubt not, very wholsome remedies will be
found for all those diseases which he will suppose
may proceed from thence; but tis to be hoped none
will chuse his desperate prescriptions, which will
cure the di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ease by killing the Patient.</p>
               <p>He concludes this Chapter, after all his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
donatives to his Soveraign, with his old wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
doctrine, that would indeed irreparably destroy
and dissolve all Common-wealths, That when by
a powerful invasion from a foreign Enemy, or a
prosperous Rebellion by Subjects, his Soveraign is
so far oppressed that he can keep the field no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60912:88"/>
his Subjects owe him no farther assistance, and
may lawfully put themselves under the Conqueror,
of what condition soever; for tho, he saies, (pag.
174.) <hi>The right of the Soveraign is not extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yet the obligation of the members is,</hi> and so the
Soveraign is left to look to himself. There are
few Empires of the World, which at some time
have not bin reduc'd, by the strength and power of
an outragious Enemy, to that extremity, that their
forces have not bin able to keep the field any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
which Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> makes the period of their
Subjects Loyalty, and the dissolution of the Common
wealth; yet of these at last many Princes have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd,
and redeem'd themselves from that period,
and arrived again at their full height and glory by the
constancy and vertue of their Subjects, and their
firmly believing, that their obligations could not be
extinguish'd as long as the right of their Soveraign
Monarch was not. So that there is great reason to
believe, that the old Rules which Soveraignty all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
prescribed to it self, are much better, and
more like to preserve it, then the new ones which
he would plant in their stead; because it is very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
that the old subjection is much more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and necessary to the support and defence of the
Soveraignty, then that new one which he is content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with, and prescribes; which he will not only
have determin'd as to any assistance of his natural
Soveraign, tho he confesses (pag. 174.) <hi>his right
remains still in him; but that he is obliged, (so strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obliged, that no pret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

out of fear, can absolve him) to protect, and assist
the Vsurper as long as he is able.</hi> So that the entire
loss of one Battel, according to his judgment
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60912:89"/>
of subjection, and the duty of Subjects, shall, or
may put an end to the Soveraignty of any Prince
in <hi>Europe.</hi> And this is one of the grounds and
principles, which he concludes to be against the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
duty of Princes, to let the People be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of.</p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> had a Conscience made and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
like other mens, and had not carefully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
that whilst his judgment is fix'd under Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical
and Metaphysical notions, his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
shall never be disturb'd by Religious specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and apprehensions; it might possibly smite
him with the remembrance, that these excellent
principles were industriously insinuated, divulged
and publish'd within less then two years after <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels</hi>
Usurpation of the Government of the three
Nations, upon the Murder of his Soveraign; and
that he then declar'd in this Book (pag. 165.) <hi>that
against such Subjects who deliberately deny the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority
of the Common wealth, then, and so established,</hi>
(which, God be thanked, much the major part of
the three Nations then did) <hi>the vengeance might
lawfully be extended not only to the Fathers, but
also to the third and fourth generation not yet in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and consequently innocent of the fact for which
they are afflicted; because the nature of this offence,
consists in renouncing of subjection, which is a relapse
into the condition of War, commonly called Rebellion,
and they that so offend, suffer not as Subjects, but
as Enemies.</hi> And truly he may very reasonably
believe, surely more then many things which he
doth believe, that the veneme of this Book wrought
upon the hearts of men, to retard the return of their
Allegiance for so many years, and was the cause of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60912:89"/>
so many cruel and bloody persecutions against
those, who still retain'd their duty and Allegiance
for the King. And methinks no man should be an
Enemy to the renewing war in such cases, but
he who thinks all kind of war, upon what occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
soever, to be unlawful; which Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> is so
far from thinking, that he is very well contented,
and believes it very lawful for his Soveraign, in
this Paragraph of cruelty, to make war against any
whom he judges capable to do him hurt.</p>

               <p>MR. <hi>Hobbes</hi> having invested his Soveraign
with so absolute Power and Omnipotence,
we have reason to expect that in this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter

                  </gap>
warning, that if any of the essential Rights of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty,
specified in his eighteenth Chapter (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>,
in a word, is to do any thing he hath a mind to do,
and take any thing he likes from any of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects)
be taken away, the Common-wealth is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd:
and therefore that it is his office to preserve
those Rights entire, and against his duty to transfer
any of them from himself. And least he should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
the Rights and Power he hath bestowed upon
him, he recollects them all in three or four lines, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
which he puts him in mind, that he hath
power to leavy mony, when, and as much as in his
own conscience he shall judg necessary: and then
tells him, that it is agaist his duty to let the People
be ignorant, or mis-informed of the grounds and
reasons of those his essential Rights, that is, that he
is oblig'd to make his <hi>Leviathan</hi> Canonical Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
there being no other Book ever yet printed,
that can inform them of those rights, and the grounds
and reason of them. And how worthy they are
to receive that countenance and autority, will best
appear by a farther examination of the Particulars;
and yet a man might have reasonably expected from
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60912:90"/>
the first Paragraph of this Chapter another kind of
tenderness, indeed as great as he can wish, of the good
and welfare of the Subject, when he declares, (<hi>pag.</hi>
175.) <hi>That the office of the Monarch consists in the end
for which he was trusted with the Soveraign power, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the procuration of the safety of the People, to which
he is obliged by the Law of Nature, and to render an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
thereof to God the Author of that Law. But by
safety,</hi> he saies, <hi>is not mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> a bare preservation, but
also all other contentments of life, which every man by
lawful industry, without danger or hurt to the Common-wealth,
can acquire to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mself.</hi> Who can expect a more
blessed condition? Who can desire a more gracious
Soveraign? No man would have thought this spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Building should have its Foundation, after the
manner of the foolish <hi>Indians,</hi> upon sand, that, assoon
as you come to rest upon it, molders away to nothing;
that this safety, safety improv'd with all the other
contentments of life, should consist in nothing else,
but in a mans being instructed and prepar'd to
know, that he hath nothing of his own, and that
when he hath by his lawful industry acquir'd to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
all the contentments of life which he can set his
heart upon, one touch of his Soveraigns hand, one
breath of his mouth, can take all this from him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doing him any injury. This is the Doctrine
to be propagated, and which he is confident will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
be receiv'd and consented to, since if it were not
according the principles of Reason, he is sure it is a
principle from autority of Scripture, and will be so
acknowledg'd, if the Peoples minds be not tainted
with dependance upon the Potent, or scribled over
with the opinions of their Doctors.</p>
               <p>One of the reasons which he gives, why his
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60912:91"/>
grounds of the rights of his Soveraign should be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
and truly taught, is a very good reason to
believe, that the grounds are not good, because he
confesses, (<hi>pag.</hi> 175.) that <hi>they cannot be maintain'd
by any Civil Law, or terror of legal punishment.</hi> And
as few men agree with Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> in the essential
Rights of Soveraignty, so none allows, nor doth he
agree with himself, <hi>that all resistance to the rights of
the Soveraignty, be they never so essential, is Rebellion.</hi>
He allows it to be a priviledg of the Subject that he
may sue the King, so there is no doubt but that the
Soveraign may sue the Subject, who may as lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
defend as sue, and every such defence is a resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to the Soveraign right of demanding, and yet
I suppose Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> will not say it is Rebellion. He
that doth positively refuse to pay mony to the King,
which he doth justly owe to him, and which he shall
be compell'd to pay, doth resist an essential Right of
the King, yet is not guilty of Rebellion, which is
constituted in having a force to support his resistance,
and a purpose to apply it that way. And as the Law
of Nature is not so easily taught, because not so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
understood as the Civil Law, so I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
why Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> should imagine the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
power to be more secure by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
then by the Civil Law, when he confesses,
<hi>That the Law of Nature is made Law, only by being made
part of the Civil Law:</hi> and if the Civil Law did
not provide a restraint from the violation of Faith,
by the terror of the punishment that must attend it,
the obligation from the Law of Nature wonld be a
very faint security to Princes for the obedience of
their Subjects. But he chuses to appeal only to the
Law of Nature, which is a Text so few men have read
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60912:91"/>
and understand, to support an imaginary Faith that
was never given, upon which Soveraignty was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
For which he hath another reason likewise; for
his Law of Nature is always at hand to serve him,
when no other Law will. For when you tell him that
the Law of Nature forbiddeth the violation of Faith,
and therefore that Kings and Princes are obliged to
observe the Promises they make, and the Oaths they
take; he answers you with great confidence, and great
cleerness, that <hi>that rule is only obligatory to Subjects,</hi>
for that by the Law of Nature, <hi>such Promises and Oaths
taken by Princes, are</hi> ipso facto <hi>void, invalid, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> bind
not at all.</hi> So that by this omnipotent Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which is indispensable and eternal, the Sacred
Word of a King, which ought to be as fix'd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable
as the center of the Earth, is made as
changeable as the Moon; and the breach of Faith,
which is so odious to God and man, is made lawful
for Kings, who are the only Persons in the World
who cannot be perjur'd, because the indispensable
Law of Nature will not permit them to perform
what they promise. And now we see the reason why
the Law of Nature must only be able to support that
Government, which no Civil Law will be able to
do: it remains, that tho there may be a very inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and lawful resistance of some essential Rights
of the Soveraign, for recovery whereof he may be
put to sue at Law, as hath bin said before, his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
by his right of Interpreting Law, may, as his
Institutor here hath don, interpret such resistance to
be Treason, and so confi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cate the Estate of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Subject he hath, who hath an Estate that he hath
a mind to have.</p>
               <p>He would be glad to find some answer to the want
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:60912:92"/>
of President, which he sees will alwaies lie in his way,
that there hath not bin hitherto any Common-wealth
where those Rights have bin acknowledg'd
or challeng'd: but he hath alwaies the ill luck to
leave the Objection as strong as he found it; and if
he could find no Artificers to assist in the erecting such
a Building as may last as long as the Materials, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
his skill in Architecture from the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Reason, his long study of the nature of
Materials, and the divers effects of Figure and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
men would rather chuse to dwell in the
Houses they have, then to pull them down, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
till he set up better in the place. He must give
a better evidence then his non-reason, that his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
will be everlasting, before men believe it;
and when his Principles from autority of Scripture
come to be examin'd, they will be found to have no
more solidity, then those which he hath produc'd
from his long study and observation. In the mean
time he shall do well to get his Doctrine planted in
those Countries, and among that People who are
made believe, that the same Body may be in innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
places at one and the same time, where possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
things equally unreasonably may be believ'd.
And since men are to be taught, that they ought not
to be in love with any Form of Government more
then with their own, nor to desire change, which he
saies, (<hi>pag.</hi> 177.) <hi>is like the breach of the first of Gods
Commandments,</hi> he hath himself raised one unanswer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Argument against the reception and doctrine of
his <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>viathan.</hi> His unskilful reproches upon the
Universities are sufficiently refuted in the last Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter.</p>
               <p>A man would hardly believe, that the same Person
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60912:92"/>
should think it to be of the office of the Soveraign
to take care for the making of good Laws, and
should so frankly declare, That no Law can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
to be good, tho it be for the benefit of the
Soveraign, if it be not necessary for the People, for
the good of the Soveraign and the People cannot
be separated; and yet at the same time determine,
that all Laws which establish any Propriety to and in
the People, are invalid and void, and that it is an
essential and inseparable Right in the Soveraign, to
levy as much mony at any time, as he in his own
conscience shall judg necessary. And therefore, tho
I think I have in several places of this Discourse suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
evinc'd the unreasonableness of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
and the inconsistency of the good and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
of the Soveraign with such a Power, I shall
here enlarge upon the Disquisition thereof, and of
the reasons which induce him to believe, that any
kind of restraint of his power of raising mony, by
what consent of his own soever, is no less then the
dissolution of the Common-wealth: for this power
of taking every mans mony from him, and his goods
that will yield mony, is his principal contention
throughout his Book, besides his liberty to lay asleep,
alter, and repeal all Laws according to his will and
pleasure. The expence and charge of the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and maintenance of the Government being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
and contingent, and so not to be provided
for by any constant provision or revenue, if by any
emergent occasion, upon a suddain Rebellion or fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Invasion, the Soveraign hath not power to
raise what mony he thinks necessary to suppress the
one and resist the other, the Kingdom must be lost;
and if he may do it in either of those cases, he may
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:60912:93"/>
do it to prevent either; and it ought to be suppos'd
that he will not take more, tho he may take all, then
is absolutely necessary for the occasion: and this is
the strongest case (and yet is not so strong in relation
to an Island, as it is in relation to an In-land King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom)
he hath, or can suppose, for the support of this
power, to every part of which this answer may be
applied.</p>
               <p>As there is no Soveraign in <hi>Europe</hi> who pretends
to this right of Soveraignty, so there was never any
Kingdom, or considerable Country lost by want of
it, or preserv'd by the actual exercise of it: and
the Laws themselves permit, and allow many things
to be don, when the mischief and necessity are in
view, which may not warrantably be don upon the
pretence of preventing it. The Law of necessity is
pleadable in any Court, and hath not only its par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
but justification; as when, not only a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
but a private man pulls down a house or
more, which are next to that house which is on fire,
to prevent the farther mischief, the Law justifies
him, because the necessity and benefit is as visible as
the fire; yet it would not be justice in the Soveraign
himself, to cause a mans house to be pulled down
that is seven miles distant, upon a fore-sight that the
fire may come thither. I am not averse from Mr.
<hi>Hobbes</hi>'s opinion, that a man who is upon the point
of starving, and is not able to buy meat, may take
as much of the meat he first sees, as will serve for
that meal; and this not only by the Law of Nature,
but for ought I know, without punishment by any
Municipal Law, which seldom cancels the unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
Law of Nature: but this necessity will not
justifie him in the stealing or taking by force an Ox
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:60912:93"/>
from any man to prevent starving for a month toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
how poor soever the man is, or to rob a Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers
shop, that he may have a second course. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
is not a word unknown, or unconsider'd by
the Law. No Subject, who will obey the Law, and
submit to that power and autority which he conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sses
to be unquestionable in the King, can run into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion;
and if he doth, all other Subjects are bound
by the Laws to assist, to suppress it in that manner,
and with that force, and under such conduct and
command as the Soveraign directs. If this Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
prospers, let the Soveraigns right be what Mr.
<hi>Hobbes</hi> assigns him, to levy mony, he will never be
able to levy it in the Rebels Quarters; and if they
extend their Quarters far, they share the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with him; for he appoints those who live in those
Quarters, and enjoy protection, to assist and defend
their Protectors. The case is the same in an actual
Invasion, where the Invaders right grows at least as
fast as the Rebels; and the power of the Soveraign,
be it never so cheerfully submitted to, can levy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
only where he is obeied, and upon those whose
hands must fight for him, or give him other assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
and then the question is, Whether he be not
like to be stronger by accepting what they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to give, then by letting them know that they
have nothing to give, because all they have is his.
And yet in both these cases of an actual Rebellion,
or actual Invasion, if the King takes any mans mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that he finds (and if he cannot find it, his right
to take it will do him little good) not as his own, but
as that mans, to be laid out for his own and public
defence, and to be repaid by the public, which
ought not to be defended at the charge of any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:60912:94"/>
man, there will be little complaint of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Law, and the right of Property will
be still unshaken. But all these mischiefs are to be
prevented by the Soveraigns sagacity and fore-sight;
and if he may not levy what mony he pleases,
and thinks requisite to make preparations to disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
all such designs of both kinds, it will be too
late indeed to do it after, and the Common-wealth
cannot but suffer by the defect of power.</p>
               <p>If the mischief be only in apprehension, there is
time to raise mony in that way which is provided,
and agreed upon for those extraordinary occasions,
by asking their consent, who can without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
or murmur that can prove inconvenient, give
present directions for the paiment thereof. But what
if they refuse to give; must the Common-wealth
perish, and every man in it, whose defence the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
hath undertaken, and is bound to? If the
Soveraign hath taken all they have before, as he may
when he will, they may have nothing left to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in those necessary seasons, and then what will
his obligation to defend them do good? and how are
they like to assist him, when they have nothing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
but his power to make them miserable? It is
not good to suspect, that Princes will extend their
power, how absolute soever it is, to undo their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
wantonly and unnecessarily; nor is it reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to imagine, that Subjects who enjoy Peace and
Plenty, will obstinately refuse to contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their own preservation, when both are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
But since it is necessary to suppose a case that
never yet fell out, to introduce a Government that
was never before thought of, let us admit that it is
possible, that such an obstinate Spirit may rule in
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:60912:94"/>
that Assembly which have the power to raise mony,
that they may peremtorily refuse to give any, and
by the want thereof the Common-wealth is really
like to be dissolv'd; I say, admit this, (tho the same
kind of obstinacy, that is, an obstinacy as natural
as this, to perform no function they ought to do,
will, and must dissolve the Soveraignty of his own
institution) the question shall be, Whether this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
disease be worthy of such a cure? whether the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
possibility of such a danger be fit to be secur'd
and prevented by such a remedy? and I think most
wise and dispassioned men will believe, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
inquietude and vexation, that must attend
men who are in daily fear to have all they have taken
from them, and believe that they have nothing their
own to leave to their Children and Family, is too
disproportion'd a provision to prevent a mischief that
is possible to fall out; and that the hazard of that is
more reasonably to be submitted to, then the danger
of a more probable revolution from the other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper.
And when he hath heightened the danger
his Soveraignty may be in, by all the desperate ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
his melancholy or fancy can suggest to
him, he will find, that no defect of power can ever
make a Prince so weak, so impotent, and so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely
miserable, as his being Soveraign over such
Subjects as have nothing to give, because they have
nothing that is their own; nor will the conscience of
their Soveraign, that he will not do all he may, bring
any substantial Cordial to them: but as he saies, that
his Soveraign <hi>may command any thing to be don against
Law, because his command amounts to a repeal of that
Law, for he that can make himself free, is free;</hi> so
they will think, that he that can be undon at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:60912:95"/>
of another man, is undon already, and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day is but the Eve of his destruction, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
will think of all ways to prevent it; and he
knows the effect of fear too well, to think that a
man who is in a continual fright can be fix'd in a firm
obedience.</p>
               <p>His Commentary upon the ten Commandments,
which in his judgment comprehends and exacts all
his Injunctions contain'd in his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> and his
other Theological Speculations, I refer to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
and examination of his Friends the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
who no doubt will be well pleased to find him
a better Casuist, now he comes to revolve the tenth
Commandment in this his thirtieth Chapter, then
he was in his twenty seventh Chapter, in his gloss
upon the same Text; for there he determines clearly,
(pag. 151.) that <hi>to be delighted in the imagination only
of being possessed of an other mans goods, or wife, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
intention to take them from him by force or fraud, is
no breach of this Law, Thou shalt not covet: nor the
pleasure a man hath in imagining the death of a man,
from whose life he expects nothing but dammage and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,
any sin.</hi> The business he then had,
was to find excuses and extenuation for sins; but
now having occasion better to consider that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
of which he stood in need, he finds,
that the very intention to do an unjust act, tho hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
is injustice, which consisteth in the pravity
of the Will, as well as in the irregularity of the act;
as if in the former case, all that delight in the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of being possessed of another mans Wife, or
the pleasure one has in thinking of the death of a
man he doth not love, could be without any pravity
of the Will. 'Tis true, a purpose and intendment
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:60912:95"/>
may be more criminal then mere complacency; but
we know more or less do not change the Species of
things. And for the best way of inculcating all his
useful Doctrines, and setting aside certain daies to
infuse (which upon so good an occasion will not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
his severe ear) the same into the hearts of the
People, which he conceives to be a duty enjoin'd by
the fourth Commandment, I shall defer my opinion
till the end of the next Chapter, when upon the view
of all his Doctrines by retail, we may better consult
upon the method of spreading them abroad. In the
mean time he must not take it ill, that I observe his
extreme malignity to the Nobility, by whose bread
he hath bin alwaies sustain'd, who must not expect
any part, at least any precedence in his Institution;
that in this his deep meditation upon the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
and in a conjuncture when the Level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
were at highest, and the reduction of all degrees
to one and the same was resolv'd upon, and begun,
and exercis'd towards the whole Nobility with all the
instances of contemt and scorn, he chose to publish
his judgment; as if the safety of the People requir'd
an equality of Person, and that (pag. 180.) <hi>the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of great Persons is to be valued for their beneficence,
and the aids they give to men of inferior rank, or not at
all; and that the consequence of partiality towards the
great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> raised hatred, and an endeavor in the People to pull
down all oppressing and contumelious greatness;</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
lent to, or borrowed from the Agitators of
that time.</p>
               <p>He seems to think the making of good Laws to be
incumbent on the Soveraign as his duty, and of much
importance to his Government; but he saies then,
(pag. 181.) <hi>that by a good Law, he doth not mean a
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:60912:96"/>
just Law, for that no Law can be unjust, because it is
made by the Soveraign P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>wer.</hi> And in truth, if the
use of Laws is not to restrain men from doing amiss,
and to instruct and dispose them to do well, and to
secure them when they do so, they are of no use at
all, and it is no matter if there be any Laws or no.
For, to make use of his own illustration, <hi>(pag.</hi> 182.)
<hi>Hedges are set to stop Travellers, and to keep them in the
way</hi> that is allow'd and prescrib'd, and for hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to chuse a way for themselves, tho a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and nearer way; and Laws are made to guide,
and govern, and punish men who presume to decline
that rule, and to chuse another to walk by, that is
more agreeable to their own appetite or conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
He renews his trouble to find fit Counsellors
for his Soveraign, which he hath so much consider'd
before, and finds the office to be as hard as the Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology
(of which let the Grammarians and he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree)
and saies plainly, (pag. 184.) <hi>that the Politics
is a harder study then the study of Geometry:</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
he believes that he can set down as firm Rules
in the one, as there are in the other. (pag. 184.) <hi>Good
counsel,</hi> he saies, <hi>comes not by lot or inheritance, and

with the Soveraign power,</hi> tho they must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
by him: and the Pedegree of those pretences
from the <hi>Germans,</hi> is one of those dreams which he
falls into, when he invades the quarters of History
to make good his assertions.</p>
               <p>Lastly, since he reckons the sending out Colonies,
and erecting Plantations, the encouraging all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Arts, as Navigation, Agriculture, Fishing,
and all manner of Manufactures, to be of the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Office of a Soveraign, it will not be in his
power to deny, that his Soveraign is obliged to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
all those promises, and to make good all those
concessions and priviledges which he hath made and
granted, to those who have bin thereby induc'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to
expose their Fortunes and their Industry to those
Adventures, as hath bin formerly enlarg'd upon in
the case of Merchants and Corporations, and which
is directly contrary to his Conclusions and Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.
And I cannot but here observe the great
vigilance and caution, which Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> (who hath
an excellent faculty of employing very soft words,
for the bringing the most hard and cruel things to
pass) uses out of his abstracted love of Justice, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the regulating and well ordering his poor and
strong people, whom he transplants into other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
for the ease of his own; whom he will by no
means suffer to exterminate those they find there, but
only to constrain them to inhabit closer together,
and not to range a great deal of ground; that is in
more significant words, which the tenderness of his
nature would not give him leave to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

make no reflexions upon what he saies concerning it,
till we come thither: nor upon his Worship and
Attributes which he assigns to God, or rather what
are not Attributes to him; in which, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of explaining or defining, he makes many
things harder then they were before. As all men who

this whole Chapter with wonderful art, by making
use of very many easie, proper, and very significant
words, made a shift to compound the whole so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd
and intricate, that there is scarce a Chapter
in his Book, the sense whereof the Reader can with
more difficulty carry about him, and observe the
several fallacies and contradictions in it. Of which

the prerogative to himself, to give new Definitions

that when it conduces to his purpose, he may inform
his Reader, or else perplex him. And therefore he doth
not think himself safe in the former plain Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which he gives of understanding, (<hi>pag.</hi> 17.) that
it is <hi>nothing else but conception caused by speech; by which,
speech being peculiar to man, understanding must be pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to him also:</hi> but now being in his one and thirti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Chapter, and to deprive God of understanding,
that Definition will not serve his turn, since it cannot
be doubted but that God doth hear all we say; and
therefore we are to be amuzed by being told, (<hi>pag.</hi>
190.) that understanding is nothing else <hi>but a tumult
of the mind, raised by external things, that press the
organical parts of mans body: So that there being no
such thing in God, and it depending on natural causes,
cannot be attributed to him.</hi> And now he is as safe as
ever he was, and let him that finds no tumult in his
mind, that presses the organical parts of his body,
get knowledg and understanding as he can.</p>
               <p>I am not willing, under pretence of adjourning
some reflexions, which would be natural enough up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Chapter, to a more seasonable occasion, for
enlargement upon the third part of his Discourse, to
be thought purposely to pretermit some of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
in this Chapter, which seem to have som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of Piety and of Godliness in them, and to
raise hope that his purposes are yet better then they
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:60912:98"/>
appear'd to be. After all that illimited power he
hath granted to his Soveraign, and all that unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
obedience which he exacts from his Subject,
he doth in the first Paragraph of this Chapter frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acknowledg, (<hi>pag.</hi> 186.) that <hi>the Subjects owe sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
obedience to their Soveraign, only in those things
wherein their obedience is not repugnant to the Law of
God,</hi> and is very solicitous so to instruct his Subject,
that for want of entire knowledg of his duty to both
Laws, he may neither by too much civil obedience
offend the Divine Majesty, or through fear of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
God, transgress the Commandments of the
Commonwealth; a circumspection worthy the best
Christian, and is enough to destroy many of the
Prerogatives which he hath given to his Soveraign,
and to cancel many of the Obligations he hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd

That the Books of the holy Scripture, which only contain
the Laws of God, are only Canonical, when they are
establish'd for such by the Soveraign power.</hi> So that
when he hath suspended obedience to the Soveraign
in those things wherein their obedience is repugnant
to the Law of God, it is meant only till the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
declares that it is not repugnant to the Law of
God; with other excellent Doctrine, the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

and because Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> hath not receiv'd any

hope, that the supreme Magistrate will at some time
so far exercise his Soveraignty, as to protect the

why the last hath bin no more enquired into then
the former, it having bin thought best, that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
Doctrines of what kind soever, which the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
of those times produc'd, should rather expire
by neglect, and the repentance of the Authors, then
that they should be brought upon the Stage again by
a solemn and public condemnation, which might
kindle some parts of the old Spirit with the vanity
of contradiction, which would otherwise, in a short
time, be extinguish'd: and it is only in Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:60912:100"/>
his own power to reverse the security that Act hath

what was his Off-spring in Tyrannical Times,
when there was no King in <hi>Israel,</hi> his more delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and legitimate Issue and Productions, in a time
when a lawful Government flourishes, which cannot
connive at such bold Transgressors and Transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and he will then find, that it hath fallen into the
hands of a Soveraign that hath consider'd it very
well, not by allowing the public teaching it, but by
a declared detestation and final snppression of it, and
enjoining the Author a public recantation.</p>
               <p>We shall conclude here our disquisition of his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
and Government of his Commonwealth, with
the recollecting and stating the excellent Maximes
and Principles upon which his Government is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and supported, that when they appear naked,
and uninvolv'd in his magisterial Discourses, men
may judg of the liberty and security they should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,
if Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> Doctrine were inculcated into the
minds of men by their Education, and the Industry
of those Masters under whom they are to be bred, as
he thinks it necessary it should be; which Principles
are in these very terms declared by him.</p>
               <p>1. That the Kings word is sufficient to take
any thing from any Subject when there is need,
and that the King is Iudg of that need. <hi>pag.
106. cap. 20. part.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>2. The Liberty of a subject lieth only in
those things, which in regulating their actions,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60912:100"/>
the Soveraign hath pretermitted, such as is the
liberty to buy and sell, and otherwise to contract
with one another; to chuse their own abode,
their own diet, their own trade of life, and
institute their children as they themselves think
fit, and the like. <hi>pag. 109. cap. 21. par.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>3. Nothing the Soveraign can do to a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
on what pretence soever, can properly be
called injustice or injury. <hi>pag.</hi> 109.</p>
               <p>4. When a Soveraign Prince putteth to death
an innocent subject, tho the action be against the
Law of Nature, as being contrary to Equity,
yet it is not an injury to the subject, but to God.
<hi>pag.</hi> 109.</p>
               <p>5. No man hath liberty to resist the word of
the Soveraign; but in case a great many men
together, have already resisted the Soveraign
power unjustly, or committed some capital crime,
for which every one of them expecteth death,
they have liberty to join together, and to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
and defend one another. <hi>pag.</hi> 112.</p>
               <p>6. If a Soveraign demand, or take any
thing by pretence of his power, there lieth in that
case no action at Law. <hi>pag.</hi> 112.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:60912:101"/>
7. If a subject be taken prisoner in War, or
his person, or his means of life be within the
guards of the Enemy, and hath his life and
corporal liberty given him, on condition to be
subject to the Victor, he hath liberty to accept
the condition, and having accepted it, is the
subject of him that took him. <hi>pag.</hi> 114.</p>
               <p>8. If the Soveraign banish the subject, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the banishment he is no subject. <hi>pag.</hi> 114.</p>
               <p>6. The obligation of subjects to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
is as long, and no longer then the power
lasteth, by which he is able to protect them. <hi>pag.</hi>
124.</p>
               <p>10. Whatever Promises or Covenants the
Soveraign makes, are void. <hi>pag.</hi> 89.</p>
               <p>11. He whose private interest is to be judged
in an assembly, may make as many friends as he
can; and tho he hires such friends with mony, yet
it is not injustice. <hi>pag. 122. cap. 22. part.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>12. The propriety which a subject hath in
his Lands, consisteth in a right to exclude all
other subjects from the use of them, and not to
exclude their Soveraign. <hi>pag. 128. cap.</hi> 24.
<hi>part.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:60912:101"/>
13. When the Soveraign commandeth a man
to do that which is against Law, the doing of it
is totally excus'd; when the Soveraign com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
any thing to be don against Law, the
command as to that particular fact is an abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Law. <hi>pag. 157. cap. 27. part.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>14. Tho the right of a Soveraign Monarch
cannot be extinguish'd by the act of another, yet
the obligation of the members may; for he that
wants protection, may seek it any where; and
when he hath it, is oblig'd (without fraudulent
pretence of having submitted himself out of
fear) to protect his Protector as long as he is
able. <hi>pag. 174. cap. 29. part.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>If upon the short reflexions we have made upon
these several Doctrines, as they lie scattered over
his Book, and involv'd in other Discourses, which
with the novelty administers some pleasure to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary
Reader, the contagion thereof be not enough
discover'd, and the ill consequence and ruine that
must attend Kings and Princes who affect such a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
as well as the misery insupportable to
Subjects who are compelled to submit to it; it may
be, the view of the naked Propositions by themselves,
without any other clothing or disguise of words, may
better serve to make them oqious to King and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and that the first will easily discern, to how high
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:60912:102"/>
a pinnacle of power soever he would carry him, he
leaves him upon such a Precipice, from whence the
least blast of Invasion from a Neighbor, or from
Rebellion by his Subjects, may throw him headlong
to irrecoverable ruine: and the other will as much
abhor an Allegiance of that temper, that by any mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
of their Prince they may be absolv'd from,
and cease to be Subjects, when their Soveraign hath
most need of their obedience. And surely if these
Articles of Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s Creed be the product of
right Reason, and the effects of Christian Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the great Turk may be look'd upon as the best
Philosopher, and all his Subjects as the best Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>

be to stir up revolt against the King, or him that
governeth by the Kings Autority, he that doth such
Miracles is not to be consider'd otherwise, then as sent
to make trial of their Allegiance,</hi> for he saies, those
words in the text <hi>revolt from the Lord your God, are
in this place equivalent to revolt from the King; for
they had made God their King by pact at the foot of
Mount</hi> Sina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: whereas <hi>Moses</hi> had no other credit
with the People, but by the Miracles which he
wrought in their presence, and in their sight; and
that which he did perswade them to, was to revolt
and withdraw themselves from the obedience of
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who was, during their abode in <hi>Egypt,</hi> the
only King they knew and acknowledged. So that
in Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s judgment the People might very
well have refused to believe him; and all those
Prophets afterwards who prophesied against seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of the Kings, ought to have bin put to death; and
the Argumentation against the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> was
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:60912:103"/>
very well founded, when the Princes said unto the
King, <hi>Ier. 38. 4. We beseech thee let this man be
put to death, for thus he weakeneth the hands of the
men of war,</hi> when he declar'd that the City should
surely be given into the hands of the King of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
But Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> is much concern'd to weaken the
credit of Prophets, and of all who succeed in their
places; and he makes great use of that Prophets being
deceiv'd by the old Prophet <hi>in the first of Kings,</hi>
when he was seduced to eat and drink with him.
Whereas he might have known, that that Prophet
was not so much deceiv'd by an other, as by his
own willfulness, in closing with the temtation of
refreshing himself by eating and drinking; chusing
rather to believe any man of what quality soever, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the express command that he had received
from God himself.</p>
               <p>What his design was to make so unnecessary an
enquiry into the Authors of the several parts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
and the time when they were written, and
his more unnecessary inference, that <hi>Moses</hi> was not
the Author of the five Books which the Christian
World generally believe to be written by him, tho
the time of his death might be added afterwards
very warrantably, and the like presumtion upon the
other Books, he best knows; but he cannot wonder
that many men, who observe the novelty and posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveness
of his assertions, do suspect, that he found it
necessary to his purpose, first to lessen the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
that was accustom'd to be paid to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
themselves, and the autority thereof, before he
could hope to have his interpretation of them
hearken'd unto, and received; and in order to that,
to allow them no other autority, but what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:60912:104"/>
from the Declaration of the King; so that in
every Kingdom there may be several, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Books of Scripture; which their Subjects must
not look upon as Scripture, but as the Soveraign
power declares it to be so; which is to shake or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
overthrow all the reverence and submission
which we pay unto it, as the undoubted word of
God, and to put it in the same scale with the <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi>
which hath as much autority by the stamp
which the Grand <hi>Signior</hi> puts upon it in all his
Dominion; and all the differences and Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
which have grown between the several Sects of
<hi>Mahometans,</hi> which are no fewer in number, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
with less animosity between them, then
the disputes between Christians in matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
have all proceeded from the several glosses
upon, and readings of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
or tolerated by the several Princes in their
respective Dominions, they all paying the same sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
and reverence to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> but differing
much in what he hath said and directed; and by this
means the Grand <hi>Signior,</hi> and the <hi>Persian,</hi> and the
petty Princes under them, have run into those
Schisms, which have given Christianity much ease
and quiet. This is a degree of impiety Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>
was not arrived at when he first published his Book
<hi>de Cive,</hi> where tho he allowed his Soveraign power to
give what Religion it thought fit to its Subjects, he
thought it necessary to provide it should be Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
which was a caution too modest for his <hi>Leviathan.</hi>
Nor can it be preserved, when the Scriptures, from
whence Christianity can only be prov'd and taught
to the people, are to depend only for the validity
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, upon the will, understanding, and auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:60912:104"/>
of the Prince, which (with all possible submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
reverence, and resignation to that Earthly
power, and which I do with all my heart acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
to be instituted by God himself, for the good
of mankind) hath much greater dignity in it self,
and more reverence due to it, then it can receive
from the united Testimony and Declaration of all
the Kings and Princes of the World. With this
bold Prologue of the uncertain Canon of Scripture,
he takes upon him as the foundation of his true rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocination
(pag. 207.) <hi>to determine out of the Bible
the meaning of such words, as by their ambiguity may</hi>
(he saies) <hi>render what he is to infer upon them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
and disputable.</hi> And with this licence he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes
to give such unnatural explanations, descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions,
and definitions to several words and terms,
which in themselves have no difficulty, as disturbs
the whole Analogy of Scripture, and exposes those
expressions, which are dictated by the spirit of God,
in his light and comical interpretations, to the
mirth of those who are too much inclin'd to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
with the Scripture, and to the scandal of all men
who are piously affected, and look upon the Sacred
Writings with that devotion that becomes them.
And upon these foundations, with much more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
then any of the Primitive Fathers of the
Church assum'd to themselves, he proceeds to the
interpretation of several Texts of Scripture, in a
diferent sense from what those Fathers, and all
other men but himself, have understood them to
signify.</p>
               <p>I shall not therefore, as I said, wait upon him in
the particular Survey of his glosses upon, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations
of the several Texts of Scripture, with
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:60912:105"/>
which he is bold, not only for my own incompeten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in those high Mysteries, but because I am not sure
that it is a work fit for the most accomplish'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in the knowledg of Tongues, and the most dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
points of Divinity, to undertake, and to argue
and contend with him upon, and to answer his vain
and light conceptions; lest the sobriety and gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Scripture be too much exposed to the critical
Licence of Grammarians, or the greater licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of petulant and profane Persons, who chuse
the Scripture for both the matter, and the language
for the argument of their common and loosest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses;
which exorbitancy is much propagated
since the publication of Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> his Writings.
And therefore it may be fitter for a general disappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
and discountenance by the Soveraign power,
or Ecclesiastical autority, as a discourse which intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
a corruption of manners in the minds of men,
and exposes Religion to the irreverent examination
of dissolute persons, and prostitutes the sacred my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of our Faith, the Incarnation of our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Lord and Saviour, the Trinity, the Sacraments,
the precious pledges of our Salvation, to a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical
and Mathematical inquisition; and under
the notion of translating proper and significant
words and terms, in the understanding whereof all
Learned men have agreed, into vulgar and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Language, which no terms of any Art ever ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
hath in truth traduced the whole Scheme
of Christianity into Burlesque, and rais'd concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of it, very much inferiour to the sublime im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
of that profession which must carry us to
Heaven. It will hardly be believed that Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>
intended to advance the estimation and resignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:60912:105"/>
that is due from mankind to the everlasting
word of God, when he took such impertinent pains
to enquire (Cha. 36.) and examine, what the word of
God is, and to exercise his fancy in many inferences,
deductions, and distinctions upon several texts of
Scripture, where that expression (the word of God)
is used, and in the understanding whereof there was
never before any difficulty conceiv'd to be. And
there could no benefit accrue to the People, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
a criticism to them, whereby they
must believe (pag. 223.) <hi>that God spake these words
and said,</hi> are less Gods words then <hi>I am the Lord
thy God,</hi> as if the last could have a due efficacy and
regard, if they all are not understood to be spoken by
him. In which kind of unnecessary Learning and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity
he seems to recreate himself upon all the
Texts of Scripture, which he thinks fit to apply to
his use, and in which he takes much pains to mend
many expressions in Scripture, for the improprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Speech, without accusing the translation; as
these words of <hi>Eliah</hi> to God, 1 Kings 18. 36. <hi>I have
don all these thy words,</hi> which he saies <hi>are instead of</hi>
(which, I suppose he means, would be better) (pag.
223.) <hi>I have don all these things at thy word,</hi> and the
like upon many other sayings of the Prophets.</p>
               <p>Since after all his learned examination, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ratiocination, and too light a mention of the
several parts of Scripture, and the Authors thereof,
he is at last compell'd to confess, that (p. 204.) <hi>he sees
not any reason to doubt, but that the old and new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as we have them now, are the true Registers of
those things which were don and said by the Prophets
and Apostles;</hi> (p. 205.) <hi>and that it is believ'd on all
hands, that the first, and original Author of them
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:60912:106"/>
is God;</hi> it is to be wish'd that he had chosen rather
to have acquiesc'd under the modest and prudent
resolution of his third Paragraph of this Chapter,
that when any thing is written in the Scripture
too hard for our examination, we are bidden to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptivate
our understanding to the words, and not to
labour in sifting out a Philosophical truth by Logic
of such mysteries as are not comprehensible, nor fall
under any rule of natural Science; because he saies
very well, (p. 195.) <hi>that it is with the mysteries of our
Religion, as with wholsome pills for the sick, which
swallowed whole have the virtue to cure, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for the most part cast up again without effect:</hi> I say,
it is great pitty that he had not rather rested un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that sober consideration, then embark'd himself,
in the two next Chapters, in a Sea of new and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
interpretations of several texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
without any other autority then of his own
ungovern'd fancy, which can only amuse men with
the novelty into impertinent enquiries, or dispose
them to believe, that he hath not that reverence to
the Scripture, or adoration of the Author of it,
that would become him to have.</p>

               <p>WHEN he had exercis'd his unruly fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and imagination, upon making it as
doubtful what is Scripture, and the
sense and meaning thereof as difficult, as he was
able to do, he proceeds in the two next Chapters
(the thirty fifth and thirty sixth) to the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the true signification of many words, terms,
and expressions us'd in all Theological discourses,
what the meaning of Kingdom of God, of Holy,
and Sacred, of the Word of God, and of Prophets
is, upon the interpretation of which there hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yet bin any doubt made, or controversy amongst
Christians. And after the whole foundation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion is laid upon the Word of God, and so
often mention throughout the Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of several
particular words spoken by God, and with such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratory
circumstances, that he is said to have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
face to face, and as a man speaks to his friend,
as he did to <hi>Moses,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> takes great pains to
make it believ'd, that he never spake at all, and then
we can have none of his words; in which, whatever
other intention he hath, he declines his own rule,
which he had prescrib'd in the foregoing Chapters,
<hi>to captivate his understanding to the words, and not to
labour in sifting out a Philosophical truth by Logic
of such mysteries as are not comprehensible, nor fall
under any Rules of natural Science.</hi> Nor is it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that he had a purpose to raise more venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60912:107"/>
towards the holy Prophets recorded in the sacred
story, when he took such pains to examine the Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology
of their title and appellation, which he saies,
(pag 224.) <hi>sometimes signifies a foreteller of things to
come, and sometimes one that speaketh incoherently, as
men that are distracted,</hi> and thence goes to their
commission, and qualification, how they came to
know the will and pleasure of God. And when he
hath brought their title as low as he thinks fit, and
their qualifications as mean, he is contented that the
name of a Prophet (pag. 225.) <hi>may be given not
improperly to them, that in Christian Churches have
a calling to say public Praiers for the Congregation.</hi>
But that they may not be too much exalted with
the vocation, he allows prophecy to <hi>signify that
which Women may do in the Church:</hi> and at last
is content that the Heathen Poets shall likewise be
called Prophets: all which he concludes from seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
texts of Scripture, which he chuses to make use
of. What man of a sincere and pious heart, could
in order to contradict the literal sense of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
and Argument of the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> and
which may well be understood literally, <hi>Shall he that
made the eie, not see? and he that made the ear,
not hear?</hi> controul it by such an instance as would
be little less then Blasphemy to repete? and to
which I shall only apply a sage saying of his own
(pag. 34.) <hi>that an Anatomist, or a Physician may speak
or write his judgment of unclean things, because it is not
to please but profit; but for another man to write his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
and pleasant fancies of the same, is, as if a man
from being tumbled in the dirt, should come and present
himself before good company;</hi> an animadversion he will
do well to remember upon many occasions wherein
he transgresses it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:60912:107"/>
What his design was by torturing so many Texts
of Scripture, to make it believ'd, that the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Prophets in the old Testament took
no other notice of the word of God, nor had any
other knowledg of it then from apparitions, and
dreams, that is to say, (pag. 227.) <hi>from the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which they had in their sleep or in an extasy,</hi> may
well be suspected, when he contributes so little to
advance the reverence that is due to Gods Word, or
the honour that is due to the memory of those
Saints, the Prophets; neither the one, or the other
being in any degree improved, to say no worse of
it, by the whole discourse of that his first Chapter:
in which he thinks he hath said enough to perswade
his disciples, from so many Texts of Scripture, and
his commentaries upon them, that the Soveraign
power is the Soveraign Prophet, who hath under
God the Autority to govern the People, and that
they are bound to observe for a rule (pag. 232.) <hi>that
Doctrine which he hath commanded to be taught, and
thereby to examine, and try the truths of those Doctrines
which pretended Prophets with miracle, or without, shall
at any time advance.</hi> And it is the more observable,
that he gave this Soveraign power to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and
annex'd to it this Soveraign Prophesy, that he might
establish his Throne for ever. Nor could he have
in all this any intention so opposite to his purposes,
as when he had subjected all Laws to his Sword
without any violation of justice, to subdue the
Gospel too, to the same arbitriment, that he might
reform the one, as he had don the other. And the
rather, because, tho the Law was quiet, whilst his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
power proceeded according to his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
without any controul, yet the Gospel was
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:60912:108"/>
troublesome to him by the noise of his own Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
who had interpreted the Scripture according to
his own spirit, and purposes, whilst the contest was
with the King; but now found that all his own
designs, and assuming the Soveraignty himself, was
expresly against the word of God: and they found
so much credit with the people, that they had so long
deluded, that he foresaw a storm coming against him
that he could hardly ride out. And therefore Mr.
<hi>Hobbes</hi> brought him a very seasonable relief, in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a doubt, when novelties were so much in request,
and the minds of the People so well prepar'd to
hearken to what they had never before heard of,
whether there were any such thing as the word of
God, at least that that was not it which they took to
be so; and that if the ten Commandments were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to his sense, yet that they were not words
spoken by him: and then in bringing the autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and qualifications of the Prophets themselves so
low, that there was room enough left to doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were alwaies in the right. From whence
he might easily expose his Enemies, who succeed
them in the office of informing and instructing them
in the Laws, and good pleasures of God, as men
without a lawful mission, and autority to pronounce
those things they do. And upon those weighty rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
he takes upon him to advise the People, to be
very circumspective, (pag. 230.) <hi>and wary in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the voice of man, that pretending himself to be a
Prophet requires us to obey God in that way, which he in
Gods name tells us is the way to happiness, For he in
that pretends to govern them, that is to say, to rule, and
reign over them, which is a thing that all men naturally
desire, and is therefore worthy to be suspected of Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:60912:108"/>
and imposture, and consequently ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd,
and tried by every man, before he yields
them obedience.</hi> And having thus deprav'd the rule,
the Word of God, by which they were to walk, and
vilified the Preachers, who are to instruct them how
they may observe that Rule, he hath enough amuz'd
them, to refer them for a complete and perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
and satisfaction to his Soveraign power,
who is his Soveraign Prophet, that is <hi>Cromwell</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
to be told by him what they are to believe, and
what they are to do, and to conform themselves
thereunto, and, in his absence, to what they shall be
directed by those who are autoriz'd by him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
them, it being reasonably to be presum'd, that
they are (p. 232.) <hi>men, to whom God hath given a part
of the Spirit of their Soveraign.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I wish with all my heart that it were within my
comprehension, how Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> can be absolv'd
from this naughty and impious discourse, since he
could not hope thereby to render himself gracious
to any other Soveraign upon Earth; since they all
detest the power he would invest them with, as a
means to extirpate Christian Religion out of their
Dominions, which depends solely upon the universal
veneration to the Scripture; upon which, if secular,
and politic interests did not fan a small Fire (that
would easily be extinguish'd) into a flame, there are
not in sixteen hundred years, many such differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
grown in the interpretation thereof, as must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
any pious believer from Heaven, if in his life
he carefully observes those Precepts, in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
whereof every man of all parties agrees.
Nor hath he therein gratified the Pope himself, who
is willing to embrace all encroachments by which he
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:60912:109"/>
may be a gainer, and uses his faculty of interpreting,
to purposes monstrous enough, yet he pretends not
to make what he pleases Canonical Scripture. If the
Clergy, whose learning is approved, and whose man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
are blameless, are not fit to instruct the People,
whither shall they repair for information? There may
be some ignorant men amongst them, who them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
need to be instructed; and yet there is a
Classis of men, who may learn much even from
them, if they are honest men. And there may
be some seditious amongst them, who maliciously
pervert the Scripture, and corrupt those who should
be taught by them: but as there are Laws very
strict for the punishment of such, so none are more
glad to see those punishments inflicted, or forwarded
to promote it, then the venerable part of their own
order, whose known abilities ought not to be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd,
nor their integrity suspected for the infamy of
the other. God was never well serv'd, nor the King
religiously obeied, when, and where the Clergy was
despis'd, or undervalued.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> is so much delighted with his institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Covenant, that he will not suffer God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to have a Dominion over the Children of Israel
(pag. 217.) <hi>but under an institution by pact,</hi> which
he saies, <hi>is an addition to his ordinary title to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
Indeed that their obligations to his Divine
Majesty were increased by his communication of
himself, and his gracious promises to them above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nations, is very true: but that he should there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
have a greater dominion over them then he had
over the whole Earth besides, is not easy to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood;
tho he makes that assumtion the ground-work
of the greatest part of his discourse and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocination,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:60912:109"/>
contain'd throughout this his Third
part. Only whereas the security of his Soveraign
consists only in the Covenants between the people
to one another, without any obligation from the
Soveraign to them; this Soveraignty which he
hath provided for God Almighty, is more perfect,
and depends upon the Covenant which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
first entred into; and then the Contract en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into on their part, like the sealing the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-part,
which he draws up as formally between
them, as he did the transferring and assigning each
others right in the former establishment: and all this
Transaction he makes good by the express words
of Scripture. No man can now blame him for wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for such a Soveraign, who would take the Bible
from every other body, and put it into his hand, with
a Commission to interpret it. But till he had gotten
that delegation, he should have forborn making such
a story out of the 17 of <hi>Genesis,</hi> 7. 8. (pag. 216.)
<hi>of a Covenant on Gods part,</hi> and I know not what
<hi>contract and promise on</hi> Abrahams <hi>part,</hi> that must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
a neerer relation, and give God a greater pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
over them then he had before; whereas there was
nothing like a promise from God to <hi>Abraham</hi>
of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for an everlasting possession, in
the 17 of <hi>Genesis,</hi> which he had not made to him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years before. He might have found the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
promise in the 12 Chapter, when God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him to go out of his Country, and from his
Kindred, and then premis'd to make of him a great
Nation, to bless them that blessed him, and to curse
them that cursed him, and (which was greater then
all the rest) that in him should all the Families of the
Earth be blessed. <hi>Abraham</hi> makes no reply, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:60912:110"/>
the command left his Country, and departed from
<hi>Haran,</hi> when he was seventy five years old, and took
his journy towards the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and passed
through the Land unto the place of <hi>Sichem,</hi> unto the
plain of <hi>Moreh;</hi> and the <hi>Canaanite</hi> was then in the
Land. Which expression so natural to the relation,
and History, he thinks ground enough for him to
deny that <hi>Moses</hi> was author of the Book of <hi>Genesis,</hi>
because that expression (he saies,) (pag. 200.) <hi>must
be the words of one that wrote when the</hi> Canaanite <hi>was
not in the Land;</hi> which is an inference without shadow
of reason. When he was in the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi>
God appear'd to him again, and said, <hi>Vnto thy Seed
will I give this Land.</hi> And he was then by a famine
driven into <hi>Egypt:</hi> and so much time passed, that
when he return'd towards <hi>Bethel</hi> from whence he went
into <hi>Egypt,</hi> his riches were so much increased, that
<hi>Lot</hi> and he were compelled to part, that they might
have more room to live in. And then God appear'd
again to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and said, <hi>Lift up thine eies, and
look from the place where thou art,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For all the
Land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to
thy Seed for ever,</hi> when he had yet no seed. After
his Sacrifice he appear'd to him again, and it is said
made a Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> saying no more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the matter then he had promis'd before, only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
the extent of the Land that he would give
to his Seed, from the river of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to the great
river, the river <hi>Euphrates.</hi> What did God promise
more to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and what farther Covenant was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into between them, in this 17. Chap. when <hi>Mr.
Hobbes</hi> dates the Covenant, when <hi>Abraham</hi> was nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
nine years old, then he had don four and twenty
years before, and what did <hi>Abraham</hi> do more then he
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:60912:110"/>
had don before, towards any contract on his part?
It is true that God enjoined him, that every man-child
amongst them should be circumcis'd, which is
his (pag. 217.) <hi>old Covenant.</hi> And it is true, <hi>Abraham,</hi>
and his Seed did so punctually observe that injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that the omission thereof was never imputed to
them, and so could not be the cause of any of the
calamities they sustain'd afterwards for four hundred
years in <hi>Egypt,</hi> or after their deliverance, when their
miseries at worst little exceeded, what they may be
thought to have suffer'd there. Where he found that
Dialogue between God and <hi>Abraham</hi> that makes the
Covenant mutual, other men know not.</p>
               <p>There is no inconvenience, nor would it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous
to suppose, that <hi>Abraham</hi> upon such an
immense benefit, and honour promised to him by
God, and so often repeted to him, did make some
humble acknowledgment, and promise of duty,
and obedience on his part. And it appears he did
whatsoever he was commanded, and assoon as he
was commanded: he left his Country, to live amongst
strangers; enjoin'd circumcision, and observ'd all
that he was commanded, to obtain a great reward
that his Posterity was to receive five hundred years
after: but for any man to digest this obedience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a style and method of words, to no other end,
but to establish a new extravagant fancy of his own,
and that he may thereby create a peculiar Kingdom
for God, more then his illimited power over the
universe had intitled him to, and put a new inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
upon the Kingdom of God, so often us'd
in Scripture, as if thereby is properly, and only meant
the Commonwealth of the <hi>Iews</hi> (pag. 218) <hi>insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
by the consent of those who were to be Subject
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:60912:111"/>
thereunto for their civil Government, and regulating
their behaviour towards God their King,</hi> whom they
rejected and depos'd when they demanded a King
from <hi>Samuel;</hi> and to confirm this by so many glos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
upon several Texts of Scripture, is worthy on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the confidence of the Author of the <hi>Leviathan.</hi>
But he will make all this good when he comes to
Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> where, he saies, this Covenant was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed.
There indeed, after all their murmurings for
Bread, and for Flesh, and for Water, that they might
not imagine that all the Promises which God had
made to their Fore-fathers, gave them a Title to the
continuance of their Protection and Blessing, in
spight of all their back-sliding and Rebellion, and as
a Preface to his Ten Commandments, and the Law
which he then publish'd to them, God commanded
<hi>Moses</hi> to put them in mind of the great Deliverances
he had wrought for them, &amp; to tell them, that if they
would obey his voice indeed, and keep his Covenant,
then they should be a peculiar Treasure unto him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all people, and they should be unto him a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Priests, an holy Nation; the natural significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereof, according to all Interpreters, is, that he
would in a more peculiar maner make himself known
to them, by giving them Laws whereby they might
know how to please him, and assigning them a Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
to offer such Sacrifices for them to him, as
would be acceptable. And their answering together,
All that the Lord hath spoken we will do, and what
they said afterwards to <hi>Moses</hi> in the fright and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation
they were in upon the Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
from the Mount, Speak thou to us and we will
hear, but let not God speak with us least we die, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
no more upon the matter, then the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:60912:111"/>
which they had often made before upon their
recollection after their several loud transgression.
God was not from that time more gracious to them,
or reckoned them more his own chosen people, then
before, when he fed them with <hi>Manna</hi> and <hi>Quailes,</hi>
nor did they think that they had entred into a new
and stricter obligation to him: as appears by their
making the <hi>Golden calf,</hi> and worshipping it so soon
after, even before God had finish'd his speaking to
them. So that the Contract on their behalf, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
God himself was more their King then he had bin
formerly, or they more the Kingdom of God then
they were before, is drawn up only by Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
three thousand years after the transaction.</p>

               <p>I should make no reflexion upon the thirty seventh
Chapter of Miracles, and their use (tho it may

to his Soveraign, he did not make him the sole
Judg of all Miracles which shall be wrought within
his Dominions: and in this extasie of his Allegiance,
in spight of all the Demonstrations he hath made in

                  </gap>tes, of the absurdity, contradiction, and
impossibility in the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctrine of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he very frankly bestows upon the King the
sole power of determining the Point of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation;
which if he concludes in the Affirmative,
no Subject must presume to contradict it. By which
he hath made the Pope, and the Roman Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
for the many merry reproches he hath cast
upon them, in allowing it to be good Divinity in all
those Dominions where the Soveraign is Popish, and
of which no private reason or conscience, but the
public reason, the reason of the King is Judg. And
tho he preserves to himself, and other private
men, the prerogative of believing or not believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his heart, because thought is free, yet that
must not be discover'd, because he makes it the
obligation of Subjects, not only to do, but to say all
that their Soveraign commands them to say or do;
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:60912:112"/>
by which he introduces such a licence of dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and hypocrisie, as is odious in the civil actions
of our life, but most detestable in the eies and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God and Man, in all acts which concern
Religion, and the Worship of his Divine Majesty.
And it is very reasonably to be doubted, that this loose
determination in matters of Faith, by a man who is
thought to have digged very deep in all the Mines of
Natural Reason, hath contributed very much to that
uncontroulable spirit, which by the extravagance
of fancy, invention and imagination, hath made
such confusion both in the speculation and practice
of Religion in this distracted Kingdom; and by his
making that which God hath manifestly command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
liable to be controul'd, or to receive autority
from the pleasure of the King, that both God and
the King are less reverenced, and their Precepts less
regarded, then they have us'd to be in this Nation.</p>
               <p>That he may the better draw himself out of those
intricacies into which he is involved by this unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary

of Logic too, he makes good by as strange
an Argument: <hi>It must be by virtue of some natural
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:60912:113"/>
Science, or by Incantation; if it be by their own power
independent, there is some power that proceedeth not from
God, which all men deny. and if they do it by power
given them, then is the work not from the immediate hand
of God, but natural, and consequently no Miracle,</hi> which
is agreeable to his Definition. But if it be by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of God, why is it natural, and therefore no
Miracle? Hath not God frequently permitted the
Devil to do Miracles? and if his Providence did
not restrain him, he would work Miracles enough
to do more mischief. And if the Devil turn'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into the Serpent, or taught the Serpent so to
speak like an Orator, for the seduction and cozen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of poor <hi>Eve,</hi> neither was natural, and cannot
be look'd upon as less then a Miracle; which hath
furnish'd a Modern fanciful Divine with an excuse
for <hi>Eves</hi> being deluded, that not imagining a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
could speak, and having never heard of the
Devil, she concluded it to be an Angel, whom she
knew God had created. And now he finds, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to his former confession, (pag. 236.) <hi>That the
Magicians of</hi> Egypt <hi>were Impostors, and did no great
matter, for that when the rod seem'd a Serpent, or the
waters Blood, because it was not to the edification of Gods
people,</hi> which his definition requires, <hi>nor the rod, nor
the water was enchanted, but the Spectator: so that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
consisted only in this, that the Enchanter had deceiv'd
a man, which is no Miracle.</hi> And so <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his
whole Court, who were the Spectators, and are
thought to have understood as much of Natural
Causes, as any who have succeeded them, and
from that excess of understanding, believ'd God the
less, as they still do who look too much into Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

               <p>WHEN the Wisdom of God himself hath

Religion, and the propagation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and to defend it from being invaded by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneness
and Atheism, the one of Heaven, for
the reward of those who serve him with devotion and
integrity; and the other of Hell, for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and terror of those who neglect his commands,
and contemn his menaces: and when all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
in the Old, and the Evangelists and Apostles
in the New Testament, have even contended to make
the joies of the one as great and everlasting, and the
pains of the other as insupportable and eternal, as
their sacred faculties could enable them to do, that
men might be allured to chuse that which is so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
and to tremble at that which is so terrible: and
that most of the Fathers of the Church, and all the
Doctors and Preachers of Christianity (of how dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Opinions soever in other Points of Faith)
have still prosecuted the same method, as the best
Argument to dispose men to virtue, and the love of
God, and to restrain them from vice, as the way that
leads to the Devil: it may appear very wonderful,
and no less scandalous to dis-passioned men, that
after sixteen hundred years Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> should arise a
new Evangelist, to make the joies of Heaven more
indifferent, and the pains of Hell less formidable,
then ever any Christian hath before attemted to do,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:60912:115"/>
by impertinent inquiries where the place of either of
them is to be, as if he would be well content that
they should be no where, and to determine by Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical
mediums, that there can be no eternity of
pain in the one, how lasting soever the joies may be
in the other. I do not complain of his bringing
down Heaven to the Earth, nor his raising and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Hell upon the same level, in which some Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men seem not to differ much from him, tho it
seems to me to be contradicted by the very words
and expression of the Creation. For if God <hi>divided
the waters that were above the firmament, from the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that were under the firmament, and the waters under
the firmament became dry Land, and was Earth, and the
firmament was called Heaven,</hi> Gen. 1. it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable,
that the Heaven and the Earth can be upon
one and the same level. Which seems likewise to be
oppos'd by that Text, <hi>But those that seek my soul to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
it, shall go into the lower parts of the Earth,</hi> Psal.
63. 9. which implies somwhat that is deeper then the
grave, and at least, that Hell is either under the
Earth, or that it cannot be understood that it is upon
the same level with Heaven, if it could descend to
keep Court upon the Earth; which yet methinks
receiv'd a greater confirmation by St. <hi>Paul, Now
that he ascended, what is it, but that he also descended
first into the lower parts of the Earth?</hi> Eph. 4. 9.</p>
               <p>Let the place be where it will, we know Gods ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
and residence in the one, must make it as
glorious as any body hath conceiv'd it to be; and
his absence, and hot displeasure, must make the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as painful. Nor am I concern'd in his assigning
Christs Reign to be upon the Earth; which as it was
an opinion that had many partizans in the first Ages
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:60912:115"/>
of Christianity, so it seems to get much ground in
the minds of many Learned Men in the present;
tho he makes his Reign longer upon Earth then ever
the Millenarians imagin'd it to be, and indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
him to it for ever. But that Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> should
perswade men to believe, (<hi>pag.</hi> 240.) that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven is <hi>nothing else, but the Kingdom of
the King that dwelleth in Heaven,</hi> by which he is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
already as much in Heaven as he desires to be;
and (<hi>pag.</hi> 243.) that all <hi>that is said in the Scripture
concerning hell-fire, is spoken metaphorically, and that
a proper sense should be enquired after (since all Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors
may be expressed in proper words) both of the place
of hell, and the nature of the torments and tormentors,</hi>
methinks it should be thought a matter of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
as is more fit to be confuted by censure
and chastisement, then by refelling the Arguments
of his presumtion. In the mean time, as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses

a Faith never before own'd or avowed by any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
may make men wonder why he is so severe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Atheists, whom he will not allow (<hi>pag.</hi> 186.) to
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:60912:116"/>
be <hi>Subjects in the Kingdom of God; nor they that believe
not that God hath any care of the actions of man kind,
because they acknowledg no word for his, nor have hope
of his rewards, or fear of his threatning. They</hi> (he
saies) <hi>that believe there is a God that governs the World,
and hath given precepts, and propounded rewards and
punishments to man-kind, are Gods Subjects; all the rest
are to be understood as enemies:</hi> whereas in truth,
there is very little difference between a man that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
no Precepts of his, and him who believes
those to be his Precepts or his Permissions, which
are contrary to his Commandments; or between
those who have no hope of his reward, or fear of his
threatnings, and those who believe, and perswade o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to believe, that the rewards which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
are of much less value then they are es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed
to be, and the punishment which he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,
to be less terrible, and of shorter duration then
they are understood; and take upon them to suspend
the inflicting of any punishment at all upon the
greatest sinner until the end of the World, by the
mortality of the Soul, equal to that of the Body,
and so to undergo no farther trouble till they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
united in the Resurrection; and even then not
to be in so ill a condition, as most men apprehend,
which is a consolation wicked men stand not in need
of, and which no Christian Casuist, before Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi>
ever presum'd to administer. And he may find, for
the support of his Atheists, who should not be so
churlishly abandon'd by him, as many pregnant Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
against Christianity, and as rationally pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and as many Texts of Scripture, as well of the
New as the Old Testament, as appositely urg'd to
maintain their Doctrine, as any which are made use
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:60912:116"/>
of by him for the propagation of his Opinions
little less dangerous.</p>
               <p>He is the first man (since <hi>Virgil</hi> accompanied <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi>
thither) that hath taken pains so accuratly to
rescue and vindicate Hell from the prejudice that men
might have to it, from some expressions they find
in Scripture relating to it; which he endeavors, by
his Interpretations, to make not altogether so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
as they are generally understood to be. And
least any apprehension of the bottomless pit should
too much amuse men, he do's assure them, from his
Art in which he would be thought to excel, (<hi>pag.</hi>
243.) <hi>That in the Globe of the Earth, which is not only
finite, but also (compar'd to the heighth of the stars) of
no considerable magnitude, a pit without a bottom, that
is, a hole of infinite depth, is a thing the proportion of
Earth to Heaven cannot bear:</hi> which perfection of
Science enabled him to discover, that if <hi>Adam</hi> had
not eaten of the Apple, he had bin immortal; and
had he never died (of which he makes not the least
question) he should not then continually have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created
his kind, (pag. 239.) <hi>for if immortals should
have generated as man-kind doth now, the Earth in a
small time would not have bin able to afford them place to
stand on.</hi> Besides, there being other places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
which he cites, to imply, that the place of
Hell is under water; so, besides the comfort that is
in the uncertainty, they need the less fear the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless
pit; and he doth at last free them from the
waters too, and the company that makes the waters
the more unpleasant. St. <hi>Iohn</hi> thought he had ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
some Classes of sinners to the purpose, when
he declar'd, <hi>That they should have their part in the
lake that burneth with fire and brimstone.</hi> Apoc. 21. 8.
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:60912:117"/>
But for their comfort Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> assures them, (<hi>pag.</hi>
243.) that all that is but a Metaphorical expression,
<hi>and signifies not any certain kind or place of torment;</hi> and
gives them another Text to raise their spirits, <hi>That
death and hell were cast into the lake of fire,</hi> (pag. 243.)
that is, he saies, <hi>abolish'd and destroied; as if after
the day of Iudgment there shall be no more dying, nor no
more going into Hell,</hi> which must be very comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Doctrine to those whom he had before secur'd
till that time, by the not existence and nothingness
of the Soul after its dissolution from the Body. So
that he had don well, that there might some fear still
have remain'd in them, to have told them, That it
is the opinion of very Learned Men, that the day
of Judgment it self is to last one thousand years.
That the darkness which St. <hi>Matthew</hi> attributes to it,
and which makes the most beautiful place the less
pleasant, may not make them think Hell a worse
place then in truth it is, he tells them, that tho the
Translation hath rendered it <hi>into utter darkness,</hi> the
Original will not bear it, (pag. 243.) <hi>and do's not si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie
how great, but where that darkness is to be, namely,
without the habitation of Gods elect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the careful Inquisitions which he makes into
the torments of Hell, and into the Tormentors, he
finds the Devil hath wrong don him, by not having
his names of <hi>Satan, Devil,</hi> and <hi>Abaddon,</hi> translated
into English, by which he conscientiously doubts,
that men imagining them to be proper names of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi>
may be seduc'd to believe the Doctrine of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
which was the Religion of the Gentiles; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
those hard words are not proper Names, but Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations,
which only set out the office and quality,
as Satan only signifies the Enemy, Devil accuser,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:60912:117"/>
Abaddon the Destroier. So that Heaven being to
be after the Resurrection upon the Earth (which he
saies he hath shew'd by Scripture that it is like to be)
(pag. 244.) <hi>Hell must likewise be upon the Earth too;
and so by Satan, is meant any earthly Enemy of the
Church;</hi> and that the torments of Hell, which are
express'd in Scripture by weeping, and gnashing of
teeth, by the worm of conscience, fire, where the worm
dies not, and the fire is not quenched, and by shame
and everlasting contemt, do but metaphorically si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie
(p. 244.) <hi>a grief and discontent of mind, from the
sight of the eternal felicity of others; and that they are
to suffer such bodily pains and calamities as are incident
to those, who not only live under evil and cruel Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
but have also for Enemy, God Almighty.</hi> But as
to the duration of the bodily pains, tho the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
is clear for an universal Resurrection, (<hi>pag.</hi>
244.) yet there is no <hi>promise to any reprobate of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
life,</hi> without which he can never undergo an
eternal punishment. Nor can a second death be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
applied to those that can die but once, he saies,
(<hi>pag.</hi> 245.) tho <hi>the fire prepared for the wicked, is an
everlasting fire, and the fire shall be unquenchable, and
the torments everlasting; it cannot therefore be inferr'd,
that he who shall be cast into that fire, or be tormented
with those torments, shall endure, and resist them so as
to be eternally burn'd and tortur'd, and yet never be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroied
nor d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

affirm everlasting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ire and torments (into which men
may be cast successively one after another for ever)
yet he finds none that affirms there shall be any eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life therein, of any individual Person; but to
the contrary, an everlasting death, which is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
death. And then he cites the Text in the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:60912:118"/>
whereby he saies, (pag. 245.) <hi>it is evident,
that there is to be a second death of every one that shall be
condemn'd at the day of Iudgment, after which he shall
die no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It cannot be denied, but that he hath taken ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
pains on the behalf of Hell, and it may
be presum'd, effectually, in making it believed, (pag.
243.) that <hi>the fire thereof is neither everlasting nor
unquencheable;</hi> and that the terribleness thereof hath
proceeded chiefly from the hard words it hath bin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
by, <hi>valley of Hinnon, Ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

have puzled and perplex'd mens imaginations, for
want of comprehension what those terms could im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
and which seem'd the more formidable in that
they had not found, and so might be thought inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of any translation; and therefore he hath don
them the favor to inform them of the worst that
they can signifie, and above all, for their comfort,
hath brought the place and situation of it to be upon
the Earth, which is so well known to them, that
they need have no other apprehensions of it then
they find reason for. And for the manifestation of
that important truth, he doth not so much depend
upon the Texts of Scripture which he hath cited to
that purpose, as that, he saies, he hath already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
out of divers evident places of Scripture, in his
thirty fifth Chapter (pag. 219.) <hi>That the Kingdom of
God is a civil Common-wealth, where God himself is So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,
by virtue first of the old, and since of the new
Covenant,</hi> which he saies doth sufficiently prove, that
after the coming again of our Saviour in his Majesty
and Glory, to reign actually and eternally, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God is to be on Earth; all which refers to
that Institution by pact, which by his Covenant with
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:60912:118"/>
                  <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the renewing thereof afterwards by
<hi>Moses</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> invested God by their chusing
him to be their King, with a more peculiar Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
then he had over any other Nation, because it
was by their own consent and Covenant; whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h he
saies, (pag. 217.) <hi>is an addition to his ordinary title to
all Nations:</hi> and that this continued, till by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
a King, when <hi>Saul</hi> was given to them, they
rejected God, that he should not reign over them. I

to judg whether what hath bin said in answer upon
that Chapter, and before, doth not weigh down the

and Contract. And for their rejection of

eminent and notorious from that time, as it
had bin from the time of <hi>Abraham</hi> to that of <hi>Saul;</hi>
nor were their rebellions and murmurings greater
after, then they had bin before: and then those two
Imaginations of his having place only in his own
brain, most of his Discourse in this his third part
falls to the ground with them, and is of no signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
               <p>When he hath made Hell much more easie, at least
in a pleasanter Region, and the pains thereof less
durable to all those who will chuse to go thither, he
is as solicitous to undeceive men in the high estimate
they have made of the joies of Heaven, and tells
them, (pag. 245.) that to be saved, which is salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:60912:119"/>
                  <hi>is to be secur'd either respectively against special e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
or absolutely against all evil, comprehending want,
sickness, and death it self.</hi> And least we should think
that this salvation contains some wonderful delight,
which we cannot comprehend, because we know not
the scene upon which it shall be shew'd; he is fully
of opinion, (pag. 246.) <hi>that this salvation must be on
Earth: for by salvation is set forth unto as, a glorious
reign of our King by conquest, not a safety by escape; and
therefore there where we look for salvation, we must look
also for triumph; and before triumph, for victory; and
before victory for battel, which cannot well be suppos'd to
be in Heaven.</hi> However, tho the reason seems very
good to him, he is so modest that he will not trust to
it, without very evident places of Scripture; and
thereupon, how positive soever he is against the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
understanding such places in Scripture, which
seem to imply an ascending into Heaven, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
them all to be Metaphorical Expressions; now,
that he may humble our salvation down to the earth,
he will have all those places of the Prophets which
he chuses, to be understood literally; by which he
saies it is evident, (pag. 246.) <hi>that Salvation shall be
on Earth, then when God shall reign (at the coming again
of Christ) in Ierusalem, and from Ierusalem shall proceed
the salvation of the Gentiles that shall be receiv'd into
Gods Kingdom.</hi> And then, with equal confidence,
he mentions other Texts out of the New Testament,
which he saies are clear (pag. 247.) <hi>that salvation,
and the Kingdom of God (after the day of Iudgment)
must be upon Earth:</hi> whereas he saies, <hi>He cannot find
any Text that can probably be drawn to prove any ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Saints into Heaven,</hi> which he seems to think
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:60912:119"/>
would be a presumtion, <hi>and that since Gods own Throne
is in Heaven, and the Earth is but his foot-stool, it would
not seem suitable to the dignity of so great a King, that
his Subjects should have any place as high as his Throne, or
higher then his foot-stool.</hi> And so making the last ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to lessen the value of our Redemtion, by making
a Grammatical enquiry into the signification of the
word, and low inferences thereupon, he concludes,
(<hi>pag.</hi> 245.) <hi>That the joies of life eternal, comprehended
all in Scripture under the name of Salvation, or being sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
is to be secur'd either respectively, against special e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
or absolutely against all evils, comprehending want,
sickness, and death it self;</hi> that is, when we are once
in Heaven we shall never want, nor be sick, nor die
again, which is a very vile expression of the joies of
life eternal.</p>
               <p>I will not deprive him of that Testimony his rare
modesty deserves, but acknowledg, (pag. 241.) <hi>that
he doth declare, because his Doctrine (tho proved out of
places of Scripture, not few nor obscure) will appear to
most a novelty, he did but propound it, maintaining no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in this, or any other Paradox in Religion, but attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the end of that dispute of the Sword concerning the
autority (not yet amongst his Country-men decided) by
which all sorts of Doctrine are to be approv'd or rejected,
and whose commands both in speech and writing (whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be the opinions of private men) must by all men, that
mean to be protected by the Laws, be obeied.</hi> This was
in the time when his fidelity and allegiance was by
his own rule extinguished by choice, for he was not
then in the Enemies Quarters, and no Sword drawn
but that in <hi>Cromwells</hi> hand, and in theirs who were
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:60912:120"/>
under his command; so that it was his single appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
and determination, that he waited, for the
promulgation of the Doctrine which he had so well
prov'd out of Scripture, and to him he sent this
blank, for the disposal of himself, body and soul,
according to his good will and pleasure. But I know
not how to excuse him since the Kings return, and
the resurrect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on of his Loialty (which is grown and
improv'd to that height, that he will deny his Saviour
upon his Command) for not retracting and renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
all those odious opinions, when he very well
knows, that the Church of which the King is So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,
doth detest all those his Doctrines, and not
concur in his interpretation of any of his Texts in
Scripture; and his not doing that which in Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
he is oblig'd to do, is a shrewd evidence that he
considers not, nor will be subject to any other Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,
then that of his own capricious brain, and
haughty understanding.</p>
               <p>I have so much kindness for Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> that I
heartily wish he would himself, or that some of his
Disciples would for him, inform the World what
good end he did, or could propose to himself in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
this his eight and thirtieth Chapter; or whether
he could imagine that Christianity, or any Christian
knowledg could be advanced by it. It seems to
me to be the greatest charity he can expect, to be
believed to be a man that believes nothing of the
immortality of the Soul, of the eternal Life, Hell,
Salvation, the World to come, and Redemtion,
which all other Christians do believe, and believe all
to be evident out of Scripture. Since it is a less fault
not to believe them, how destructive soever, then
to imagine that he takes all that pains, and uses all
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:60912:120"/>
that raillery upon the Scripture, to shew how liable
the Word of God it self is to be ill handled, and
perversly interpreted by a great and bold Wit. And
truly, he hath not bin disappointed in the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this desperate Art, which hath enabled his
most devoted Proselytes to apply Texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
to all their profane, impious, and unclean pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses;
and which, probably before they leave this
World, will give them a sad presage and prospect of
the next; the which can give them no reputation or
credit, except with persons pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>igate, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
to all kinds of vice and iniquity. Plain it is,
that he hath not endeavor'd to advance the practice
of any one Christian Virtue, or to improve the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of any one Moral Duty, to the end that the
lives of men may be more innocent, and thereby
their hopes more reasonable of eternal Life; as if
he were not willing to perswade men, by the strength
of his master Reason, to be better then they have a
mind to be, or to dis-countenance the practice of
those sins which unavoidably must carry them to
Hell, let the situation of it be where it will, (pag. 56.)
<hi>as Adultery, Sodomy, and any vice that may be taken for
an effect of power, or a cause of pleasure; all which vices
amongst men,</hi> he saies, <hi>are taken to be against Law, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then against honor:</hi> which since he hath discover'd,
he might for those wretches sake, very naturally
have interposed some powerful Animadversions in
this Chapter of Eternal Life, Hell, and Salvation.</p>

               <p>I have Charity enough to hope, that Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>
may have no worse design in this thirty ninth
Chapter, then can be made manifest out of his
words, which being plain, and yielding naturally a
good interpretation, I will not endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
them to a bad, but wish he had farther enlarged
upon the Subject, to shew with what absurdity the
word Church is applied to destroy Religion, as if
Christ had instituted one, and but one Church that
should have Autority to controul all the Christians
in the World. Which is a fancy (how successful so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever)
so extravagant and senseless, so far from coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
from Scripture, or Antiquity, so in it self
impossible, that nothing is more wonderful, then that
so unreasonable a pretence should gain so much
credit, as to impose upon so great a part of the
World so long: and which, tho it was not brought
in by, could never have bin brought in or grown
but under that barbarous Tyranny and inundation,
which by the incursion of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> and <hi>Vandalls,</hi>
and <hi>Hunns,</hi> and <hi>Lombards,</hi> who successively broke
in from the <hi>North,</hi> cover'd so great a part of Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endom
for so many hundred years. And it cannot
be denied, but that tho Spiritual, and temporal are
proper distinctions in the Government, when the
Soveraign, who is equal Soveraign over both, will
apply them to several functions in the Government,
and to that exercise of different parts, yet indeed they
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:60912:121"/>
have bin made use of in the World, (<hi>pag.</hi> 248.) <hi>to
make men see double, and to mistake their lawful So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign.</hi>

who think their Government securely established
under that distinction, whil'st any Subject professes
to owe a Spiritual, or any other kind of Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

the Implicite Faith which he prescribes by a mental
reservation, is so destructive to common honesty,
that it is not only unworthy of a Christian, but of a
moral man, who desires to live with any credit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
men; which we shall be obliged to enlarge
upon in another place, where he more confidently
calls for it, and therefore shall decline it here. And
God be thanked, no Christian Prince doth himself
believe, or wishes that his Subjects should believe,
that he is in <hi>Abrahams</hi> place, to be the sole Interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of what God hath spoken.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> is so much addicted to the sole obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of Contracts and Covenants, that he will
hardly allow God himself to have a title to our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
but by virtue of some Contract on his part,
and Covenant on ours; which that he may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
make good, he assumes a Jurisdiction to himself
to give what signification and interpretation he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to words, whether they have bin generally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
to signifie so, or no; without which he would
not have determin'd, that (<hi>pag.</hi> 250.) <hi>Moses had no
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:60912:123"/>
autority to command the children of</hi> Israel, <hi>nor they any
obligation to obey him, until in the terror of the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
and lightning, and the noise of the Trumpet, and
the smoaking of the mountain,</hi> they said unto <hi>Moses,</hi>
Exod. 20. 28. <hi>Speak thou with us, and we will hear,
but let not God speak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with us least we die;</hi> by which
he saies, (<hi>pag.</hi> 251.) <hi>they obliged themselves to obey
whatsoever he should deliver unto them for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
of God:</hi> whereas the most that can be
drawn from that engagement is, that they would
hear, and receive what he should say. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which, it doth not appear that they paid more
obedience to <hi>Moses,</hi> after this profession of theirs,
then they had don before; nor can it be imagin'd,
that the promise to <hi>Moses</hi> was more binding, then
all former obligations to God. And surely he who as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes
this licence of Interpreting, is much to blame
if he doth not make many places in Scripture to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie
what conduces to his purpose; and he may
from <hi>Moses</hi> having leave to go up into the Mount,
declare, not only that the Scriptures are the Mount,
and therefore that the Soveraign only may interpret
them, but that they may not be look'd into;
which would increase the Prerogative, and is as near
the signification and intention of the Text, as what
he gives to it. But then how Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
himself for violating his own Doctrine, which
concludes, that (<hi>pag.</hi> 252.) <hi>no man ought in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of Scripture, to proceed farther then the
bounds which are set by his Soveraign,</hi> I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
except he hath refuge to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> whom he
did then acknowledge to be his Soveraign. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it was of no small advantage to him, that all
Persons under him (by what Oaths or Obligations
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:60912:123"/>
soever they were bound to administer Justice to the
people, according to the known Rules of Law and
equity) should understand themselves to be in the
same capacity that the Seventy were to <hi>Moses,</hi> to
whom God took of the Spirit that was upon <hi>Moses,</hi>
Num. 11. 25. and gave it to them; the sense of
which place, he saies, is no other, (pag. 252.) <hi>(as
he hath formerly declar'd, that spirit signifies mind,)
then that God endued them with a mind conformable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and subordinate to that of</hi> Moses, <hi>that they might
prophesy, &amp; speak to the people in Gods name, in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as to set forward such doctrine as was agreeable to</hi>
Moses'<hi>s doctrine.</hi> And in truth so absolute an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority
in all spiritual matters, as high as it is, is not
more then is absolutely necessary to support his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
power in the temporal.</p>
               <p>He administers occasion enough in this Chapter
to induce me to repete what hath already bin said
upon the Covenant made by <hi>Abraham,</hi> which is a
principal corner stone upon which he still persists
to erect his building, which I shall forbear to do,
persuming the Reader will not forget it; only I
must observe the activity and restlessness of Mr.
<hi>Hobbes</hi> his fancy, and that, as the first mention of
the Covenant and Contract as to the end for which
he formed it, was a pure dream of his own, so he
adds to it, and makes it larger, as new matter oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs
to him that requires such a supply. As in the
beginning of this Chapter, that he might make the
Soveraignty of <hi>Abraham</hi> to appear the more unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable,
he saies, that (pag. 249.) <hi>by his Covenant
he obliged himself, and his seed after him, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
and obey the Commands of God, not only such as
he could take notice of (as moral Lawes) by the Laws
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:60912:124"/>
of Nature, but also such as God should in special man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
deliver to him by dreams, and visions,</hi> of which
before he makes no mention, tho he mention'd more
then he had autority for; for he saies, (pag. 249.)
<hi>that no contract could add to, or strengthen the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by which both they, and all men else were bound
naturally to obey God Almighty, and therefore the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
that</hi> Abraham <hi>made with God, was to take for
the commandment of God, that which in the name of
God was commanded him in a dream, or vision, and to
deliver it to his Family, and cause them to observe
the same.</hi> Yet notwithstanding this great additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
tho <hi>Abraham</hi> and all the Soveraigns who suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
him, were qualified to govern, and prescribe
to their Subjects what Religion they should be of,
and to tell them what is the word of God, and to
punish all those who should countenance any do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
which he should forbid, from which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
that (pag. 250) <hi>as none but</hi> Abraham <hi>in his
family, so none but the Soveraign in a Christian Common-wealth,
can take notice what is, or what is not the word
of God;</hi> Yet, I say, neither that, nor the <hi>renewing
the same Covenant with</hi> Isaac, <hi>and afterwards with</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,
he saies now, <hi>did make that people the peculiar
People of God,</hi> but dates that Privilege, which before
he dated from the Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
only from the renewing it by <hi>Moses</hi> at the mount
<hi>Sinai;</hi> by which he corrects his former fancy by a
new one as extravagant, upon the peoples contract
in those words, which he had mention'd before with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that observation and gloss that he makes upon
it, nor did God at that time promise more to them
by <hi>Moses,</hi> then he had before as expresly promis'd
to <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:60912:124"/>
This shall suffice to what he hath so often urg'd,
or shall hereafter infer from the Covenant with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
and by <hi>Moses,</hi> and of the peculiar domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
over that People by vertue of that Contract. Nor
will I hereafter enlarge any more upon their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
rejection of God, when they desir'd a King,
which he now confirm's by a new piece of History,
or a new Commentary upon the Text by his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
power of interpreting; for he saies (pag. 254.)
<hi>that when they said to</hi> Samuel, <hi>make us a King to judg
us like all the Nations, they signified, that they would
no more be govern'd by the commands that should be laid
upon them by the Priest in the name of God; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
in deposing the High Priest of Roial autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
they deposed that peculiar Government of God.</hi>
(pag. 255.) And yet he confesses in the very next
page, that <hi>when they had demanded a King after the
manner of the Nations, they had no design to depart
from the worship of God their King, but despairing of
the justice of the Sons of</hi> Samuel, <hi>they would have
a King to Iudg them in civil actions, but not that they
would allow their King to change the Religion which
was recommended to them by</hi> Moses. By which he
hath again cancell'd and demolish't all that power
and jurisdiction, which he would derive to all Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns,
from that submission and contract, which he
saies <hi>they made at Mount</hi> Sinai: for he confesses <hi>that
they had no intention, that the King should have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority
to alter their Religion,</hi> and then it passed
not by that contract. And thus when his unruly
invention suggests to him an addition to the Text,
or an unwarrantable interpretation of it, it alwaies
involves him in new perplexities, and leaves him as
far from attaining his end, as when he began. It
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:60912:125"/>
is upon his usual presumtion, that from the 17. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter
of <hi>Numbers,</hi> he concludes, that after <hi>Moses</hi> his
death, the supreme power of making war and peace,
and the Supreme power of judicature belonged
also to the High Priest; and thus <hi>Ioshuah</hi> was only
General of the Army: whereas no more was said in
that place to <hi>Eleazar,</hi> then had bin before said to
<hi>Aaron</hi> his Father, to perform the Priestly Office;
nor doth it ever appear that <hi>Eleazar</hi> offered to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
the Soveraignty in either of the cases, but was
as much under <hi>Ioshuah,</hi> as <hi>Aaron</hi> had ever bin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Moses.</hi> God appear'd unto <hi>Ioshuah</hi> upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease
of <hi>Moses,</hi> and deputed him to exercise the
same charge that <hi>Moses</hi> had don. <hi>As I was with</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<hi>so will I be with thee. This Book of the Law shall
not depart out of thy mouth, that thou maiest observe to
do all that is written therein. Then</hi> Ioshuah <hi>command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Officers of the People.</hi> Josh. 1, 2. 5, 8, 10. The
people made another covenant with <hi>Ioshuah. All
that thou commandest us we will do, and whither so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
thou sendest us, we will go. As we hearkned
unto</hi> Moses <hi>in all things, so will we hearken unto thee.
Whosoever doth rebel against thy Commandment, and
will not hearken to thy words in all that thou command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
him, shall be put to death.</hi> ver. 16, 17, 18. <hi>And the
Lord said unto</hi> Joshuah, <hi>this day will I magnify thee
in the sight of all</hi> Israel; <hi>as I was with</hi> Moses, <hi>so will
I be with thee. And thou shalt command the Priests
&amp;c.</hi> Josh. 3. 7, 8. All the orders and commands to
the Priests were given by <hi>Ioshuah.</hi> Joshua <hi>built an
Altar to the Lord God of</hi> Israel <hi>in Mount</hi> Ebal. <hi>He
wrote upon the stones a copy of the Law. He read all
the Law, the cursings, and the blessings, &amp;c.</hi> Josh. 8.
30, 32, 34. <hi>Ioshuah</hi> divided the Land, and when any
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:60912:125"/>
doubtful cause did arise, they repair'd to him for
judgment. And when the two Tribes, and the half,
returned to the other side of <hi>Iordan,</hi> where <hi>Moses</hi>
had assign'd their portions, it was <hi>Ioshuah</hi> who bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them, and sent them away. There is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any Soveraignty of <hi>Eleazar.</hi> What the
jurisdiction of the High-Priest was, and whether
the Office was limited, or any way suspended du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the time of the Judges, is not otherwise per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent

his care to enquire and consider. But these extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies,
and the greater in the next Chapter, in
his description and definition of the Trinity, I shall
leave to Divines to refute, and to the Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction, to convince him by information, or
to reform him by chastisements; without making any
observation, that how little power or jurisdiction
soever he allows to other Officers and Ministers, he
reserves to himself autority to determine the highest
Points. And whereas our Saviour himself professes,
that he hath laid down his life, &amp; bin sacrific'd for the
sins of the whole world, he takes upon him to contract
the number who are to receive any benefit thereby,
only to that of the Elect. And he is less to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
when he positively declares, (<hi>pag.</hi> 263.) <hi>the
end of Christs coming to be, that he might restore unto
God by a new Covenant, the Kingdom which had bin cut
off by the rebellion of the Israelites in the election of Saul:</hi>
which dream still possesses him to that degree, that
he seems to think the conversion of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to
be merely accidental, the restoring that peculiar
Kingdom to his Father by a new Covenant, being
the great end of his coming; and in case that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
should generally refuse him, then to call to his
obedience such as should believe in him of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles:</hi>
whereas his coming was equally for the one as
for the other, and in truth, was promis'd to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
before the <hi>Iews</hi> became the chosen People of
God, if the Promise made to <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall
had any prospect towards our Saviour, of which few
men make doubt.</p>
               <p>I cannot but observe some ingenuity (if it had
bin perfect ingenuity, it would have amounted to a
clear retractation) in his declaring so freely, and by
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:60912:127"/>
so many instances, that as our Saviour himself de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd,
<hi>That his Kingdom is not of this World,</hi> so that
he never exercis'd any Soveraign Jurisdiction in it,
contrary to what he more magisterially publish'd in
his twentieth Chapter; when his business being to
prove the absolute and illimited power of Kings
over their Subjects, and all that they have, he quotes
several Texts out of the Old and New Testament, in
which the simple obedience of Subjects to their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
is enjoin'd: and then concludes with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of our Saviours judgment in the point, (<hi>pag.</hi>

any thing from any Subject when there is need, and that the
King is judg of that need;</hi> for saying that <hi>our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour

to take the Ass<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Asses Colt, to carry him into Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,

to receive too much countenance in Popish Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries

and opinion, not only of Church Jurisdiction,
but upon the matter of all things which concern Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in the Church; that is, the Profession of the

Christian Faith. I do first observe, that he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
(<hi>pag.</hi> 267.) <hi>that the Ecclesiastical power was left
by our Saviour in the hands of the Apostles,</hi> and that it
remained in them, and in those who were ordained
by them, those hundreds of years before there were
any Christian Soveraigns: and I will confess with
him, that our Saviour left no external, ordinary,
coercive power to them, or with them, but only a
power to proclaim the Kingdom of Christ, and to
perswade men to submit themselves thereunto, and
by Precepts and good Counsel, and the terrors of the
Lord, to teach them that have submitted, what they
are to do that they may be receiv'd into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God, and by the censures of the Church
chastise and discipline offenders: all which cannot

they must still have a power to publish the Scripture,

teach the Doctrine of Christ before the Doctrine of
the King, which office he hath thought fit only to
commit to them, and trust them with, not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring

Christ, and that they have no power by that title to
punish men for not believing, or for contradicting
what they say: doth that defect of power of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion,
abolish that power which he hath given
them of instructing and preaching, and using the
Keys? As Christ hath trusted them to do, and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
them with peculiar circumstances to perform
those Offices; so he hath trusted Soveraign Princes
to assist them, whil'st they perform their office with
integrity, or to punish them if they do not, with
their power of compulsion, that their labors may be
effectual. And Princes are no less obliged to give
them that assistance, then they are to perform the
office of the Apostles and Disciples; nor can any
Prince think his Soveraignty impair'd, by being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to take care that the Laws and Precepts of
God his Soveraign be punctually submitted to, and
that they, to whom in special manner the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof is committed, be not only protected,
but obeied and reverenc'd, whil'st they do their duty;
or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>urmise that the Word of God stands in need of,
or can receive any dignity or autority, by any thing
he can add to it by his Soveraign power. God hath
left, and requir'd them to be Nursing Fathers to his
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:60912:129"/>
Church, and from the time of their being Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
hath communicated his Scripture to them, which
they have receiv'd, and which they are equally bound
to obey as their meanest Subject; and if they are
not good and faithful Nurses, the miscarriage of the
Children shall be imputed to them. There is no
cause of jealousie from the Soveraign towards his
Subjects, which Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> out of his constant good
will desires to kindle: for there is neither Bishop nor
Priest who pretends to any Power or Jurisdiction,
inconsistent with the Kings Supremacy, in Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
as well as Temporal matters. No man can be
made a Bishop, but by his appointment and grant.
No man can be ordained a Priest, but by him whom
he hath nominated to be a Bishop. And if either Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
or Priest mis-behave themselves to that degree,
they shall by his autority be degraded, and depriv'd,
and suffer as Lay-men are to do, he being no less So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
over the Ecclesiastical Persons and Laws,
then over the Temporal; and whoever so become
liable, are to blame, and for ought I know, have to
answer for somthing besides the departing from their
dignity. In a word, Prelates assume no title of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
nor pretend to any Jurisdiction that they have
not receiv'd from him, and therefore deserve to be
countenanc'd and supported by him, amongst his best
and most useful Subjects.</p>
               <p>He is not concern'd, if the King forbids him to
believe in Christ: it is a command of no effect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
belief and understanding never follow mens
commands; but if the King commands him to say,
that he believes not in Christ, he is very ready to
obey him. (<hi>pag.</hi> 271.) <hi>Profession with the tongue, is
but an external thing, wherein a Christian holding firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:60912:130"/>
in his heart the Faith of Christ, hath the same liberty
which the Prophet</hi> Elisha <hi>allowed to</hi> Naaman <hi>the</hi> Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.

for Idolatry past, and not begged leave to be Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
for the time to come. But admitting the Text
to be according to the common Translation, it can
do Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> no good, except he procures the same
leave from another who hath as much autority as
<hi>Elisha</hi> had. Who doth not know, that none of those
Examples which were either enjoin'd or permitted
to be don by the Divine Autority, for some extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
end of Providence, are for our imitation,
when they are opposite to the truth, and justice, and
integrity of Gods Precepts? He may as well justifie
the breach of Faith, and down-right Theft and
Robbery in his Neighbors, by the example of the
<hi>Israelites</hi> borrowing the Jewels, and other Goods of
the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> or the assassination of an Enemy, by
the example of <hi>Ehuds</hi> stabbing of <hi>Eglon,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

good men directed by the Spirit of God in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,

deal falsly, neither lie one to another, was a part of
the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law, and by Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> rules, a part
of the Law of Nature, and so must not be violated,
nor can be controul'd by God himself. He knows
very well who is the Father of lies, tho it may be he
doth not enough consider what portion is allotted
for his children. And if they who <hi>said they were Iews,
and were not,</hi> but did lie, were pronounc'd by St. <hi>Iohn</hi>
to be of <hi>the Synagogue of Satan,</hi> Rev. 3. 9. There is
very great danger, that he who is a Christian in his
heart, &amp; upon any Kings commands shall profess with
his Tongue that he doth not believe in Christ, will
not be admitted by our Saviour to be of his Church.
In vain hath the whole current of Scripture endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor'd
to raise such an awful reverence for truth, that
it hath scarce pronounced more severe Judgments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
any Species of sins, then against lying. <hi>He

Proverbs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 9. Let him believe what he will,
he shall perish for speaking lies. And if he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> he will not find the heart to be the
seat that comprehends all Christian Religion, but
that the tongue hath a very necessary part assign'd to
it, to perform: <hi>If thou shalt confess with thy mouth
the Lord Iesus, and shalt believe in thy heart that God

                  </gap>. Salvation would be gotten at too cheap a rate,
if believing would serve the turn, and men might
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:60912:131"/>
speak, and do what they find most convenient.
Words are actions in his own judgment, and to
be punish'd with the same severity. Our Saviour
had provided very ill for the propagation of his
Faith, if he had left a latitude for men to deny
him in their words, so they confessed him in their
hearts. How many Converts would that secret, and
reserv'd belief and confession have produc'd? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
with mouth, as it is the more generous, so
it is the more avowed and declar'd way of doing God
service. He cannot confess him with his mouth,
that doth not believe him in his heart; and he
doth believe him in his heart to no purpose, that
will not confess him with his mouth. A man cannot
be a true Christian without both. There may be
some men who may be possessed with as much fear
as Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> and as good Courtiers as he, in
submitting to the commands of their Soveraign,
of what kind soever; but I have not heard that
any man doth so frankly own it as he doth; and
the expedient that he hath found might have
saved many hundred thousand lives of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
in the primitive persecution, when the
greatest part of them were not required with their
mouth to deny Jesus Christ, but to acknowledg
<hi>Iupiter,</hi> or <hi>Venus,</hi> or <hi>Apollo</hi> (according to the
Religion of the Climate) to be Gods, and to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
them, which after they were Christians they
could not do: so that their Martyrdom was, that
they chose to lose their lives with the most terrible
circumstances of Torment, rather then they would
lie, and say, that they believ'd them to be Gods,
when they knew they were not so: and the Church
hath never doubted of their being Martyrs, very
precious in the eies of God. But we shall have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:60912:131"/>
to resume this argument of Martyrs again
very shortly.</p>
               <p>But it is not reasonable to believe or expect that
those, or any other Texts of Scripture, can make
any impression upon Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> when he is able
to save himself harmless from that determination
and declaration of our Saviour, <hi>Who so d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nieth me
before men, I will deny him before my Father which
is in Heaven,</hi> by saying roundly, that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a Subject is compell'd to do in obedience to
his Soveraign, and doth it not in order to his own
mind, that action is not his but his Soveraigns, nor
is it he that in this case denieth Christ before men,
but his Governor: so that he is well content to shift
of his own damnation to his Soveraign. But that
this distinction will not serve his turn, is evident to
all, but the Casuists of his own faith; and twill
concern him to find a better way to defend himself
for committing Adultery, Theft, Murder, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wickedness God hath forbidden, if his Soveraign
commands him, then he hath taught any other men
who believe his doctrine, and who deserve more sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
from him, for depending upon his reason.
I know no difficulty in resolving his case of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
concerning his Mahometan in a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Common-wealth, nor can doubt, but that he
which is a true Mahometan, and believes that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet
will not permit him to be present at the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Service in a Christian Church, which I do not
think the Mahometans restrain'd from out of their
own Country, no more then the Jews, who make
no scruple to be present at Common Praier, or Mass,
if it be attended with any convenience, looking
upon themselves only as being present in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:60912:132"/>
not at the devotion: Yet I say, if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
it, he doth well not to obey his Soveraigns
commands, and is much the honester men in avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the doing against conscience, however errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
it may be. Nor will any part of that tragical
inference follow, that then any private man may
disobey their Princes in maintenance of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
true, or false, there being other trials for the
punishment of those, then the bare word, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Prince.</p>
               <p>There are two conclusions which reasonably result
from Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> his <hi>Axiome,</hi> and which may prove
beneficial to him; the first is, that we may believe
that he doth not himself believe one word in his
Book that we find fault with: for writing is at least
as external a thing as speaking, and therefore keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his heart right, he might have the same liberty
the Prophet gave to <hi>Naaman,</hi> and write what his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
<hi>Cromwell</hi> commanded him, or what he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
would be so acceptable to him, that it would
procure him his protection, which ought to have
the same force with him as his command. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is, that when ever he shall be commanded by
the King, or required by any Court of Law, which
is the voice of the King, to retract, and recant what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is condemned in this Book, he will cheerfully,
and with a better conscience renounce them all, and
write an other Book more reasonably in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
of his errors in this. But then he is upon
an other disadvantage, which is very grievous to an
honest man, that when he makes that recantation,
no man will believe that it is the thoughts of his
heart, but only his profession with the tongue,
which being but an external thing, he doth signify
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:60912:132"/>
his obedience to that autority to which he is Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
without any remorse for the wickedness of his
former writing. The truth is, this licence which he
avows, how odious and impious soever, hath in it self
likewise so much of levity and extreme weakness,
that a man may depart a little from his gravity in
answering it, and wonder why he did not make use
of a Text of <hi>Euripides</hi> englisht in <hi>Hudibras,</hi> who
is much a graver writer, and far better Casuist, as an
autority to support his doctrine,
<q>
                     <l>Oaths are but words, and words but wind,</l>
                     <l>Too feeble instruments to bind. &amp;c.</l>
                  </q>
He knows well that in the custom of speaking, worse
cannot be said of any man, then that he is ready to
say any thing he is bid, and the natural judgment
upon him, is, that no man believes any thing he
saies.</p>
               <p>Error is naturally pregnant, and the more despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
it is, the more fruitful. Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> well foresaw
that the latitude he assum'd to himself, could not
consist with the courage of the blessed Martyrs of
the Christian Faith, who had laid down their lives
rather then they would with their tongue (which
would have saved their lives) deny their Saviour,
or say they did not believe in him, upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of what Emperour of Soveraign soever. Nor
could it reasonably be expected, that a man who is so
declared an Enemy to Martyrdom, should enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a great reverence or esteem for the persons of
Martyrs; and therefore it cannot be wondred at,
that he very resolutly chargeth that glorious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
(whose memory every Christian Church cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brates
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:60912:133"/>
with extraordinary devotion) with want of
Wit and understanding, and with loss of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and boldly determines by his Prerogative of
interpreting words according to his definitions and
Etymologies, whatever the constant, and general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
hath bin, that because Martyr signifies a
witness, (pag. 272.) <hi>and a witness must have seen
what he testifies, and the fundamental Article of
Christian Religion being that Iesus was the Christ,
therefore that none can properly be called Martyrs
of Christ, but those that convers'd with him, and
saw him before and after his Resurrection, and that
whosoever did not so, can witness no more then what
others said, and are therefore but witnesses of other
mens testimony, and are but second Martyrs, or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
of Christs witnesses.</hi> And yet for fear that they
might yet have too much honour, he doth as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periously
declare, that (pag. 273.) <hi>none can be a
Martyr of the first, or second degree, who have not a
warrant to preach Christ come in the flesh, and who
are not sent to the conversion of Infidels; for that no
man is a witness to him that already believes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
needs no witness, but to them that deny, or doubt,
or have not heard it.</hi> And even to those, that there
is one only Article, which to die for, meriteth so
honourable a name, and that Article is, that (pag.
272.) <hi>Iesus is the Christ. But a man maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every Doctrine, which he himself draws out of the
History of our Saviours life, or out of the Acts or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles
of the Apostles, is very far from being a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr
of Christ, or a Martyr of his Martyrs:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
whoever hath laid down his life for the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of any Christian verity, or rather then he would
deny any such, hath alwaies bin inserted in the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:60912:133"/>
number of the Martyrs, by the judgment of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal
Church.</p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> had bin conversant in the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of matters upon the testimony of witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
he would have known, that in cases of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
importance, it is not alwaies necessary that the
witness must have bin present, and have seen what
he testifieth, or else his testimony is not good. They
are very comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ent witnesses who declare what they
have heard from others; the question being only,
whether what they say be true; which often appears
to be more unquestionable by the testimony of what
others saw, and declar'd, then what they saw or
heard themselves: and the truth of all matters of fact
would be quickly lost, or dangerously suspected,
if the death of half a dozen persons, who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
could render the truth without evidence. So
that he could not in this assertion, have any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to discountenance any other sort of witnesses
but only Martyrs. And I must complain of his
extreme undervaluing his Readers, in endeavouring
to perswade them, from St. <hi>Peters</hi> proposing,
or enjoining after the death of <hi>Iudas,</hi> that the rest
of the Apostles should ordain one to be a Martyr,
(a witness with them of Christs Resurrection) of
those men who had accompanied with them all the
time that the Lord Jesus went in and out amongst
them, beginning from the baptism of <hi>Iohn,</hi> &amp;c.
(which he saies, makes it manifest, (pag. 272.) <hi>that
he which is to be a witness of the truth of the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Christ, must be some Disciple th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him, and saw him before, and after his Resurrection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and consequently, must be one of his original Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>)
that none else could be a Martyr. He would
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:60912:134"/>
have too just reason to upbraid the breeding in the
Universities, if there be any Novice in Logic there,
who can be imposed upon by such Argumentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
They who are deluded by him, have not passed
through that course Education. It is true, that the
method in which our Saviour chose to work the
conversion of men, was by matters of fact, which
he submitted to the examination of the senses, and
which was don in the sight of the Sun, that there
might be no want of witnesses. His greatest mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
were don in the greatest company, whom he
had made Judges as well as witnesses of what they
saw. When he changed the Water into Wine, it
was at a Wedding, which in that time, and in that
Country, was alwaies celebrated in the presence of
a great multitude, and with notable Festivity. These
people saw the Water poured out, and in the drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
found it to be excellent Wine, better then the
Wine that was first brought into the room: and
the evidence of so many witnesses, could not but
make the miracle believed, which he expected not
should be believed upon a less testimony. When he
rais'd the dead to life, it was alwaies in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of them who had seen them living, and
dead: the same eies which saw them die, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
buried, saw them likewise rise from the dead,
and eat, and drink, and perform all the functions
of life as other men. The whole people saw his
Passion, and were witnesses of all the circumstances
of it: and all his Disciples, and many other were wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of, and conversed with him after his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.
And to supply all possible defects, after
his Ascension (which was in the view likewise of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
witnesses) he sent the Holy Ghost upon them
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:60912:134"/>
who taught, and them who believed; and which was
a miracle little inferior to the rest, he gave many
of his witnesses so long a life to publish what they
had seen, and known, that it is made a question whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Christianity be farther spread at present, then
it was before the death of all the Apostles. And then
they all (for we may say St. <hi>Iohn</hi> suffer'd death, tho
he out-lived it) sealed with their blood the truth of
what they had preach'd and publish'd. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
the Scripture being likewise publish'd and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
attested, there needed no more Martyrs
of the History, but only for the doctrine: and they
are no less Martyrs who suffer death rather then
they will commit a Sin, against which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
hath pronounced damnation, then they who
assert his Passion, and Resurrection. And, as hath
bin said before, the greatest number of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Martyrs, were never question'd about the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of our Saviour, of which the Persecutors had
never particularly heard, but were condemn'd for
renouncing their Religion in which they had bin
bred, and denying those to be Gods, who were
worshipped as such by that Country; for which
Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> hath obliged himself to have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence:
and however they are challeng'd, and
made to be Martys for that Religion, which now
assumes the Soveraignty over all Religion, there
was not one amongst them who ever heard of any
of those opinions which are since grown up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Christians, <hi>nor suffer'd for any thing, but what
all the Christians at present in the world do believe.</hi>
And the Martyrdom of all who have since suffer'd
death for the maintenance of any particular opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
hath consisted only in that they would not
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:60912:135"/>
deny what in truth they believ'd, or pretend to
believe what they thought apparent to be false:
which is not therefore to be condemn'd, because
Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> is resolv'd to decline it.</p>
               <p>In this Rapsody of extravagant notions he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
to the dissecting the Commission granted
by our Saviour to the Apostles, and with the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of a Grammarian translates the terms of their
Commission, to make their office of as little autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as he wishes it to be. He saies Preaching signifies
nothing, (pag. 273.) <hi>but what a Crier, or Herald,
or other Officer useth to do publicly, in proclaiming
a King; and a Crier, he saieth, hath not right to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
any man: that teaching is the same thing with
Preaching, but to teach that Iesus was Christ, and
risen from the dead, is not to say, that men are bound
after they believe it, to obey those that tell them so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the commands of their Soveraign, but that they
shall do wisely to expect the coming of Christ hereafter,
in patience, and faith, with obedience to their present
magistrate.</hi> All which signifies nothing, if it doth
not signify, that where ever Idolatry is the Religion
of the Soveraign, what ever they do believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they are to practice Idolatry still, and to
perform all the Rites of Infidells, till the coming
of Christ himself to justify their conversion. And
this no question is his meaning: to which I shall
apply no other answer then the stating his propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.
And if there could remain any doubt, since
that meaning is so very bad, that it could not be
his, he will quickly remove that doubt in the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
he takes of Baptism, and the obligation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

the doctrine of the Apostles, who being assisted
by the spirit of the Father and the Son</hi> (he tells us

only and assur'd way thereunto.</hi> And so that you
may not suspect him to be a better Christian then
he is, he hath taken the pains to let you know a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
the little esteem he hath of the Trinity. This
being our promise in Baptism, and the autority
of Earthly Soveraigns being not to be put down
(1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 25. 22, 23, 24.) till the day of judgment,
for that he sai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tority over us, by which our externall actions are
to be govern'd in this life, but promise to take the doctrine
of the Apostles for our direction in the way to life eternal.</hi>
So that the greater moiety of the world being (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the computation made by the Learned
men) mere Heathen men, and Pagans, and much
the greater part of the other moiety being Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans
(no account being taken of the Jews)
neither the one, or the other, however they may in
their hearts believe the doctrine of the Apostles,
are bound to make profession outwardly of the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:60912:136"/>
Christian Religion, before the second coming of our
Saviour to judgment, except their own Soveraigns
command them so to do. And in all these ravings
he hath Texts of Scripture at hand, which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,
and interprets to his own ends, contrary to the
genuine sense, and indeed to the whole Analogy of
Faith and Scripture, (as any man must conclude who
examines them) and the interpretation which hath
bin alwaies made of them before Mr. <hi>Hobbes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A man would imagine that he had bin content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the Apostles and their Successors should
enjoy some dignity and prerogative<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
that (pag. 274.) <hi>the end of Baptism is remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Sins, and to baptize, is to declare the reception
of men into Gods Kingdom, and to refuse to baptize,
is to declare their exclusion; and that the power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
them cast out, or retained in it, was given to
the Apostles, and their Substitutes and Successors.</hi> But
he quickly humbles them from this exaltation, and
since no man can judg the secret thoughts of the
heart, he saies, (pag. 275.) <hi>the Apostles, and their
Successors were to follow the outward marks of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
which appearing, they had no autority to deny
absolution.</hi> Besides they alwaies were, and are but
ministerial, they have nothing to do to judg of
(<hi>pag.</hi> 275.) <hi>the truth of repentance; that belongs to the
assembly of the faithfull, the judgment belonging to them,
and only the publication of it to the Apostle, or Pastor
of the Church as Prolocutor,</hi> after the Assembly had
first heard the cause, and determin'd it. So that it
seems St. <hi>Peter</hi> was a little too presumtious, in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
to know the heart of An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nias, and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phira,</hi>
and in pronouncing so severe a judgment
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:60912:136"/>
upon them without so much as asking the advice
of the Assembly. I shall not accompany him in
his disquisition upon Excommunication, the use
and effects of it, upon whom it is to be exercis'd,
and for what faults, or the conditions which are
requisite to make men liable to it, and whether
the Teacher of Christian doctrine may as a master in
any Science, abandon his Disciples that obstinately
continue in an unchristian life: but he cannot say the
excommunicate have wrong; because they are not
obliged to obey; in all which he mingles great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
with some truth well expressed, and the errors
being of a less magnitude then those he is usually
guilty of, I shall not particularly insist upon them.
But I cannot but observe his close design, to make
the foolishness of Preaching of no effect, by his
absolving their Auditory from any kind of obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to believe them; which he would not attemt
to do, if he had less autority then from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
themselves. (<hi>Acts</hi> 17. 3. 3.) For from Saint
<hi>Pauls</hi> behaviour in the Synagogue in <hi>Thessalonica</hi>
(pag. 280.) <hi>when some of them believed, and others
did not believe,</hi> he finds the reason was, <hi>that St.</hi>
Paul <hi>came to them without any legal Commission, came on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to perswade them, and reasoned with them out of the
Scriptures, which were well known to the Iews, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
by them to be the word of God. And the reason why,
when they all believed the Scripture, they did not all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
believe him, was, that some approved, and oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rs
disapproved the Interpretation which St.</hi> Paul <hi>shad made,
and every one interpreted them to himself; for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
perswades by reasoning from Principles written,
makes him to whom he speaks judg both of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of those Principles, and also of the force of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:60912:137"/>
upon them. If</hi> St. Paul <hi>had bin to be Iudg
himself of what he said, what needed he to have quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
any places of Scripture to prove his doctrine? It
had bin enough to have said, I find it so in Scripture,
that is to say in your laws, of which I am interpreter,
as sent from Christ. Therefore the Iews of</hi> Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica,
<hi>were the sole Iudges of what St.</hi> Paul <hi>alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of Scripture; and every man might believe, or
not believe, according as the allegations seem'd to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
to be agreeable to the meaning of the places alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And generally,</hi> he saies, <hi>in all cases of the world,
he that pretendeth any proof, maketh him Iudg of his
proof to whom he addresseth his speech.</hi> Which cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
absolves the Jews for not believing our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
himself when he alledged Texts of Scripture to
inform and convince them, and absolves all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
men from yielding obedience, or believing
the interpretation of Judges in point of Law, If
their own sense pleases them better; which introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as wild a confusion in Church and State, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
can wish; and he, and his Disciples would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the only confident Interpreters of the Law
and the Gospel.</p>
               <p>It is a very painful thing to read this two and
fortieth Chapter of Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> in which all the loose
and licentious reflections upon piety, and religion,
the undervaluing and perverting the Scripture, and
the utter contemt of the Church, which are a little
more warily scatter'd throughout his book, (that
is, by being scattered, not so easily discern'd) are
collected, and gathered more closely together in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
such a Mass of impiety, that the very repeting all
the particulars, without which they cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to, must be more grievous and offensive to
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:60912:137"/>
most devout Persons, then the most unclean dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
can appear to the chastest eares. And the
argument being of power Ecclesiastical, he hath
made all Ecclesiastical power to be of no significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the most useless thing upon the earth.
Our Saviour himself (who is the Fountain from
whence all Ecclesiastical power must flow) he hath
discover'd to have so little autority when he
was here, that he could delegate little to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.
And since men were not bound to believe
him, nor committed any fault if they did not believe
him, he could not leave his Apostles in a state of
more reverence and esteem: and their greatest pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege
was, to leave the conversation of those, who
did not care for their company. And that he might
with great method and order make all this appear,
is the business of this very long Chapter, towards
which the most innocent Paragraph in it contributes
somewhat, as appears by those which we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
examin'd; and therefore we can take little
delight, or administer it to others, in the Survey of
the rest. It cannot but be wonder'd at, that Mr.
<hi>Hobbes,</hi> who evidently hath taken pains in reading
the Scripture, to what ill purposes, and with what
evil intentions soever, could have the confidence to
affirm, (pag. 281.) <hi>that the Apostles preached nothing,
but that Iesus was the Christ, &amp;c. that he was not
dead but risen again from the dead, and gon up into
Heaven, and should come again to judg the world, &amp;c.</hi>
All which are indeed the Elements of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
faith, but he saies, <hi>none of them preached, that
himself, or any other Apostle was such an interpreter
of the Scripture, as all that became Christians, ought
to take their interpretations for Law.</hi> The founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:60912:138"/>
must be, that it might be believ'd, that Christ
the Messias was come; for till that was believ'd, what
he said, or what he did, was of little moment. Yet
their great business too was to make them know, that
the simple believing that, would not serve their
turn; that Christian Religion did not consist more,
(it may be not so much) in believing, as in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
In all Christs Sermons upon the Mount, there
is very little of opinion taught, or prescrib'd,
only the practice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of Christian duties was vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
urged: <hi>wherefore by their fruits you shall know
them; whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and
doth them,</hi> Mat. 7. 24. A great part of his redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was, that he qualified us to receive redemtion;
and tho he paid the price of his blood for our ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
yet he left somthing to be don still by us, in
following his example, and observing his Precepts.
The informing and convincing the world of this,
was the office of the Apostles; and all they said, and
all they wrote, were interpretations, and commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
upon what our Saviour himself had said, and
don, and together contain'd so perfect a body of
Christianity, that we are not obliged to any thing
under the penalty of damnation, but what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
therein, or evidently deduced from thence.
The office of the Apostles was to point out, and
demonstrate the way to that Salvation, which was
so dearly purchased for us; and efficaciously to prove,
that the declining that way, and walking in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
path, must lead us to eternal perdition; and
confidently to declare, and pronounce the reward
and the punishment to both, that men may chuse
for themselves. This they were to do, and this
they did; and after all this, are we now to believe
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:60912:138"/>
that they had no autority for what they did, and that
we have no obligation upon us, nor the Jew, nor
the Gentile before us, to believe what they said, or
to do what they enjoined?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> is the first Commentator upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists,
who upon that advice of our Saviours,
<hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> John 5. 39. observes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
(<hi>pag.</hi> 281.) that if <hi>our Saviour himself had not
meant that the Iews should interpret the Scriptures, he
would not have hidden them to search them, and take from
thence the proof of his being the Christ, but he would
either have interpreted them himself, or referred them
to the interpretation of the Priests;</hi> that is, because as
he vouchsafed to expose his Miracles to the test and
examination of their grossest senses, so now by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descending
to quote Scripture for his own manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he intended to make themselves the Judges,
whether he spoke to the purpose or no, and at liberty
to believe him or not, without forfeiture of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence.
Did he not interpret the Scriptures him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
when by the several Texts, which he cited out
of several of the Prophets, he made it evident to
them, that those Prophesies were of his Person,
and could refer to none else? And since they all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
that they were the word of God, he advised
them to search the Scriptures, because they are they
that testifie of him. The Apostles observe the same
method, demonstrate out of the Prophets, whom
they all professed to believe, what Christ must do
when he came, and what must be don to him, and
that all that was don and suffered by him which was
fore told. His admirable Life and Doctrine was well
known to them all, they had bin present at his trial,
and at his death, and had with their eies seen the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:60912:139"/>
circumstances of it; they had seen him buried,
and the Jews had providently appointed a guard of
Soldier, who had without remorse beheld his Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to watch his Tomb: and yet after all this vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,
the Body was not found, but as he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
himself, and what had bin by the Prophets
fore-told of him, the third day he was risen; of
which there were so many eie-witnesses, who had
seen, and conferr'd with him for many daies, and
had at last beheld with their bodily eies, his Body
ascend in the air towards Heaven. And besides
that the greatest part of all this was seen and known
by all the People, the Preachers and Declarers of it
appear'd to be very extraordinary men, by the daily
M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>racles they wrought, by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> such multitudes were

                  </gap>ist believing all they said,
and promis'd to observe the Precepts they enjoin'd.
But all this is nothing: others, and much greater
numbers did, and lawfully might refuse to do either;
for Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> saies positively, (<hi>pag.</hi> 281.) that <hi>the
people had liberty to interpret the Scriptures to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
till such time as there should be Pastors that could
autorize an Interpreter, whose interpretation should
be gene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Pastors, or Pastors Kings.</hi> So that what the Apostles,
or our Saviour himself had said, laid no obligation
upon those who heard them.</p>
               <p>We have now the reason why he was concern'd so
much to extend those plain words of the Children
of <hi>Israel,</hi> in their fright, to <hi>Moses, Speak thou to

ten Commandments, since they were forbid to approach
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:60912:139"/>
the mountain, by which they might have heard what
God said to</hi> Moses: but that obligation that they
would hear <hi>Moses,</hi> made all sure again, and so they
came to receive them. Yet he confesses, (<hi>pag.</hi> 282.)
that <hi>they could not but acknowledg the second Table for
Gods Laws, because they were all the Laws of Nature:</hi>
but for those of the first Table that were peculiar to
the <hi>Israelites,</hi> (which gives him occasion to enlarge
his Commentary upon the third Commandment, in

               </p>
               <p>Since the reception of the New Testament as a
Law (that is, within the Canon of Scripture) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
wholly upon the word of the Soveraign, and
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:60912:140"/>
by that word is receiv'd and acknowledg'd to be the
word of God, and from thence is obeied as such: it
must likewise, by his rule, still subsist by the sole
autority of the Soveraign, for he can by his word
to morrow abrogate that which this day he made a
Law. So that if a Christian Soveraign be succeeded
by a Soveraign who is a Jew, or an evil Christian,
he may abrogate that Law by which the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was declar'd to be within the Canon of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
and then the Subjects must neither (<hi>pag.</hi> 285.)
<hi>in their actions or discourse observe the same, and can

by which the confessed word of God must be made
void, and controul'd by the commandments of man.
And he hath the confidence to aver, that the very
Council held by the Apostles, in which they use
this style, It seem'd good to the Holy Ghost, and
to us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath no autority to oblige any body,
(<hi>pag.</hi> 286.) <hi>since the Apostles could have no other power
then that of our Saviour, who could only perswade, not
command; for they who have no Kingdom can make no
Laws.</hi> And so I hope <hi>Leviathan</hi> hath now laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, and perform'd his full function, which
makes him worthy to receive a more reasonable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer

               <p>Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> hath invested the Soveraign with his

there was no Civil Soveraign to meddle with it, but

that the direction of all Ecclesiastical Affairs apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
to the Apostles and their successors, and those
who were ordain'd by them; he finds a way to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
his Christian Monarch with that Jurisdiction
and Supremacy, by the right all Heathen Soveraigns
had, who had the name of Pastors of the People,
because there was no Subject that could lawfully
teach the People, but by their permission and auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
and that no body can think, that the right of
Heathen Kings is taken away by their conversion to
the Faith of Christ, who never ordain'd, that Kings
for believing in him should be deposed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to any but himself. And therefore Christian
Princes are still the supreme Pastors of their People,
and have power to ordain what Pastors they please
to teach the Church. But to make their title the
more unquestionable, he resorts to the title he found
out for his Soveraign by institution, that from the

Representative of the people, and so hath the same
power and authority, as if he were by their electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
He finds now, that the Christian Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
assoon as he is Christian, becomes the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative
of the Church, and so the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
he elects are elected by the Church, which
was all the title they had from the time of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
to the time of the Soveraigns becoming
Christian, from which time he is the true Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
of the Church as well as of the State, (<hi>pag.</hi>

that they have all manner of power over their
Subjects that can be given to man, and may make such
Laws, as themselves shall judg fittest for the government
of their own Subjects, both as they are the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
and as they are the Church.</hi> But as his Civil
Soveraign rejects his Institution, and knows he hath
much a better title to his power, then he could have
by pretending to be the Representative of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
so his Christian Soveraign will as much reject
the being Representative of the Church, knowing
that he hath a better title by being Soveraign, to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
his Clery, and all Ecclesiastical persons in his
own Dominions, and for suppressing all seditious
and erroneous Doctrines, which may disturb the
Peace, or discredit the Integrity of the Church,
then such a Representation would give him. And
they are little beholding to him for deriving their
Supremacy Ecclesiastical from the Heathen Princes,
since few Heathen Soveraigns ever pretended to have
the supreme, or indeed any power or autority in
what concern'd the service and worship of their
God, the direction and government whereof apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
to Magistrates, and Ministers assigned for that
Sacred Province: as the Great Turk himself (as hath
bin said before) doth not give Laws, but receives ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and the interpretation of the Mufty, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
<hi>Mahomet</hi> hath enjoin'd to be don.</p>
               <p>But let the title be what it will, he will be sure
that his Soveraign shall have a power as unlimitted in
all Ecclesiastical affairs, as in Civil; and not only to
give what Religion he thinks fit, and to allow what
Book he pleases for Scripture to his Subjects, but
that he may himself if he pleases, perform all the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:60912:141"/>
Functions himself in Religion (pag. 287.) <hi>as to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize,
administer the Sacrament of the Lords Supper,
consecrate Temples and Pastors to Gods service.</hi> And he
saies, <hi>the reason is evident why they do it not; which is
no other, but that they have somwhat else to do.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he is sure <hi>they may be literal Pastors of their
own Subjects in their own persons, and have autority to
Preach, to Baptize, to administer the Sacrament of the
Lords Supper, and to consecrate both Temples and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to Gods service:</hi> which he doth not grant, out of
the high qualifications which he believes to be inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in the power and person of a King, but from
the low esteem he hath of those Offices and Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Religion. For fore-seeing the objection that
those administrations (by the testimony of all Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity)
require the imposition of such mens hands,
as by the like imposition successively from the time
of the Apostles have bin ordain'd to the like Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry;
he removes that difficulty, by offering a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the original and use of the Imposition of
Hands, and instructs us from the perpetual custom
and usage in all Nations, of Imposition of Hands as
well in Civil as in Sacred occasions, as well in inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
punishment, as in conferring Honors and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
as in the condemnation of him who blasphemes
the Lord, <hi>all that heard him, shall lay their hands upon
his head, and</hi> that <hi>all the Congregation should stone him.</hi>
And when <hi>Iairus</hi> his daughter was sick, he did not
desire our Saviour to heal her, but to lay his hands
upon her, that she might be healed. And they brought
little Children up to him, that he might lay his
hands upon them, &amp;c. And the reason is, he saies,
(pag. 298.) <hi>as in the case of the Blasphemer, where the
witnesses laid their hands upon the guilty persons, rather
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:60912:142"/>
then a Priest or Levite, or other Minister of Iustice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
none else were able to design or demonstrate to the
eies of the Congregation, who it was that had blasphemed,
and ought to die,</hi> so in other things, <hi>it is natural to
design any individual thing, rather by the hand to assure
the eies, then by words to inform the ear in matters of
Gods public service.</hi> All which, and many other
Texts, of which he never finds want to any purpose,
must signifie, if they signifie any thing, that the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of hands, that venerable circumstance that
hath bin from the beginning of Christianity, and
where ever it is professed, applied to all Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Functions, is to no other purpose but to point
out the person, that all the people may know who is
the person that is ordained: but the person of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Soveraign Prince, is too notorious and perspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to need any such demonstration, and therefore
he may Baptize, Preach and Consecrate, and do all
other Offices without it. To all which, I shall sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
any farther answer, until he can prevail with
one Christian Prince to assume and exercise the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
he so frankly confers upon him; or one Christian
Subject willing to receive those Honors and Graces
from their Royal Hands.</p>
               <p>I have waited upon Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> into Cardinal <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>'s

him there in the Controversie he hath with
him, which takes up the remainder of his forty se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Chapter, more then to say, that he takes upon
him to answer that Book of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> which of all
that ever he writ is most easie to be answer'd having
less of Reason and Learning in it, and having few
Assertors, and being generally condemn'd among
the Papists themselves, and particularly by the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg

of <hi>Sorbone,</hi> the fairest Representers of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> and in answering of
which, he hath said nothing new, nor so substantially
as many others have don, as he must confess, if he reads

                  </gap>or some Texts of Scripture, which,
he saies, conclude for his Soveraign, upon which
the other would establish the supreme autority of
the Pope; and which in truth, cannot be applied
with any colour to either of them. And he cannot
take it ill, that I have, and shall take the same me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
in answering many of his Arguments, which he
himself thought fit to do, before he would enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any particular disquisition of those of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,
by laying open the consequences of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
(pag. 314.) that <hi>Princes, and States, that have
the Civil Soveraignty in their several Common-wealths,
may bethink themselves, whether it be convenient for
them, and conducing to the good of their Subjects, of whom
they are to give an account at the day of Iudgment, to
admit the same:</hi> which way of exposing his whole
Book, is without doubt the best way of answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it.</p>
               <p>I shall only add, that as it was unreasonably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> to establish a title that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon matter of Fact by arguments from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
which proves, that it ought to be so; so Mr.
<hi>Hobbes,</hi> who when History controuls him, thinks it a
sufficient answer to say, <hi>If it was not so, it should be
so,</hi> as unreasonably follows the same method, and
would, by the ill consequences which would flow
from such a right, devest the Pope of an autority,
which he confidently saies was granted to him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
by our Saviour, and hath bin enjoied by
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:60912:143"/>
his Predecessors from that time to this. Which if
true, all the arguments from Reason may fortifie,
but can never shake a Right so founded upon a
clear and plain Grant, from one who had an Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
power to grant, and wherewith the possession hath
gon ever since. He therefore who will pertinently
answer and controul these pretences (which Mr.
<hi>Hobbes</hi> can well do, if it would not cross some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his Doctrines) must do it by positively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
any such grant, which never was, nor ever
can be produced in such plain and significant terms,
as are necessary to the grant of the most inferior Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
in any Church or State. He would make it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
appear, that for many hundreds of Years no
Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> made the least pretence to any such
Soveraignty; and when they began to make it, with
what a torrent of contradiction it was rejected. He
would make it evident, that all that power which
that See assum'd, was granted to them by Kings and
Princes, and restor'd to them again when they were
oppressed by their own Factions and Schisms, and
by more powerful Enemies. He would point out the
very Article of time, when by the Incursions of the
<hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> and the foul arts pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed
by the Popes, their autority by degrees increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to a great height, by the bounty of <hi>Charlemain,</hi>
in making them great Temporal Princes; against the
inconvenience whereof he thought he had sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
provided, when he reserved to himself, and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Emperors, to make all the Popes. He would
shew them many wonderful accidents, by which the
power of the Emperor grew to decay, and the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of all neighbor Kings and Princes, by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions
in their several Kingdoms, and their unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:60912:143"/>
bloody Wars amongst themselves; and then
the artifices still practiced by the Popes to foment
those Divisions, and to contribute to their own
Greatness &amp; Usurpation; notwithstanding all which,
that there hath not bin one Century of Years from
St. <hi>Peter</hi> to this time, that there hath not bin some
notorious opposition and contradiction to that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
which was argument enough, that it was
never look'd upon as a Catholic verity. All this he
would prove to be true, as likewise, that no Prince
of the Roman communion, who at present is most
indulgent to it, (as all of them are in such a degree
as is most advantageous to their own affairs) look
upon it as such, and that a submission to the Popes
autority, except it be commanded or allowed by the
King, and the Law, is not taken for a part of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in any Kingdom but that of <hi>England.</hi> This is
the method that must be taken towards the enerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
those high pretences; and if it were vigorously
pursued by one well versed in the Pontifical Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
in which he needs no other witness then their
own Records, I mean Popish Writers, all the World
would be convinc'd, except only such Princes who
are very well paid for the communication of part of
their Soveraignty to him, that the Pope hath not out
of his own Dominions, so much as the power of the
Metropolitan Schole-master, which Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>
seems willing to confer upon him.</p>

               <p>HE who hath taken so ill a Survey of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
if self, is not like to be a good guide
for the way thither (which is the business
of his forty third Chapter) and which, into how
little room soever he brings all that is necessary
to Salvation, would be very difficult to find, if
it were not for his old expedient, his Soveraigns
commands; since the most prescrib'd and known
way, which hath bin thought to lead thither, (is
quite damm'd up by him) the Scriptures. (pag. 323.)
<hi>That which made the Patriarchs, and the Prophets
of old to believe, was God himself, who spake unto
them supernaturally, and the person whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
and Disciples that conversed with Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
was our Saviour himself. But of us, to
whom neither God the Father, nor our Saviour e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
spoke,</hi> he saies, <hi>it cannot be said that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
whom we believe, is God. So that the Faith of
Christians ever since our Saviours time, hath had no
other foundation, then the reputation of their Pastors,
and the Old, and New Testament, which their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Princes have made the rule of their Faith;
which Princes are the only persons whom Christians now
hear speak from God,</hi> and to whom consequently they
are beholding for their Salvation. Admit that single
contracted Article <hi>Iesus is Christ,</hi> comprehends all
that is necessary to Salvation, for he confesses, that <hi>he
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:60912:144"/>
who holdeth that foundation, Iesus is the Christ, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
expressly all that he seeth rightly deduc'd from it,
and implicitly all that is consequent thereunto, tho he
have not skill enough to discern the consequence;</hi> I
demand still, how they shall believe this Article
whom their Soveraigns forbid to look upon the
New Testament as Scripture, which is all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
they can have for it: and yet he saies,
(<hi>pag.</hi> 327.) <hi>for the belief of this Article, we are to
reject the autority of an Angel from Heaven, much
more of any mortal man if he teach the contrary;</hi> I
know well he reconciles this contradiction by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
in the heart, and denying with the tongue,
having the example of <hi>Naaman.</hi> But how shall
he believe in his heart if he be depriv'd of the New
Testament? and if he doth come to believe in his
heart as he ought to do, what affection and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
can he have for that Soveraign who will not
be saved himself, and requires him to renounce
his Saviour? He must be content with a mere ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal
affection without any influence upon the heart,
which is much less duty then he requires towards
his Soveraign whom he is so intirely to obey, that
he must say all he bids him say, and do all he bids
him do: so much more duty he requires for his
Earthly then for his Heavenly Soveraign. I wish
with all my heart that Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> did remember,
or believe his own good rule in the end of this
Chapter, which would have preserved him from
many presumtions, which administer great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and grief to his Readers for his sake, (<hi>pag.</hi> 331.)
<hi>It is not the bare words but the scope of the Writer
that giveth the true light by which any writing is to
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:60912:145"/>

from them clearly, but rather by casting atomes of
Scripture, as dust before mens eies, make every thing
more obscure then it is; an ordinary artifice,</hi> he saies,
<hi>of those that seek not the truth but their own advantage.</hi>
Alas! that it should be an advantage to Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi>
to perswade men to believe that <hi>Our Saviour hath
not given us new Laws, but Counsel to observe those
we are subject to; and that in his Sermon upon the
Mount,</hi> (which is the <hi>compendium</hi> of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)

of the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> sure his declaration,
That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

If his determination, That whosoever
should put away his Wife, saving for the cause
of Adultery, &amp;c. be not a new Law, it cannot
be a Commentary upon that of <hi>Moses,</hi> Let him
give her a writing of Divorcement. Was the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
suppression of circumcision, was the total abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
of all their Sacrifices, making no new Law
to the Jews, but only expounding the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses?</hi>
And yet he came not to destroy the Law,
or the Prophets, but to fulfil: and when he had
fulfilled what was there foretold of him, the Law
became <hi>felo-de-se,</hi> and ceased to be useful any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
When our Saviour bid the <hi>Pharisees</hi> learn what
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:60912:145"/>
that Text in the Prophet <hi>Hosea</hi> meaneth, <hi>I will
have mercy, and not Sacrifice,</hi> did he intend they
should repair to the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> for instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
because they were subject to it? I do with
some passion desire Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> to consider sadly
(for there will at some time or other, before he
struggles out of this world, be sadness to him in the
consideration) whether it be probable, or possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that our Saviour should give such a charge to
his Apostles, that when in any House or City,
they who were in it refused to receive them, or
hear their words, that they should shake off the
dust of their feet, with so terrible a Declaration
by our Saviour himself, <hi>Verily I say unto you,
it shall be more tolerable for the Land of</hi> Sodome
<hi>and</hi> Gomorrah <hi>in the day of Iudgment, then for that
City, Mat.</hi> 10. 15. I say, can any man ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that Christ should there have made so fierce
a denunciation, if he had intended the Precepts
which himself, and his Apostles gave, should be
looked upon only as good Counsel, which men
might as innocently disbelieve as believe; and that
they which should believe, might securely suspend
yielding any obedience to what he directed, till
his second coming to Judgment? Indeed the day
of Judgment would be so far from being a day
of terror, that it would be as festival a day, as Mr.
<hi>Hobbes</hi> himself can wish it, if none be to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
there for not observing the advice, or not
obeying the precepts which our Saviour, and
his Apostles gave to them. But of this I have
said enough before, which I think I need not to
repete or inlarge upon, and am willing to get
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:60912:146"/>
out, and wish Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> will likewise, from this
maze and labyrinth of confusion, and be advis'd
by himself, <hi>to give over the casting atomes of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
as dust before mens eies, to make every thing more
obscure then it is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot omit the observation of the three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
definitions which he makes of Heresy in
three several places, as they were suitable to his
occasions; which himself declares to proceed from
ignorance, when (<hi>pag.</hi> 50.) <hi>men give different
names to one and the same thing, from the difference
of their own passions.</hi> In his eleventh Chapter, whilst
he affected to be plain and perspicuous in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
and explanation of words, he saies,
<hi>Heresy signifies no more then private opinion, but has
only a tincture of greater choler;</hi> but in his forty Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Chapter of the power Ecclesiastical, in which
it concern'd him to be wary what punishment he
permitted to be inflicted on it, he declares, that
(<hi>pag.</hi> 277.) <hi>an Heretic is he, that being a member
of the Church, teacheth nevertheless some private
opinion which the Church hath forbidden.</hi> Which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be his own case, he was very well content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to resort to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and to grant him au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority
in this case to make rules as well as to give
advice, and finds his direction to <hi>Titus</hi> to be such
as pleases him, <hi>A man that is an Heretic af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the first and second admonition reject, Tit.</hi> 3.
10. but to reject in this place he saies is not
to excommunicate the man, but to give over
admonishing him, to let him alone, to set by
disputing with him as one that is to be convinc'd
only by himself; and then he doubts not to shift
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:60912:146"/>
for himself. But now when he hath better thought
of it in his contest with <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> he hath reason
to be sorry that he hath left so much autority in
the Church, as to reject in his own sense, least
the Cardinal procures that power for the Pope,
whom he hath allowed to be the Master Schole-Master,
and then he may find another significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>reject,</hi> then letting him alone. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he now pronounces (<hi>pag.</hi> 317.) <hi>that Heresy
is nothing else but a private opinion obstinately main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
contrary to the opinion which the public per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
(that is to say the Representant of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth)
hath commanded to be taught:</hi> by which he
saies, <hi>it is manifest</hi> (he hath made it manifest by
his definition) <hi>that an opinion publicly appointed to
be taught cannot be heresy, nor the Soveraign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that autorize them, Heretics.</hi> And yet he may
remember, that the doctrine of <hi>Arius,</hi> after it was
condemned by the Gatholic Church, was not
thought to be the less Heresy for the countenance
it receiv'd from two or three Emperours, or for
being allowed in the dominions of several Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and tho the Pope himself <hi>(Liberius)</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
himself from Banishment, which was inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon him, for refusing to condemn <hi>Athanasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
became likewise an <hi>Arian:</hi> so that Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>
was not the first inventor of that expedient, <hi>by
believing in the heart and denying with the mouth.</hi>
But still he is in an ill case: for his own Soveraign
hath already condemn'd him in the declaratory
Law, that whosoever contradicts any thing that
is determined by, or in the four first General
Councils, is an Heretic, and to be proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:60912:147"/>
and censured as such: which form will
not be satisfied by rejecting him, and leaving him
to himself. So that there is but one way to save
him harmless, which is his not being obstinate;
and that, whosoever knows him, or believes him,
will undertake he shall never make use of.</p>

part being against the doctrine, or the practice

them to agree as they can. In the other part he doth

of the Soul (which by no means he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows;)

that it was not arguing from Scripture, but a

not so much argue from, as insult upon the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,

of the Soul, of the Eternity of the joies of
Heaven, and the Everlastingness of the pains of Hell,
as if they were points in Controversy, when no
Christian Church in the world, makes, or admits
the least doubt to be made of either. Nor can any
man imagine, why he leads us into this his Kingdom
of Darkness, but that he may resume again all those
arguments which lie scatter'd through the several
Chapters of his Book, and which can never prevail,
whilst there is any light to direct the understanding
by. He renews his particular dream of <hi>(pag.</hi> 335.)
<hi>Gods peculiar Kingdom over the Iews only, which
ceased, and was determin'd by, and in the election of</hi>
Saul, which he saies, <hi>he hath proved at large in the
thirty fifth chapter,</hi> as he believes he had don every
thing that he hath once affirm'd, (how weakly or er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneously
soever) and from the not understanding
this, or not comprehending, <hi>that from that time of</hi>

men,</hi> he saies, <hi>are fallen in the error, that
the present Church is Christs Kingdom.</hi> But what ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation
can a man hold with him, who from
the not understanding, or believing that dissolution
of Gods Kingdom in the election of <hi>Saul</hi> (which no
body ever heard of but from him) deduces the <hi>Popes
challenging to be vicar general of Christ in the present
Church, the introduction of Purgatory, and Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,
and all other errors in the Church of</hi>
Rome, which he takes great pains to confute, and
would perswade us to believe, that the imagination
of the Immortality of the Soul is the only ground
and foundation of the general error of Eternal
Life, and Everlasting Death; which makes him so
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:60912:148"/>
solemnly endeavour to prove the nullity of either
by so many Texts of Scripture: which can never be
difficult for him to do in this, and any other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
that occurs to him to prove, whilst he may
take upon him to pervert the current sense and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of some Texts in Scripture to his own
purpose, and to wrest and torture words to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with his extravagant Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and Logic: and when
he cannot decline the taking notice of other Texts,
which manifestly controul his unnatural glosses, he
may acquiesce in a confession, that they are very
hardly to be reconcil'd with the doctrine received:
<hi>(pag.</hi> 347.) <hi>nor,</hi> he saies, <hi>is it any shame to confess the
profoundness of the Scripture to be too great to be sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the shortness of human understanding:</hi> which
being prudently, and modestly consider'd in the
beginning of this Chapter, or rather in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his Book, might have saved the labour, and
the reproch of most of the Texts of Scripture, which
he hath unwarily or absurdly quoted from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
and which presumtion and method he
continues to the end of his Book. And as I have
formerly said, if a diligent peruser of the whole
doth mark what himself saies in one place, that will
fully answer what he affirms in another, his Book
would need no other refutation. As to that part of
his most material argument against the Everlasting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Hell fire in this Chapter, that <hi>(pag.</hi> 345.)
<hi>it seems very hard to say, that God who is the Father of
mercies, that doth in Heaven and Earth all that he will,
that hath the hearts of all men in his disposal, that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in men both to do and to will, and without whose free
gift, a man hath neither an inclination to good, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
of evil, should punishments transgressions without
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:60912:149"/>
any end of time, and with all the extremity of torture,
that men can imagine, or more.</hi> All which will not
require, nor can receive a fuller answer then he
himself prescribes, when he will establish the utmost
extent of arbitrary power in his instituted Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.
He saies, (pag. 153.) <hi>it is reason, that he which
do's injury without other limitation then that of his own
will, should suffer punishment, without other limitation
then that of his will whose Law is thereby violated.</hi>
And so I shall keep him no longer company in
his Kingdom of Darkness.</p>

               <p>I Should not presume to except against so many

truth will find himself entangled in words as a
bird in lime twiggs, the more he struggles the more
belimed;</hi> and observing that rule for the most
part throughout the first parts of his Book, except
where he found it necessary for his own purpose,
sometimes to perplex and belime his Readers: yet
in the two last parts, supposing that he hath enough
captivated them to believe any thing he saies, he
takes more care to fit his definitions for the support
of his assertions, then that his assertions may na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
result from the integrity of the definitions.
Especially since he hath gotten into his Kingdom of
Darkness, he takes less care to illustrate the instances
and similies he thinks fit to use; and so good Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
may comprehend what he means, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to leave his less knowing Readers involved and
puzled amongst hard words, with which they
have not used to keep company. As he begins
this Chapter, with the definition of Sight, which
will not make any man see the farther or the better,
(pag. 352.) <hi>That sight is an imagination made by the
impression on the Organs of sight by lucid bodies, either
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:60912:150"/>
in one direct line, or in many lines reflected from O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paque,

                     </gap>ies, which produceth in living creatures, in whom
God hath placed such Organs, an imagination of the
object from whence the impression proceedeth.</hi> It may
be doubted that many of his friends, who have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
too much credit to all he saies, may have found
themselves in this definition entangled in words as a
bird in Lime twiggs. And if it were necessary in
this place to tell them what Sight is, they would
have understood him better, if he had said, that
sight is a faculty that God hath given to living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
who keep their eies open. However whether
it be clear or no it serves his turn, by his skill in
Optics, and the unskilfulness he concludes most o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men have in that science, to examine that part
of the Religion of the Gentiles, which was called
Demonology. And by the credit that kind of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
had got among the Jews, he finds a way to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul
the literal sense of the Scripture in the most
important places, and to undermine the miracles
which were wrought by our Saviour himself. Rather
then he will have his Geography and Geometry
contradicted, and because there (pag. 354) <hi>is not
any Mountain high enough,</hi> he saies, <hi>to shew him one
whole Hemisphere,</hi> he will have the Devil's carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Saviour unto a high Mountain, and all that
relates thereunto, to be nothing else but a vision,
or dream, then which no Jew could more underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
it, or Christ be more dishonour'd, then to have his
conflict with the enemy of mankind, to be look'd on
only, and consider'd as a dream.</p>
               <p>And that his Philosophy may be preserved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurt,
which assures him, <hi>that no corporeal Spirit
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:60912:150"/>
may be in a body of Flesh and Bone, full already of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
and animal Spirits,</hi> he will not believe that our
Saviour ever cast the Devil out of any man, only
(pag. 354.) <hi>that he cured those persons of madness or
Lunacy,</hi> which cures have bin wrought by many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Persons, and so would be unworthy to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd
amongst the Miracles of Christ. Nor will
he admit that Satan otherwise entred into <hi>Iudas,</hi>
then that <hi>he had a traiterous intention of selling his
Master.</hi> I wonder he doth not impute his hanging
himself afterwards, or hanging in the air, to nothing
but a fit of Melancholy.</p>
               <p>Under pretence of informing, and reforming the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in their worshipping of Images,
which he saies (and it may be reasonably) <hi>is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
of Gentilism, and rather left then brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church, he could not avoid persecuting it to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi>
which he doth not think well enough defin'd,
nor well enough defended by Christian Divines.
And remembring how he preserved himself from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
our Saviour, when he denied that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
in him (by believing in him in his heart at
the same time that he denied him,) upon his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns
command; he will not deprive his Soveraign
of that prerogative, nor be without the benefit of
his own fear in the liberty to commit Idolatry. And
therefore that he may not be thought to do any
thing out of ignorance (of wickedness he is not so
tender) he declares frankly, that (pag. 360.) <hi>to pray
to the King for fair wea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>her, or for any thing which
God only can do for us, is divine worship, and Idolatry;
on the other side, if the King compel a man to it by the
terror of death, or other great corporal punishment, it is
not Idolatry; for the worship which the Soveraign com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:60912:151"/>
to be don unto himself by the terror of his Law, is
not a sign that he that obeieth him, doth inwardly honor
him as a God, but that he is desirous to save himself from
death, or from a miserable life; and that which is not a
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gn of internal honor, is no worship, and therefore no Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</hi>
The sum is, that there is no wickedness (for
there can be no greater wickedness then Idolatry)
which a man may not commit to save his life, or to
avoid pain: which is a Thesis in Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
suitable to the rest of his policy and piety,
and might properly have bin controuled by his own
love of Justice, of which he would be thought to be
an Idolater, for he saies (pag. 74) <hi>that which gives
to human action the relish of Iustice, is a certain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
and gallantness of courage rarely found, by which
a man scorns to be beholding for the contentment of his
life, to fraud or breach of promise.</hi> And sure he hath
as great obligations to preserve him from Idolatry;
and therefore I wish, that to the great bulk of scorn
of which he is possess'd, he had that scorn likewise
added, to be beholding to such an expedient for the
preservation of his life.</p>
               <p>That this Doctrine of Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> is very perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
and destructive to the very essence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
cannot be doubted by Pious and Religious
men. But what kind of arguments to apply to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the information or conversion of him, is very
difficult to find. That which is got by reasoning
from the autority of Books, will work nothing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, (pag. 367.) <hi>because it is not knowledg, but
faith.</hi> So that the example of <hi>Socrates,</hi> who scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to redeem his life by the least trespass against
truth or ingenuity; or the Precepts and Judgments
of <hi>Seneca,</hi> will be of no force with him, tho both
great, and confessed Philosophers. What would

                  <hi>Seneca</hi> have thought or said of any corrupt way for
the prolongation of life, if he had known any thing
of the obligations of Christianity, when only upon
the strength of natural reason, he could so much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue
it. <hi>Non est vita tanti ut sudem, ut aestu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

valued life only as it was a way to somwhat

when a Christian Philosopher, who pretends to have
a full prospect of all that is most precious, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
his life at the price of disclaiming, to have

that they should patiently attend Natures pleasure,

Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> is of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Curats mind, of whom
Cardinal <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>yeuse</hi> makes mention in his Letters. When
<hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth had issued out his Interdict against
the Republick, whereby any Priest who should say
Mass, or perform any other part of his Function,
stood excommunicated; and the Republic had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
an Edict, that the Magistrates upon any Priests
refusal to say Mass, or to do any thing else that his
duty obliged him to do, should cause every such
Priest to be hanged: a Magistrate demanded of his
Neighbor Curate, whether he would say Mass;
and he making some pause, the Magistrate told
him, that if he refused, he must presently hang
him. The Curate replied with more resolution,
that he had rather be excommunicated thirty years,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:60912:152"/>
then hanged a quarter of an hour, and that Princes
did at last make an end of all quarrels by Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Peace, and then their Subjects on both sides
had the benefit of the Articles, only he had heard
that they who were hang'd had never the benefit of
any Articles, therefore for his part he would say
Mass. Yet it is probable, the autority of the Republic
would not have bin so absolute, if their injunction
had bin to have committed Idolatry. Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> is
not of <hi>Seneca</hi>'s mind, who consulted nature as much
as he, <hi>Citius mori an tardius ad rem non pertinet, bene
mori an male ad rem pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>culum.</hi> But he is too much a
Philosopher to be swaied by the dictates of other
Philosophers. Let us therefore resort to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
and put him in mind of the example of those
three in <hi>Daniel,</hi> who chose to be thrown into the hot
fiery furnace, rather then to fall down before the
Image which <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had set up; or of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
himself, who would not only not pray to the
King, but would not defer praying to God only for
thirty daies, nor would be contented to pray to him
in his heart, or in a private corner, which he might
securely have don, but would be found upon his
knees, when he knew the penalty was to be thrown
into the Lions den, as he was. And Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> will
tell you that tho they did well, they might have don
otherwise. Yet methinks he should not so easily e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
all the denunciations made by the Prophets, of
Gods judgments against <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> for their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry,
when they were only guilty of it, under the
power, and by the command of their Idolatrous
Kings. And yet that was no excuse for them: the
judgments were pronounced against the People, and
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:60912:152"/>
they underwent the punishment. But he will say it
was, because they had forsaken God in their hearts,
and were as great Idolaters as their Kings. Yet still
the fault was his, who took not care that they should
be instructed in the true knowledg of God. But
no objection out of the Scripture can weigh with
him. Let us therefore resort to himself, and to his
own reason, to convert or confute him. And he
seems not so fully satisfied in this latitude which
he hath given himself, as in other his bold asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but is more perplexed then he uses to be: To
<hi>(pag. 360.) worship God, not as inanimating or present
in the place or image, but to the end to be put in mind
of him, or of some works of his, if that place, or image
be dedicated, or set up by private autority,</hi> he saies <hi>it is I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry,
but if by the Soveraigns autority, it is not.</hi> As
if the autority of setting it up, could make that
which in it self is Idolatry, to cease to be Idolatry.
He doth acknowledg (pag. 361.) <hi>that a scandalous
worship of Images, tho it is but a seeming worship, and
may sometimes be joined with an inward and hearty
detestation of the image, and proceed only from the fear
of death, or other grievous punishment, tho it be no Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
is nevertheless a sin;</hi> and if it be a sin, no man
ought to commit it for the safety of his life, by all
the precepts which Christ and his Apostles have
left to guide us towards the next world. But that
confession keeps him not long in pain, <hi>for it is a sin</hi>
he saies (pag. 362.) <hi>only in men whose actions are
looked at by others, as lights to guide them by, whereas
the example of those we regard not, works not upon us at
all. If a Pastor lawfully called to teach and direct o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
or any other of whose knowledg there is a great o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
do external honor to an Idol for fear, unless he
make his fear and unwillingness to do it, as evident as
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:60912:153"/>
his worship, he scandalizeth his brother by seeming to
approve Idolatry; for his brother arguing from the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his teacher, or of him whose know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>edg he esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
great, concludes it to be lawful in it self. And this
scandal,</hi> he saies, <hi>is a sin, and a scandal given.</hi> Yet
in the page before he saies as positively, that (pag.
360.) <hi>it cannot be said that he that do's it, scandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth,
or layeth any stumbling block before his brother; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
how wise or learned soever he be that worshippeth
in that manner, another man cannot from thence argue
that he approveth it, but that he doth it for fear, and that
it is not his act, but the act of his Soveraign.</hi> So hard
a thing is it after such an excess to make any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch
to truth, without involving a mans self in
contradictions.</p>
               <p>He is very positive, that (<hi>pag.</hi> 362.) <hi>in a Pastor who
hath undertaken to preach Christ to all Nations, by give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such a worship to an Image, it were not only a sinful
scandal, but a perfidious forsaking his charge.</hi> And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
this obligation upon the Pastor to suffer in such
a case, is I think the only priviledg he grants him
above other men: for we shall find hereafter, that
he thinks himself qualified to preach as well as he.
And that he may not be thought too indifferent in
the matter it self, he doth confess, that (pag. 362.)
<hi>for an unlearned man, that is in the power of an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
King, or State, if commanded upon pain of death
to worship before an Idol, he detesteth the Idol in his
heart, he doth well, tho if he had the fortitude to suffer
death rather then worship it, he should do better.</hi> And
it is observable, that tho he makes such a kind of
worshipper the more or the less scandalous by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
he doth not presume (tho he would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
to do so) to absolve him from sin. For tho
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:60912:153"/>
the notoriety and example, may be an aggravation
of the sin, yet it cannot make that a sin, that was in
it self no sin; nor can the secrecy of committing it,
make that which in it self is sin, become no sin.
And therefore whether it amount to Idolatry or no,
no terror of death ought to prevail over any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
to commit that sin. Whether his Pedigree of
Idolatry be well derived from the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> is not
worth the inquiry, since he takes so little care for the
shutting it out of the Christian Church. For the
Canonizing of Saints, and the Popes assuming the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of <hi>Pontifex Maximus,</hi> (the remembrance of which
office in the Roman State, might have put him in
mind to have retracted what he said before, of the
admitting the exercise of all Religions in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public)
and the abridging his Universal Jurisdiction,
tho he gives him more then ever <hi>Constantine</hi> is sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested

of Images, and the original of Wax-candles,
and Torches lighted, and the information he gives
us of Holy-water, and some Processions, I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him to some of his friends of the Roman Church,
who in truth are in too great an arrear to him; for
which they make no excuse that I have heard, but
that they never think themselves concern'd to write
against a <hi>Mahometan.</hi>

they have bin in all times eminent Opposers of the
Papal Power, and are at present the greatest Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks
Christendom hath against that Tyranny, and
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:60912:154"/>
the propagation of the Roman Doctrine; I may
justly say, that the other famous Universities of
<hi>Europe,</hi> tho in Popish Countries, as the <hi>Sorbone,
Lovain,</hi> and even <hi>Salamanca</hi> it self, have bin so far
from advancing the most pernicious point of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
(I call it most pernicious, because it is most
destructive to the peace of Christendom) the most
Supreme and Universal Jurisdiction of the Pope,
(which if rejected as it ought to be, there would
quickly be as much unity of opinion amongst Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
as Christianity it self requires) that they all
contradicted it as long as their Civil Soveraign
would permit. And as the <hi>Sorbone</hi> still continues its
vigor, as enjoying a freer air; so the other two have
not deserved, by any demonstration they have made,
to be suspected to have degenerated from the spirit
that possessed them in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> when
the Pope was more afraid of their Bishops, then of
the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> himself, or of the two
Crowns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> And truly, it might
be wished, that in this Chapter, he had either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
to have asked that question, (<hi>pag.</hi> 373.) <hi>to
what purpose such subtlety was in a discourse of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
where he pretends to nothing but what is necessary to
the doctrine of Government and obedience;</hi> or that he
had given a clearer and more satisfactory answer,
then by saying, that it is <hi>to that purpose, that men may
no longer suffer themselves to be abus'd by them, that by
the doctrine of separated Essences, built on the vain Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
of</hi> Aristotle, <hi>would fright them from obeying the
Laws of their Countries, as men fright Birds from the
corn with an emty doublet, a hat, and a crooked stick.</hi>
It is not possible that Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> can believe that
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:60912:155"/>
many of those who are most guilty of disobeying
the Laws, or have openly and rebelliously opposed
the Soveraign power in his own Country, or in Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Kingdoms, have ever bin led into it by the
<hi>doctrine of separated Essences,</hi> which very terms few
of them have ever heard of. And if the Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Soul, which he thinks so great an absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
hath some dependance upon the opinion of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
Essences, it will still as little concern that
Classis of Men, against whom he intends to inveigh,
who rather believe they have no Souls at all, then
that they are immortal, (the belief of which, would
make them more consider what is like to become of
them by their wicked and rebellious lives) to which
they are most like to be induced by Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s
Doctrine, that the Soul and Body die together, which
would secure them from a world of troublesom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions.
He knew too well the Lord <hi>Say,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pim,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> who first promoted the Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> who conducted it, to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that they were corrupted to it by the Doctrine
of separated Essences. And if <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and <hi>Vane,</hi>
and <hi>Ireton,</hi> who carried it much farther then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
intended to do, and made it incapable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,
grew better inform'd of the mischiefs
of that Doctrine, it was after the publication of the
<hi>Leviathan;</hi> and yet they continued more of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
then most other men, in the literal sense, that
Faith, and Wisdom, and other Virtues, were som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>pour'd into them,</hi> and somtimes <hi>blown into them
from Heaven,</hi> and yet were not more Rebels from
that opinion then they were before: with which
words Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> renews his mirth, more then he
hath cause for, except it be for their sakes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:60912:155"/>
If he were constant to his own assertions, and did
not think himself oblig'd to defend every new De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
he thinks fit to give (as in the beginning of
this Chapter, he makes a very new Definition of
Philosophy, never heard of before, nor applicable
to any Philosophy but his own) a man might won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that he should so categorically pronounce, that,
(<hi>pag.</hi> 367.) that <hi>Original Knowledg, called Experience,
in which consisteth Prudence, is no part of Philosophy,
because it is not attain'd by reasoning, but found as well
in brute beasts as in man, and is but a memory of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions
of events in times past, wherein the omission of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
little circumstance, altering the effect, frustrateth
the expectation of the most prudent, whereas nothing is
produced by reasoning aright, but general, eternal, and
immutable truth.</hi> How is this consistent with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
he formerly gave (<hi>pag.</hi> 79) that <hi>Moral
Philosophy is nothing else, but the science of what is good
and evil, in the conversation and society of mankind?</hi>
for now he excludes all this from being any part of
Philosophy. Which may make some men apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that he doth not reason aright in words he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands;
for he saies (<hi>pag.</hi> 367.) <hi>that he who reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
aright in words he understandeth, can never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
an error.</hi> So that if we have discover'd any
error throughout his Book (and we are monstrously
in the fault, if we have not in such abundant choice)
we may without presumtion conclude by his own
rule, that either he hath not reasoned aright, or that
he hath don it in words that he doth not understand.
And he would have don well to have informed us,
what those brute Beasts are in whom that original
knowledg, called Experience, in which consisteth
Prudence, is found, as well as in man. I shall not
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:60912:156"/>
labor to reconcile him to the Schole-men, with whose
Learning I am not much in love, nor do believe that
they have made any necessary or useful knowledg
much more clear, or easie by their Definitions or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions;
and do often wish, that very many of
them had bin bred Artificers, and Handy-craft-men,
in which they would have don the world much more
good, and Learning much less hurt. And as Canon
and Gun-powder were first the Invention of a Monk,
or a Friar, so I believe some of the Schole-men
would have bin excellent Lock-smiths, or Ship-carpenters,
and would have enriched the World with
many useful Discoveries and Inventions. And
more I shall not say to their Language, or to the
errors of Tradition, or the other enormities of the
Roman Church, which he takes alwaies in his way,
let the subject of his Discourse be what it will; and
I wish they would be provoked by him to consider
and amend their faults.</p>
               <p>Nor will I take any pains to disswade Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>
from taking upon him to preach, but shall only put
him in mind that if he doth, he thereby becomes a
Pastor, by which he will deprive himself of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
by his own Doctrine, to deny our Saviour, or
to worship an Image, upon what autority or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
soever. And if he finds himself among the
Idolaters of <hi>America,</hi> he will I doubt, as good a
Christian as he is, forbear to preach Jesus Christ,
when he remembers that he is without a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
and what judgment he hath pronounced
against the poor <hi>Indian</hi> that shall come into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
to change the Religion that is here establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de.
But above all, whatever latitude his Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,
at that time when his <hi>Levia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

permitted for the performing those Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

will not give him that liberty, until he receives or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

               <head>The Survey of Chapter
47.</head>
               <p>IF Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> hath in this his last Chapter disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
the true causes of that darkness, which hath
hitherto hindred this new devouring light of his
from breaking in upon us, we have more obligations
to the Papists and Presbyterians, then I knew we
had: however, I shall not gratifie him, by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
to vindicate either of them from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches
he charges them with; nor will I take upon
me to reply to his sly and bitter Insinuations against
the Clergy in all kinds, Protestants as well as Papists,
in a thread that runs through his Book from one end
to the other. They are of age, let them speak for
themselves. Only I cannot but observe, and I should
be unexcusable if I should not, that after all his
bitter and uncharitable Invectives against the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Clergy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and of
which he would still be thought a member, he hath
not in this his last Chapter of <hi>Cui bono,</hi> bin able to
fasten the least reproch upon them, of being swaied
by any other motives then the most abstracted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
of Conscience, Duty, Gratitude, and
Generosity, constantly and stedfastly to adhere to
the King: since they had in their view, before the
Civil War was begun, all the prejudice to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and all the destruction to their Interest that
fell out afterwards; and had their election, whether
they would, besides keeping what they were posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of, receive greater additions and graces from
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:60912:157"/>
those who opposed the King, or by continuing faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to Him, be dispossessed of all they had, be cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Prisons (and new Prisons made for them in old
Ships and Barques upon the Water) and with such
circumstances of inhumanity, that put a short end
to the lives of many thousands of them, their Wives
and Children. And they chose the latter, and to be
exposed to all the misery and contemt imaginable,
rather then to dissemble or concele that Fidelity and
Allegiance they ow'd to their King, in the highest of
his Afflictions and Persecution: and from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his execrable Murder, continued the same
Affection and Loialty to his Son, their present Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
when the triumphant and victorious Faction
made it penal to acknowledg Him, or to give Him
the Title of King. And therefore it was below the
education of Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> and a very ungenerous and
vile thing, to publish his <hi>Leviathan</hi> with so much
malice and acrimony against the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
when it was scarce strugling in its own ruines; and
against all the Bishops and Clergy of the same, when
many of them were weltering in their own blood
upon Scaffolds, and the rest reduced to all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
human nature can be exposed to, without any
suggestion of a Crime, but of Fidelity to the King.
When the Reverend Bishops who were left alive,
and out of Prison, being stripped of all that was
their own, preserved themselves from Famine, by
stooping to the lowest Offices of teaching Schole,
and officiating in private Families for their Bread;
which, together with the alms of those charitable
persons who were themselves undon, was all the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that the poor Bishops, and all the faithful Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> had to preserve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:60912:158"/>
in the low condition to which they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.
And it is but justice to the memory of those
Persons, and for the everlasting glory of that
Church, to say, that the whole Orthodox Clergy
were joint sufferers with, and for the Crown; and
that very few can be named, who were ever reputed
or looked upon as Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
that adhered to, or concurred with the Rebels.
Some few impious Apostates in the beginning of the
Rebellion became perjur'd, to satisfie their ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the countenance of the great Incendiaries,
who paid them well for their labor. Afterwards,
they made and ordained their own Clergy, and then
undertook and performed the Function themselves,
their own Creatures finding them too wicked to be
complied with, whil'st the true Clergy somtimes lost
their lives upon Scaffolds, somtimes on Gibbets for
the greater disgrace, to give testimony of their fast
and unshaken Loialty to the King; and others died
in Prisons, or lurked in obscure, but safe and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
corners.</p>
               <p>These were the men who propagated Loialty and
Allegiance with the utmost hazard of their lives,
when it was near extirpation; countermined the
stratagems which were every day set on foot, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
the affections of those who had paid dear for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good Subjects, and to make them weary of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so great losers for conscience sake; when Mr.
<hi>Hobbes</hi> his <hi>Leviathan</hi> absolv'd all men from their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance,
and industriously perswaded all sorts of
men, that <hi>Cromwell</hi> was their true and lawful So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,
and that it was folly and guilt, and inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
deserved ruin, not to adhere to him, and assist
him against any opposition soever. These are the
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:60912:158"/>
men who as diligently administred Antidotes against
his Poison, prevented the operation of it in many,
and the application of it to more; watched the tares
which he, and others of his party scattered abroad,
and pulled them up before they got strength to grow
to do the mischief he intended; and, tho they were
all banish'd the Universities, and durst not be seen
there, that his vile Principles, or as bad, might take
root and flourish there; yet found means to preserve
and purifie those Nurseries, and keep those Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
clean, and so to cultivate Learning and good
Manners there; that whil'st the chief Governors
were placed there as <hi>Olivers</hi> Centinels, to keep the
Protestant Religion from entring into his Disciples,
to instruct those who were under his charge to be
good Subjects to him, that seed brought up very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
fruit; but the Elements of Duty and Allegiance
to their absent, banished, lawful Soveraign, were
sucked in greedily by them, and flourished accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.
In a word, these were the men, who were
look'd upon with esteem and reverence by all the
Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdom, who retain'd
their affection and duty towards the King entirely in
their hearts, and thereby the opportunity to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
many notable Services to the King, and to give
him useful Advertisements; and having unquestion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
credit in a treacherous and perfidious season, when
Children betrayed their Fathers, Servants their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and Friends one another, were trusted by all
men; and so having no farther care for themselves,
then to live very meanly, they became Treasurers
and Almoners for all indigent Gentlemen who had
served the King, or desired so to do; and relieved very
many of that kind, that they might be ready upon a
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:60912:159"/>
good opportunity to serve his Majesty, and not be
forced to go to him, who had not wherewith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them. They discharged the expense of many
expresses, which were frequently sent to the King,
and from him, which amounted to a great charge;
and contributed much to the maintenance of those
of the Clergy who faithfully attended his Majesties
Person, and often transmitted such sums of mony
to his Majesty himself, as were very seasonable
supplies to him in great distresses. I can have no
end, and have no temtation to say all this, but hold
my self obliged to Justice and truth to give this
testimony, since all the particulars are well known
to me, having at that time the honor to be in some
trust with his Majesty, and thereby the full know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of what then passed, of which there are not
now many other witnesses amongst the living. And
therefore I could not omit this proper season in the

for the scandal he hath brought upon Religion,
upon the best constituted Church of the World,
and upon the most Learned Clergy of any Church,
and the most irreconcilable to any thing that is er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous,

therefore looks upon them as the only conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and formidable Enemy they have to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter.</p>
               <p>I shall not need to take any pains to remove him
from the good opinion he had of Independency
when he published his Book, because (pag. 385.)
<hi>it left every man to do what liked him best in Religion,</hi>
                  <pb n="309" facs="tcp:60912:159"/>
as he saies, but in truth because <hi>Cromwell</hi> was then
thought to be of that faction. But I dare say he
did with his heart, as well as by his tongue, quit that
party the very day that the King was proclaimed, as
he is ready to quit all his other Opinions true or false,
assoon as the Soveraign power shall please to require
him; which makes whatever he saies, the less to need
answering. And I shall be less solicitous to deprive
the Pope of his new Kingdom of <hi>Fairies,</hi> with the
title to which Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> hath gratified him, to
allay that fear, and apprehension which he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
so much before to infuse into the minds
of all Princes, of his dangerous greatness and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
if at last prove no more then the King of <hi>Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
hath, it is less terrible then he represented it to
be. But since he hath not thought fit to retain that
modesty which he professed to have, (pag. 241.)
<hi>that tho he had proved his Doctrine out of places of
Scripture not few nor obscure, yet because it will appear
to most men a novelty, he did but propound it, maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing in this, or any other Paradox of Religion,
but attending the end of that dispute of the sword, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the autority (not yet amongst his Country-men
decided) by which all sorts of Doctrine are to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
or rejected, and whose commands both in speech
and writing (whatsoever be the opinions of private men)
must by all men, who mean to be protected by their Laws be
obeied;</hi> notwithstanding which reservation, and
after he hath seen that dispute of the Sword con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the autority amongst his Country men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided,
after he hath seen that Prodigy of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
whom he acknowledged to be his Soveraign,
instituted and adored by him, exposed upon the
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:60912:160"/>
Gallows, and his Carcass placed upon the stage that
is reserved for the most infamous Traitors and
Rebels, and all his actions condemned and detested
by the whole Nation (all which were govern'd and
steered exactly by Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> his own Institution,
and sufficiently shew how insecure they will prove
to any man that observes them) and after he hath
seen his true and lawful Soveraign, his disavowed
and renounced Soveraign, and whose Subjects he
had absolv'd from his obedience, restored and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
with the universal and unexpressible joy of
his three Kingdoms, and thereby his whole Doctrine
with reference to the Ecclesiastical as well as Civil
Government, disavowed and condemn'd, and not
exemplarily punished only by his Majesties gracious
observation of the Act of Indemnity, of which
few Subjects have more need: it is too malicious an
obstinacy and perversness in him, still to adhere to his
odious Paradoxes, both in his Conversation and by
private Transcripts, which he labors to get printed,
and was never more solicitous to have his most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
Doctrines to be published and confirm'd
by autority, (the ill consequence whereof to himself,
he despises the learning of the Law too much to
understand.) And as he would allow no other right
to the Subject in his Liberty or Propriety, but
what the Soveraigns silence hath permitted in not
taking it from him, as to dwell where he pleases,
and educate his Children as he thinks fit, and the
like: so he interprets the present silence of the Law,
as an approbation of those his monstrous Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
which it knows not how to contradict, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the while that this silence of the Law can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be broken, but in the loud inflicting those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:60912:160"/>
punishments upon him, as without the shelter
of that Soveraigns mercy whom he so much despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and provoked, would at once in his ruine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit
all his vain Philosophy, and more pernicious
Theology; and he would find the Successors of Sr.
<hi>Edward Cooke,</hi> with whose great ignorance he makes
himself so merry, learned enough to instruct him
in the duty, and reverence, that is due from all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects

having now walked to the end of his fourth part,
before we take a view of his Review and Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we will observe the same method we did at the
end of his two first parts, and according to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
himself gives in his examination of <hi>Bellarmines</hi>
Doctrine, lay open his conclusions, and Principles
in Religion, which lie scatter'd through those other
two parts, that men may take a view of the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
and bethink themselves, whether Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
be advanc'd, and consequently whether the
peace and happiness of mankind be provided for,
and secured by such Doctrines.</p>
               <p>1. Those Books of Scripture only are Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical,

everlasting after the Resurrection. But it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:60912:161"/>
therefore be inferr'd, that he who shall be
cast into that fire, or be tormented with those
torments, shall endure and resist them so, as to
be eternally burned and tortured, and yet
never be destroied, or die. <hi>pag.</hi> 245.</p>
               <p>7. There shall be a second death of every
one that shall be condemn'd at the day of
judgment, after which he shall die no more. The
Scriptures affirm not, that there shall be an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life therein of any individual person, but
to the contrary, an everlasting Death. <hi>pag.</hi> 245.</p>
               <p>8. The Salvation we are to look for, is
to be upon the Earth. For since Gods Throne
is in Heaven, and the Earth is his Footstool,
it is not for the dignity of so great a King,
that his Subjects should have any place so
high as his Throne, or higher then his Foot-stool.

               <p>9. If we be commanded by our lawful Prince
to say we do not believe in Christ, we may obey
such his command. <hi>pag.</hi> 271.</p>
               <p>10. None can be Martyrs for Christ,
but they that conversed with him on Earth,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:60912:162"/>
and saw him after he was risen; for a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
must have seen what he testifieth, or else
his testimony is not good. <hi>pag.</hi> 272.</p>
               <p>11. None can be a Martyr who hath not
a warrant to preach Christ come in the Flesh,
and none but such who are sent to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of Infidels. <hi>pag.</hi> 273.</p>
               <p>12. To teach out of the old Testament that
Iesus was Christ, and risen from the Dead,
is not to say, that men are bound after they
believe it, to obey those who tell them so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Laws and commands of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns,
but they do wisely to expect the
coming of Christ hereafter in patience, and
faith, with obedience to their present Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
<hi>pag.</hi> 274.</p>
               <p>13. The autority of Earthly Soveraigns
being not to be put down till the day of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it is manifest we do not in Baptism con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
over us another autority, by which our
external actions are to be governed in this life.
<hi>pag.</hi> 274.</p>
               <p>14. They who received not the Doctrine
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:60912:162"/>

               <p>15. Christian Kings have power to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize,

and to Consecrate both Temples and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to Gods service, &amp;c. 297.</p>

<hi>pag.</hi> 345.</p>
               <p>17. To pray voluntarily to the King for
fair weather, or for any thing that God only
can do for us, is divine worship, and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
but if a King compel a man to it by the
terror of death, or other great corporal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it is not Idolatry. <hi>pag.</hi> 360.</p>
               <p>17. If one being no Pastor, or of eminent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
for knowledg in Christian Doctrine,

he had no cause to follow such example. <hi>pag.</hi>

               <p>And now I hope he hath made an ample Paraphrase
upon Religion, according to the definition he g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of it in the first entrance of his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> when
he defines <hi>(pag.</hi> 26.) <hi>Religion, to be f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

to grow from, or to consist in, <hi>are opinion of
ghosts, ignorance of second causes, devotion towards
what men fear, and taking things casual for Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These, amongst others, are the Doctrines of Mr.
<hi>Hobbes</hi> in his two last parts; which, I believe, in the
judgment of most Christians, are assoon renounc'd
as pronounc'd, and which indeed need little other
confutation then the reciting them; yet I doubt not,
many men will say, how scandalous soever the asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
seem to be, (since he appeals to the Scripture,
and cites several Texts out of the same, for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
good the worst of his Opinions) it is pity that
his ignorance, or perverseness in those Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
had not bin made appear, by manifesting that
those places of Scripture could not admit that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation,
and what the genuine sense thereof is.
Which consideration had bin more reasonable and
necessary, if these Errors had bin publish'd, and those
Glosses made and own'd by any National Church,
or any Body of Learned men; but it may be thought
too great a presumtion for a private man, a stranger
to Divinity, to take upon him to put unnatural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations
upon several Texts of Scripture, the
better to apply them, and make them subservient to
his own corrupt purposes and opinions, contrary to
the whole current of Scripture, and to the Doctrine
thereof, and without the least autority or shadow,
that the like Interpretation was ever made before by
any other man: I say, such a person cannot reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
expect, that any body should too seriously
examine all his frivolous and light suggestions, and
endeavor to vindicate those Texts from such impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:60912:163"/>
Interpretations. Yet if any man thinks it worth
his pains, I am well content that he receive that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
and will still hope that Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> may be so
well instructed in the true sense and end of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
that he may better discern the eternity of the
reward and punishment in the next World. And so
we conclude our discourse upon his Book, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
what he saies in his Conclusion.</p>
               <p>The Review and Conclusion, is only an abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and contracting the most contagious poison
that runs through the Book, into a less vessel or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume,
least they, who will not take the pains to read
the Book, or reading it may by inadvertency and
incogitancy not be hurt enough by it, may here in
less room, and more nakedly, swallow his choicest
Doctrine at one morsel: and is in truth, a sly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> that being then out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and so being neither conquered nor his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
he might by his return submit to his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and be bound to obey; it which, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compelled
by any necessity or want, but having as
much to sustain him abroad as he had to live upon
at home, could not proceed from a sincere heart and
uncorrupted. This Review and Conclusion he made
short enough, to hope the <hi>Cromwell</hi> himself might
read it; where he should not only receive the pawn
of his new Subjects Allegiance, by his declaring his
own obligation and obedience, but by publishing
such Doctrine, as being diligently infused by such a
Master in the mystery of Government, might secure
the People of the Kingdom (over whom he had no
right to command) to acquiesce and submit to his
Brutal Power. And in order to that, he takes upon
him very positively to declare (which no man had
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:60912:164"/>
ever presumed to do before) the precise time when
Subjects become obliged to submit to the Conqueror;
and saies, <hi>(pag.</hi> 390.) that time is, <hi>as to an ordinary
Subject, when the means of his life is within the guards
and garrisons of the enemy; and for him who hath nearer
obligations, he hath liberty to submit to his new Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
when his old one can give him protection no longer.</hi>
And he is very careful that it may be the more taken
notice of, to insert in another Letter his Maxime,
<hi>(pag.</hi> 390.) that <hi>every man is bound by nature, as much
as in him lies, to protect in War the autority by which he
is himself protected in time of Peace.</hi> All which he
saies, appears by consequence from those Laws
which he hath mentioned throughout his Book, <hi>(pag.</hi>
390.) <hi>yet that the times require to have it inculcated and
remembred;</hi> which shall not oblige me to recapitulate
what hath bin said before upon the Propositions.
And he is so fearful that <hi>Cromwell</hi> was not solicitous
enough for his own security, that he tells him in
his Review (which he had not before said in his
Book <hi>(pag.</hi> 392.) that <hi>Conquerors must require not only
a submission of mens actions to them for the future, but
also an approbation of all their actions past.</hi> Which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
he followed as far as he could, till he found it too
unreasonable to impose, even upon those who had
concurred with him in most of the mischief that he
had don. And least he should be too scrupulous and
modest in using the power he had, and too apt to be
amused with reproches, he saies, <hi>(pag.</hi> 392.) <hi>the tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of a professed hatred of Tyranny, is a toleration
of hatred to Commonwealth in general;</hi> to the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancy
of which Assertion, enough hath bin said
before. These are the choice Flowers he hath bound
up together in his Review, least the odor of them
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:60912:164"/>
might lose some of its fragrancy in the bigness of
the Book. And having with great tenderness provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that no man should think it lawful to kill him;
and insinuated as much, and with as much virulency
as he could, a prejudice to the Roial party; he
gives his own testimony of his whole Doctrine, and
saies, <hi>(pag.</hi> 394.) the <hi>Principles of it are true, and
proper, and the ratiocination solid;</hi> and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
<hi>that it might be profitably printed, and more
profitably taught in the Vniversities, &amp;c.</hi> and other
Licence then his own it never had to be printed.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> knows well, that a mans testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
in his own behalf, is not valid; and if mine
could carry any autority with it, I would make no
scruple to declare, that I never read any Book that
contains in it so much Sedition, Treason, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety
as this <hi>Leviathan;</hi> and therefore that it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unfit to be read, taught, or sold, as dissolving all
the ligaments of Government, and undermining all
principles of Religion. I do not with that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
should be ordered to recant, because he would
be too ready to do it upon his declared <hi>Salvo:</hi> nor
do I wish he should undergo any other punishment,
then by knowing that his Book is condemned by the
Soveraign Autority, to be publickly burn'd, which
by his own judgment will restrain him from publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his pernicious Doctrine in his Discourses, which
have don more mischief then his Book. And I
would be very willing to preserve the just testimony
which he gives to the memory of <hi>Sidny Godolphin,</hi>
who deserved all the Eulogy that he gives him, and
whose untimely loss in the beginning of the War,
was too lively an instance of the inequality of the
contention, when such inestimable Treasure was ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:60912:165"/>
against dirty people of no name, and whose
irreparable loss was lamented by all men living who
pretended to Virtue, how much divided soever in
the prosecution of that quarrel. But I find my self
temted to add, that of all men living, there were no
two more unlike then Mr. <hi>Godo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>phin</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi>
in the modesty of nature, or integrity of manners;
and therefore it will be too reasonably suspected,
that the freshness of the Legacy rather put him in
mind of that Noble Gentleman, to mention him in
the fag-end of his Book very unproperly, and in a
huddle of many unjustifiable and wicked particulars,
when he had more seasonable occasion to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
him in many parts of his Book. However,
I cannot forbear to put him in mind, that I gave him,
for an expiation of my own defects, and any tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes
which I may have since committed against
him, the Friendship of that great Person; and first
informed him of that Legacy, which had not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
bin paid before the printing his Review. And
for my own part, I shall conclude as I begun, with
the profession of so much esteem of his parts, and
reverence for his very vigorous age, (which in, and
for it self is venerable) that in order to his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to be a good Subject, and a good Christian, I
could be well content, that as he seems to wish in
his Commentary upon the Fourth Commandment,
<hi>(pag.</hi> 178.) <hi>as the Iews had every seventh day, in which
the Law was read and expounded; so he thinks it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
that some such times be determined, wherein the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
may assemble together, and (after Praiers and Praises
given to God the Soveraign of Soveraigns) hear those
their duties told them,</hi> which are prescribed in this his
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:60912:165"/>
                  <hi>Leviathan; and the positive Laws, such as generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
them all, read and expounded, and be put in mind of
the autority that maketh them Laws:</hi> so I say, I should
not be displeased, if himself were allowed to make
choice of his own Sabbaths, to read his Lectures in
both Universities, and if he desired it afterwards, in
the City, upon those <hi>Theses,</hi> which for his ease are
faithfully collected in this answer out of his Book.
And if this exercise doth not cure him, I could wish
that the same application and remedy might be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by which the Emperor <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> cured
the censoriousness and ambition of <hi>Ovinius Camillus,</hi>
who was as old, and loved his ease as well as Mr.
<hi>Hobbes;</hi> yet being not satisfied with the present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of affairs (and from thence became very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular)
he had a purpose to make himself Emperor.
Of which <hi>Severus</hi> being inform'd, and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
and examin'd the full truth of it, he sent for
him, and gave him thanks, as <hi>Aelius Spartianus</hi> tells
us, <hi>Quod curam Reipub. quae recusantibus bonis impone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur,
sponte reciperet:</hi> and thereupon took him full of
fear, and terrified with the Conscience of his own
guilt, with him to the Senate, <hi>participem Imperii ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellavit,
in Palatium recepit, &amp; Ornament is Imperialibus,
&amp; melioribus quam ipse utebatur, affecit.</hi> Afterwards,
when there was occasion of an Expedition against
the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> he offered him, <hi>vel ipsum si vellet ire,
vel ut secum proficisceretur;</hi> which he chusing, and
<hi>Severus</hi> himself walking still on foot with his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league,
who had accompanied him for many daies
with intolerable fatigue, the Emperor caused a horse
to be brought to him, upon which having rode some
daies, as much tired as before, <hi>carpento imposuit.</hi> The
conclusion was, he was so weary and ready to die un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:60912:166"/>
the command, that <hi>abdicavit Imperium;</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus</hi>
after he had commended him to the Soldiers,
<hi>tutum ad villas suas ire praecepit, in quibus diu vixit.</hi>
I should be very glad that Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> might have a
place in Parliament, and sit in Counsel, and be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in Courts of Justice, and other Tribunals;
whereby it is probable he would find, that his solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
cogitation, how deep soever, and his too perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
adhering to some Philosophical Notions, and
even Rules of Geometry, had misled him in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestigation
of Policy, and would rather retire to
his quiet quarter in the <hi>Peak,</hi> without envy of those
whom he left in emploiment, then keep them longer
company in so toilsom, uneasie, and ungrateful
Transactions. And possibly this might, and I doubt
only could, prevail upon him, to make such recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
and acknowledgment of all the falshood,
profaneness, impiety and blasphemy in his Book,
as may remove all those rubs and disturbances, which
he may justly apprehend, as well in the way to his
last Journy, as at the end of it, if he be not terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with that disinal Pronunciation, <hi>If we sin willful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
after that we have received the knowledg of the truth,
there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, but a certain
fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation,
which shall devour the adversaries.</hi>
