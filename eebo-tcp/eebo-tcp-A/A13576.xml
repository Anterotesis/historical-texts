            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Thys sum is infinite and not to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.

The Million of Talents of siluer, valueth sixe hundred Millions of Crownes, according to the estimate of <hi>Budaeus</hi> in hys Booke of Coynes. Where speaking of the tryumphes of <hi>Caesar,</hi> he saith, that he caused to be brought into the publique Treasurie, three-score and fiue thousand Talents of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, which valued nine and thirty Millions of Crownes. He maketh also the like men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where he speaketh of <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> who tooke <hi>Craesus</hi> and his treasure, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to fiue hundred thousand Talents of siluer, which value three hundred Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Gold.</p>
               <p>It is written in the second Chapter of the third booke of Kings, that in the time of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> he had so much siluer out of <hi>Iudea,</hi> as there was not any account made thereof.</p>
               <p>The shyps belonging to <hi>Salomon</hi> &amp; king <hi>Hyram,</hi> went by three and three yeerely to

                  <hi>Tharsus,</hi> whence they brought great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of Gold and siluer; in so much that (as the Text saith) there was such store of gold and siluer in Ierusalem, as the King estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med therof no otherwise then of stones: the Vessels and all the vtencelles together of the house of <hi>Lybanon,</hi> was of fine Gold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iosephus</hi> in his seauenth booke of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, witnesseth, that <hi>Dauid</hi> when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceassed left greater riches, then any other King, were he Hebrewe or Gentile, which was hydden within his Sepulchre, as also in the Coffer or Vessell monumentarie, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bones and ashes of the Kinges were wont to be kept, so that his treasure was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie hard to be found.</p>
               <p>Likewise in the ninth Booke of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelicall preparation, he sayth, that hee hath read in <hi>Eupolemus</hi> an auncient Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, that the King of <hi>Tyre</hi> and of <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> with many other beside, were tributaries to King <hi>Dauid:</hi> from whom hee conquered these Treasures by force of Armes, and by the Diuine fore-pointment, the place was shewen him where the Temple shoulde be builded. But because hee had soyled his hands with blood-shed in warre, it was told him that he should not builde the fore-saide Temple. Wherefore he prepared so great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance
<pb facs="tcp:1110:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as he could, of gold, siluer, brasse, stones, Tymber of Cipres and Cedar, and sent it into the Ile which hee called <hi>Urpha,</hi> situate in the Red-sea, which was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully stored with Mines of Gold, and from whence was brought an innumerable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie.</p>
               <p>After his deceasse, <hi>Salomon</hi> wrote Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the King of <hi>Egipt</hi> named <hi>Uafres,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner. <hi>Salomon King of Iudea, to Vafres his friende King of Egipt, perpetuall health.

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I require thee to send me Maisters of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, Stone-cutters, Carpenters, and workmen, who may erect for me the said Temple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These Letters receiued by the King of <hi>Egipt,</hi> were in this manner answered. <hi>I sende thee eyght score thousand men, such as are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert &amp; chiefe in erecting of buildings, euen such as thou hast required of me.</hi> Like Letters wrote <hi>Salomon,</hi> to <hi>Suron</hi> King of <hi>Tyre,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing like aunswere, and like number of Maisters in workes and buildings.</p>

This History written by <hi>Eupolemus</hi> an Historian Gentile, agreeth in euery part with the holy Scripture, as in the fift Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the thirde booke of the Kinges: and there is no other difference, but onely that concerning <hi>Tyre,</hi> where he calleth the king of <hi>Tyre Suron,</hi> the Scripture nameth hym <hi>Hyram.</hi>

                  <hi>Iosephus</hi> in the eyght Booke of his Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, saith, that these two Epistles or Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of King <hi>Salomon</hi> and King <hi>Hyram,</hi> were in his tyme intirely sound and perfect, both in <hi>Tyre</hi> and in <hi>Iudea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eupolemus</hi> passeth further, and sayth, that all the gold which was imployed about the Temple, the Colloms and Vessels of Gold, amounted to foure Millions, and sixe hundred thousand Crownes: The siluer for the nayles and other thinges, valued twelue hundred and thirtie two Talents.</p>
               <p>After the work-men were contented, &amp; they of Egypt sent home into theyr Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, as also the men of <hi>Tyre,</hi> the sum that was gyuen to each one for his paines, was tenne Talents of Gold.</p>
               <p>The dispence of the Temple, according to <hi>Budaeus,</hi> amounted to twentie seauen Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, nine hundred thousande Crownes of the Sunne, and twelue hundred thirtie-two
<pb facs="tcp:1110:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Talents of siluer: which come to seauen hundred, thirty seauen thousande Crownes of the Crowne.</p>
               <p>Yet is not comprised in this sum, what was giuen to three-score and ten thousande Labourers, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mention is made in the 5. chapter of the 1.

               <p>It is written in the second booke of the Chronicles, the fourth Chapter, <hi>That all the Vessels, Basons, Candlesticks, Censors, Lampes, Organes, and other musicall instruments of the Temple, the Alsar, the Ports, the Tables, and Hindges were of pure gold.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>This Crowne was made of greene hearbs,
<pb facs="tcp:1110:30"/>
they not esteeming or respecting to make it of Gold or other Mettall: but onelie of the hearbes of the fielde, from whence the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie had beene chased.

                  <hi>Corona Ciuica,</hi> or the Cittizen Crowne, was a Garland made of the leaues of an Oa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken bough, with the fruite vpon it: and this was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to him, that in extreame peril saued a Cittizen, killing his enemy, and defending still manfully the place where the occasion happened. This Crowne or Garlande was so much esteemed, as readily a man shoulde be founde that had saued a Romaine Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, who at his deliuerance had slaine two of his enemies: but because hee coulde not maintaine and defende the place, according as it was appointed, they doubted whether they had deserued this Cittizen Crowne or no. Notwithstanding it was concluded, that such a one should be dispensed withall, and
<pb facs="tcp:1110:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it was graunted him, seeing he had deliuered the Cittizen and slaine two ofhis enemies in a place so dangerous: that (beyond his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) he should not stand to defend the same, albeit the poynt of the Law consisted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <p>And although one had deliuered a King, or a Captaine of the Confederats &amp; friends, yet might not this Garlande bee giuen him, without he had deliuered a <hi>Romaine.</hi> I finde that <hi>Plinie</hi> saith, that the selfe same Crowne was giuen to him, who slewe the first enemy that mounted on the walles of any Citty or Fortresse defended by the <hi>Romaines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then was this Cittizen Crown the most excellent, next after the <hi>Obsidionall,</hi> and it might be worne at all times, &amp; in all places. And if hee that had deserued this Crowne, were of such esteeme, that in feastes or The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aters he alwaies had his place neerest to the Senate, &amp; when he entred, the Senate would rise on foote to doe him honour: he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so exempt &amp; free from any office or charge what-soeuer, vnlesse himselfe pleased to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thereof: and by reason of his exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so was his Father and Grand-father, if they liued.</p>
               <p>Many <hi>Romaines</hi> obtained this Crowne, and especially the most valiant <hi>Cincinatus</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1110:31"/>
                  <hi>Dentatus</hi> heere-to-fore named: hee wonne foureteene of them. The younger <hi>Capitolinus</hi> had sixe: and to <hi>Cicero</hi> (by particuler dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence) was graunted one, because he defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Rome</hi> from the conspiracie of <hi>Catalme.</hi> These Crownes whereof wee haue spoken, although they were but of hearbes &amp; leaues, which more properly may be tearmed Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landes, or (according to the French) Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets of flowers: yet neuerthelesse they were more esteemed then they that were of gold.</p>
               <p>As for the Crowne <hi>Murall,</hi> that was of gold, and it was giuen to him, who at the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault of the wall of a Cittie or Castell: mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted first on the Ladder and freed the wall, standing there still like a Bulwarke for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence thereof. The first (according to <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie)</hi> that obtained this Crowne, was <hi>Manli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Capitolinus.

               <p>
                  <hi>Corona Castrensis,</hi> was giuen to him that in the fight entred first within the enemies barre: this Crowne was likewise of Golde, made like to the Rampiers or Bulwarkes in the fielde of warre.</p>
               <p>Of selfe same Mettall was the Crowne <hi>Nauall,</hi> which was giuen to the first that (in

fight on the Sea) boorded the enemies ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell: and it was made in forme of a prow or poynt of a Ship. <hi>Marcus Varro</hi> did not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine this Crowne, when it was offered him by <hi>Pompey</hi> the great, in the warres of <hi>Corsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca. Octauius</hi> presented the like to <hi>Marcus Agrippa,</hi> and to <hi>Sylla,</hi> beside diuers other which heere I name not. And when any <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mame</hi> Souldiour, were he noble or vn-noble had made any other proofe of his bodie, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by course of the Launce, or in single Combat: the <hi>Romaine</hi> Captaines, (as testifie <hi>Plinie</hi> and <hi>Suetonius)</hi> were wont to gyue him Collers of golde and siluer, or Bracelets, or Gyrdles, as I haue before saide, with other priuiledges and preheminences.</p>
               <p>These or such like prizes, they might giue to their friends that had ayded them in warre: but as for the Crownes, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued onely for the <hi>Romaines,</hi> of all which things we find notable examples in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Histories.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Suetonius</hi> writeth, that <hi>Octauius</hi> permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Marcus Agrippa</hi> to beare a banner of Azure, because of a victory he obtained on the Sea against <hi>Sextus Pompeyus.</hi> And if I shoulde say, this was hee which deuised the Collers, the rich coates of Maile, and other gyfts, which were particularly appointed for
<pb facs="tcp:1110:32"/>
these affaires: it woulde require too large a discourse to declare the whole matter and manner thereof. Neuerthelesse it is to bee noted, that the <hi>Romaines</hi> were so valiant, as euerie one gained the honor of these things, or at the least the greater part: for <hi>Plinie &amp; Solinus</hi> naming diuers, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g others affirme, that <hi>Marcus Sergius</hi> attained the greater part; And in the battaile of <hi>Thrasimen</hi> and <hi>Treuia,</hi> where the <hi>Romaines</hi> were vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by <hi>Hanniball,</hi> he won <hi>Corona Ciuica,</hi> &amp; likewise in the ouer-throwe at <hi>Carinas.</hi> This man was so valiant, that hauing lost his right hand in the battaile, he behaued himselfe so wel with the left, as also with a hand of yron, which hee caused to be made in sted of that hee had lost: as in one day hee defied foure men in the fielde of battaile, one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and vanquished the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all: in which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats and other fights, he receiued onelie on the fore-part of his body, three and twentie woundes.</p>
               <p>Yet not this <hi>Marcus Sergius,</hi> or any one beside, won or deserued so much, as <hi>Lucius Cincinatus Dentatus,</hi> Tribune of the people, of whom we spake before: of him writ <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, Solinus, Ualerius</hi> the great, and <hi>Aulus Gellius,</hi> who say, that in Iewels and presents of prize, some greater then other, he won by
<pb facs="tcp:1110:32"/>
braue deeds of Armes, three hundred twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and more: that he entred with nine Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, in making their tryumphes, &amp; whom he had ayded in their victories. He had a great number of broken Launces, or Trun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chions of Speares, &amp; Pykes without yrons, whereby he wonne great honour: hee had eyghteene Collers of gold, foure-score and three of siluer, of harnesse &amp; accoustrements for Horsses, heereto particulerly deputed, fiue and twentie, an hundred &amp; forty brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, fourteene Crownes Cittizen, eyght <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strensis,</hi> three <hi>Murall,</hi> one <hi>Obsidionall,</hi> and I know not how many <hi>Nauall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was wounded in these battailes with forty fiue wounds, all on the fore-part of his body, and but one behinde, hee had thirtie foure times disarmed and despoyled his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and had been in sixe and twenty fough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Battailes: he was so valiant &amp; fortunate in Armes, as he was named the <hi>Romaine A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles:</hi> and albeit these deedes of hys may seeme incredible, yet the number and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie of Histories doe plainely iustifie them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romaines</hi> for these great exployts of Armes, graunted them yet other honours &amp; preheminences: as the power of publique iudgement, seating them in the yuorie
<pb facs="tcp:1110:33"/>
Chaire called <hi>Curialis,</hi> which was the seat of the <hi>Ediles</hi> and <hi>Pretors,</hi> as it was permitted to <hi>Scipio:</hi> &amp; oftentimes they yeelded to souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours the greatest authorities, according as it was lawfull for the people to doe it, beeing a degree of estate subiect to the liberty of the Fathers conscript, and of the people. It was lawful for the Captaines to erect tryumphal statues, and to clothe or deck them as if they had beene Consuls.</p>
               <p>The Senate permitted by manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and congratulation, that they might bring to the Temples, the Armes &amp; spoiles of the enemies vanquished by them in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile: and these things were named <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biae,</hi> that is to say, the booties gotten from the enemies. The <hi>Romaines</hi> had another lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble custome, which was, to giue to the chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of such as had been slaine in warre, like wages as they gaue their Fathers when they liued: and to the old Souldiours, which had long time followed seruice, they would giue so much good and substantiall lande, as they might very wel liue thereon: suffering them to dwell in Citties and Prouinces that had beene conquered, euen as themselues plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to like or chuse.</p>
               <p>In this sort the Citty of <hi>Ciuill</hi> was made by <hi>Caesar</hi> a Romaine Colonie: from which
<pb facs="tcp:1110:33"/>

                  </hi> was also made a Colonie by this meane, and infinite other in dyuers Prouinces.</p>
               <p>In breese, the <hi>Romaines</hi> neuer left any good turne vnrewarded, and without great priuiledge: for which cause was founde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them the most valiant men, that euer haue beene in any Nation, because each one stroue to attaine these degrees onelie by vertue.</p>
               <p>I leaue many other sorts of rewards, which the <hi>Romaines</hi> vsed in case of Armes, in that I imagine I haue spoken sufficiently: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, it is a thing certaine, that if they haue gone beyond all other Nations, in reknowledging &amp; remunerating such good actions: it cannot likewise be denyed, but in learning &amp; punishment of disorders, they haue doone much more. For if any one were not acquainted with honour and vertue, yet shame and feare of punishment, with-helde him from doing any vile deede, were it tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row necessity or in hope of gaine: because the paines were so great &amp; rigorous against such as did badly.</p>
               <p>For if they lost any honour wherto they had been called, or that they had been whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped

euen to the blood: they were thrust in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to yrons as they had beene slaues, and if they had fled, leauing their Captaines in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, they were eyther thrust vpon a spyt, or otherwise extreamely handled, and so accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to theyr offence was the punishment inflicted.</p>

Diodorus Scicilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> in his third booke, <hi>Amianus Marcellus</hi> in his 23. booke, <hi>Paulus Orosius</hi> in his second booke, maintaineth the same, with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of the Authours among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles: yet notwithstanding, S. <hi>Austine</hi> in his first booke of the Cittie of GOD, and <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus</hi> in the sixt booke of his Antiquities, say, that they were builded by <hi>Nemrod,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ay ded by his proude and mighty Giants: but were it the foundation or reparation which <hi>Semiramis</hi> did, it suffiseth that she was greatly ennobled thereby.</p>
                  <p>The plot of this Citty was a plaine on the one side, the other passed by the Riuer of <hi>Euphrates:</hi> the draught or figure of thys Cittie, was in a Quadrangle, the wals mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous high, and wrought with very cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning workmanship: the thing it selfe was of stone, ioyned with white lyme and Morter, which grew in the Quarries of the Country, especially in the great Lake of <hi>Iudea:</hi> where sometime stoode <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorha,</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Asphaltida</hi> or <hi>Mare mortuum,</hi> which casteth forth earth like Pitch or Glewe, the very strongest that can be found.

<pb facs="tcp:1110:35"/>
largenes of the compasse of the wals: which might easilie happen, by reason of the diuers measures they made.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plinie</hi> sayth, the circuite of the walles, was three-score thousand paces, so that one of the squares was fifteene miles-long: hee saith likewise, that they were two hundred foote in height, one of which feete excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth by three singers the measure of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi> foote: in thicknesse they were fifty foote of the same measure, which in trueth is a thing very admirable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Diodorus</hi> the <hi>Scicilian,</hi> sayth in his thyrd booke, that the walles of this Citty, had in compasse, three hundred and three-score Stades, euerie Stade containing in length, sixe-score &amp; fiue paces: and that they were so broade or large, as sixe Chariots might passe thereon along together, without the one hindring the other. The bridges, rocks, Towers and Gardens <hi>Semiramis</hi> caused to be made, were to very wonderfull astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and it is found written, that shee had in daily pay to this worke, three hundred thousande men, of all the Kingdomes that were subiect to her.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:1110:36"/>
in his seconde booke, that they were foure-hundred and foure-score Stades long, which amount (taking sixe-score and fiue paces to euerie Stade) to three-score miles, agreeing with <hi>Plinie.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Strabo</hi> in his sixteene booke affirmeth, that they contained in length three hundred, eightie fiue Stades, and so large as so manie Chariots might passe ouer them, as we haue already named, without hindering each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers way. Beside, these Authours declare a meruailous thing, that the Gardens were vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Arches and Towers, hauing Trees in them of wonderfull height: <hi>Iulius Solinus</hi> confirmeth the same, with <hi>Plinie</hi> and other Authours.</p>

                  <p>In thys Citty were an hundred Gates of Mettall very strange, and for conclusion, what-soeuer is written co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the height and largenes of these walles, is to be credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: because in trueth it was the proudest Cittie in the worlde, and long time held the vniuersall Monarchie, which is no meane argument of the greatnesse, declared by <hi>Aristotle</hi> in the thyrde Booke of hys Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiques,

                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>OR the third, I think meete to set downe the Piramides of <hi>Egipt:</hi> which in truth, if that which so many learned Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians haue written, may be tearmed trueth, was a thing very admirable. These Piramides were certaine buildings, which began in forme of a Quadrangle, or foure square, &amp; ascended so vp to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est in large proportion, according to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a poynted Diamond: yet were they of such greatnes and height, containing such &amp; so many stones, and in such perfection, as it is very hard to be set downe, but more hard to cause each one giue credite thereto: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
<pb facs="tcp:1110:38"/>
they are so authorised by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours both Christians and Gentiles, and them that are the best approoued, as none can deny what they haue written.</p>
                  <p>These Piramides then are like high Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, finishing at the top spire and sharpe, the Etimologie of the name, commeth of <hi>Pyr</hi> in Greeke, which is to say, fire: because it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that the highest of these building doe flash out flames of fire.</p>
                  <p>Amongst all other Piramides, the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians make particuler mention of three that were in <hi>Egipt,</hi> neere the Cittie of <hi>Memphis,</hi> which at this day is the <hi>Caire,</hi> and the Ile that foundeth <hi>Nilus,</hi> named <hi>Delta:</hi> one of which three, is placed in ranck among the seauen Meruailes of the world, for it is saide, that at the making thereof, continually and dailie laboured, three hundred and three-score thousand men, for the space of twentie yeres together.</p>
                  <p>Many doe affirme this, and particulerlie <hi>Plinie,</hi> speaking amply thereof, in his thirtie sixe booke and twelfth Chapter, and for hys assuraunce, alleadgeth twelue sounde Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours; Beside, <hi>Diodorus</hi> in his first Booke, <hi>Strabo</hi> in his last booke, <hi>Pomponius Mela</hi> in his first booke, <hi>Herodotus</hi> in his seconde booke, <hi>Amianus</hi> in his second booke, and
<pb facs="tcp:1110:38"/>
many other. Some say, that the plot and foundation of this Piramides, spred foorth and couered eyght daies iourney of ground: let me leaue to your imagination, what space that may be. Some other say, seauen dayes iourney, but the least yeeldeth to sixe, and as much or rather more in height.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plinie</hi> sayth, that each square contained eyght hundred, foure-score and three foote, the stones were of Marble, brought out of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and <hi>Pomponius Mela</hi> saith, that the most part of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were three foote large. Heereby may we easily gather, that so many thousand men might be imployed: some to carry stones, some to hew and cut them, and others to place them, beside the multitude that wrought in the yron workes, and about other necessary occasions.</p>
                  <p>Of the other Piramides it is thus saide, the least of the two was made by the vanitie of the Kings of Egypt, which were the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chest in all the world: as well by the fertility of the earth, as also that in this Countrey no person possessed any thing in proper, but the King onely. And this was since the time, that <hi>Ioseph</hi> the sonne of <hi>Iaacob</hi> councelled <hi>Pharao,</hi> to preserue the Corne for 7. yeres aboundance, regarding the time of famine: during which space, by the meanes of thys
<pb facs="tcp:1110:39"/>
Corne, hee had all the Countreyes his Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailes. Thinke then whether these Kinges were rich or no, when they made theyr Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects attend on them like seruaunts.</p>
                  <p>And the Historians say, that the Kings in thys respect caused these Piramides to be builded, because they would giue to eate to their people that laboured: as also least they should leaue their riches to their successours, for they had rather thus spend it among their people, then any of their heyres should be aduantaged by their death, inheriting theyr goods and money.</p>
                  <p>It is found also written, that these Pira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mides serued for Sepulchers to the Kings: and who so will consider the multitude of the Hebrew people that serued in Egypt, by whom the Kings caused to be builded Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Fortresses: they will not bee aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed heereat, seeing it is a thing verie cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that sixe hundred thousand men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side great multitude of women and young children, endured the seruitude, all which were imployed and serued in these meruay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous workes.</p>
                  <p>So then it is no matter of meruaile, howe these buildings should be made, for it is said, that in Turnops, Garlike and Scallions, to maintaine this number of workmen, were
<pb facs="tcp:1110:39"/>
spent eighteene hundred Talents, which va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued the price of each daies worke, a Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and four-score thousand Crownes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Diodorus</hi> sayth, that all the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of and very farre about, there was not so much as one little stone, nor apparance that any person had beene there, nor signe of any foundation, but the Grauell verie small and fine as any salte: so that it seemed this Pira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mides was there set by the hand of God, and that it was naturally created, the top therof resembling as if it touched heauen.</p>
                  <p>If wee set aside the old auncient Bookes, yet shall we find witnesses in our owne later tymes, for <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> of <hi>Millaine,</hi> a man learned, that was Ambassadour for the Princes Catholique, <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> and Dame <hi>Isabell,</hi> to the Soldane of <hi>Egipt,</hi> in the yeere one thousande, fiue hundred and one, made a booke of what he had seene &amp; done in his Embassade: therein he reciteth, as if it were by word of mouth, that he sawe these Piramides, and agreeth with what the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Authours haue written. And particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerly he speakes of two which hee had seene, that were of incredible height: he sayth, hee measured the squares of one, and found each to be three hundred and fifteene paces, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thirteene hundred in compasse: that
<pb facs="tcp:1110:40"/>
on euery side, there were such huge great stones, as each one seemed a building of it selfe.</p>
                  <p>He sayth moreouer, that certaine of hys company got vp on one of them by great labour, and (though in long tyme) they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the top: saying, that on the verie high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of all was one onelie stone, so great and broade, as thirty men might easily stand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it. And when they were belowe, they said they supposed themselues to haue been in a Clowde, they were so high: and they seemed to haue lost the light, their braynes wheeling about and turning downe-warde. Whereby he saith, that the number of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is not to be doubted, nor yet the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence which is saide to be consumed about these things.</p>

                  <p>The principall Maister of this worke, according to <hi>Pinie,</hi> was <hi>Dresiphon,</hi> and after <hi>Strabo</hi> in his four-teene booke, <hi>Archiphron:</hi> notwith-standing, this diuersitie of opinion is to be borne withall, considering how long time was required about it, and therefore it had more then one Maister, especially for the trymming by diuers, &amp; in sundry times.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solinus</hi> in hys fourteene Chapter, and <hi>Pomponius Mela</hi> in his first booke, say, that the <hi>Amazones</hi> builded and dedicated thys Temple. Moreouer <hi>Solinus</hi> saith, that when
<pb facs="tcp:1110:43"/>
the puissant King <hi>Xerxes</hi> went to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of <hi>Greece,</hi> and that hee burned all the Temples, yet he reserued this onely.</p>
                  <p>All Historians doe agree, that the Pyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of this Temple helde vp the plauncher of wood, so arteficially wrought as was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to be doone: and that it was couered with Cedar, according to <hi>Plinie</hi> in his sixt booke, and 49. chapter, the Gates &amp; seelings beeing of Cipres. Afterward, a villaine see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this sumptuous and admirable building, he was desirous to burne it, and so hee did: when beeing taken for thys offence, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed he dyd it for no other intent, but to leaue a renowne of hymselfe to the world.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Ualerius</hi> the great, and <hi>Aulus Gelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> in his second booke say, that to spoyle this villaines desire of renowne, it was forbidden vnder great and greeuous paine, that none should write his name; to the ende he might faile of the fame and glory he expected. But thys serued to small purpose, for <hi>Solinus</hi> and <hi>Strabo</hi> say, that he was named <hi>Erostratus,</hi> &amp; of him came the Prouerbe: that when anie one would be famous for a vicious acte, they would say, <hi>This is the renowne of Erostratus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, it may bee spoken for a notable thing, that the same day the Temple was burnt, <hi>Alexander</hi> the great was borne, who
<pb facs="tcp:1110:43"/>
conquered all <hi>Asia:</hi> Heereof are Authours, <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> in his seconde Booke of the nature of the Gods, there it is reported in many places, &amp; likewise in the booke of Diuination<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it is said, that while the Temple burned, the Sages prognosticated the destruction of all <hi>Asia,</hi> as afterwarde it happened by <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some say the Temple was re-edified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, farre more great and excellent then it was before, and that the Maister of the work was named <hi>Democrates.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:1110:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
perfection and admirable workmanship, as also for the greatnesse thereof.</p>
                  <p>It was made of Porphire, some say Iuory, by the hande of <hi>Phidias,</hi> the most excellent Engrauer and Image-maker that euer was.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Strabo</hi> sayth, the excellencie thereof was in the greatnesse: and that which makes it more admirable, is, that it was of Porphiry, cut in an infinite number of peeces.</p>
                  <p>It is saide, that <hi>Phidias</hi> was toucht with one onely imperfection, which was, that hee had not well compassed the proportion of the Image with the Temple, because it was in such sort placed, and so huge, as when one considered what might be the height there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ifhe were vnderneath vpon hys feete, he would imagine nothing more could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained within the Temple. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the renowne of this Image was highly aduaunced, and made the Temple more known then otherwise it would haue beene: because in that place was the sports and Games called <hi>Olimpia,</hi> &amp; hence it came, that they accounted the yeeres by <hi>Olimpiades,</hi> whereof they madè fiue yeeres in fiue yeres.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Astly, for the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth wonder, some say that it was the Tower in the Ile of <hi>Pharos,</hi> neere to the Cittie of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Egipt. Pharos</hi> was a little Ile long and straite, seated on the coast of <hi>Egipt,</hi> &amp; directly against the mouth of <hi>Nylus,</hi> which in times past, as saith <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponius Mela</hi> in his second booke, and <hi>Plinie</hi> in his fift, was altogether inclosed with firme Lande: and afterwarde, to the times of the selfe same Authours, it was embraced wyth the mayne Sea, saue onely a bridge, wherby they passed from the one Ile to the other.</p>
                  <p>In this firme Land is the great Cittie of
<pb facs="tcp:1110:45"/>
                     <hi>Alexandria,</hi> builded by <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, which Cittie was afterwarde a Colonie to <hi>Iulius Caesar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this Ile called <hi>Pharos,</hi> after the name of a great Pilot to <hi>Menelaus,</hi> who was there buried: the Kings of <hi>Egipt</hi> caused to be buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a Tower of Marble, meruailous in height and work-manship, vpon a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine enuironed with water. The laboure thereon bestowed was such, as it cost eyght hundred Talents, which value foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and four-score thousand Crownes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the computation of <hi>Budaeus:</hi> and it was builded for no other purpose, then to alight a fire in the night on the top thereof, for guyde and direction to the shyppes that came to take port there.</p>
                  <p>Thys Tower, according to the most great opinion, was builded by <hi>Ptolomeus Philodel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi> King of <hi>Egipt,</hi> and the chiefe Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect that made it, was named <hi>Sistrates,</hi> as we are certified by <hi>Plinie</hi> in his fiue and thirty Booke.</p>
                  <p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:1110:45"/>
in the end of the thirty foure Chapter, that al Towers which were made afterward, were named <hi>Pharos,</hi> after this one: as was the <hi>Pharos of Messina,</hi> and else where. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine I thinke, that the fires which are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily carried in Ships, to guide them in the night from others, by thys occasion, are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Pharos.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus thys Tower is the last of these sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen VVonders, albeit that by many it is not placed among the number of them: but in sted thereof is named the high grounded Gardens of Babilon, whereof already wee haue spoken.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lactantius Firmianus,</hi> holdeth so, &amp; saith that these Gardens were vppon the Arches and Towers, admirable in greatnes, with a number of Fountaines: the forme of which building is amply set downe by <hi>Diodorus</hi> the <hi>Scicilian.</hi>

                     <hi>Caelio</hi> the <hi>Rhodian,</hi> discoursing on the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Wonders, agrees not that this seauenth is the Tower of <hi>Pharos,</hi> or the high hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gardens: but the Obelisque of <hi>Semira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,</hi> which was made after the same fashion and structure of the Piramides, for it began so in a Quadrangle, and finished in a sharpe point: nor was there any difference between the Obelisque and the Piramides, but that
<pb facs="tcp:1110:46"/>
the Obelisque was onely of one peece, and therfore could be nothing so high as the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramides. It is found written, that certaine of them were so great as Towers, and of a very faire stone: there is one at this day in <hi>Rome,</hi> named <hi>Caesars</hi> Needle, which was brought out of <hi>Egipt,</hi> and is a very meruailous thing to beholde, as well for the greatnesse and to consider the manner howe it was brought thether.</p>
                  <p>Of the Obelisque of <hi>Semiramis,</hi> which <hi>Caelio</hi> (as I haue said) numbreth amongst the seauen Meruailes, it is iustified in wryting, that it was an hundred &amp; fifty foote high, as also four and twenty foote broade in a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drangle, so that the whole compasse thereof was ninety foote. And this stone so beeing whole &amp; sound, was taken from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines in <hi>Armenia,</hi> and by the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Semiramis</hi> brought into <hi>Babilon Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea:</hi> but in trueth when we consider how it was drawne, carried and lifted vp, it seemeth altogether a matter incredible, if the tymes of antiquitie had not like thinges or more strange, whereof we are truely certified by Authours worthy of credite, and other very great Obelisques, which the Kings of <hi>Egipt</hi> cause to be made. <hi>Plinie</hi> in his sixt booke, eyght and ninth chapters, shewes the maner
