         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

WORD of ADVICE
TO THE
Two New Sheriffs
OF
LONDON.</head>
            <l>NOw all the bussel's over 'bout the choice</l>
            <l>Of <hi>North</hi> and <hi>Rich, Papillion</hi> and <hi>Duboise,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Some cryd no <hi>North,</hi> and many had an itch</l>
            <l>To see some other chosen and not <hi>Rich,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Many a <hi>Whigg</hi> did gape with his loud voice,</l>
            <l>And gave his single Vote for their <hi>Duboise;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And I believe there was near half a Million,</l>
            <l>Within the City voted for <hi>Papillion,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And as to you ingenious Mr. <hi>North,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>My <hi>Lord Mayors drinking</hi> only brought you forth;</l>
            <l>Some talk'd as if you came in at th' <hi>Back door,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But you were introduc'd by Sir <hi>Iohn Moor;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Come in what Way you will it must be born,</l>
            <l>For now we find your Worships both are sworn.</l>
            <l>And now with all my heart I wish you joy,</l>
            <l>Hoping the <hi>Whiggish Vices</hi> you'l destroy,</l>
            <l>Where vertue is, Oh <hi>Sirs!</hi> let that alone,</l>
            <l>Present it sacred to <hi>Great Brittains Throne,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Let that be gently dealt with, do't no harm,</l>
            <l>With Pike, pickt Juries, or with strength of Arm,</l>
            <l>Encourage vertue in the open Street,</l>
            <l>And let us see that you are glad to see't,</l>
            <l>Then wee'l adore you like two petty <hi>Gods,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And <hi>Whiggs</hi> and you will be no more at odds,</l>
            <l>Wee'l strive with all our might to tell your Glory,</l>
            <l>If you will stay the vice of <hi>Whigg</hi> and <hi>Tory:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The number of their Sins (I fear) increase,</l>
            <l>And that's the chief disturbance of our Peace;</l>
            <l>We pray you therefore wheresoe're you find them,</l>
            <l>Give them no quarter, but with Milstones grind them,</l>
            <l>Be as severe to Sin as you think fit,</l>
            <l>But as to vertue meddle not with it;</l>
            <l>If any should be without cause opprest,</l>
            <l>Oh ease their griefs, and thus you may be blest,</l>
            <l>Encourage good men, and correct the bad,</l>
            <l>The <hi>City</hi> then will be no longer sad,</l>
            <l>Suppress the <hi>Cities</hi> Sins, and you'l do well,</l>
            <l>Suppressing vertue brings men unto Hell;</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:93572:2"/>
Meetings have been disturb'd too oft by those</l>
            <l>That to a Bawdy-house were never Foes:</l>
            <l>Thus <hi>Preaching</hi> seems a Crime, and <hi>Whoreing</hi> none,</l>
            <l>Poor Mr. <hi>Hilton,</hi> Oh! let him alone,</l>
            <l>He's a pure harmless Youth and out of pity,</l>
            <l>Disturbs the <hi>Meeting-houses</hi> in the <hi>City,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>I think indeed I do not miss my mark,</l>
            <l>If I declare that he is in the dark,</l>
            <l>His time were better spent in <hi>Whetstones-Park.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>There let <hi>Informers</hi> work and spend their time,</l>
            <l>To break their <hi>Meetings</hi> up can be no Crime;</l>
            <l>But <hi>Whores</hi> may swear rather then Christians Pray,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Informers</hi> will have large accounts to pay,</l>
            <l>But like the <hi>Welch-man</hi> they put off that day:</l>
            <l>Let Hur alone till that day come cry they,</l>
            <l>That day will come, and woe woe be too those,</l>
            <l>That are the <hi>Strumpets</hi> friends and <hi>Christians</hi> foes,</l>
            <l>Woe be to to those I say, the time draws near,</l>
            <l>In which they must expect to pay for't dear.</l>
            <l>But go <hi>Informing Villains</hi> from my Pen,</l>
            <l>As you Inform you are the worst of men,</l>
            <l>Inform where <hi>Papists</hi> are, there are great store,</l>
            <l>Inform the Justices of ev'ry Whore,</l>
            <l>Inform against your fellow <hi>Rogues</hi> that swear,</l>
            <l>And wallow, like to Swine, in Wine and Bear;</l>
            <l>Inform against the Vices of the Age,</l>
            <l>There we will give you leave to shew your rage,</l>
            <l>Let them alone that Worship God with fear,</l>
            <l>Or let me tell you, you will pay for't dear;</l>
            <l>If in their <hi>Meetings</hi> they disturb the Peace,</l>
            <l>I would not have <hi>Informers</hi> then to cease,</l>
            <l>Then be severe, and Plague them as you please,</l>
            <l>Then give them neither countenance nor ease;</l>
            <l>But if they do no ill, why so severe?</l>
            <l>Surely thou tak'st the wrong Sow by the ear.</l>
            <l>Sweet Sir <hi>Informer</hi> if they preach but Treason,</l>
            <l>Then hang them up indeed, it is but reason,</l>
            <l>But it's to hard to suffer, or to swing,</l>
            <l>For meeting but to pray for our good <hi>King;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>They Preach down sin, and pray for <hi>Reformation,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Would there were no worse Subjects in the Nation.</l>
            <l>Increase the number Lord of such good men,</l>
            <l>Now where there is but one, do thou raise ten:</l>
            <l>And we shall think it a most Blessed change,</l>
            <l>To give us these, and take away <hi>Le' Strange.</hi>
