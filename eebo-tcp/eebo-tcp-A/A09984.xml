         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>If any man love not the Lord Iesus Christ, let him
be accursed; yea let him be had in execration
even to the death, or let him be <hi>Anathema Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranatha.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HESE words have little or no
dependance on the words before
going, which are these; <hi>The sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation
of me</hi> Paul <hi>by mine owne
hand:</hi> and the reason why he
thus writes is, because there were
many false Apostles, and counterfeit Epistles
went abroad in the world, if not under his name;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:15495:3"/>
but hereby (saith he) you shall know me from
them all, even by this my salutation, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
as by mine owne hand; for in all my
Epistles so I write, <hi>The grace of our Lord Iesus
Christ be with you all, Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore to consider them in themselves, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.
<hi>Paul</hi> hating those (as we use to doe) who speake
evill of them we love, doth here pronounce a
curse against them that love not the <hi>Lord Iesus
Christ;</hi> and the reason why he doth so, is, because
he cannot endure to heare him evill spoken of by
any blasphemous tongue.</p>
            <p>So that this then is the scope and drift of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
in this place, namely, to commend Love
unto us, and above all other, the love of the <hi>Lord
Iesus Christ,</hi> and to exhort us by all meanes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto;
in which exhortation, let me desire you to
observe with me these two reasons why we should
thus love him. Whereof the<list>
                  <item> first is taken from the <hi>Necessity of it,</hi> he is accursed that loves him not.</item>
                  <item>second is taken from the Equity, or object of his love, <hi>the Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>If any man love not the Lord Iesus Christ, let
him be &amp;c.</p>
            <p>There is not much difficulty in the words, yet
fome there is; for clearing whereof, I will shew
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:15495:3"/>
you what is meant by these two termes, <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema,
Maranatha,</hi> and so proceede: for the first
<hi>(Anathema)</hi> it is a <hi>Greeke</hi> word, and it is as much
as <hi>elevari, &amp; suspendi,</hi> to be lift up, or be hanged,
and it signifies accursed, by way of allusion to that
opprobrious and cursed kinde of death, which
was inflicted upon notorious and hainous Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors,
who for their offence were hanged up up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a tree, gibbet, or any such engine, according as
it is said, <hi>cursed is every one that hangeth</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 21. 23.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
which place is againe alledged by this our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul,</hi> to prove that Christ hath redeemed
us from the curse of the Law, being made a curse
for us, for it is written, <hi>cursed is</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, for the word <hi>(Maranatha)</hi> it is an
<hi>Assyrian</hi> word taken from an <hi>Hebrew</hi> root, which
signifies execration or cursing, (and therefore I
so rendered it in the reading of it unto you) now
in that the Apostle useth two words of diverse
Languages, for the fuller expression of this his so
fearefull a malediction and curse, as if one word
were not enough, or that out of his zealous affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
he could not so content himselfe with it,
we may note that by how much the more the
curse is greater, by so much the more grievous is
the duty omitted, from which premisses we may
make this conclusion, or draw this point of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
<hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That he is worthy to be curst,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> (yea to bee curst

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:15495:4"/>
For the further unfolding and opening where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
consider with me these three things follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to wit.</p>
            <p>First, what Love is in generall.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what love to the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ</hi> is.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, some reasons why he is worthy to be
accursed that loves him not: of each of these in
their order; and first of the first. <hi>What Love is
in generall,</hi> and for that take this briefe descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Love is an inclination of the will, whereby it
inclines to some good thing agreable to it selfe.</p>
            <p>First, (I say) its an inclination of the will]
where we may take notice of two things, both of
the subject or seate, which is not any inferior
part or faculty of the soule, but the will, one of
the most supreme and potentest of all the rest.
And what is the nature and property, the quality
and condition of it? it is <hi>elicita, non coacta,</hi> not
forced, but free; inclined, not constrained, for <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas</hi>
(as say the Phylosophers) <hi>est libera,</hi> the
will is of a most absolute and free power, so that
though a man may be compelled to doe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
against his liking, yet he can never be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to doe any thing against his will, at lest his
will cannot be forced, that like a Queene in her
Throwne is alwayes free.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I say its an inclination of the will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
good; <hi>aut verum, aut apparens,</hi> either for that it
is so indeede, or at least (for the present) appeare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
and seemes so to be unto it, according to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:15495:4"/>
 
trite and true axiome of the Schooles too, <hi>bonum
est objectum voluntatis,</hi> the <hi>Adequate</hi> object of the
will is onely good, yet not every good neither,
but <hi>bonum sibi conveniens,</hi> such a good as is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to it selfe, that onely is the object of love.
Now by this you conceive the second thing,
what love to the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ</hi> is: and it is
nothing else but an intensive bending of the mind
unto Christ, as the most necessary and suitablest
thing for it that may be, the <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> the
chiefest good of all that it can desire, so that it
desires and loves nothing like him.</p>
            <p>Now the properties whereby we shall know,
whether our love to the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ</hi> be such
or not, are especially these three.</p>
            <p>First, it alwayes desires to have the thing it
loves, cannot be contented with any thing else
but him, as being the proper Center of the soule,
which is never at quiet so long as it is out of his
place; agreeable to that of a Father, <hi>Fecistinos Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
ad te, &amp; inquietum est cor nostrum donec re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiescit
in te, Thou hast made us O Lord, and our
heart is never at rest till it rest in thee,</hi> it is his frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that gives it satisfaction: againe, as it desires
the fruition of him, so it desires as much,</p>
            <p>Secondly, the conjunction and union with him,
to be one with him and he with us; and therefore
it hates whatsoever may hinder it, and seekes
whatsoever may helpe it therein: and being thus
once conjoyned, and enjoying it, it finally</p>
            <p>Thirdly, seekes and endeavours the protection
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:15495:5"/>
and preservation of the thing it loves, as it on the
other side shunnes and avoids ought that might
endanger the destruction thereof; and if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
it meete with it, interposeth it selfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
it and that to defend it, as the arme wards
the blow from the head, albeit it be to the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it selfe.</p>
            <p>And when these three concurre together,
when our love hath these three concommitants,
and is attended with these fruits and effects, as
you heard before, that it thus desires the<list>
                  <item>fruition</item>
                  <item>conjunction</item>
                  <item>preservation</item>
               </list>
               <hi>of</hi> Christ.</p>
            <p>Then may we distinguish it from all sensuall
and carnall love; for there be many sorts of love
in the world, but it is all but worldly love, not
spirituall and Heavenly love.</p>
            <p>First, ther's a love of pitty, as when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile
a mans case, but hate his deeds, so are Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors
beloved.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ther's a love of desire, as when the
stomacke desires sweete meates, the eare delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
sounds, and the eye fine sights, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, ther's a love of complusment, when
one lusts or longs after a thing with the whole
heart or soule, so as he cannot subsist without it;
as a woman with child lusteth and longeth after a
thing she hath a minde to, which she cannot fafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
goe without.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:15495:5"/>
Fourthly, ther's love of friendship, when
one man loves another for some courtesie or
kindenesse he hath received from him.</p>
            <p>Fiftly and lastly, ther's a love of dependance,
when a man loves God more then himselfe, more
then his life, and depends upon him for all good
things belonging to body or soule. Or to be more briefe ther's a <list>
                  <item>naturall</item>
                  <item>sinfull</item>
                  <item>spirituall</item>
               </list>Love.<note place="margin">Deut. 21. 23.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The first, is betwixt parents and children, and in
it selfe is neither good nor evill.<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The second, ariseth from evill habits bred in
the soule, and it is most hatefull to God, and
makes us worse then the brute beasts.</p>
            <p>The third, is that divine gift and grace of God
which the Holy Ghost puts into our hearts,
whereby we are more then men, and desire Holy
things for themselves; and this is that love
which the Apostle here calls for in this place.</p>
            <p>Now if our love to the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ</hi> be
such, we shall further know it by these two things
which alwayes proceede and goe before it, as the
former followed after it. <hi>viz.</hi> humiliation for
sinne past, and faith in Christ for the time to
come.</p>
            <p>First humiliation for sinne past;<note place="margin">Doct.</note> for till a
man come to have a sight and sense of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
by reason of his sinnes, he will never
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:15495:6"/>
care for Christ; and when he hath beene thus
cast downe, yet</p>
            <p>Secondly, without faith in Christ, whereby
he applies him to himselfe, and is perswaded that
he is reconciled unto him, he will not yet love
him, but rather hate him of the twaine.</p>
            <p>Now the manner or meanes of getting of both
these, and so consequently of love into our hearts,
is by the preaching of the word of God, by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and taking him when he is offered and given
unto us in the same for that end.</p>
            <p>But now we must take Christ as an husband
takes a wife, or a wife an husband, out of love to
their persons, not to their portions, and then shall
we be the better subject unto him; but except
we be first humbled (as was before said) for our
sinnes, and consider in what neede thou standest
of him, how that without him thou must perish;
till then (I say) thou canst not sufficiently set by
him, nor love him aright: but when thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
how necessary he is for thee, how alsufficient,
and affectionate he is towards thee, then thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnest
to looke at Christ as a condemned person
doth at him that brings a pardon for him whom he
loves and longs after, joyes and rejoyceth in.</p>
            <p>And yet all this is but a preparative to our love
of him; it is faith, that is the first fountaine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we so love him, as that we can cleave unto
him, with purpose of heart to serve and please
him in all things, and this love which thus ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
from faith, doth not onely beleeve that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:15495:6"/>
Christ is mercifull, and will forgive thee thy
sinnes upon thy supplication and repentance unto
him for the same, but also that he is most fit and
conformable for thee, so that thou couldst finde
in thy heart to be <hi>anathaematized</hi> for his sake, and
to be divorced from all things in the world for
love of him: And so much for the second thing
also, I come now to the last; to wit,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, to the reasons,</hi> why he is worthy to
be had in execration, and to be cursed even to the
death that loves not the Lord Iesus Christ? <hi>and they
are chiefly these five.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">Reas.</note> because when Christ shall come and be a
Sutor unto us to love him, and we refuse to doe it,
and to be reconciled unto him and receive him,
then he growes angry to the death; you may see
this in the Parable of the Marriage of the Kings
sonne, how wroth he was when he heard they
had abused and beaten his servants which he sent
to call them to the<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 22. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>wedding:</hi> and therefore the
Prophet <hi>David</hi> bids us <hi>kisse the Sonne lest he bee
angry,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 2. 12.</note> 
               <hi>and so &amp;c.</hi> that is, as if he should say,
when he offers himselfe to kisse you with the kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of his mouth, be not too coy and curious, but
imbrace his offer, returne his curtesie with the like
kindnesse, and kisse him againe, lest he take it in
great indignation at your hands; and be so angry
with you, that you die for it.</p>
            <p>Indeede when we knew not the Gospell, he
was content, though we were froward and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse;
but now that he sends his Desciples <hi>to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:15495:7"/>
preach unto all Nations,</hi> then if they bring not
forth <hi>fruits worthy amendment of life,</hi> he tells
them, <hi>the axe is laid unto the rootes, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, because he that in old time brake the
law, was accursed; now this was the Lords
Commandement,<note place="margin">Matth. 22. 37.</note> 
               <hi>that we love him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will say, we are not able to fulfill the
law of our selves;<note place="margin">Object.</note> and how then shall we doe
it?</p>
            <p>I answer,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> ther's a two-fold obedience, Legall, <hi>and Evangelicall,</hi> that requires
exact obedience in our owne persons; but
this requires no more but onely our endeavour,
and faith in Christ.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, because he loves something else more
then God, and so commits Adultery; now shee
that in the old law did commit Adultery, had a
drinke of bitter water given her, <hi>which made her
belly swell &amp;c.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Numb. 5. 15.</note> 
               <hi>so that shee died;</hi> how much more
worthy of death is he then that thus deales with
God, and going a whoring after it, commits spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
fornication.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, because that commonly belongs to
Hypocrites, they are a cursed crew, to whom
Christ shall say at the last day, <hi>goe ye cursed &amp;c.</hi>
Now all such as love him not, are, no better nor
worse, but wretched and damnable Hypocrites.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, because love governes the whole man,
its as the Rudder of a ship, which turnes it any
wayes; and so which way soever this affection of
love goes, it carries the whole man along with
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:15495:7"/>
it, and makes him leade his life accordingly.</p>
            <p>Thus much then for the proofe of the point, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
propounded.</p>
            <p>Now for the application of it to our selves,
that so we may the better make some use of it, for
the direction and reformation of our lives and
conversations therein: if it be so (as so you have
heard it is) that it is such a sinne not to love the
<hi>Lord Iesus Christ, that he is worthy to be accursed
that loves him not; yea, to be had in execration &amp;c.</hi>
Then first it may teach us to looke to our selves,<note place="margin">Vse.</note>
and be sure that we love him; and so looke at
others, as that out of a godly zeale thou canst sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
and truely say with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> here, <hi>let him
be accursed,</hi> for this is an infallible and sure signe of
this love which proceeds from faith, that when
we see Christ trampled under feete, our hearts
burne within us, as his did: <hi>there are some</hi> (saith
he) <hi>of which I told you before, and now tell you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
with teares or weeping, that they goe about to
pervert and turne others from the wayes of God:</hi> so
that we may here see Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> disposition, he
doth not say, <hi>cursed be he, but cursed is hee;</hi> from
whence we may also note the difference betwixt
the curses of the Law, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f the Gospell: for
the Law faith, <hi>cursed is he that continueth not in all
&amp;c.</hi> but the Gospell saith, <hi>cursed is he that loves
not the Lord, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if we love him, we will desire (as was
said but a little before) to be joyned unto him, and
to have his company, for how can that woman be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:15495:8"/>
said to love her husband that cares not for his
company; so how canst thou say thou lovest the
<hi>Lord Iesus Christ</hi> when thou lovest not his society?</p>
            <p>Againe, if we love him, we will be content to
have him upon any condition; for love is impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
<hi>the love of Christ constraines us</hi> (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
speakes) <hi>to doe what it desires;</hi> yet, so as not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
but with our wills, which it inclines there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto:
now if we doe not finde these things in us,
<hi>we doe not love the, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore this Doctrine <hi>that he that loves
him not is &amp;c.</hi> it should teach us to consider our
owne conditions, how we stand affected towards
him, and whether we love him or not; and wee
shall know it for certaine whether we doe, or doe
not, by examining our selves by these quaeries.</p>
            <p>First vvhether vvhatsoever good things vve
have done, vve have done them out of love to
God, and desire of his glory, more then of our
ovvne profit, or out of custome; for othervvise all
that vve doe is nothing vvorth; Christ respects
nothing but vvhat comes from love, and that love
from faith, if that be not the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> the
first moover that sets us on vvorke, if vve goe not
upon this ground, vve vvere as good doe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>othing,
for all the good vve shall get by it: ô that thou,
that most of all despisest Religion, and scoffest at
the zealous Professors thereof, vvouldest but
throughly consider of this one thing, <hi>that he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed
that loves not the Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> and
that all the good duties of piety, or charity which
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:15495:8"/>
thou performest, if thou dost them not out of love,
but more for custome then conscience sake, are
rather abominable then any whit pleasing unto
God; for then wouldst thou no longer content
thy selfe with the forme of godlinesse, but labour
for the power thereof.</p>
            <p>But thou wilt say, how shall I know whether
this that I doe,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> I doe it out of love to his name, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then out of any hypocrisie, or love to my
selfe? I answer.</p>
            <p>You shall feele it, for love is of a stirring na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
and moves all the rest of the affections, as
desire and longing after him, with hope that thou
shalt obtaine him, and feare least thou shouldst
faile of it; but yet still let me give thee this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat,
beware thou love him not more in regard of
his Kingdome, then of his person, for then I tell
thee true, thou lovest him not aright.</p>
            <p>Secondly, consider whether (as was said) thou
love his company, and delight in his presence, to
have communion with him, to be talking to him
by prayer, or to have him speaking unto thee by
his word; so then dost thou pray not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint,
but willingly; dost thou heare, reade, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Sacrament &amp;c. not for fashion sake, but
of faith unfained, in obedince to his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then dost thou love him, but otherwise
thou dost not.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, dost thou love his appearing at the last
day, canst thou say in the uprightnesse of thy
soule, <hi>come Lord Iesus, come quickly?</hi> dost thou
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:15495:9"/>
thinke it long first? and art not afraid when thou
hearest of it, as <hi>Felix</hi> was, who trembled when
he heard <hi>Paul</hi> discourse of <hi>Temperance, Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and Iudgment to come;</hi> but dost rather desire
it, and wouldst be glad of it, and the sooner, the
better? then (I say) also mayst thou resolve upon
it, that thou dost assuredly love him, and that when
he shall so come, he shall come without sinne unto
thy salvation.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, whether thou lovest him as well in
health as in sicknesse, and in sicknesse as in health,
as well in poverty as in aboundance, and in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
as in prosperity, for so thou wilt, if thou
love him truely for himselfe, and not for these.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, marke this with thy selfe too, whether
thy love be bountifull, as was that womans that
had the box of oyntment, which shee powred on
Jesus head, and as <hi>Abrahams</hi> was, who would
have offered his Sonne, his onely Sonne <hi>Isaac</hi> for
his sake; so (I say) examine thy selfe hereby,
whether thou be content to part with the best
things for his sake, as thy living, thy lusts, thy
life; for he that loves any thing truely, will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe
and give all he hath to purchase it.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, looke whether thou seeke to doe the
Lords will, and what may please him best; for
love seekes not her owne, we see it in men who
will take any paines, be at any cost, to get that
thing for them whom they love, which they love
to have, and so will we doe for Christ, <hi>if we love
him, we will keepe his Commandements,</hi> and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:15495:9"/>
they will not be grievous unto us; yea rather
it will be our meate and drinke to doe his will,
and the dearer it costs us, the dearer will it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, examine thy selfe by this rule also,
whether thou be content to doe much for him,
not some things, and not othersome, but whether
thou have an eye to all his Commandements, and
all false wayes thou utterly abhorre; <hi>for faith</hi>
(you know) <hi>workes by love, and love that proceeds
from faith is not idle but operative,</hi> so that what is
spoken of faith, may as truely be said of love, <hi>that
its dead without workes,</hi> and therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
professeth of himselfe, that he laboured more
then they all, which was an argument, that he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
much because he was in labour much; and so
when our Saviour asked <hi>Peter</hi> whether he loved
him, he puts him to worke, and sets him his taske
saying, <hi>feede my sheepe;</hi> and last of all,</p>
            <p>Eighthly, whether thou wouldest not onely
doe, but suffer much for his sake, as <hi>David,</hi> when
his wife <hi>Michal</hi> laughed at him for dancing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Arke, he was contented to beare it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he did it to the Lord; and so the Apostles
rejoyced because they wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> counted <hi>worthy to
suffer for his name</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 5. 41.</note>. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> likewise when
the people intreated him with teares, not to goe
up to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> because he should be bound, as
<hi>Agabus</hi> had signified by the spirit unto him, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
them, <hi>Why doe yee rent my heart, I am ready
not onely to be bound, but also to dye for &amp;c.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 21. 13.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:15495:10"/>
But thou wilt say,<note place="margin">Object.</note> I have no such occasions now
adayes, if I had, I know not what I should doe.</p>
            <p>But I answer,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> is it so? hast thou no such occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions?
yes, thou hast occasions enough, as when
he takes away thy wife, thy child, thy friends, thy
goods, thy good name &amp;c. if then (I say) thou
canst beare it patiently with <hi>Iob,</hi> and say, <hi>it is the
Lord giveth, and the Lord &amp;c.</hi> or with <hi>Ely, it is
the Lord, let him doe what seemeth him good:</hi> then
thou lovest him, and yet thou must doe more then
that, thou must not onely beare it patiently, but
ioyfully too, as you heard before the Apostles
did; lay thy selfe to these rules then, and try im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
whether thou love the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ</hi>
or not; and forthy further helpe and more infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
notice thereof, to know whether thy love
to him be pure and unfained, or whether it be
false and counterfeit, take these more particular
proofes of it; for assure thy selfe if thou love him
aright (as we touched before) that then,</p>
            <p>First thou wilt be content with nothing but
love againe, so that as <hi>Absolon</hi> (though in hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie)
said, when as <hi>David</hi> had fetch'd him out
of banishment, and confined him to his owne
house that he might not see the Kings face, <hi>what
doe I here, seeing I may not see the Kings face</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">2 Sam. 14. 32.</note>?
so wouldest thou say out of love to the love of
God; what doe I here, since I cannot behold the
faire beauty of the Lord? Lord lift thou up the
light of thy countenance upon mee, or else what
good will my life doe me; but if thou doe so,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:15495:10"/>
               <hi>then thou shalt make my heart more joyfull and more
glad, then they that have had their Corne and Wine
and Oyle increased</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 4.</note>.</p>
            <p>Secondly, thou wilt love the brethren, for they
are like him, though he exceede them in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
and measures of goodnesse, as the Ocean
doth a drop of a bucket, this is a pregnant proofe
hereof, and therefore deale squarely with thy
selfe herein. And the reason why thou canst not
love the Lord if thou love not the Brethren, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
its an easier matter to love man whom thou
hast seene, then it is to love God whom thou hast
not seene; for use (we know) makes them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
and hansomer; wherefore Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>If
any man say he loves God, and yet hates his Brother,
he is a lyer, he deceives himselfe, and there is no
truth in him</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Ioh. 4. 20.</note>.</p>
            <p>But thou wilt say, thou lovest them well enough.
Dost thou so? then thou wilt love their company;
for what we love and delight in, we are never
well without it, nor cannot endure it out of our
sight; and therefore when the <hi>Psalmist</hi> had said
<hi>That all his delight was in the Saints, and upon such
as excell in vertue</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 16.</note>, if you would know, how to
know it was so, he afterwards tells us, <hi>That he was
a companion of them that feare him, &amp;c. Psal.</hi> 119.</p>
            <p>But thou wilt say againe,<note place="margin">Object.</note> though thou dost not
love them, yet God forbid thou shouldst be so bad
but that thou shouldst love the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sol.</note>
But I answer thee againe to that too; If thou dost
so, then thou wilt love his appearing, for if thou
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:15495:11"/>
wish in thy heart there were no generall iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
thou lovest him not, say what thou wilt to
the contrary; as a loving and loyall wife cannot
love her husband but shee will reioyce at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
home when he is abroad, and the neerer the
time approacheth, by so much the more ioyfull
and glad will shee be.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if thou love him thou wilt speake
well of him upon all occasions, and in every place
where thou commest, <hi>for out of the abundance of the
heart the mouth speaketh;</hi> so that if thou speake
well of God, but for fashion sake, not out of any
true affection, but of feare, thou lovest him not;
for he that loves him will be much in his praise,
as we have an instance in <hi>David,</hi> so that if the
heart be inflamed, the mouth will be open, thou
wilt not be tongue-tied, nor ashamed of him, no
not before Princes.</p>
            <p>But thou wilt say, I am no scholler,<note place="margin">Object.</note> I cannot
speake eloquently; if I could, then indeede I
should not be so afraid, nor ashamed to doe it, as
now I am, because I can doe it no better, nor
Rhetorically then now I can.</p>
            <p>But let me tell thee for thy comfort,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> let that
never trouble thee, speake as well as thou canst,
and thou needst care for no more, for that will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
more and more love in thee, and love that
will make thee eloquent; we have a notable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedent
for this in the <hi>Spouse,</hi> who because shee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Christ, see how shee sets him forth, <hi>my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
is all beautifull &amp;c*.</hi> and it is most sure,<note place="margin">Cant. 5.</note> it
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:15495:11"/>
will be so with thee; if thou love the Lord, thou
wilt shew it by thy speeches, for thou canst not
well speake well of him whom thou lovest not;
but if thou hast no good thought of him, thy
words will bewray thee; yea thou wilt not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
speake well of him, and of his wayes, but thou
wilt also walke in the same, nor wilt thou stand
pausing upon it, to consider whether thou wert
best doe it, or no; but if it be about a good duty,
as suppose keeping of the Lords day, hearing of
the word &amp;c. thou wilt doe it without any more
adoe, yea though there were no promise nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to be got by it, for else thou dost no more but
as a servant, not as sonne, in hope of wages, and
not out of love, looking for nothing for thy
paines: so did Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> he would preach the
Gospell, though he had nothing but chaines and
imprisonment for his labour; and why will he
so? why? because God commands it, and its a
good duty; so that if thou make a question of it,
whether thou wert best to doe this or that good
duty, or wilt doe no more then thou must needs,
thou lovest not the Lord, for he that loves him,
will doe whatsoever he can for him, and yet
thinke all too little when he hath done too.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, as thou wilt speake well of him thy
selfe, so thou wilt not endure to heare others
speake ill of him, but thy heart will be mooved
within thee at them, and at any thing that might
impeach and hurt his glory; as to see his Church
lye wast, his word corrupted &amp;c. so <hi>Ely</hi> was
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:15495:12"/>
not mooved so much with the death of his
Sonnes, as to heare <hi>that the Arke of God was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken*.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 13.</note>
and indeede they are bastards and not sons
that can heare their father reviled, and railed on,
and never be affected, nor offended at it.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, if thy love to the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ</hi> be
sincere and sound, thou wilt be loath to lose him,
for we will rather lose all we have, then lose the
favour and affection of a friend, whom we love
intirely; and as thou wouldst be loath to lose him,
so thou wouldst be as loath to offend him, or doe
any thing whereby thou mightest be like so to
doe; or if so be thou hast, thou wilt never be at
quiet till thou hast gained his good will againe,
whatsoever it cost thee to get it.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, thou wilt linger and hang after him, as
we may see in the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> she would
not be said nay, but let him say or doe what he
would, she would not leave him, but she still staid
by him till he had granted her suite.</p>
            <p>Examine thy selfe then narrowly by these
signes likewise, and when thou hast done so, and
findest thy selfe guilty in any, or all of these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
then confesse thy sinne unto the Lord,
and beg the pardon of it at his hands, leave him
not till he hath heard thee, and granted thee the
request of thy lips, <hi>by saying unto thy soule, I am
thy salvation;</hi> and witnessing with thy spirit, that
thou art his child by adoption and grace. And so
as I have hitherto shewed you some reasons, <hi>why
he is accursed that loves not the Lord Iesus Christ,</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:15495:12"/>
ought to love him, and whereby thou mayst be
incited and stirred up thereunto; for as <hi>David</hi>
said in another case, <hi>the Lord is worthy to be praised,</hi>
so may I say, the Lord is worthy to be beloved,
and that in many respects; as</p>
            <p>First, because he hath all the glory and beauty
in himselfe that ever thou sawest in any creature,
it is in its full perfection in him; whereas it is but
in part in any creature, as the light is in its full
lustre and strength in the Sunne; whereas the
Starres and Planets have but a glimpse or beame
of it, and tha by participation, and not in it selfe,
as in a fountaine; and therefore the <hi>Spouse</hi> in the
<hi>Canticles</hi> saith, <hi>that he is all glorious, or that all
glory is in him;</hi> and this is the reason why some
love him, and others love him not, because he
hath manifested and revealed himselfe and his
glory to some, and not to others, as unto <hi>Moses,
Abraham, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, he is unchangeable, ther's no man
but that thou shalt at some time or other, see that
in him, which might make thee not to love him,
but in God we cannot finde any such matter, for
he is <hi>Iehovah, semper idem, yesterday, to day,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iames 1. 17.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
there's no variablenesse nor shadow, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, because he is Almighty, he can doe
whatsover he will; there is nothing impossible
to him; and as he is able to doe all he will, so he
will doe all that he is able, so farre forth as it may
make for his owne glory and thy good.</p>
            <p>But thou wilt say,<note place="margin">Object.</note> why? is this such a load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
of love?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:15495:13"/>
Yes verily that it is, for by his omnipotency
are understood all the excellency and glory, all
the grace and vertues that are in God.</p>
            <p>But thou wilt say,<note place="margin">Object.</note> I have often offended him,
will he then yet heare me, or accept of my love
for all that?</p>
            <p>Yes that he will,<note place="margin">Solu.</note> for he is gracious and mercifull.</p>
            <p>Oh,<note place="margin">Object.</note> but I have nothing in me, but am ready to
offend him againe.</p>
            <p>What if thou be,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> 
               <hi>yet he is long suffering,</hi> so
that he will not cast thee off, if so be thou wilt
cleave to him?</p>
            <p>Oh,<note place="margin">Object.</note> but how shall I know that?</p>
            <p>I answer,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> thou shalt know it by his word;
and that is truth it selfe; search the Scriptures
therefore, and there thou shalt heare him say as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
in plaine termes, <hi>he that commeth to me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 37.</note> 
               <hi>I
will in no wise &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> but my sinnes are such strange ones, as no
bodies are.</p>
            <p>Suppose they were,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> yet his mercy is infinite,
and farre more then thy sinnes are, or can be: but
yet that is not so as thou sayst, for there have bin
as great sinners as thou, whatsoever thou art,
which yet neverthelesse upon their faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
have beene received into grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
againe; as were, <hi>Mary Magdalen, Peter,
David,</hi> and diverse others besides them.</p>
            <p>Oh,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> but for all that I am not worthy of his love,
and it will be a disparagement for him to set his
love upon such a one as I am.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:15495:13"/>
But what is that to thee?<note place="margin">Sol.</note> if he thinke thee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy;
as so he doth, for he sues unto thee, what
needst thou stand upon that, why shouldst thou care
for any more? now this is all the dowry and duty
he askes of thee, <hi>for what doth the Lord thy God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of thee, ô</hi> Israel, <hi>but that thou love him*?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 10. 12.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And moreover, besides this, consider that it is
he that first gave thee this affection, that thou
shouldst love him; and that ther's none other on
whom thou canst better bestow it, or who more
deserves it at thy hands, then he doth.</p>
            <p>And finally, consider that thou hast engaged
thy selfe unto him by vow in Baptisme, so that as
<hi>Ioshua</hi> said unto the Children of <hi>Israel, yee are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
against your selves, that you have chosen the
Lord, to serve him;</hi> so are yee against your selves,
and every time that ye receive the Sacrament of
the Lords Supper, you renew your covenant; so
that if you love and serve not the Lord, you are
so many times witnesses against your selves.</p>
            <p>And here let us make some little stand to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
up the severall circumstances that doe engage
us to love him; as,</p>
            <p>First, that he is our Lord, and hath bought us
at a very high rate; now if a condemned person,
or a man taken by the <hi>Turkes,</hi> should bee replee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
or ransomed by another, we would all thinke
it his duty that he should love him as long as hee
lives for it: and so stands the case with us, we all
sate in darkenesse and in the shadow of death, and
were taken Captive by Satan, at his pleasure; and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:15495:14"/>
Christ hath redeemed us from that his more then
<hi>AEgyptian</hi> bondage,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 18. 19.</note> 
               <hi>and that not with corruptible
things, as silver or gold, but with his precious blood,
as of a Lambe without, &amp;c.</hi> and doth not he then
deserve thy love? canst thou deny him such a
small thing as that is? Againe consider</p>
            <p>Secondly, what he hath done for thee, even
from thy youth up, how he hath fed thee, forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
thee thine offences, and paid the debt for thee,
when thou wast ready to goe to prison for it, so
that now the Lord begins to grow angry with
thee, if thou wilt not yet love him for all this;
and yet this is not all, and therefore</p>
            <p>Thirdly, consider also that he loves thee; now
as fire begets fire, so doth love beget love, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
saith Saint <hi>Iohn, we love him, because he loved
us first;</hi> that is, his love to us should make us love
him againe: but especially we cannot but love
him, if we consider in the last place,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, what his love is, <hi>for its unspeakeable,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 3. 19</note>
               <hi>and passing knowledge;</hi> we can never conceive
the height and length &amp;c. All which, what
should it teach us, but these two things?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, that if we will not love the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 22.</note> he will
shew his wrath, and make his power knowne upon us,
that we are but vessells of wrath, fitted for destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<hi>as it is said. Againe,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, it should exhort us to love the <hi>Lord
Iesus Christ;</hi> and therefore to provoke us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
we should often consider, and thinke in
these things, what right and title he hath to us,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:15495:14"/>
how much he hath done for us, and how greatly
he loves: yea and more then all this, wee shall
thereby also have these and these things, wee
shall by this meanes reape these and these bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits.</p>
            <p>First, we shall have his spirit, the spirit of truth,
the Comforter which shall leade us into all truth,
and enable us to fullfill his Commandements, and
with facility and ease, whereas else they would be
grievous unto us; as for example, Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
would soone have beene weary of preaching and
suffering so much as he did, if he had not had this
love in him; and why doe parents thinke nothing
too much for their children, but because they
love them? therefore it is that though they bee
froward and untoward, yet still they beare with
them: if then we cannot finde in our hearts
to be quiet, untill they looke to the Lord, like as
the needle of a compasse which is toucht with a
Loadstone, will never stand still till it comes to
the North-pole; then may this be a testimony
unto us, that may distinguish us from Hypocrites,
and witnesse to our soules that we love the <hi>Lord
Iesus Christ;</hi> for they keepe the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God in some sort, and abstaine from
some one kinde of sinne, but not out of love to
him, nor in any obedience and conscience of his
word, but in love to themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, this is a marke of thy Resurrection
from the death of sinne, to the life of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
hereby shall yee knew that yee are translated
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:15495:15"/>
from death to life, because yee love the brethren,
now yee cannot love them, but you must love the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that begot them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, thou shalt get by this thy love to him,
for when thou givest him thy heart, he will give
it thee againe, he will onely alter the object, but
let thee keepe the affection still, onely it shall be
better then it was before, he will purifie it from
all its corruptions, and cleanse it from all its sins:
Nor shall this be any thing out of thy way, it
shall be as much for thy profit as ever it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
for when thy heart is set to keepe his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
<hi>when it inclines to his statutes,</hi> (as so
hee will incline it) <hi>then whatsoever thou dost,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay 58. 14.</note> 
               <hi>it
shall prosper:</hi> so that as its said of the Sabbath, <hi>that
it was made for man;</hi> that is, for mans good; so
may we say the same of all the rest of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
that it is made for man; that is, for
his good and benefit,<note place="margin">Deut. 5. 33.</note> and therefore <hi>the promise of
life and happinesse is made to all alike.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here by the way take this difference along
with thee, to distinguish thy love from selfe love,
for that is all for it selfe, but this is all for him
whom thou lovest; if then thou love the Lord
for thine owne good, it is selfe love, but if thou
love him for himselfe, simply without any respect
to the recompence of reward, then is it true love
indeede.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, wee shall receive much comfort by
loving the Lord: now what is that keepes us
from loving of him but our pleasures? we are
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:15495:15"/>
loath to part with them, and yet alas we shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
much more, and they farre more substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall,
sollider, and sounder comfort by loving of
him, then ever we should by loving of the world,
or the things of the world. Now doe but thinke
how good a thing it is to love one that is but like
thee? much rather shouldst thou love one that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for thee; wherefore if thou wouldst have thy
heart filled with joy and comfort, love him; for
so thou shalt have joy unspeakeable and glorious.
And last of all, if thou wouldst indeede unfained<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
love the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ;</hi> consider,</p>
            <p>Fiftly, that it makes thee a more excellent man
then thou wast before; for every man is better or
worse according to his love, as it is set on things
better or worse; now Christ is the <hi>Summum bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
the chiefest good, and if thou love him, thou
art united unto him, and to his God-head, for
love is of a uniting nature.</p>
            <p>Thou wilt say,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> these are indeede good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
to make us to love him, but how shall I
come by this love? or by what meanes shall I
get this love into my heart?</p>
            <p>For answer whereunto, I tell thee, first of all,<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
that if thou canst but unfeinedly desire to love
him, thou hast halfe done this worke already;
and that thou mayst have such a desire, meditate
often upon those motives before.</p>
            <p>This is the answer Christ himselfe gave to his
Disciples, when they asked him, how they
should get faith; why, saith he, <hi>if you have faith
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:15495:16"/>
but as a graine of mustard feed, you should say to this
mountaine, be thou removed, and be thou throwne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the midst of the Sea, &amp;c.</hi> thereby shewing them
the excellency of it, that so he might the more
enamour them with the love of it, and make them
desire it above all that they could imagine and
thinke of besides, in comparison thereof: but if
thou wouldst (as thou sayst thou desirest to) love
the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ</hi> indeede, <hi>with all thy heart,
with all thy soule, and with &amp;c.</hi> I answer, and add
againe, thou canst not use a better meanes to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
thereunto, and get the love of him into thy
heart then these.</p>
            <p>First, pray unto God for it, for all graces are
his gifts, they are meere <hi>Donatives,</hi> and hee hath
promised to heare them that aske in his Sonnes
name, and to give the spirit to them that aske it,
that is, to give the gifts and graces thereof unto
them; nor is he any niggard, for he giveth libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
and obraideth not.</p>
            <p>But thou wilt say,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> how doth prayer beget
love?</p>
            <l>I answer, it begets it two wayes.</l>
            <l>First,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> by prevailing with God.</l>
            <l>Secondly, by familiarity with him.</l>
            <p>First, I say, by prevailing with God; so did
<hi>Iaacob,</hi> and the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> for considering
that he hath condescended to their request; that
he hath granted their suite, and heard their peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that in such a matter, as they are never
able to make him any part of amends; as the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:15495:16"/>
forgivenesse of their sinnes; why, then they
thinke that to love him, is one of the least things
they can doe for him, so <hi>Mary Magdalen loved
much, because much was forgiven her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, by familiarity with him, we have a
saying, that <hi>nimium familiaritatis contemptum pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that too much familiarity breeds contempt;</hi> and
however amongst some men it may sometimes
fall out so, yet its seldome seene amongst those
that are intimate friends indeede; or say it should,
yet I say, it never so comes to passe betwixt God
and the faithfull soule; but by how much the
more familiar and frequent they are together, by
so much the more fervent and indissoluble is their
love: and this is most certaine, that a man that is
a stranger may with thee well, but cannot truely
love thee, till he be acquainted with thee; so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
canst thou love the Lord as thou shouldst, so
long as you are strangers one to another; and
what brings us and the Lord better acquainted
together, then prayer? wherein (as it were) thou
talkest familiarly with God; even as a man talketh
with his friend face to face: this is the first
meanes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, desire the Lord to shew himselfe
unto thee, as <hi>Moses</hi> did, for this is a strong motive
and meanes to make thee love him; therefore
(saith our Saviour to his Disciples that) <hi>hee that
loveth him, shall bee beloved of his Father, and I
will love him, and will manifest my selfe unto him</hi>*,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 21.</note>
which is, as if he had said, if you would know how
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:15495:17"/>
you shall come to love me, or my father, it shall
be by this way or meanes; <hi>I will manifest my
selfe unto you, I will shew you my glory, and then you
cannot choose but love mee, though you loved me not
before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the ordinary way and meanes whereby
he reveales himselfe unto any one, is by the
preaching of the word, which though it be but a
dead letter in it selfe, yet when hee puts life and
spirit into it, and opens our hearts, as he did open
<hi>Liddeahs</hi> thereby, then we see and conceive his
mercy and our owne wretched vilenesse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
we cannot but love him, knowing how hee
hath loved us, and gave himselfe for us: and
therefore the Apostle prayeth, <hi>That the God of our
Lord Iesus Christ would give the Ephesians the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of knowledge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes 1. 17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>wisdome, and revelation, that the
eyes of their understanding being enlightened, they
may know what is the hope of his calling, and the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the glory of his inheritance in his Saints*;</hi>
as if he had said, if you know but these things,
then there is no doubt to be made of it but that
you will love him, as well as one would desire:
for this is one sure ground why we love him not,
or love him no better then we doe, because wee
know him no better; we are ignorant of him, and
<hi>ignoti nulla cupido</hi> (as it is said) there is no love,
no longing desire after that which we know not,
or know not the worth and necessity of it: as a
sicke man hath no thought after the soveraigne
druggs in the Apothecaries shop, because hee is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:15495:17"/>
ignorant of any such matter; whereas the skilfull
Physitian seekes out and sends for them: and as
an ordinary rusticke, cares not for a precious
pearle, but casts it away when he findes it; which
if an expert Lapidary had it, hee would set much
by it, because he knowes the price and worth of
it well enough: and thence it is, that when the
Prophet <hi>David</hi> had professed his love to God,
saying, <hi>I will love thee ô Lord my strength;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 18. 1.</note> hee
afterwards addes (as it were) the reason or
ground of that his love towards him; <hi>because hee
bowed the Heavens and came downe.</hi> Whats that?
why that he had made himselfe knowne unto him:<note place="margin">ver. 9.</note>
he had declared his power and might in his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
and that was it that made him love him;
if therefore thou wilt but desire (I say) to love
him, he will inflame thy heart with the love of
him; yea he will open the Heavens, and thou
shalt see him sitting on the right hand of God;<note place="margin">Act. 7. 56.</note> as
Saint <hi>Steven</hi> did.</p>
            <p>But thou wilt say, all these are the workes of
God, and they extraordinary ones too;<note place="margin">Quest.</note> but what
must I doe for my part, to have the love of God
in my heart? to which I answer.</p>
            <p>First, no; it is no such extraordinary thing for
God to reveale himselfe to his Saints;<note place="margin">Answ.</note> it is an usuall
manner with him; but yet,</p>
            <p>Secondly, thou must doe these things thy selfe:
First, thou must looke how he hath revealed
himselfe in the Scriptures, to be a most glorious
and gracious God, a mercifull Father in <hi>Iesus
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:15495:18"/>
Christ, slow to anger, and of much mercy;</hi> and now
when we perceive him to be such a one, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but love him, and long after him with all our
hearts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we must consider our owne misery;
this made <hi>Mary</hi> to seeke after him, and were it not
but that we stand in neede of him, but that wee
know wee are undone and damned without
Christ, wee should never care so much for him,
<hi>for the whole have no neede of the Physitian,</hi> that is,
they care not for his skill, nor his helpe; but they
that are sicke, they that know their owne wants
and weakenesses, they know how to value and
esteeme of him: and so we, when we see we are
wounded by sinne, and sicke unto death, then
will we enquire and seeke out for the spirituall
Physitian of our soules, <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, we must humble our selves before
him confessing our sinnes, and that in particular,
as many as we can, by the omission of such and
such good duties, and the commission of these and
these sinnes: especially we must confesse our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
bosome-raigning sinnes; so the Prodigall
Sonne confessed, <hi>that he had sinned especially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Heaven, and before his father, by ryotous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 15. 19.</note>
               <hi>whereby he was unworthy to be called his sonne,
and did desire onely to be as one of his hired
servants:</hi> and now when he saw his father not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
make him so welcome, who had so
meane a conceit of himselfe, that he put a ring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his finger, and shooes on his feete, &amp;c. then
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:15495:18"/>
he loved him much more:<note place="margin">Psal. 4.</note> and so it is with Christ
and us, when we are once out of love with our
selves, and yet perceive that he loves us, who are
not worthy to be beloved, then that makes us love
him againe, and the more lowly we are in our
owne eyes, the more highly doe we esteeme
Christ, and Christ us.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, and lastly, thou must first of all get
faith, for as thy faith is stronger or weaker, so is
thy love more or lesse; if thou hast but a little
faith, thou hast but a little love, for faith is the
ground of love, as the promises are the ground of
faith. Now so long as thou dost not beleeve that
he hath satisfied the divine wrath and justice of
God for thee, and that God hath accepted the
attonement for thee in him, thou canst never love
him as a brother or friend, but rather feare him as
an enemy or Judge; pray therefore with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples,
<hi>Lord encrease our faith,</hi> and therefore ply
the ministery of the word, <hi>for that is the meanes
whereby faith is wrought and begotten in any one</hi>*;<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 17.</note>
else (I say) againe, thou canst never truely love
him, but as thou dost another man which thou
knowest not whether hee love thee againe, or no;
and so thou mayst hate him againe at some time
or other for all that: but labour for faith, and
that will breede love; and then if thou love him
he will surely love thee; yea, indeede, thou
couldst neither love nor beleeve in him, were it
not but hee loves thee first.</p>
            <p>But thou wilt say, how shall I know that?<note place="margin">Quest.</note> I
answer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:15495:19"/>
It is the Apostle Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> owne words,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> or
rather his words by that his Apostle; <hi>wee love
him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 4. 19.</note> 
               <hi>because hee loved us first.</hi> And besides his
word (though that were enough) thou hast his
seale, he hath given thee his Sonne, who hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
his life for thee, and shed his most precious
blood for thy salvation; and would he have done
this for thee (thinkest thou) if he had not loved
thee? no, but herein is love, not that wee loved
God, but that God loved us, and sent his Sonne
to die for us, <hi>that so by the blood of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hee might seale the same unto us</hi>*;<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 4. 10.</note> and even
yet by his spirit, hee still sues unto us for our love,
as a further testimony thereof.</p>
            <p>Oh but (thou wilt say), I am not worthy of so
great love,<note place="margin">Object.</note> for I am a sinner, disobedient, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious.</p>
            <p>But I answer, what dost thou tell him of that?
what if thou wert the chiefe of sinners;<note place="margin">Answ.</note> he knew
that before he gave thee his Sonne; and he gave
him unto thee the rather, because he knew thou
wast so, for he justifies the ungodly; that is, those
that condemne and judge themselves to be so; so
that if thou wilt but beleeve in him, and imbrace
him, it is as much as he desires of thee.</p>
            <p>But thou wilt say,<note place="margin">Object.</note> it may be he is affected to
this or that person, and not to me: to which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
againe.</p>
            <p>That his commission is generall;<note place="margin">Solu.</note> 
               <hi>Goe preach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <note place="margin">Matth. 28. 19.</note>

               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:15495:19"/>
so that if thou wilt but beleeve and come in unto
him, thou shalt be saved; for he casts out none
that come in unto him (as you heard before) <hi>Ioh.</hi>
6. 37.</p>
            <p>And when thou hast considered this, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to argue and reason thus with thy selfe; sith
the promise is made to all, I know I am one of that
number, and then thou wilt begin to love him for
all thou art a sinner, yea thou wilt love him so
much the more for that, to consider that for all
that he loved thee.</p>
            <p>Oh but (thou wilt say) I see I sinne dayly and
hourely, and that againe and againe, against many
vowes and promises,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> against many mercies and
meanes of better obedience</p>
            <p>But I answer; what though thou dost?<note place="margin">Sol.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that as there's a spring of sinne and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
in thee, so there's a spring of mercy and
compassion in God; and that spring is set open
for sinne and for uncleanesse, to wash and purge
thee from the same, so that still (I say) if thou
wilt but love and beleeve in him, he will love
thee; for notwithstanding all this, hee still woes
and sues unto thee for thy love, and therefore
stand no longer out with him, but come in with
all the speede thou canst make, which that thou
mayst the better doe, thou must remove these
two hinderances out of the way<list>
                  <item>Strangenesse,</item>
                  <item>Worldly mindednesse.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:15495:20"/>
First, <hi>Strangenesse</hi>] for strangenesse begets cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of love, whereas familiarity (as I told you)
procures boldnesse in the day of judgment.</p>
            <p>But (thou wilt say) how shall I come to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with God?<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
            </p>
            <p>How?<note place="margin">Answ.</note> why be much in his praise, in hearing
of the word, and receiving of the Sacrament,
there is a communion of Saints (you know) and so
there's a communion of God with the Saints; let
us therefore be carefull to maintaine this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
betwixt us; by having recourse unto
him in his ordinances, and seeking unto him for
comfort in all our troubles and adversities.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Worldly mindednesse</hi>] that also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
coldnesse of affection, and want of love to
the Lord Christ, and therefore hee circumcises
the heart;<note place="margin">Deut. 30. 6.</note> that is, he puts off all carnall and
worldly affections from it, that so thou mayst not
love the world, nor the things of the world, but
<hi>may love him with all the heart, and with all &amp;c.</hi>
for the love of the world is enmity with God, so
that if any man love the world, the love of the
father is not in him, <hi>for you cannot serve God and
Mammon;</hi> and therefore our Saviour saith, <hi>That
we must not onely forsake, but hate father, and mother,
and wife, and children, and house, and lands for his
sake and the Gospells;</hi> or else we cannot be his
Disciples: so did the Apostles, <hi>we have forsaken
all and followed thee.</hi> Wherefore let us not set
these things too neere our hearts, but consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what it is that keepes us asunder; as vaine
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:15495:20"/>
hopes, worldly feares, fantasticke pride, pleasures,
profits, and the like, let us cashiere them, and cast
them from us; for what are all these, and all such
as these are? but vaine things that cannot profit
in the evill day.</p>
            <p>And therefore as <hi>Samuel</hi> exhorts the people of
<hi>Israel, Turne not aside from the Lord unto them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the right hand or to the left;</hi> for they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
profit, because they are vaine.</p>
            <p>But (thou wilt say) will God then be content
with any love?<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, no truely that he will not neither;<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
what then? Answer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, thou must love him</hi> withall thy strength, and
with all thy power, with all the parts and faculties
of soule and body.</p>
            <p>Now it may be thou art a Magistrate, a master
of a family, a Minister, a Tutor, or any other go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
and then thou must doe God more ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
then another private and inferiour person;
thou mayst compell them that are under thee, to
love the Lord by thy authority and example;
God lookes for this (I say) at thy hands; <hi>for to
whom much is given, of them much shall be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;</hi>
thou art but as a servant sent to market,
which must give an account for what hee hath
received, and the more money hee hath given
him to bestow and lay out, the more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
his master lookes he should bring home with
him for it; so the more wit or understanding, or
learning, or knowledge, or authority, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:15495:21"/>
thou hast, the more love must thou beare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christ, and shew it by thy bringing forth more
fruits thereof unto him, then others that have
none of all these oportunities, or not in so great a
measure as thou hast, this is the first thing.</p>
            <p>Secondly, thou must love him above all things
in the world besides, whether it be pleasure, or
honour, or pride, or profit, or what else thou
wilt, or canst name besides; yea thou must love
him above thy selfe and thine owne salvation; so
that if his glory, and any, or all of these come in
competition together, thou canst be content to
be accursed for his sake, to have thy name razed
out of the booke of life, and to be <hi>Anathema</hi> for
Christ; then is thy love such as God will accept
of, for this is that selfe-deniall which Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
speakes of, and calls for of us.</p>
            <p>But thou wilt say,<note place="margin">Object.</note> 
               <hi>durus est hic sermo, this is an
hard saying,</hi> how shall I be able to doe this? to
which I answer.</p>
            <p>Thou shalt doe it the better,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> by considering
that he is better then all things, and that the
whole world is not to be compared with him;<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 18.</note> 
               <hi>I
count that all the afflictions of this life, are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the glory that shall be revealed</hi> (saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle)
and that made him endure such persecutions
for the Gospell as he did, with joy and patience;
and so if thou be once come to that passe as to
know and be perswaded in thy conscience, of the
incomparable worth and excellency of Christ,
thou wilt make more reckoning of him, then of all
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:15495:21"/>
the world besides; for as he himselfe said of
himselfe, <hi>He that will not deny himselfe, and take
up his crosse, and follow mee, is not worthy of mee;</hi> so
he that loves any thing else above, or equall with
Christ, is not worthy of him; no, thou must be
wholly his as he is, <hi>as he is wholly thine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hos. 2. 19.</note> 
               <hi>and hath
betroathed thee unto himselfe;</hi> so that as a Virgin
that hath betaken her selfe to an husband, must
forsake all other, and cleave or keepe her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
unto him, so long as they both shall live;
so wee, being married unto Christ, must not play
the Harlot, and goe a whooring after other
Gods, but must be wholly his, as he is wholly
thine.</p>
            <p>But thou wilt say, he is not wholly mine, for
he is the Saints too.<note place="margin">Object.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To which I answer; he is indivisible,<note place="margin">Solu.</note> hee is
not divided, but is wholly thine as wel as theirs, so
then if thou wilt love the Lord Christ truely and
purely, as he would thou shouldst, thou must love
him so, as that all that is within thee be set upon
him.</p>
            <p>But (thou wilt say againe yet further) what,<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
must wee love nothing else but him then? to
which I answer.</p>
            <p>Yes that thou mayst,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> so as it be with a subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
and not with an adulterous love, as a woman
may love another man besides her husband, but
it must not be with such a love as she loves her
husband withall, she may not love his bed; it
must be onely with a neighbourly and civill, but
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:15495:22"/>
not with a conjugall or matrimoniall love, and so
thou mayst love thy lands, thy life, thy friends,
&amp;c. but so as thou art ready to part with all for
love of Christ: so that hereby shalt thou know
whether thy love be an adulterous love or not,
if when he bids us follow the duties of our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
and we suffer our selves to be drawne away
by vaine delights,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 24.</note> 
               <hi>and doe not therein abide with
God</hi> (as the Apostle speakes;) that is, use it not
to the glory of God, and the good of the Church
and Common-wealth wherein we live; and so
for any other matter, if we cannot be content it
should give place to Christ, then is our love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
and adulterous, yea if our lives lay upon it,
if we doe not yet preferre him before them, wee
are not worthy of him, we love our selves more
then him, it is no true love of Christ.</p>
            <p>But thou wilt say,<note place="margin">Object.</note> this is impossible, that a man
should thus love God more then himselfe, more
then his soule.<note place="margin">Sol.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, I deny not but that it may seeme so
to flesh and blood; but yet thou must know, that
to a man truely regenerate it is not so; for (as
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith) <hi>I am able to doe all things through
Christ that strengthens me:</hi> those things that to
the eyes of carnall reason seeme hard and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
to them that are spiritually enlightened, are
facile and easie to be done, and so is this.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If thou wouldst have thy love plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to God; thou must have it grounded on him,
and that requires two things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:15495:22"/>
First, It must be grounded on faith in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
revealed unto thee in his word; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
faith, it is impossible to please God, neither
is it so much love, as presumption that hath not
this foundation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it must be grounded on his person,
not on his prerogatives or priviledges which thou
shalt get thereby, for if we love him onely for his
Kingdome, and not for his person (as we doe
when we cannot be content to suffer temptation
and persecution for his sake) then he cares not for
thy love, because it is selfe love, and not love of
the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> for then if it were, thou
wouldst respect nothing else but him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, thy love must be a diligent love,
ready to reforme any thing that is amisse in thee,
or which may dislike him;<note place="margin">1 Thes. 1. 3.</note> which whether it be
so or no, thou mayst try it by these three markes
or tokens following.</p>
            <p>First, it will cause thee to put on new apparrell;
a woman that loves her husband, will attire her
selfe according as she thinkes it will please him
best, and give him most content, especially when
shee is to be married unto him, then she will have
a wedding garment that may set her forth, so as
he may take the better liking in her: so thou, if
thou hast put off the old man which is corrupt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the deceiveable lusts of the flesh, and
hast put on the new man, which after God is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
in knowledge, righteousnesse, and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
if thou be cloathed with the wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:15495:23"/>
of <hi>Christs</hi> righteousnesse, and givest dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
thereunto, to make thy calling and election
sure, then mayst thou be sure thou lovest him, and
that he accepts of that thy love from thee.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It will open and enlarge thy heart
towards him, so as thou wilt dayly love him more
and more, (so saith the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul) my
heart is enlarged towards you ô yee Corintheans;</hi> it
is not any scanty or niggardly kinde of love that
hee will like of, but a full, free, and liberall one;
so that if thou canst not be content to be at some
cost and charges for the maintenance of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
and the enjoyment of his love, thou lovest
him not, or at least he regards not thy love who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
thou art.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it cleanseth thy heart, what is said of
hope, is as true of love; he that hath this love
in him,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 3.</note> 
               <hi>purifies himselfe as he is pure,</hi> and of faith
it purifies the heart, and so doth love; therefore
saith the Apostle againe, <hi>Ye were thus and thus,
but yee are washed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 11.</note> 
               <hi>but yee are sanctified, but yee are
justified, &amp;c.</hi> so that if you would not lose your
labour, if you would have Christ accept of your
love, and you would know that he doth so; suffer
not any sluttishnesse, any sinne and filthinesse to
rest in your hearts, but sweepe and cleanse them
with the beesome of repentance, from all such
things.</p>
            <p>And so hitherto of the necessity of your loving
the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> together with the meanes,
motives, and markes thereof, and in all these, the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:15495:23"/>
equity and justice of God, <hi>how worthy hee is to bee
accursed that loves him not;</hi> now</p>
            <p>Secondly, followes the object of this our love,
which is <hi>(the Lord Iesus Christ)</hi> who may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
three wayes. as being our <list>
                  <item>Lord,</item>
                  <item>Saviour,</item>
                  <item>Messiah.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>First, as our <hi>Lord]</hi> to whom of due, we doe
owe our love and obedience: now as he that
runnes away from his earthly Lord is worthy to
be hanged for it, so he that runnes away from the
<hi>Lord Christ,</hi> and will not love and serve him, is
most <hi>worthy to be accursed:</hi> but I have spoken of
this sufficiently in the former part of our text, and
therefore because I have beene so large therein, I
will now be more briefe in this, and therefore so
much for the first consideration we must love him
also.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as our Saviour, or Jesus, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
who hath bought and chosen us unto
himselfe, <hi>a peculiar people, zealous of good workes;</hi>
and therefore let us not deferre it,<note place="margin">1 pet. 4. 7.</note> for now are
the last times, the end of all things is at hand,
so that if yee doe not love him now, it will bee
too late hereafter to doe it, if we would never so
faine, and its a fearefull thing to fall into the
hands of the living God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, he is the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the annoynted of the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:15495:24"/>
Lord, the light that should come into the world,
the high Priest of the new Covenant, ordained
and consecrated of God to offer sacrifice for us,
even a peace offering of his precious body and
blood, to bee a reconciliation for us unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and to set us at one againe with him, who
before were utter enemies one to the other, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of God, and hated of him, therefore is he
also called our peace, our Mediator, and Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
and the like: but yet he is not onely made
and appointed to be a Priest unto us, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
us unto his Father; but withall a King too, to
rule over us and subdue us, if so bee wee will
not bee reconciled and come in unto him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
these two words, <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>Iesus,</hi> are here,
(and in diverse other places elsewhere) joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
together. And so Saint <hi>Peter</hi> gives him
two the like titles, saying that he is a Prince,
and a Saviour; not a Saviour onely, <hi>but also a
Prince to them that would not that hee should raigne
over them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 5. 31.</note>
            </p>
            <p>So that wee must marke this then, wee doe
not preach <hi>Christ</hi> in the Gospell a Saviour one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but a Prince, and a Lord also; and they
that love him must be content to take him as
both, aswell a Lord and King, as a Iesus and
Saviour; as a wife takes her husband, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and obey him aswell as to love him, or
have him keepe and cherish her in sicknesse and
in health: and thus if wee bee content to take
Christ upon these conditions, then wee shall
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:15495:24"/>
have him with all his influences, all the fruits
and benefits of his passion: but otherwise thou
hast no part nor portion therein, Christ shall
profit thee nothing, but thou art and shalt bee
accursed to the death notwithstanding hee
died.</p>
            <p>It may be thou wilt say,<note place="margin">Object.</note> thou carest not for
that.</p>
            <p>But let me aske thee one question;<note place="margin">Sol.</note> dost thou
know what it is to bee so accursed? if thou
dost, consider more seriously of it, if thou dost
not, know it is this; First, he curseth thy soule, and that in a double respect of<list>
                  <item>Grace,</item>
                  <item>Glory.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>First, hee curseth it from the excellency of
grace; that is, from the effectuall and powerfull
working of it, so that thou shalt bee never the
better,<note place="margin">Rom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 5.</note> but rather the worse for all the meanes
of grace and salvation; and shalt goe on in thine
impenitency and hardnesse of heart, which
cannot repent &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But thou wilt still say, thats nothing;<note place="margin">Object.</note> Is it
not so, then</p>
            <p>Secondly, hee curseth thee from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
in whose presence is the fullnesse of
joyes, and at whose right hand, &amp;c. so hee
did <hi>Caine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 16.</note> the text saith, <hi>hee went out from the
presence of the Lord*,</hi> that hee cast off all care
of him (as it were in this life) so as let what
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:15495:25"/>
would befall him, hee would never pitty, nor
protect him.</p>
            <p>But it may be, thou wilt say,<note place="margin">Object.</note> that is nothing
neither.</p>
            <p>Is it not so?<note place="margin">Sol.</note> is it not a great griefe for a man
to be confind to his house, so that hee must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come to the Court, nor see the Kings face
any more? much more griefe then is it, and
a farre greater judgment must it bee for any
poore soule to be excluded from the presence
of the King of Kings. And however (for the
present) thou dost not now thinke it so much,
yet the time will come thou shalt finde it to bee
one of the most fearefullest things that can bee;
when thou shalt behold <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi>
and <hi>Iacob</hi> in the Kingdome of God, and thou
thy selfe out, to have thy portion with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
and his Angels; and therefore the Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are not afraid to say, that the punishment
of losse is greater then the punishment of
sense.</p>
            <p>But thou wilt say,<note place="margin">Object.</note> these are all spirituall
things, wee feele not these curses; and so as
wee have no crosses nor curses in our outward
man, our estates, our goods, and good name,
wee care not a straw for these, wee neither
feele nor feare them.</p>
            <p>To this therefore I answer,<note place="margin">Solu.</note> that you shall not
escape so, but even in your outward man, in
your body and goods shall you be cursed also,
for the earth shall not yeild her increase unto
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:15495:25"/>
thee, but the Heavens shall bee as brasse, and
the Earth as iron; thou shalt sow much and
reape little; and thou shalt bee a vagabond and
a runnagate upon the face of the earth all the
dayes of thy life; and whosoever meeteth
thee shall slay thee, as the Lord also said to
<hi>Caine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But thou wilt say yet againe;<note place="margin">Object.</note> wee see no such
matter as I speake of, for you know them that
love him as little as your selves, and yet they
thrive and doe well enough, yea better then
many other that love him a great deale bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>To which I answer, it is true, it may bee so,<note place="margin">Sol.</note>
they may proser a while, but they shall be
plagued at the last; either here, or hereafter
in hell fire for evermore. And now doe but
consider seriously of Eternity, what a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
thing it is, that when thou hast beene
there ten thousand times, ten thousand yeares,
thou shalt yet be as farre from ever comming
out, or having of any end of thy torments as
thou wast at the very first moment thou wentest
thither: and therefore remember for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
these two places of Scripture, which here
I desire thee to looke and reade with mee; the
one is, where the wise man saith, <hi>that though
a man live many dayes, and rejoyce in them all,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles. 11. 8.</note> 
               <hi>yet
hee shall remember the dayes of darkenesse, for
they are many, and all that commeth is vanity*;</hi>
that is, all his delights shall have an end, but
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:15495:26"/>
his damnation shall bee eternall, it shall never
have either ease or end. The other place is this;
where the Apostle, <hi>with such as thus despised the
bountifulnesse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 7, 8. 9.</note> 
               <hi>and patience, and long suffering,
and forbearance of God, not knowing that his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
&amp;c.</hi> he tells them that they did but trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
up wrath against the day of wrath, &amp;c. for
God will render unto every man according to
his workes, to them that through patience in
well doing seeke glory and honour &amp;c. and to
them that are contentious, and disobey the truth,
and obey unrighteousnesse, tribulation, and
anguish, and wrath, &amp;c. that is, as if hee
should say, let men please themselves in sinne
as long as they list, yet they shall pay deere
for it at the last upshot; for, for all these things.
God will bring them to judgment, and reward
them according to their workes, whether they
bee good or evill: so that however some drops
of his mercy may light upon them here in this
world, yet then the greate deepe of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and the vast gulfe of his justice shall bee
broken up, and hee shall raine upon them fire
and brimstone, storme, and tempest,<note place="margin">Psal. 11. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>this shall
bee their portion to drinke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This then may reach thee not to deceive
thy selfe any longer, but to know for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
that hee that will not now take the Lord
Jesus, and love Christ whilst hee is offered
unto thee, shall undoubtedly be accursed, and
that with such a curse as is here described; for
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:15495:26"/>
God will not have his Sonne mocked and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by us, there is nothing that angers him
more; and therefore its said (as I said before in
the beginning) <hi>kisse the Sonne least he be angry.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Obiect.</note>
And let us not dreame that it will bee soone e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
then to receive him when his wrath is
once kindled: For if we will not take him now,<note place="margin">Sol.</note>
then we shall not be able to doe it, but shall bee
afraid to come in unto him, for then will his
wrath burne like fire, and scoarch like a flame,<note place="margin">Revel. 1. 14. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>
and therefore Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>That his feete are
of burning brasse, and his eyes of flaming fire,</hi> as
if from top to toe he were all on a raging flame.</p>
            <p>But thou wilt say;<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> what though I doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him now, I may receive him hereafter,
before hee be so throughly mooved, and angry
with mee, as that he will not be pacified.</p>
            <p>To which I answer, indeede I cannot deny it,<note place="margin">Sol.</note>
but that the time of this life is the time of grace, &amp;
offering of reconciliation, and that so long as
there is life, there is hope; but yet I tell thee
withall, that there is a time set downe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
of God, beyond which thou shalt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Christ; for then it may be he hath sworne
in his wrath thou &amp;c. he doth never reject, till
they reject him, and then when they will not
imbrace his offer but refuse him, it is just with
God to refuse them; so that afterwards though
they would receive him, yet they shall not doe
it; thus when the Jewes had once reiected and
refused his Sonne, then he left them; and so
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:15495:27"/>
when the <hi>Israelites</hi> refused the good land, then
he refused them; <hi>and swore in his wrath that
they should never &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here, for a conclusion, let us note that the
Gospell bringeth a swifter and severer curse
then the Law doth; so that (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the
<hi>Hebrewes</hi> hath it) <hi>if hee that despised Moses law
died without mercy, under two or three witnesses,
of how much soarer punishment shall hee be thought
worthy that trampleth under feete &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 28, 29.</note> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as it is there also said in that Epistle;
<hi>Whilst it is time, whilst hee stands at the dore and
knockes, open unto him and receive him, even
now whilst its called to day, harden not your
hearts as in the provocation, &amp;c. least
hereafter he sweare in his wrath &amp;c.</hi>
And so to say no more, consider
what I have said, and the Lord
give you understanding in
all things. <hi>Amen.</hi>
