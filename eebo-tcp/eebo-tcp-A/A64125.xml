            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

reformed thereby.</hi> He that lives an evil Life may preach with Truth and Reason, or as did the Pharisees; but not as Christ, or as one having Authority.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Every Minister in taking ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts of his Life, must judge of his Duty by more strict and severer measures, than he does of his People; and he that ties heavy Burdens upon others, ought himself to carry the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viest end: and many things may be lawful in them, which he must not suffer in himself.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Let every Minister endeavor to be learned in all spiritual wisdom, and skilful in the things of God; for he will ill teach others the way of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, perfectly, that is himself a babe and uninstructed. An ignorant Minister is an head without an eye; and an evil Minister is salt that hath no sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> Every Minister, above all

things, must be careful that he be not a servant of passion, whether of anger or desire. For he that is not a master of his passions will always be useless, and quickly will becom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible and cheap in the eyes of his parish.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> Let no Minister be litigious in any thing; not greedy or covetous; not insisting upon little things, or quarreling for, or exacting of every minute portion of his dues; but boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and easie; remitting of his right, when to do so may be useful to his people, or when the contrary may do mischief, and cause reproach. <hi>Be not over rightous</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon)</hi> that is, not severe in demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or forcing every thing, though it be indeed his due.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> Let not the name of the Church be made a pretence for personal covetousness; by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you are willing to remit many things, but you must not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38074:5"/>
wrong the Church: for though it be true, that you are not to do prejudice to succession, yet many things may be forgiven upon just occasions, from which the Church shall receive no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodity; but be sure that there are but few things which thou art bound to do in thy personal capacitie, but the same also, and more, thou art ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to perform, as thou art a publick person.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> Never exact the offerings,  or customary wages, and such as are allowed by law, in the ministration of the Sacraments, nor condition for them, nor secure them before-hand; but first do your office, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster the Sacraments purely, readily, and for Christs sake; and when that is done, receive what is your due.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> Avoid all pride, as you would flee from the most frightful apparition, or the most cruel enemie; and remember
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38074:5"/>
that you can never truly teach humility, or tell what it is, unless you practise it your selves.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> Take no measures of Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,  but such as are material and tangible; such which consist not in humble Words, and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gestures; but what is first truly radicated in your Souls, in low opinion of your selves, and in real preferring others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your selves, and in such significations, which can neither deceive your selves nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> Let every Curate of Souls strive to understand himself best; and then to understand others. Let him spare himself least; but most severely judge, censure, and condemn himself. If he be learned, let him shew it by wise teaching, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manners. If he be not learned, let him be sure to get so much knowledge as to know that; and so much Humility, as not to grow insolent, and puffed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38074:6"/>
up by his Emptiness. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will pardon a good man that is less learned; but if he be proud, no man will forgive him.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/> Let every Minister be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to live a life as abstracted from the Affairs of the World, as his necessity will permit him; but at no hand to be immerg'd and principally imploy'd in the Affairs of the World: What cannot be avoided, and what is of good report, and what he is oblig'd to by any personal or collateral Duty, that he may do, but no more. Ever remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the Saying of our blessed Lord: <hi>In the world ye shall have trouble; but in me ye shall have peace:</hi> and consider this also, which is a great Truth; That every degree of love to the World, is so much taken from the Love of God.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> Be no otherwise sollicitous of your Fame and Reputation, but by doing your duty well &amp;

wisely: in other things, refer your self to God: but if you meet with evil Tongues, be careful that you bear reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es sweetly and temperately.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/> Remember that no Minister can govern his people well, and prosperously, unless himself hath learn'd humbly and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to obey his Superior. For every Minister should be like the good Centurion in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel: himself is under Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and he hath people under him.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIV"/> Be sure in all your Words  and Actions to preserve Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian simplicity and ingenuity; to do to others, as you would be done unto your self; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to speak what you do not think. Trust to Truth, rather than to your Memory: for this may fail you, that will never.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XV"/> Pray much, and very fervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,  for all your Parishioners, and all men that belong to you, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:38074:7"/>
and all that belong to God; but especially for the Conversion of Souls; and be very zealous for nothing, but for Gods glory, and the salvation of the World, and particularly of your Charges: Ever remembring that you are by God appointed as the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Prayer, and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of good things; to pray for all the World, and to heal all the World, as far as you are able.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVI"/> Every Minister must learn and  practise patience; that by bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all adversity meekly, and humbly, and cheerfully, and by doing all his duty with unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried industry, with great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, constancie, and Christian magnanimity, he may the better assist his people in the bearing of their crosses, and overcoming their difficulties.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVII"/> He that is holy, let him be  holy still, and still more holy, and never think he hath done his work, till all be finished by

perseverance, and the measures of perfection in a holy Life, and a holy Death: but at no hand must he magnifie himselfby vain separations from others, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising them that are not so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
