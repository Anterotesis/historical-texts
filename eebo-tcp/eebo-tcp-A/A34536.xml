            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I A. B.</hi> do Swear, that it is not Lawful
upon any pretence whatsoever, to take
Arms against the King; and that I do abhor
that Traiterous Position of taking Arms by his
Authority against his Person, or against those
that are Commissionated by him, in pursuance of
such Commissions; and that I will not at any
time endeavour any Alteration of Government
either in Church or State.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:64867:3"/>
THE Interpretation of the Oath here
given, is not peremptorily determined,
but probably concluded and humbly
proposed, by the Inquirer, to men of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and Impartial Judgment, in order to the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his own Judgment, and the settling of his
own Conscience about this important Matter.</p>
               <p>In Considering the Warrantableness of taking
this Oath, these two main things do necessarily
come under consideration;</p>
               <p>I. Whether the words do signifie a just and
good meaning according to a Rational Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation?</p>
               <p>II. Whether such just and good meaning was
the very meaning of the Law-makers in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
of this form of Words.</p>
               <p>The First Inquiry is, whether the Words do
signifie a just and good meaning according to a
Rational interpretation. Now in the way of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Interpretation, these things are to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served;</p>
               <p>1. We must proceed no otherwise than the
Words will bear in their ordinary signification.
For Words as taken in their common use are the
first and most noted means of signifying the
Mind of those that use them. Therefore to force
upon them a sense in it self Rational enough,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64867:3"/>
which is Alien from their ordinary signification, is
indeed Irrational.</p>
               <p>2. A Meaning, which the Words taken by
themselves may bear, may not be rigidly insisted
on against the intent of the Law. For the Words
of a Law are many times more rigorous than the
intent; nevertheless, they are but subservient to
it, and may not be urged to the perverting of
it.</p>
               <p>3. It is Rational to Interpret a Law, if the
Words will bear it, in a sense agreeable to right
Reason and Equity. For by the Reverence that
is due to Governours, we are forbidden to put
upon their Acts a sense repugnant to Reason and
Equity, unless that repugnancy be apparent.</p>
               <p>4. It is Rational to consider this Law not by it self
alone, but as it is a Law of this Realm, and in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctionwith
the other Laws there; of and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to interpret it, farre as the Words will
bear, in a sense consistent with the constitution of
the Realm, and with the other Laws, and with the
ordinary legal Practice. For the Law-makers must
not be supposed to enact things inconsistent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
the inconsistency be manifest.</p>
               <p>In this way of proceeding I come to consider the
just and good meaning which the words of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
do admit.</p>
               <div n="1" type="part">
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:64867:4"/>
                  <head>The First Part of the OATH.</head>
                  <q>
                     <p>I do Swear that it is not Lawful upon any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
whatsoever to take Arms against the
King.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>IN this part these or the like words [<hi>I do hold</hi>
or <hi>I do believe</hi>] are necessarily and evidently
to be understood. For the thing that the
Law seeks or aimes at, is not the truth of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
which is presupposed, but the discovery
of the swearers Judgment concerning it. This
may further appear from some other Act, where
the said Words are expressed in the like imposition.
[<hi>I Swear that I hold it unlawful to take Arms against
the King.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>As for these words [<hi>upon any pretence whatsoever</hi>]
they signifie no less than upon any cause, or in
any case whatsoever; so that this Tenet (as I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend)
is sworn to without any restriction or
limitation. But then it must be considered, that
these Words [<hi>to take Arms against the King</hi>] must
be taken in their due and legal sense; and so taken,
they import the resisting of the Soveraign Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
or the power ordained of God, which is not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64867:4"/>
Lawful upon any pretence whatsoever. I know
it is objected that some of the most eminent Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of the power of Princes, as <hi>Grotius, `Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay,</hi>
&amp;c. have Restrictions and Cases of Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in this Point. But I conceive that the objected
Cases of Exception delivered by them, are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
Restrictions laid upon the Tenet, but Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planations
of its meaning, that their Readers may
not mistake some for delinquents against it, who
indeed are not such according to their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>The design of this part of the Oath, is to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
all Rebellion, and all resistance contrary
to due Subjection, as not to be justified upon any
Cause, or in any Case, that may come to pass.
And its due legal meaning is Rationally conceived
to be, That it is not Lawful upon any pretence
whatsoever for any of the King's Majesties Subjects
to take Arms against his Person, or Authority, or
any of his Rights and Dignities.</p>

                  <head>The Second Part of the OATH.</head>
                  <q>
                     <p>And that I do abhorre that Traiterous Position
of taking Arms by his Authority against his
Person, or against those that are Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
by him, in pursuance of such Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>THE Position of taking Arms by the Kings
Authority against his Person is justly to be
disclaimed. Though the King's Person
and his Authority be distinct, yet they are not
separate. The King's Authority is inherent in his
Person, and in no other. Though it be exercised
by an other during his Natural incapacity, as in
his infancy, yet his Person alone is the proper
Seat and Subject of it, and that other exerciseth
it only in his Name, and as his Vicegerent. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
sometimes an inferiour Authority, as that of
a Judge, or Justice of Peace, or Constable is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the King's Authority; but in proper significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it is no more than the Authority of the said
Officers derived from the King as the Fountain
thereof. Now it is most absurdly spoken or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
that the King's Authority, which is inherent
in his Person only, can be exerted in taking Arms
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64867:5"/>
against his Person. Likewise it is as absurdly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
or imagined, that an Authority inherent in
an other, but derived from the King and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
on him, should be so exerted.</p>
                  <p>The following Words [<hi>or against those that are
Commissionated by him</hi>] are most Rationally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of those, that are Legally Commissionat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him. Likewise by pursuance of such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
is meant Legal Pursuance. It cannot
reasonably be supposed, that a Law, on the behalf
of Persons Commissionated, doth intend any other
than such as are Commissionated not against, but
according to, Law. A Commission against Law
is no Commission. Wherefore Commissionated in
this place is of the same import with authorized.</p>

                  <head>The Third Part of the OATH.</head>
                  <q>
                     <p>That I will not at any time endeavour any Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
of Government either in Church or
State.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>I Confess that these Words [<hi>I will not at any
time endeavour any Alteration</hi>] taken by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
may be interpreted so unlimitedly as
to import the abjuring of all kind of endeavour
of any Alteration whatsoever, whether great or
small, for the better or the worse, necessary or
unnecessary. Nevertheless being considered as
the words of a Law in Conjunction with other
Laws, they may be well limited to a more tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and equitable meaning. We cannot reasonably
imagine that the intendment of this Oath extends
so far as the abjuring of all lawful endeavour in
our place and calling of any alteration whatsoever
in any point of Government, though never so
small, never so necessary, never so advantageous
for the publick good in this or after times. The
informing and petitioning of Parliament-men, and
legally acting in them in order to the alteration
of particular Laws is warranted by the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Constitution of this Realm. Wherefore it is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64867:6"/>
Rationally conceived, that the true intent of this
part is to engage against disturbing the Publick
Peace and Government now Established, by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
Sedition or any other unlawful practice;
and that the endeavour here abjured is only such
as is forbidden or not Warrantable by Law. For
a Law ought to be interpreted, as far as is possible,
so as to be consistent with Equity and Justice; and
it ought not to be so interpreted, as to damn the
ordinary Course of Law, and the necessary al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
practice, such as is the Alteration of Laws
both in Civil and Ecclesiastical matters from time
to time, as need requires.</p>
                  <p>The Restrictive Interpretation here given, is
no forcing of the intendment of the Oath in this
part into a narrower Compass, than the form of
Expression can well bear. Indefinite Words are
to be limited according to the Nature and Reason
of the thing about which they are used. So is the
indefinite expression of endeavour to be here li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
that the Oath may bear a just and equal
sense in Conformity to other Laws, and to the
ordinary Legal Practice.</p>
                  <p>Besides, seeing the Words [<hi>any Alteration of
Government</hi>] are an unlimited form of Expression,
and put no difference between the most alterable,
and the most unalterable Points, certainly it is
most Rational to conceive that the Word endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64867:7"/>
is to be taken in a restrained sense. For it
is not to be thought that the Law should intend
the perpetual securing of the least and most alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
points of Government, as much as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and most unalterable. Yet it could intend no
less, if the abjuring of all kind of endeavour of
any Alteration were intended. Moreover though
the Law doth not explicitly, yet it doth implicitly
distinguish in the present case, and restrain it to
Rebellious, Seditious, Schismatical, or other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
endeavour. For it is the declared end of
the Law to obviate the designs of such [as take
opportunity to instill Poisonous Principles of
Schism and Rebellion into the hearts of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Subjects] as the Words thereof are.</p>
                  <p>The second thing to be considered is, whether
the just and good meaning before set forth was
the very meaning of the Law-makers in the enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this form of words.</p>
                  <p>A Law being the Will of the Lawgiver must be
taken in that meaning, which is therein immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
signified by him to be his Will. And that
meaning being not his secret or private but his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
and publick will, must some way or other
be so evident and open<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as that the Subjects may
be sufficiently informed thereof, if they be not
culpably negligent. That the meaning of the
Law-giver be made thus open and evident is a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64867:7"/>
condition necessary to be constituting of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
Duty. Now to discern what it is, they are
to use their Judgments of Discretion, that their
submission to it may be according to right Reason
and Good Conscience. In the present Case the
declared and publick will and meaning of the King
and his two Houses of Parliament is to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and discerned.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the meaning of the Law-giver may be
so clearly expressed in the Law it self, that he, who
hath the understanding of a man, cannot or need
not mistake it, and then there needs no farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
about it. Sometimes being not so clearly
expressed in the Law it self, it may be more fully
done by some other declarative act, or open ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
signification of the Law-giver, and then also
their needs no further inquiry. But in case the
said meaning be not so clearly signified by the
Law it self, nor by some Authoritative Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
nor by other open express signification, then
of necessity recourse must be had to a Rational in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation:
And according to Reason, that sense,
which the words do conveniently import, which is
agreeable to the Law of God, and which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the Realm, and other Laws thereof,
and the ordinary legal practice do require, is to
be taken for the declared and publick Will and
meaning of the Law-giver; Especially if it answer
the design of that very particular Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:64867:8"/>
The meaning of the Oath now considered is not
so clearly expressed in the Words taken by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as to prevent all mistaking or doubting
thereof in all, that are men of Understanding, and
make use of it. The Words may bear a far more
extensive sense, than what may be judged to be
the true intent and meaning of the Law-makers.
The sense of many Laws, which are unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
Just and Good, do lye in a Narrower Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
than the full extent of the Words taken by
themselves, as is manifest in these Divine Laws.
<hi>Swear not at all. Call no man Father on the
Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Law-makers have not by any Authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Declaration, or open act signified that their
meaning in this Oath is as extensive as any sense,
which the Words taken by themselves will bear, or
that it is not to be limited to an equitable intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in a Consistency with the other Laws, and that
legal practice, which they themselves own and
maintain. Therefore that equal sense which the
Words do fairly bear, and which bears Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to the Law of God, and which the other
Laws, and the Constitution of the Realm, and the
ordinary legal practice do require, and which
suits with the design of this very Law, is in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to be taken for their declared and publick
Will and meaning in this Oath.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:64867:8"/>
Here let us look back upon the Interpretation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
given. Is there any just Reason to conceive that
the Law-makers or the Major part of them did in
the first part of the Oath intend by taking Arms
against the King, any other than what is such by
the Law of this Kingdom? Or that in the second
Part, they intended by those that are Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onated
by him any others than those that are
Commissionated by him according to Law? Or
that in the third Part, they intended the abjuring
of all kind of endeavour, and not that only which
the Law forbids, or is not warranted by Law?
And more especially concerning the third Part,
which hath been most called into question, can it
Rationally be supposed that the generality or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority
of them intended to bind men by Oath from
lawfully endeavouring in their places such Changes
about particular Laws or Canons, as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
ordinarily make in their Places by Voting in
Parliament, and some of them being Clergy-men
by Voting in Convocation? Or can it Rationally
be supposed that they intended to bind only one
sort of men, called Non-conformists, from lawful
endeavours of the publick good, while others were
left free.</p>
                  <p>If it be Objected that Law-makers may in some
particular Law have a meaning repugnant to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
and to the Ordinary Course of Law and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64867:9"/>
legal Practice, my answer is, that the Reverence
and Charity, which is due to our Superiours for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
us to conceive that they have such a meaning,
unless we be compell'd to it by convincing Reason.
Now we are not compell'd to conceive thus by
the Words of the Oath, for they carry it fairly for
a very good meaning; nor by the Scope of the
Law (which is expresly declared to prevent the
distilling of the Principles of Schism and Rebellion
into the hearts of his Majesties Subjects); nor yet
by any publick or open Act of the Law-Makers.
Have the Majority of them as so many single Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
severally declared such a meaning, as is sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
in the Objection? Or can it reasonably be
imagined that they would ever so declare? Or is
there any other Evidence or convincing Reason
to be produced for it?</p>
                  <p>The Will of the Lawgiver, which the Subjects
are bound to take notice of, is that which is so
publick and open, that they may be inform'd of it,
if they be not culpably negligent. But if any shall
imagine him to have a private Will or Aim in the
contrivance of a Law different from his publick
and open Will and meaning, the Subjects are not
concerned therein, because it is not the Law or
Will of the Lawgiver as such. For a Law is the
Will of the Governour, not as meerly existent, but
as declared, Wherefore touching this Oath, that
which the Subjects are concerned in, is to know
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64867:9"/>
what is the apparent or sufficiently declared mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Law-makers therein, and that the same
is Just and Good.</p>
                  <p>Being it is further noted, that it is no more than
the meaning of the Law-makers expressed in the
Words of the Oath, touching two general Positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and a general promise, that is sworn unto
in the taking thereof. In the first part of this
Oath the Person, upon whom it is imposed, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to swear this general, Tenet according to the
true intent of the Words, <hi>That it is not lawful up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any pretence whatsoever to take Arms against the
King;</hi> but not that this or that case is a taking
Arms against the King, which is not signified by
this Oath, but by the Law and State of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
In the second Part he is called to abjure
the general Position of <hi>taking Arms by the King's
Authority against his Person or those that are commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionated
by him according to his Laws.</hi> But who are
Commissionated according to Law, and who are
not, is not signified by this Oath, but by the Law of
this Kingdom. Likewise in the third Part he is
called to make this General promise upon Oath,
that he <hi>will not at any time endeavour any Alteration
of Government either in Church or State by any unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
means.</hi> But what means are unlawful, and
what are not, is not signified by this Oath, but by
the Law and Constitution of this Kingdom. And
it behoves him in all particular Cases, that may
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64867:10"/>
come under the said Generals, to judge and act as
the said Law and Constitution doth determine.</p>
                  <p>I have used the best of my Understanding in this
Inquiry; and I should not thus labour in it, were
it not my own concernment. What I can discern
thereof I have impartially set down: yet if any
thing here written should be found Erroneous, I
disclaim and revoke it. The issue of the whole
disquisition is to propose it to the Consideration of
Sober, Judicious and Unprejudiced Persons, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the full meaning of the prescribed Oath be
not expressed in this more explicate from here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Do Swear, that I do believe that it is not
Lawful upon any pretence whatsoever, for
any of the King's Majesties Subjects to take Arms
against his Person or Authority, or any of his
Rights and Dignities; And that I do abhor
the Traiterous Position of taking Arms by his
Authority against his Person, or against those
that are Legally Commissionated by him, in the
Legal pursuance of such Commissions; And that
I will not at any time endeavour any Alteration
of Government either in Church or State, by
Rebellion, Sedition, or any other means forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
or not Warranted by Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:64867:10"/>
It is the Duty of a Subject to give due security
for his Loyalty to the King and his Government;
And it is the Property of one that feareth God, to
fear an Oath.</p>
                  <p>I think I have set forth the true intent and
meaning of the Oath, and I do not see how it can
be reasonably taken otherwise. Nevertheless in the
matter here discussed, I am unavoidably timorous,
and therefore have published this Inquiry to the
intent, that if I be in the right, I may be confirmed
in it by the sufficient Testimony of others; but in
Case I have misunderstood it, that I may be better
informed, and set Right. My design is to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
my self and others concern'd in the taking of
this Oath from groundless scrupulosity; yet I
would not encourage my self or others to take it in
a wrong meaning. If I take it, it must be in the
sense before given, which I think is a full renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of those Principles of Schism and Rebellion,
against which this Law designs to secure the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
