            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A Letter ſent from the PARLIAMENT of SCOTLAND to the ſeverall <hi>PRESBYTERIES</hi> within the Kingdome.</head>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He many ſcandals that are thrown on our Actions by the favourers of Sectaries, and haters of the Perſon of our KING and Monarchicall Government, invite Us to this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary addreſſe to you; Conjuring you, as you will anſwer to the great GOD whoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants you are, not to ſuffer your ſelves to be poſſeſt with unjuſt and undeſerved prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt Us and Our proceedings, who have ſince our late meeting in Parliament pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred no earthly thing to our Duties to Religion, and the promoting of all the ends of our Covenant, and have conſtantly uſed all reall endeavours to have carried on thoſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the ſatisfaction of the moſt tender conſciences; and eſpecially by Our great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances with the many deſires from the Commiſſioners of the generall Aſſembly: We have proceeded to greater diſcoveries of Our Reſolutions, in the wayes and meanes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging this preſent Service then poſſible in prudence We ought to have done, having ſo neare and active Enemies to oppoſe Us: Neither can it be with any Truth or Juſtice in any ſort alleadged, that We have in the leaſt meaſure wronged, or violated the true Priviledges and Liberties of the Church, or any wayes taken upon Us the determination or deciſion of any matters of Faith or Church Diſcipline, though We be unjuſtly charged with taking an Antecedent judgement in matters of Religion; under pretence whereof great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments are made on our unqueſtioned Rights. For what can be more Civill then to determine what Civill Duties We ought to pay to our King, or what Civill Power he ought to be poſſeſſed of? And if we meet with obſtructions and oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in carrying on thoſe Duties, are not We the only Judges thereunto? Is there any other Authority in this Kingdome, but that of King and Parliament, and what flowes from them that can pretend any authoritative power in the choice of the Inſtruments and Managers of Our publick Reſolutions. It is a ſubject for the diſpute of Church Judicatories, whether his Majeſty hath a negative voice in Parliament or not? Theſe certainly cannot be pretended to by any Kirk-man, without a great uſurpation over the Civill Magiſtrate, whereof We are confident the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor any Judicatory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will never be guilty, nor fall into the Epiſcopall diſeaſe of medling with Civill affaires: And if any have already in theſe particulars exceeded their bounds, We expect the enſuing generall Aſſembly will cenſure it accordingly, and prevent the vilifying and contemning the Authority of Parliament by any of the Miniſtery, either in, or out of their Pulpits, or who ſhall offer to ſtir up the Subjects of this Kingdome to diſobey, or deny to give Civill obedience to their Lawes; it being expreſly prohibited by the 2. and 5. Acts of <hi>Ja.</hi> 6. his 8. Parliament, in Anno 1584. <hi>That none of his Majeſties Subjects, under paine of Treaſon, impugne the authority of Parliament.</hi> And therefore ſeeing the cauſe is the ſame for which this Kingdom hath done and ſuffered ſo much, and that We are reſolved to proceed for the preſervation and defence of Religion, before all other worldly intereſts whatſoever; and to carry on ſincerely, really, and conſtantly the Covenant, and all the ends of it, as you will finde by our Declaration herewith ſent to you: We doe confidently expect, that as the Miniſters of this Kingdome have hitherto been moſt active and exemplary in furthering the former Expeditions, ſo now you will continue in the ſame zeale, to ſtir up the people by your Preaching and Prayers, and all other wayes in your calling, to a chearefull obedience to Our Orders, and engaging in this buſineſſe; and that you will not give ſo great advantage to the Enemies of Presbyteriall Government, and bring ſo great a ſcandall on this Church, as to oppoſe the Authority of Parliament, or obſtruct their proeeedings in their neceſſary Duties for the good of Religion, the Honour and happineſſe of the King and his Royall Poſterity, and the true peace of his Dominions.</p>
