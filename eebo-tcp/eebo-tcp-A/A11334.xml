            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For the which I blame him the lesse, sithence nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Aesculapius, Hippocrates, Galen, Auicen,</hi> nor any other of the old stampe euer assumed any such title, though better giuen them.

<pb facs="tcp:1774:3"/>
and necessarie to giue such attributes, especially to men indowed with so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a qualitie as the true knowledge of Physicke, and guift of healing is. But how vilely this worthie Science and profession is traduced and abused! Witnesse the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Mounte-bankes, Quack-saluers, Horse-leaches, Cunning-women, Imposters and Vpstarts, who hauing learned (my chance) the Calcining of <hi>Mercurie,</hi> the preparation of <hi>Antimony,</hi> or the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of some home-spun medicine, and hauing scraped together some triuiall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments out of some old Manuscripts, or from some brazen-fac't <hi>Bragadotio,</hi> will presently forsooth set the Physition at open defiance, boasting and protesting that they haue saued the life of twentie, whom such and such a Physition had quite forsaken and giuen ouer for dead. Nay I haue heard a good fellow (I will not say a <hi>Pharmaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paean,</hi> and that no simple one neither) bouldly affirme that if hee should not now and then adde or diminish something from the Physitions Bill, the fat were in the

But the Physitions are well enough serued, for if they would expulse one packe of these, snaffle another, and take a little paines with <hi>Fernelius,</hi> to prepare or see prepared their principall Medicines, and not to be so idle as to giue too much credit to the Druggist, nor let each giddie-headed fellow be partaker of their secrets, it were doubtlesse better for the Common wealth, more profitable vnto themselues, and more pleasing vnto God: but of this inough. There resteth nothing now (my worthy friends) but that you would vouchsafe to stand betwixt me and such malicious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractors; for if they dare baspheme the tall Cedars, what will they not doe vnto the lower shrubs.

heare say as they haue rather chosen to indure intollerable paines then they would take three poore graines of well prepared <hi>Laudanum</hi>: but I cannot greatly blame them, for the naked truth is, many moderne Physitions know not well what to make of it. <hi>Forestus Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi> and many others with <hi>Galen</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely conclude, that it is stupefying and cold in the fourth degree at least, and therefore not fit to be inwardly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at all, but in Syncopes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame necessitie; <hi>Mercatus</hi> is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. <hi>Capiuaccius</hi> is forced by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon experience to grant with <hi>Auicen,</hi> that for its foure degrees of coldnesse it is furnished with three of heate in operation.</p>

needs many words seeing the Author himselfe hath sufficiently discouered the benefit hereof, I onely wish you to haue great regard to its preparation: for as in most Physicall Drugges there remaineth some bad qualitie or other which needeth correction, so doth <hi>Opium</hi> require <hi>Vulcans</hi> helpe, and other specificall meanes to driue away its sulphurous malignitie: you may read in <hi>Quercetane</hi> his answere to <hi>Anonimus Cap.</hi> 2. and in <hi>Sennertus</hi> his <hi>Institutions Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>part.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fathers of Physicke made their chiefest Medicines with their owne hands, and intituled them after their owne names, which many retaine to this day, but now the case is altered;

               </gap>ie in me to vtter my opinion also being grounded vpon rationall termes, and agreeable to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie as well of ancient and moderne <hi>Sages</hi> as mine owne peculiar experience and obseruations, collected and gathered for the instruction and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of such onely as shall haue occasion to make

good vse of them, not taking vpon me in this tract or any other to teach any man; <hi>much lesse those</hi> which thinke they know already <hi>much more then my selfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly (concerning that obiection that diuers Physitions haue written and made mention alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Chymicall preparation of <hi>Opium</hi> as a principall ingredience into that excellent Medicine called <hi>Laudanum</hi>) I deny not their assertion, but rather rely vpon their authoritie, and am partly satisfied with such things as they haue already di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged, as may appeare hereafter, yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the whole world can beare mee witnesse that neither <hi>Laudanum</hi> nor the vse thereof haue beene things commonly knowne; for it is a thing most certaine, that among a hundred Physitions and Practitioners in <hi>Europe,</hi> a man can hardly finde fiftie that will take paines to read ouer the workes of <hi>Paracelfus,</hi> or any other <hi>Spagitique</hi> which hath written of this subiect; <hi>much lesse can the thing it selfe bee common or familiar vnto them:</hi> among those fiftie a manshall hardly finde twentie which make vse of it: among those twentie it were strange to finde ten which are able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with their owne hands, and among those ten it were rare to finde three which durst freely pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish or manifest its vertues to the world, or propound the vse thereof in their <hi>priuate and particular</hi> consultations for the benefit of the diseased; or
<pb facs="tcp:1774:9"/>
maintaine the same for such a soueraigne thing as it is indeed.</p>
            <p>I am very well assured that although the most part of our <hi>Physitions</hi> here at the <hi>Hage</hi> doe sometimes make vse of this Medicine, yet a man may trauaile into a hundred Cities in Christendon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> where the Physitions neither vse it nor make any more accompt of it then of a thing altogether strange vnknowne and of no vse in the world.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, if we come to a popular examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, I am perswaded that in this very Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (notwithstanding the aforesayd) among a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men and women which know the name and vse of <hi>Treakle, Mithridate</hi> and other ordinary Medicinall compositions, and can apply them to their best vse and behoofe when they are diseased or sicke, yet a man can hardly find twentie of them which haue once in their liues heard one speake of <hi>Laudanum,</hi> the knowledge whereof no question had beene as requisite and necessarie as of either of the aforenamed. What great matter is it then if <hi>Iames, Martin, Francis, &amp;c.</hi> knew what <hi>Laudanum</hi> is, and the vse thereof, when so many thousand men know nothing at all, many of them in the meane time languishing and complayning of extreame paines and want of sleepe euen to death, and can finde no ease at all, vnlesse by meanes of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and pretious secret, <hi>or such like:</hi> Well then, Let vs put the case that this my <hi>Treatise</hi> were
<pb facs="tcp:1774:9"/>
good for nothing else but to inlarge and make knowne the name of <hi>Laudanum</hi> among the rude multitude to giue them occasion (when time and oportunitie shall serue) to inquire and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund for it of their Physitions, or of others which shall haue the same by them, whereby they may be assisted and fortified against sundry daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous accidents which by no other meanes can be so qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ckely, safely or easily auoyded; so that if it were for no other reason then this, my labours (me thinkes) were not vnworthie regard; but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit which may redound to many persons by this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery is not small, as the discreet <hi>Reader</hi> may easily perceiue hereafter. To conclude with the common prouerbe, <hi>As hee cannot spit sweete whose throat is full of gall,</hi> no more can such as are stuffed with their owne passions (thinking themselues onely wise) euer speake well, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend others labour or knowledge then their owne, yet notwithstanding, neither these nor any other obstacles whatsoeuer, either ought or can hinder the good will and entire affection of him which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Whether Chymicall Medicines in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall are more violent and dangerous then other ordinarie Medicines are; and whether in respect thereof a man may lawfully administer them except in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate diseases onely as some imagne?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A man shall finde some Physitions in the world which (hauing no skill in Chymicall art) being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of their patients and other people, what they imagine and thinke of Chymicall Medicines and their vse ingenerall, will not altogether blame and reprooue them (as not long since many d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>seases onely.</p>
            <p>Therfore before we speake any more of <hi>Opium,</hi> or the Chymicall preparation thereof (for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter purging of chymicall Medicines and such as vse them from suspition and blame) I thinke it fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test to resolue this question on this fashion.</p>
            <p>First, it may bee easily perceiued, that these <hi>Learned M. M.</hi> by this maner of answering fall into a double error, and are therefore worthily taxed in two principall points which makes their consequence vnsauery and idle. First, that they
<pb facs="tcp:1774:10"/>
iudge and censure of things whereof they haue no skill, nor exact experience at all, so that what they answere in this point, is either by some vaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture, <hi>blind tradition,</hi> or idle report; secondly, by making no distinction betweene generall and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, they condemne all Chymicall Medicines without exception to be such as a foresaid.</p>
            <p>But leauing to reproue the former of these two points, as a thing exploded by each <hi>discreet</hi> mans conceipt, let vs insist a little to confute the later: in pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing that they wrongfully impose violence and churl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>riques as other ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Physitions, differing only in maner of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position and preparation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1774:11"/>Hereby you may at first dash perceiue that if they would speake any thing against the vehemence which may subsist in any Chymicall Medicine whatsoeuer, they should change this generall enun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation into a more particular, and say, <hi>among Chymicall Medicines there be some which be vehement</hi> and not to say absolutely and generally <hi>that all Chymicall Medicines are so</hi> in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance whereof we will do them right, and presently draw them to confesse that wee onely haue not some vehement and churlish medicines, but that they themselues also haue the like, no man can deny.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore we accord in this (as wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not choose) if they will further aggrauate the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer accusation, they must of necessitie prooue that chymicall medicines of a vehement nature are more churlish and daungerous then their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Medicines of the same nature are, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that their milde and gentle Physicke Chymical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepared, becommeth more dangerous then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but (alas good men) they can proue no such matter.</p>
            <p>For primarily touching those Chymicall Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, which they pretend to be vehement (as those of <hi>Antimonie</hi> and <hi>Mercurie</hi> vomitiue) there is no question made among vnderstanding Physitions (besides daily experience) that being compared with those vehement vomits which the auncien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Physitions haue prescribed, as those of white <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebore,

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue purgatiues.</p>
            <p>And furthermore, if they should say that they neither vse white Hellebore, nor Tithymalls in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their venemous proprieties, or because they are found daungerous in working, this is the thing wee looke for at their hands, for they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer make it appeare, that either <hi>Antimony</hi> or <hi>Mercurie</hi> well prepared cause any such Sympto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes in the bodie as these doe: or if they esteeme it a thing fit and requisite to desist from the instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ancient Physitions, exploding the vse of such Medicines which they finde to be daungerous; we thinke it far<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e more rationall on the other part, (obseruing the main end of the foresaid intentions, and so cutting off quite the vsage of euill things,) to appoint and ordaine in their roome such as are more gentle and familiar.</p>
            <p>Here they may finde fault (but nothing to the purpose) and say that they custome to make sicke people to vomit is very daungerus, and therefore to that intent they ought to vse no Med<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cine at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. But hauing sufficiently answered this obiection, and proued the contrarie in my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise intituled <hi>Emetologia,</hi> concerning the nature and vse of vomitiue Medicines, I thinke it
<pb facs="tcp:1774:12"/>
needlesse to repeate the same in this place.</p>
            <p>If notwithstanding what is said these <hi>M. M.</hi> persist in their opinio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, saying that <hi>Antimonie</hi> and <hi>Mercurie,</hi> are Medicines not so free from Maligne qualitie as I pretend, but that that they in-here and cleaue to the guts, and leaue some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret infection in the blood or <hi>Radicall</hi> humours, the which in continuance of times comes to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest it selfe. And these are those common nui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sances which many obiect, thinking thereby to drawe mens, affections after their owne fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies.</p>
            <p>But this vaine opinion is quickely confuted by plaine and euident demonstration when they please, for most men which take either <hi>Antimonie</hi> or <hi>Mercurie</hi> well prepared, evacuate or cast the same out into the vessell, whereinto they vomit euen at the very first operation of the Medicine either vpward, or downeward, so that it hath beene often found in the excrements, when nature did worke that way first, as sometimes it falleth out.</p>
            <p>Secondly, these (being mettallicke and fixed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies) cannot bee concocted, or brought into chyle or naturall nutriment by any meanes, whence it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently followeth that they cannot intermixe themselues with the blood, or any other substance of the bodie, as all other vegetable and animall Medicines may easily doe, in regard of that Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolization
<pb facs="tcp:1774:12"/>
they haue with the foresaid substances, so that the stomacke may reduce them into chyle at pleasure, which is the cause also that the poysons of euill plants, serpents and other venemous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are more actiue, sodaine and piercing then <hi>Arsink</hi> it selfe or <hi>Realgar</hi> minerall.</p>
            <p>I could produce a number of other reasons to demonstrate that Chymicall Medicines of a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment nature, as principally the two before named (against which all this controuersie doth particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly arise) are more gentle then any violent vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Medicine which our Ancients prescribed, yea farre more safe then any vomitorie vnder <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebore</hi> or any aboue named: but to auoide long discourse let these suffice at this time.</p>
            <p>Now let vs come to resolue our selues whether those ordinarie Medicines which be naturally gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and without any offensiue qualitie, after chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call preparation change their naturall mildenesse, into that which is euill, and so become vehement and dangerous.</p>
            <p>Concerning which point wee haue in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course alreadie spoken some thing in defence of purgatiue Medicines, as those of more frequent vse then others among diseased persons, and therefore wilbe contented to determine the whole matter in the generall defence of <hi>Diaphoretickes, Diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, Alexiteries,</hi> &amp;c. chymically prepared.</p>
            <p>First, therefore it must of necessity be granted of
<pb facs="tcp:1774:13"/>
all opponents that euery Medicine ingenerall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaued of its earthinesse and seculencie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and made pure cleane and well digested by fire must of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence be lesse hurtfull, lesse dangerous, and lesse offensiue, and is also farre more apt to worke, <hi>ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ò<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutò &amp; miundè</hi> (as the Physitions wish) then any crude, earthie, impure or ill prepared Medicine may or can doe by any meanes' possible; the reason is, that when such ill-prepared stuffe is once gotten into the stomacke of any diseased person, nature (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie strugling against the disease) becommeth thereby more wearied, ouer-cloyed and oppressed in concocting and seperating the pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>enesse from the impurenesse of such drugges then it was before, and therefore can receiue very little or no comfort at all by such Medicines, whereas on the contrary part other medicines (made subtill, actiue, pure and well prepared by art) doe begin to disperce and dilate themselues gently into all parts of the bodie as soone as they are receiued thereinto, and being neuer so little exagitated or moued by naturall heate assist nature her selfe without any alteration or distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance at all, and like a good friend aide <hi>and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone</hi> her; whereas the other wearieth and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth the body like a <hi>Tyrant.</hi> Moreouer wee may consider that Chymicall Medicines being pure and neate, as aforesaid, leaue no feculent resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or corruption in the bodie at all, as others commonly doe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1774:13"/>But if it commeth to passe (as it is not vnlikely) that some should deny these reasons, obiecting that Chymicall Medicines being subtill and pure, can more easily disturbe nature, and moue the body more sodainely then other Medicines do; to whom we answere, that although among our Chymicall Medicines, there bee some of a subtill Nature, as our distilled oyles, the <hi>quintessence of wine,</hi> and other vegetables: and as there be diuers <hi>liquors</hi> (we acknowledge) very sharpe and piercing; so in like manner be there some diseases, wherein such Medicines be very requisite and necessary, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as others of a crosse, seculent, and clammy substance can yeeld no ease or comfort at all; in regard whereof wee ought not to accompt them daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous or hurtfull, but rather very beneficiall and wholesome, especially being well applyed and vsed a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> all Medicines of what nature soeuer ought to bee.</p>
            <p>But vnder colour of these no man ought to comprehend other Chymicall Medicines, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime them to bee of such a piercing nature, for comming to purgatiue Medicines extracted (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a sappie, thicke, and condense forme) wee know well that they are not nor cannot bee so sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till or piercing <hi>as oyles,</hi> nor are called subtill in regarde of their penetratiue vertue, but rather because they are farre more easily conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Liquors, then the substances from whence
<pb facs="tcp:1774:14"/>
they are extracted, and therefore ought in no ease to be called irritatiues.</p>
            <p>Experience her selfe teacheth vs that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of <hi>Mechoacan, Rheubarbe,</hi> or <hi>Sena</hi> (being gentle Med<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And this is a <hi>Maxime</hi> that not only <hi>Scammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi> but euerie other purgatiue Medicine of such venemous and veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t nature as <hi>Hellebore, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymalls, &amp;c.</hi> loose their acrimonie and maligne qualitie, and by meanes of this Art become gentle and effectuall in the extirpation of all such diseases as they naturally concerne or respect, without any

                  <hi>Opium</hi> taken crude and raw, as asoresayd, to the quantitie of an <hi>Orobus</hi> or wild Fitch, appeaseth all Aches or paines, helpeth digesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, stayeth all Coughes and Destillations or Rheumes, which fall from the braine into the stomack, it is excellent against all kinde of <hi>Head-ach</hi> if the temples bee anointed and chaffed with the same and oyle of roses: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dropped or instilled into the eares with

               <p>The cause of those dangerous effects and Symptomes, which crude <hi>Opium</hi> by its too much vse is said to procure, is attributed to its exceeding coldnesse; for most Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hold, that it is not vnfitly ranged among things that are cold in the fourth degree.</p>

They take it in as great snuffe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, and accompt it as great an iniurie when one vpbraides another with eating of <hi>Opium,</hi> as another Countriman would do if one should call him a drunkard.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Christian-Armenian,</hi> with whom wee lodged long time, vsed many times to eate <hi>Opium</hi> in our sight, and prouing the same our selues, we found no other accident, sauing that it heated our stomackes, troubled some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the braine, and caused vs to sweat in our sleepe.

ouer hither it is sophisticated &amp; mingled, for the Merchants do questionles multiply it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they vent it abroad into the Countries, and therefore because we know some marks and tokens how to choose the best, it is not amisse to set downe the same.</p>
                  <p>The best <hi>Opium</hi> is that which is very bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and so hot in tast that it wil almost scorch and inflame the mouth, it is in colour some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing yellowish or like to a Lyons skin, and being formed into a lumpe, it seemes speck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as a masse of diuers colours, for in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the sayd <hi>Opium,</hi> the seeds are found clustered vpon the Poppie-heads, which being amassed cleaue together like a cake, its smell is fulsome and strong, and although it be accompted but of a cold temprature, yet it many times scaldeth the mouth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Opium</hi> is formed into cakes in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Natolia,</hi> which exceed not aboue foure ounces or halfe a pound at the most, but the Merchants to make the greater profit by their sophistication double the aforesaid quantitie, for the subtill <hi>Venetians</hi> make the Cakes in their shops to weigh a pound at least, and this is the report of <hi>Bellon</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Opium.</hi>

               <p>But heere some (to small purpose) may tell mee that the <hi>Turkes</hi> may easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly digest <hi>Opium,</hi> how colde soeuer in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of the hot Clime they liue in, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Christians dwelling vnder a colder in <hi>Europe</hi> can doe no such matter: to whom I aunswere, that if it were graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that <hi>Opium</hi> were of such qualitie as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresayd: yet whether a man could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest it or not, cannot bee Physicallie at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the temprature of the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, but rather to the strong constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or naturall vigour of the people; for
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1774:22"/>
the <hi>Turkes</hi> being from their very cradle more grossely brought vp and sed then the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> are ingenerall, become not only more able bodied and stronger thereby, but also more apt and able to eate and digest diuers things which the tender and nice Christians cannot iudure: and that the truth is so, Let vs but consider a little the difference of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall toughnes and strength betweene a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <hi>Paysant</hi> or <hi>Carle</hi> here amongst vs, and a Gentleman or Citizen; do not we see (I pray you) that the <hi>Paysant</hi> can more easily indure a purgation made of <hi>White Hellebore, Tithy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malls, Euphorbium</hi> or <hi>Colocynthis</hi> (which are accompted violent and venemous Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines) then these tender sparkes aforesayd can brooke <hi>Rheubarbe, Mechoacan, Sena, Aloes</hi> or the <hi>Damaske</hi> rose.</p>
               <p>But why the <hi>Turkes</hi> deuoure <hi>Opium</hi> on this fashion, ought rather to be imputed vnto an ordinarie custome, and common vsage among them, then to any other cause what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer; euen as the <hi>Indians</hi> are accustomed to take <hi>Tobacco,</hi> which is a plant not onely Narcoticke and stupefactiue, but of a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and extreame vomitiue quality also. Notwithstanding we see that Christians, all <hi>Europe</hi> ouer, by little and little haue brought themselues into such a custome and habit
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1774:22"/>
thereunto, that they feele no alteration or preiudice at all (<hi>as they thinke</hi>) by the vse thereof.</p>
               <p>I make no question but a man might finde a number of people among Christians that if they cannot alreadie, could easily accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome themselues to eate <hi>Opium</hi> as familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as they take <hi>Tobacco</hi>: although they could not vse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There be some <hi>Empericks</hi> (I know) which giue crude <hi>Opium</hi> to their Patiens in as great or greater quantitie at a time then <hi>Discorides</hi> hath limitted, and that without any great daunger or hazard of life at all, onely cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting it a little with the powder of Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-seed; and in case of necessitie I my selfe would not sticke, or make any scruple to

vse it, yea I durst, if neede were, take two or three graines thereof at a time my selfe; for although I neuer did eate thereof hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to indeed, yet haue I often tasted the same, and also receiued great quantitie of the sulphurous vapours, both into my stomacke and head in time of the preparation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of without any perceiuance, or the least touch of any offence in the world: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse it is not my counsell that any Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should vse it crude in this maner, seeing we haue Art and meanes to prepare it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
               <p>The second assurance that wee haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the vse of <hi>Opium,</hi> is in that wee finde and see that the most expert and wisest Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions of olde, found it good, and therefore prescribed this Medicine as a principall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient, <hi>and as one of the most important ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> in their chiefest compositions, <hi>Alexiteries, Diaphoretickes, Anodynes, Cordialls,</hi> which naturally resist the most grieuous and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diseases that can any waies happen to humaine bodies, for which cause they vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally call them <hi>Opiate Confections,</hi> as that of their <hi>Tre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Opium</hi> then is not such a colde thing as they would haue it, as I can proue both by reason and experience; by reason in regard it is not onely bitter, but inflaming and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coriatiue, which are euident tokens of its hot qualitie and complexion; for so the wisest Physitions in the world iudge of bitter things: and the light of Nature it selfe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs that none of the foure elements doe corrode, in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1774:25"/>
Againe, its nature is knowne by its colour, for being of a darkish yellow, when it is dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and powdered, it must needs be hot, as <hi>Aloes</hi> and <hi>Myrrhe,</hi> and all things of like co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour be, especially if they haue any bitter tast adioyned.</p>
               <p>By experience wee may well approue that <hi>Opium</hi> is not cold in two respects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> first that when the <hi>Turkes</hi> eate thereof, they become cheerefull, couragious and fierce in warre, secondly that when one giueth two or three graines thereof to any sick person, and couer him warme in his bed, it will make him sweate more then any other Diaphoreticke, which operations can by no meanes proceed from any cold qualitie it hath.</p>
               <p>But if a man should obiect amongst both. these reasons, saying, first the <hi>Turkes</hi> being of a hot constitution, and liuing in a hot clime, become more faint-hearted and cowardlike then those of colder temperatures, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Opium</hi> tempering that heate maketh him more frolicke and cheerefull accidentally; secondly, that if a man giue but a cup-full of cold water onely to a sicke man to drinke, it will questionlesse make him sweate &amp;c. Whereunto I answere, that if the <hi>Turkes</hi> doe acquire force and courage by tempering their heate with cold things, they might very
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1774:26"/>
well spare that great labour and toyle they take in sowing their Poppie, and gathering their <hi>Opium,</hi> seeing that spring and riuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water might stand them in as great stead, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a cold liquor, and dispiercing it selfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all parts of the body, as soone as it is drunke, but it is so farre short of <hi>Opium</hi> in quickening the spirits, and raysing the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, that it worketh quite contrary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
               <p>And whereas they affirme that a cup of water (which is apparantly cold) will cause any sicke person to sweate, I answere, that if it cause one that is in a Feuer, or pestred with some other hot disease to sweate, as many times it doth, it proceeds not from any Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoreticall or sweating qualitie, inherent in it, but commeth to passe rather, <hi>per antiperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasim,</hi> and accidentally, for like as water cast vpon a hot Anuile or burning stone, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately rayseth vp vapours and fumes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p>Now let vs returne to their arguments,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1774:26"/>
which goe about to proue that <hi>Opium</hi> is cold in respect it prouoketh sleepe, thickneth the humours, and taken too liberally causeth daungerous Symptomes and doubtfull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents, which reasons (I affirme) are of no force in this behalfe, for first as <hi>Opium</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoketh sleepe to all those which are afflicted with hot diseases, so doth it also prouoke the same in all other causes without exception, yea although they bee of different qualities, as witn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1774:27"/>
vertues that <hi>Opium</hi> before is described to haue, whereas ou the contrarie part no hot things could effect the same; but experience proueth it farre otherwise, for if <hi>Quick-siluer,</hi> the <hi>Magisterie</hi> of <hi>Lead</hi> (compared to Saturne) <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> or <hi>Allome</hi> (salts of a cold tempra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) or the water <hi>de Sper: Ran,</hi> which is thought to coagulate or congeale the bloud by its extreame frigidi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ie, if none of these (I fay) perform those effects which <hi>Opium</hi> doth, nor Ice nor Snow themselues rationally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred in neuer so large a dose, can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure sleepe, or cease paines, but rather for the most part cause more vehement fits. Yet I will not deny that cold things may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and vpon some occasions procure rest, though not alwaies when neede is, nor so surely at any time as <hi>Opium</hi> well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</p>
               <p>And as for hot things, they are for the most part so farre from causing disquietnesse to mens bodies, or subtilizing grosse hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours that quite contrary a man may finde many that will prouoke sleepe, and thicken subtill and virulent humours, rather and soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then other of a colder qualitie, as we may plainely perceiue by <hi>Mirrhe, Aloes, Storax, Olibanum, Worme-wood, Betonie, Safran</hi> and such other, yea &amp; <hi>Sulphur</hi> it self (the very fire
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1774:27"/>
of nature) doth not onely prouoke sleepe in some reasonable measure, but doth also in such wise coagulate and condense the subtill and hot humours, that it auaileth much the Pthysicall in staying their defluxions, and it is a thing most manifest amongst <hi>Spagirists</hi> that Sulphur can coagulate water, wine or Aqua-vitae in such sort that a man may beate them to powder in a morter, and after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to that naturall forme they were in before.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant, that a man may tell mee that things of a cold or hot nature, doe worke diuersely in bodies according to the diuersitie of the subiect they light vpon, as the fire which hardneth clay, and softneth waxe, and so of cold things, in like manner that <hi>Opium</hi> being extreamely cold, by that extremitie worketh in bodies, where other things of an inferiour degree cannot in any wise; but neither of the two reasons reach to the deapth of our dispute, for first <hi>Opium</hi> (the subiect of our discourse) worketh not in mens bodies in this or that manner by electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to the diuersitie of their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pratures and complexions, but doth indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently prouoke sleepe, and causeth all paines to cease of what nature or qualitie soeuer as aforesaid.</p>

                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:1774:28"/>Secondly, putting the case that <hi>Opium</hi> were the coldest thing in the world, yet that small <hi>Dose,</hi> which we commonly vse to giue at a time, cannot exceed the great frigidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of those things afore-named in their larger <hi>Doses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Were it not a great absurditie, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that one graine or two of <hi>Opium</hi> were colder then a dragme of <hi>Allome,</hi> prepared or crude, or one scruple of the <hi>Magisterie</hi> of <hi>Lead,</hi> or an ounce of the water of the <hi>Sperm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Now touching the Symptomes which <hi>Opium</hi> causeth being inordinately taken, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience her selfe teacheth vs, that <hi>Aqua-vitae</hi> (which is of a hot and subtill essence) being

               <p>
                  <hi>Wine</hi> it selfe also causeth diuers Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of <hi>Opium</hi> in them which abuse it, as wee may plainely see by the lamentable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples vsed in diuers parts of the <hi>Papacie,</hi> where they commonly make those people drunke which are condemned to any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent death, of whom some goe singing, and some rayling thereunto, and others as dull and senselesse as bruit beasts, none of them hauing any vnderstanding or memorie of their iminent slaughter, and which is worse, haue no true feeling of their sinnes, nor solide iudgement or discretion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend themselues to the mercie of their Creator.</p>
               <p>Wine (as all Authors affirme, and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience her selfe declareth) being abused, doth cause in processe of time <hi>Phrensie, Madnesse, Rage, Furie, Stupiditie, Lethargie, Palsi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now as purgatiue Medicines rightly vsed, doe not onely euacuate Natures excrements, and bring the bodie to an excellent tempra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but being abused doe mightily offend and bring dissolution to the same; euen so <hi>Opium</hi> well administred, endoweth the bodie with singular benefits, but abused and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperatly giuen, worketh the contrary, whence it followeth that in the vsage of either of them, it behoueth the Physiti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The second meanes, is to take <hi>Opium,</hi> and to cut it into small slices, and to put it into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and letting it digest and boyle easily, still scumming away the froath, and vnctuous Cremor swimming aloft, which indeed is its sulphurous malignitie, and reserue the rest for vse.</p>

                  <head>The Answere.</head>
                  <p>Concerning the first obiection, I am of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that if such men as goe about to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose any such thing, would either giue place to the authority of great Physitions, or expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience-self (both which assuring vs that c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e, nor dulleth the senses, as hath beene already sufficiently proued in the beginning of this discourse) they would neither blame, nor so basely esteeme of it; but suppose that a very smal <hi>Dose</hi> of crude <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium</hi> did produce such effects, must it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe the same when it is depriued of the superfluity of its narcotical Sulphur, his Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie corrected, and after mixed with such <hi>Bezoardick</hi> and Cordiall things as aforesaid? No man of iudgement, or of any experience in the Mysteries of nature, can deny that <hi>Opiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> (the principall ingredience or Basis of <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum</hi>) being thus altered both in forme and substance, beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth likewise changed in its vertues and operations, and therefore can
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1774:54"/>
with no reason censure so hardly thereof as when it is crude: And notwithstanding that <hi>Laudanu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> doth prouoke the diseased to sleepe, yet daily experience teacheth vs that it doth not suffocate naturall heate, but rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue it when it is about to consume, and in danger to be suddainely extinct by reason of its violent motion, extreame paines, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary watching, whereby it is as rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled as a lampe or burning-torch is in a mightie tempest, which causeth a greater wasting of oyle, and losse of light then it would doe if it were defended from such an accident.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 For the second obiection: <hi>Laudanum</hi> is so farre from aggrauating, impairing or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king worse the causes of the disease by reason of its incrassating faculty, that quite contrary it prepareth some offending humours, and maketh them far more apt and easie to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, as in the 21. passage before co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning Gouts we haue something declared; For is it not the consent and verdict of the best Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions in the world, that the preparation of humors before purgation doth chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in two operations, that is in subtilizing and attenuating of those which are Viscouse thick and clammy, and incrassating and thickning indifferently those which are too
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1774:54"/>
subtill, virulent, windy &amp; vagant in the body? Now the greatest part of extreame paines and inward heates proceeding from some dissolued matter, that is either salt, sharpe or corroding, or from such as doth excoriate, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame and alter the member affected, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by malignant vapors arise, which passing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the adioyning parts, doe by consent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, &amp; many euil accidents as by experience is manifest: what better course can a man obserue, then by meanes of <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum</hi> to thicken and digest the sayd humors &amp; sequestring &amp; consuming the aforesayd va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours in such sort, that they can by no means exercise their cruelty as before? And in case of superfluity (if it be any waies requisite to be purged, a man may doe it afterwards farre more warily and safely then in the former e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state: is not this represented to any mans vnderstanding, by sundry outward vlcers, which being inflamed and distilling from some subtill and corrosiue humour, cause great Pricking, Dolour and paines and oftentimes by consent a Feuer to the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, so that the true remedie in such a case to take away such accidents is some excellent <hi>Anodyne,</hi> which may mitigate and asswage that vnnaturall heate, and suddenly ripen and indifferently thicken the offending
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1774:55"/>
humor which was so subtill and corrosiue, which being done, al other Symptomes cease whatsoeuer; <hi>Laudanum</hi> then (not onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing these effects by its naturall propertie, but also mundifying, resisting putrifaction, and healing, and comforting the weakened parts as it were Balsame) may by good conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence take away or extinguish the cause of many euill Symptomes, rather then impaire and make them incureable: for although it doth moderately incrassate, yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it doth not coagulate the bloud, nor fixe the substances, which in their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per nature are liquid in stone, nor soder or glue the parts together as <hi>Gypsum</hi> doth, for which cause onely men should blame it in such maner as before.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Thirdly, we will not deny, but that some sick person may chance to die soone after the receipt of <hi>Laudanum,</hi> but that <hi>Lauda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>First therefore it is very apparant by our former discourse, that <hi>Laudanum</hi> is not a thing of such a venemous quality, as will cause death to the receiuer, for albeit the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation be true that some haue died soone after the taking thereof, yet that ought not
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:1774:55"/>
to supersede all other reasons, attestations &amp; experience concerning the good effects, and safe vse of <hi>Laudanum,</hi> for as it is an absurd and foolish thing for a man to say, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> did see cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine graines of <hi>Bezoar-stone, Vnicornes-horne, Pearles,</hi> or such like pretious Cordials giuen to a sicke person who died not long after, <hi>ergo,</hi> that was the cause of his death, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re take heed of vsing any such thing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: or I saw one giue a Clister to such a sicke person who died soone after, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters are dangerous remedies, and ought not to be vsed, as many simple people are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to argue; Euen so it is as absurd a thing to hold <hi>Laudanum</hi> in suspition, because such a one tooke it &amp; after dy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d, for although it doe principally and speedily cause all tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to cease, and prouoke the diseased to sleepe, yet that is no consequence that it can preserue a man from death, when by God his secret decree his houre is come, for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that nor no other Medicine in the world can doe: sleepe and exemption from paines are necessary things, as well for sound as sicke men, the one with distinction, the other with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all exception; but that these two doe sometimes serue for the maintenance and strengthening of mans life, and other some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are vnnecessary, and of no vse, this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:1774:56"/>
not through any fault in themselues, but in nature which doth not receiue them for her owne good and benefit, as other times she vseth to doe, which thing is liuely represented vnto vs by the vse of meate, drinke and all other things called Medicines not naturall, which sometimes are good and profitable to the bodie, and sometimes quite contrary, euen as nature disposeth of them for our good, or euill, howsoeuer in themselues they are alwaies good, seeing without the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no man can liue, we may easily perceiue the v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie hereof by the example of any man, who hauing watched, and trauailed moderately vntill at last hee become drowsie and faint, who after a little sleepe, and repose being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened, becommeth as liuely and frolicke as at first. But if this man returne to his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and redouble his paines &amp; watching in such sort, that hee surpasse the limits of his strength, and so long vntill his vitall animall and naturall functions be vtterly disbanded and weakned, making such an exceeding al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in his body and turning it quite vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side-downe, so that a dangerous and mortall disease insue: Now in this case, if he betake himselfe to this Medicine for rest and sleepe, thinking to finde like benefit and comfort, as before, he shalbe so farre from enioying
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:1774:56"/>
the same, that quite contrary he must needs pay the price of his life for his vaine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse and intemperance. After the very same manner may wee iudge of such a sicke person as hath wanted sleepe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond measure, indured intollerable paines, taken no food or nourishment, and become extreame weake and at point of death, who afterwards falling into a little sleepe of himselfe, or by meanes of a little <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum,</hi> or a spoone-full or two of some restauratiue liquor to comfort him; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steed of recouering his life by any of these, hee doubtlesse dies; the cause of his death notwithstanding ought not to bee imputed to the little sleepe hee had, nor to the taking of the Cordiall (seeing that sleepe and nourishment are two ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary things for the preseruation of life) but rather in regard that death hauing seized vpon them, these things could not produce those good effects, which by natures intention they were ordained and appointed for. Let this suffice then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the third obiection aforesaid, in defence of well prepared and discreetly administred <hi>Laudanum.</hi> For if any man vsing <hi>Opium</hi> as the <hi>Turkes</hi> doe, or <hi>Henbane, Mandrage,</hi> or any other Narcotiall thing so crude, raw,

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any notable error in that behalfe, it is farre from my scope or intention to defend any such abuse; my desire is rather that Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions should beware how they deale with simple people, and lest the Art should bee slaundered, there ought to bee a fit time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected for the giuing of <hi>Laudanum,</hi> that is at the first incounter of the disease, when there is good hope of cure, considering that wee must not onely haue regard to purge Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mize, prescribe a Dyet, &amp;c. to our Patients, but also to comfort and restore, to aduance and bring them to their naturall rest, and to cease and qualifie their torments. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer wee should omit no occasion at any time, to ease and succour our neighbour, euen vntill the point of death, in all things wee may or can possibly, euen as, wee would bee serued our selues in the like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
