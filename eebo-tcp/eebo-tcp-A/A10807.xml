            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Amongst many of sundry countries, which made their voyage to this famous Porte, thr√©e gallant youthes Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of great reputation, wealth, &amp; credit, hauing to names, <hi>William, Robart,</hi> and <hi>Otho,</hi> all from the well knowne and honourable Citie of <hi>Exeter,</hi> had residence at <hi>Roane</hi> in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie:</hi> where their great affaires ended, hauing some idle time, and waying not the expence of a hundreth or two of Crownes, in a merriment, gaue faithfull promise each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to passe for <hi>Burdeux,</hi> as well to s√©e the manner of the Uyntage, and order thereof, as witnesse to themselues, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther report of the great fl√©ete which yearely there laded might be true, as also to m√©ete with some their countreymen of <hi>Deuonshire,</hi> and with them to frolicke: for which iourney, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

to time prefixed, being prouided. To <hi>Burdeux</hi> they are come, where they frequent the gallantest company of all Nations thereof, demeaning themselues in such manner, that their company was acceptable and desired of all men: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>pani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for al sportes, or exercises, whether gaming, drinking, spor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or reuelling: what any durst do, they neuer refused it: such Boone companions they are, and so of all men est√©emed.</p>
               <p>Not long after their comming to <hi>Burdeux,</hi> fortune bringeth with happinesse from the Westerne shore of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, a tall ship, well equipped and furnished, fit for the voiage: of whose arriuall, <hi>William</hi> and his accomplisses being aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised, as men glad to heare of their countries welfare and friends, make such enquirie for the ships company, that in good time they are met, with three other gallants Merchants, (viz.) <hi>Walter, Oliuer,</hi> and <hi>Iohn:</hi> with whom as straungers m√©eting, and questions propounded and answered, <hi>William</hi> knowing curtesse, in kindnesse enuited the new arriued Marchants to his lodging that night to supper: which with thankes they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and accordingly at the appointed houre came, where make no question, they were all as welcome, as friends in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain parts may be to friends: spending the euening sometimes in discoursing of their Country and acquaintance there: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in gaming, and often carowsing hralths to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, kindred, and friends.</p>
               <p>Amongst this delight, albeit <hi>Oliuer, Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Walter,</hi> were as wel pleased in their company, as countreymen might be: yet were their mindes other where: especially <hi>Oliuer</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> who yearely traffickt for that Porte, had there loues neare adioyning, one dwelling at <hi>Bloys,</hi> the other at S. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines:</hi> such as for beautie, wealth and reputation, might draw men of more worth to their liking: of whom <hi>Oliuer</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> in priuate whisperings, tooke great care, entending that night to haue s√©ene them, and deliuer such presents as they brought from England: had not this m√©eting of their countreymen pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented them.</p>
               <p>To all which priuate talke, <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Robert</hi> tooke

good h√©ede. But <hi>William</hi> specially gaue eare, and ouerheard their speech: vnderstanding by many motions, that willingly they would haue bene fr√©e from their companies, which he, could well haue wished them, to their best liking: but that he entended to search them as he could, and make tryall what mettall his countreymen were of: &amp; for that purpose, when he had well lined their hoodes with the iuyce of Grape, a potion that maketh the coward bolde, and ouerthroweth the stoutest, <hi>William</hi> singleth from his companion, the best demeaned <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer,</hi> and with him, of many matters discoursed: betw√©ene whom, such enchatinting words passed, that an inuiolable league of friendship was profest, as nothing might haue po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to violate: and consequently amongst them all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William</hi> growing on this new-vowed friendship, to more familiar parly, besought <hi>Oliuer</hi> and the rest, hauing acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in that place, to bring them to their femall friends in the Citie, where they might spend that night to s√©e the fashions of those damsels, for that they were straungers &amp; had no acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: for requitall of which, he promised them if they could finde opportunitie to come to <hi>Roane,</hi> where they had abiding, they would so quite their kindnesse as they should well like of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oliuer,</hi> as well disposed to mirth as his friend <hi>William,</hi> and as pleasantly conceited, imagined that his owne sp√©ech to his companion <hi>Iohn</hi> was ouer heard, whereon this question was propounded, tooke in good part his words, and thankfully acepted all friendship offered, and cheare receiued. Beseeching pardon, not accomplishing his desire, whom he assured was of more continuance in the Citie, then himselfe, that had not bene full foure and twentie houres a shoare: and therefore rather ought to be a conductor to him and his companions, his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience being more then twentie such Idiots as himselfe in such causes. Therefore good brother (quoth <hi>Oliuer</hi>) rather let vs participate with your teminine pleasures, that being Ledgers are not vnprouided: and hereafter if you haue cause to vse vs, it may be we poore men may proue as kinde to you vpon like occasion.</p>

                  <hi>William</hi> thus pretily trumped by his friend <hi>Oliuer,</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the point of his own weapon into his bosome, thought it ill halting before a Cripple, and hereby iudged his countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men no Clownes<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> nor their answeres to s√©eke, which on the sudden could giue them such bones to gnaw.

greefes ariseth, the <hi>Aabbas</hi> sorroweth, and the whole company complaineth for their comfort, whom none but their friendes libertie can comfort, especially such of the Uirgins that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed there French puritie for English loue, est√©eming more of the imprisoned English then the whole countrey. Amongst those that loue had tyed in liking, the Lady <hi>Abbas</hi> was not least in affection, who dayly dressing the woundes of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> with her owne handes, beganne so well to b√©e pleased in his company, that sh√©e forgat her Paternosters, her sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke so wambled with this little god of loue, that hauing small time to cloath her, was often compelled to make her of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings a bed.</p>

Wherefore to reclaime him from these sullen humours, shee studied and deuised all possible meanes she could to doe them good, for which hauing conceited a Plot,

               <p>
                  <hi>Robert</hi> well pleased with these wordes, was in his minde more quieted, yet made no semblance thereof, but accused her of flattery and dissimulation, s√©eming in sp√©ech so vehement, as if he would haue murdred all that came neare him: which the pitifull Lady with teares bewayled, vowing by<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> her holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and by all rights of her honour, to perfourme her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, or it shoulde cost all the wealth sh√©e had, and hazarde of her best friendes, on which giuing him her hand, shee leadeth him like a good Nurse, carefull least harme should betyde her Infant: conducting him to that place where so often she desired his company, where h√©e still continued, vrging her to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme her promise.</p>

To all which coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants <hi>Ioane</hi> sware to be iust, and faithfully to k√©ep, which done he said: Sweete Mistresse <hi>Ioane,</hi> though my yeares deny me that experience which many good men proue, yet am I not so sencelesse, but can conceiue the pleasures parents haue in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous children, the ioyes in wedlocke, and the sw√©ete content therein: where husband and wife participate in one simpathie of loue, and so much the more greeue, to s√©e such a one as your selfe,

marked of God to be the mother of many sw√©et Infants, wherein your fathers aged yeares should be blessed, and the world by procreation encreased, should be depriued of al rights due in marriage to the poorest begger: robbed of mothers hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable name, and pleasure therein, all proc√©eding from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of nature, in him whose wife by full graunt you are.</p>

                  <hi>Williams</hi> owne seruant, who thought she sorrowed to the death, for his supposed sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, wished his head off, so she were rid of him: entring into consideration of <hi>Iames</hi> particular sp√©ech, the losse of wombes pleasures, and mothers delight, so nearely touched her, that as in a trance she had like to haue fallen from her horse, if <hi>Iames</hi> had not the more regarded her.

But nothing might preuaile, home she would, no deniall could serue: whither <hi>Iames</hi> made such haste, that they came before the old man was in bedde.</p>
               <p>The sudden comming of <hi>Ioane</hi> with her guide <hi>Iames,</hi> much amazed them: especially s√©eing their dearest childe in such a pittifull case: and not-knowing the cause, thought verily that some hobgoblings or theeues had frighted them: which to assure them, finding <hi>Ioane</hi> in weake case, and not to be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned, the mother and her maides were very carefull in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her to bed: meane while the father earnestly enquired of <hi>Iames,</hi> what the occasion of his daughters griefe was: who

like himselfe, so suttelly pleaded, that the olde man was not a whit the wiser: <hi>Iames</hi> hauing broached this deuise, how wel or ill so euer it sp√©edeth in the end. After he had in secret coniured <hi>Ioane</hi> by her holy oathes to remember her promise, with all sp√©ed hasteneth to <hi>Exeter,</hi> where he discharged his horse, and recouered his maisters house, long before the company brake vp: <hi>William</hi> little suspecting what his man had bene about.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:11102:16"/>
small rest. The morning no sooner gaue light, but <hi>Iames</hi> wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with his nightes disquiet, got vp about his businesse, and not long after came <hi>William</hi> home, as heauie and full of passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as a man might be losing his delight, her Father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with w√©eping neare wearied, and the whole housholde mourned for their disquiet. The old woman who had a mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly care of the Mayden, searching all wayes and meanes for her daughters health, principally noted the small content she tooke in <hi>Williams</hi> company, who hearing that he was gone, began more ch√©erfully to talke, calling for such things as she liked: this amendment caused her Mother to imagine, some discontent it was that troubled her, which would be her destruction if some meane were not found, to know the cause from whence it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c√©eded. To effect which, pollitikely she insinuates with an aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Mayden seruant of theirs, that had bene her daughters bed-fellow euer since she was weaned, whome <hi>Ioane</hi> loued wel: to her the Mother maketh great mone, promising mony plentifull, and what other friendship they could do for her, if she could by any deuise attain the knowledge of her griefe, for that they were assured was the chiefest cause. The mayden wroght by her old Mistresse, promised faithfully to do her best to satisfie them, not forgetting her Maister &amp; Mistresse good words, and rich proffers of mony, as one that could well handle the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, watching in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> night with <hi>Ioane,</hi> vttred many faire words, bemoaning her extremitie, and pittying her distresse, saying she was perswaded that some secret sorrow cumbred her, willing whatsoeuer was in her minde, to reueale it to some one whom she best trusted therewith: which would be the more comfort for her in sicknesse: so might she the better ease her heart of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and haue meanes to releeue her: otherwise there was no hope of life. <hi>Ioane</hi> hearkening to her approued friendes good counsell, after she had sworne her to conseale what she had to impart vnto her, and the seruant promising faithfully to fulfill whatsoeuer she was enioyned, with many sighes which like smoke came from her stomack, out it came, which sore burned her hart and consumed her bodie: vttring wherof; she enueyed
<pb facs="tcp:11102:17"/>
against her Father, Mother, <hi>William,</hi> and all friends thereto consenting. The seruant hearing her, bel√©eued verily shee had found where the hurt lay, and smoothed her more to feele the bottome of her heart, which <hi>Ioane</hi> faithfully discharged at full, leauing nothing hid from her. With which newes, the May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den laboured as a woman with childe to be deliuered, wayting opportunitie, to her Maister and Mistresse she came, and vnto them deliuered what <hi>Ioane</hi> vnder Benedicitie had reuealed: assuring her Maister that was the cause. Her mother at hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thereof, grew into admiration how <hi>Ioane</hi> should come to knowledge of so great a secret, yet was glad at the heart, she had that giuen her to vnderstand.</p>
               <p>The better to eschew ill to such chances incident, with more tender compassion, bemoning her, that being a woman as sh√©e was, should so be deluded, loosing the benefit of youth, the rytes to marriage in dutie appertaining.</p>
               <p>The olde woman finding by <hi>Ioanes</hi> trustie friend where her griefe laie, on the morrow came vnto her, inciting her, by the dutie of a childe, to let her know if any thing troubled her minde, and fr√©ely speaking without blame, she should be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, if all the abilitie she had would procure it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ioane</hi> hearing her mothers sp√©eches, though modestie wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her conseale it, trusting her mother would be secret to her in like manner, reuealed the substance of <hi>Iames</hi> his tale &amp; cause of her griefe: which the old woman was glad of, willing her to take comfort and be of good cheare, for she should not haue that wrong by her consent: blaming her most, for so long consealing the occasion, so highly to gr√©eue her selfe: which sooner made knowne, order had bene taken before that time, for a husband sufficient. <hi>Ioane</hi> well pleased with her mothers saying, assured of her loue, began to comfort her selfe in hope, and by little and little recouered some strength.</p>
               <p>Her mother whose secrets she could not k√©epe, to a Gossop a neighbour of hers, reuealed the cause of her childes malladie, and the imbesilitie of <hi>William.</hi> So long this newes was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, that it came by a Nourse dwelling in that parish, to <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>

who told her Mistresse, which was wife to a wealthy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, what common talke was through their parish of <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am.</hi> The Marchants wife, whose husband loued <hi>William</hi> wel, could not be quiet, but assoone as her husband came in, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him with that report. The good man smiling at his wiues simplicitie, that was no better imployed then to spend her time hearing so bad a tale. Wife (quoth he) I hope your modestie is more, then to be a carrier of such tydings: to answere you, as I would do all others that speake it, I will on my oath iustifie, that he is a man sufficient for any reasonable woman: what I speake is trueth, I know it well: hauing bene his bedfellow al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most thr√©e yeares, learning our language in <hi>Spaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Marchant acquainted <hi>William</hi> herewith, who in chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, accompanied with some friendes, hyed to the Farmers house, requesting to see <hi>Ioane,</hi> who would not be spoken with: wherfore taking her Father aside in priuate, he discoursed how he was abused: and vehemently protested he wold not be made a scorne by his daughter if she were a Lady: therefore willed to let him know the originall of this scandall, or by heauen he protested, the next Sunday at diuine seruice, in their parish Church, to quit himselfe of so great an ignomy, he would na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked shewe himselfe, to her and their great shame, that deuised the same. The old man s√©eing <hi>William</hi> so angry, by mild sp√©ech brought him to more reason, and at his intreatie discouered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, what modestie forbad: on which assurance, her Father with his daughter and mother so preuailed, that taking his word for currant, and <hi>Williams</hi> for good payment, she apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her selfe, and came amongst them: where all broyles were ended, and promises faithfully giuen, neuer more to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred: and shortly after to both their contents were wedded. <hi>Ioane</hi> finding her man <hi>Iames</hi> to be a strife-maker, though she neuer for her oath discouered his doings, secretly enuyed him euer after.</p>

               <p>The Londoners which were winners frumped them, and were pleasant, amongst which, one challenged <hi>William,</hi> to throw one cast for all his money before him, which was a good summe: which offer, <hi>Oliuer</hi> and <hi>Robert</hi> would haue taken, offering to pawne their wares in the hall to make it good, scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be braued by their betters.

spent a day or two, feasting and making merrie with their friends. From thence to <hi>Welles,</hi> and so to <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> ouer the downe called <hi>Poldonne,</hi> a place often frequented with such as lighten honest trauellers of their monies. These good companions passing the downe, the way faire and gr√©ene, and they pleasanty discoursing, <hi>William</hi> of a necessarie businesse was enforced to stay behinde: wherin being earnestly imploied, came to him thr√©e tal fellows wel appointed, with short swords and bucklers, commanding him to deliuer his mony. <hi>William</hi> being thus surprized on the sudden, nothing daunted with their words, presently said. It is done like cowards and not men, to take me at such aduantage. Now I s√©e the old prouerbe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, It is easie kissing a mans tayle when his hose are downe.</p>
               <p>If you be men, as you haue the forme of men, shew me faire play and do your worst.

               <p>
                  <hi>William</hi> hauing his Rabbets, the dearest commoditie hee euer bought, hastneth after his company, who missing him, at the foote of a hill stayed his comming, vnto whom he shewed no maner of discontent, but ieasting, said: you my maisters of <hi>Barnestable</hi> and <hi>Tiuertonne,</hi> being so neare, make hast to be with your wuies, and misse all good bargaines: s√©e what I haue bought to make my <hi>Ioane</hi> merrie when I come home. Nay quoth one, though they be good and well worth the carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, yet will they not k√©epe so farre, the weather being so hote. Therefore let vs eate them to dinner, and be merry togeather before we part. Eat them quoth <hi>William,</hi> soft sirs, they cost me more. Why said they, you shall haue as much as they cost you with thankes. You say like honest men, said <hi>William,</hi> let vs ride no further then <hi>Bridgewater</hi> to night, and take my bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
<pb facs="tcp:11102:20"/>
on this condition you pay me what they cost, and my selfe go cleare for buying and cariage. To which they all assen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and forward they set a round pace to <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> where they dined, bespake good cheare for supper, where the Rabbets were a dish: enuited their friends of the Towne, with whom they were very merrie at supper. <hi>William</hi> often demaunding how they liked their cheare, which they all commended. The guest gone, a reckoning was called and the hoast payed. Now <hi>Signior William</hi> (quoth <hi>Oliuer</hi>) what cost y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Rabbets? and wel remembred said <hi>Otho,</hi> we had like to haue forgotten them. Yea had said <hi>William,</hi> that is all one, forbearance is no quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: giue me my present money as your promise was, and after I wil bestow on you to bedward a gallon of the best wine in the towne. You will gaine much by that said <hi>Robert.</hi> Get or loose I will do it. Tell vs then (quoth <hi>Walter</hi>) what cost they? My maisters I doubt not but you will all bel√©eue me: speaking on my credit, twentie pounds they cost me, and some odde mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, how much I do not perfectly remember: wherefore pay me twentie pounds, and let the rest go. Muse not at my large account, for your haste was cause thereof: leauing me in such manner without regard: recounting all that hapned betw√©ene the theeues and him. Whereat though they were ashamed, and more gr√©eued for the daunger he was in, they could not forbeare to laugh. Well my maisters said <hi>William,</hi> ieast on, you shall not scape one penney better cheape: for as I am an honest man, you shall pay it, to teach you leaue your honest friends hereafter: whose life was by your negligence in great hazard. So iustly sharing the twentie poundes amongst them, turning it to a ieast, with a good will they deliuered it. <hi>William</hi> called for his gallon of wine promised, which they merrily drunke to wash downe the Rabbets: and the next morning when they had rid thr√©e or foure houres togither as their way lay, they parted euery man to his home faithfull friends, and true louers one of the other.</p>

This done, proclamation was made for the quiet of the Gamesters, who proceeded to their pastimes, wherein of both sides was shewed many manfull feates, and slights of pollicie, to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties great pleasure: who by generall voyce of the whole company, gaue the honour of that dayes exercise, to <hi>Williams</hi> Prentises &amp; their fellowes.

No sooner entered they the field, their duties done, and the players strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, the King to do them grace and encourage them to their play, caused a Noble man of his traine to cast vp their Ball, which came no sooner on the ground, but was taken at aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: then began the strength and nimblenesse of men to be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with lifting, throwing, and casting one the other, some with violence, others with fine slights, generally commended, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing their sport without victory on either side, along time, vntill by vnhappie chance, one of <hi>Williams</hi> company, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per man, and a Gentleman borne, was with a fall from a lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie mans armes, vnfortunately slaine.

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Ames,</hi> the first seruant of <hi>William,</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing long in <hi>Cales</hi> and Saint <hi>Lucas,</hi> on his maisters businesse, by his good carriage and gentle behauiour had more credit then all the English Marchants there resident, or thither trading: not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the countrey, but with the Duke of <hi>Medina,</hi> who continually vsed <hi>Iames</hi> as a companion at all exercises, or play whatsoeuer: such was his bountie and nourture, who thought himselfe a Spanish Duke, or a Noble man at least. Fauour of all estates he had, as worthily deserued: his purse euer pliant to the poore, who euer sought him in distresse, whether Stranger or English, felt his bountie.</p>
               <p>These good parts of <hi>Iames,</hi> gained him loue and fauour, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially with the Duke, who being a. Prince of noble minde, fauoured no Nation like the English, or had pleasure with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but them. Frolike he was in their company, commending their bountie, and wondring at their costly fare and attire, which would cause him many times to leaue his owne Table and omit himselfe to their dyet, gracing them more then all Nations with his presence.</p>
               <p>The Noble Duke who by often resort to their house, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times had noated their seuerall dispositions, and highly
<pb facs="tcp:11102:27"/>
commended them, purposed to trie at full what was in them, hauing on a time the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> in his Court, vnto whom he had liberally spoken our Englishmens praise: and that he might better credit his sp√©ech, he ordained a most costly banket: to which he inuited the chiefest of our English Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants: amongst which, <hi>Don laques de Engleterre,</hi> for so h√©e named him, was not forgotten.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iames,</hi> which cared not for coyne, but wayed his countries honour, against the prefixed time, suted himselfe very rich after our countrey fashion: and with his companions to the Court is come: where with great welcomes of both Dukes they were entertained, and feasted most costly with rare Cates, spending the time of dinner with mirth, and much pleasant parley.</p>
               <p>Dinner ended, to sundry sportes they fell: some dance, some discourse, other court the dames. <hi>Iames</hi> and other two of his companions, accompany the Dukes at dice: betw√©ene them was very great game, and store of money on each side wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. The Duke setting great summes which was neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused. The Duke of <hi>Medina</hi> perceiuing it, thought verily to make them turne crauen. Being somewhat discontent, loosing so much, and few Crownes before him, pulled a Iewell from his chaine, valued at fiftie thousand Duckets: daring in high tearmes, the proudest Englishman to throw at it. This sterne chalenge of the Duke, dismaied our gallants, who looking one on the other, strained curtesie who should accept it, none so so hardie to aduenture thereon, the value being so great, all their substance not able to counteruaile it, and loath to lie in prison for a cast at Dice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iames</hi> nothing the timerousnesse of his companions, chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their faint sprites, said.</p>
               <p>Countreymen, what all amort? hath one proude word o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne you, that hitherto scorned to be dared, but like true Liegemen to our King, hath maintained his and our countries honour? No gallants no, were his King here and would pawne his Crown, making so peremptorie a chalenge,
<pb facs="tcp:11102:27"/>
my selfe would giue the aduenture thereon: if life, goods, of credit would answere the losse thereof. Therefore Saint <hi>George</hi> Englands honoured Patrone (quoth <hi>Iames</hi>) I am the man: and stepping to the table, clapped hand on the Iewel, and couered it with his pawne: promising to make good, the valued summe of fiftie thousand Duckets, if he lost it: which the Duke accepted.</p>
               <p>But in vnhappie time for <hi>Iames,</hi> who lost by fortune of the Dice, at that throw, not onely all the wealth he had gained, but his Maisters stock, and all the goods he had of other Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants: to deale for as factor: all which neuer daunted his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, nor could the Duke perceiue in his countenance any change, but with great chearefulnesse, drew the money he had of his owne, and borrowed of his companions all they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them: he paide it in part, pawning his honest word for the rest, to be satisfied within ten dayes next following. Which don, spending some time in banketting, they tooke their leaues, all the company gr√©eued in heart for <hi>Iames,</hi> who in that humor had vtterly vndone himselfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iames</hi> recouering his lodging, heauie in heart, although he were light of substance: began to consider of his estate, it gr√©eued him more for his good friends in England, his Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and such whose goods he had lost, then for himselfe. In these passions of discontent, when hee had a while, like one lost from himselfe remained, chearing his spirits, hee thus said.</p>
               <p>Base peasant, vnworthy the name of Englishman: what disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor were it for th√©e and thy Nation, if thy cowards thoughts by these proud Spaniards could be perceiued? accountest thou more of trash then thy countries honour? or shal this pelfe alter thy former contented humour, drawing thy pleasant conceited minde, to a laborinth of cares, and so quite ouerthrow thy self? No, no, cease to sorow, a pound of care neuer paid one ounce of debt. Let this be thy comfort: thou wast for the time, compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the greatest Prince in <hi>Spaine,</hi> then fail not to dispaire, quiet thy effects, follow thy businesse, and satisfie the Duke:
<pb facs="tcp:11102:28"/>
least this more disgrace thy countrey for none payment, then the insolent Spaniards, hath gained welth by his Indies. Lis farre better to die a begger in thine owne countrey, then here to be disgraced, and discountenanced: the which all those Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants of my countrey, that shal come hereafter into these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines, with Millions of gold cannot red√©eme. Bestir thee then, make sale of thy goods, call for thy debts, &amp; hauing the summe, glut the myser Duke with golde, though hereafter thou sterue.</p>
               <p>Thus said, leauing his studie, with diligence he applied him, against this promised time to procure the money, which by his friends he conueyed to the Dukes house, where he tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the vtmost farthing.</p>
               <p>The Duke of a milde and honourable inclination, bethin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him what a great losse it was for a Marchant, tendering his estate when he had sundry waies discoursed with him, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his Steward to returne him the one halfe of his money, deuiding it betw√©ene them: which <hi>Iames</hi> tooke in great scorne, and more gr√©eued to be found other in the latter ende, then at the beginning: yet with courtesie and thankes returned the same: saying to his companions, That neuer Spaniard should report he was Benifactor to an Englishman. So taking leaue of the Dukes of <hi>Medina</hi> and <hi>Florence,</hi> departed to his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, lamented of those Princes for his losse: but highly hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for his magnanimitie and haughtie spyrit, which made the Dukes censure him, to be doubtlesse, the sonne of some migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Potentate, how basely so euer shrowded in those his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed attires.</p>

So long trauelling, that his horse being wearie, desired his Maisters lodging in the fields, for lodging that night he was not likely to recouer: his guide fearing some hard measure, being better horst left him, thorow his threatning sp√©ech, which brought him to a very melancholy humour. While he was debating with himselfe what should betide him that night, hauing brought himselfe within such a Thicket or Groue of Drenge, Lemmon, or Pomgranat trees, casting vp his eyes betw√©ene the glimsing of the light, he espied a gallant <hi>Cauolere</hi> brauely mounted, vpon a swift running Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat.</p>
               <p>This sight hapning in a place so suspitious, more appalled him then the losse of his money, dreading more company and bad conditions, of some lurking th√©eues to take away his life: yet arming himselfe with courage, resolued to make them buy it dearely, if they did not ouermatch him: deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining with himselfe for his owne safetie, he came nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to his suspected enemie, who crossed him the way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tw√©ene the tr√©es in such manner, as might driue a man to doubt.</p>

This courtesie deserued thankes: which <hi>Iames</hi> very thankefully rendered him: yet trusted nothing more his good words: passing on the way, diuersly discoursing, the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iard courteous in words said.</p>

With this company a while he merily conuersed, perusing his Letters, and taking order for discharge of such goods as they brought, consealing the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinesse of his hearts sorrow, and colouring his thoughts with showes of content.</p>
               <p>The houre being come of appointment, when he should visit his new acquainted friend, who fayled not her time, as carefull thereof, but accordingly dispatched her conducter for her Loue <hi>Iames,</hi> of whose comming, assoone as <hi>Iames</hi> had knowledge, taking leaue of his companions, he followed his guide to the house of the Gentlewoman, whom in her owne forme we call Madam <hi>Petronella:</hi> who desirous to shewe all kind welcome to her friend, prouided to giue him entertainme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t with most costly and rare cheare, thinking all things too little, how costly so euer, that mony or loue could procure, for a guest of so high ext√©eme, which might commaund his Mistresse and all she had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iames</hi> that came not before he was expected, was espied a farre off, of his kind Lady <hi>Petronella,</hi> who attended his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming at the gate, where louingly unbrasing him, she bad him most hartily welcome to his owne house: leading him by the hand to place appointed for supper. <hi>Iames,</hi> seeing this straunge chaunge of his new bedfellow, being now her selfe most sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously apparelled and adorned with rich Iewels of great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, was striken into a dumpe, eftsoones admiting her stately personage, beautie and grace, her modest countenance, and costly furniture of her mansion, which rather resembled a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice then any other thing.</p>
               <p>In midst of these extremities, which reason required to ende, calling himselfe to minde, and not forgetting his dutie to the kind Lady, he rendered many thankes, returning her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brasings, with kisses, and interest, farre aboue ten in the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.

To please his minde yet farther, she openeth her Closet, her Casket of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels, Chests of Plate, and bagges of mony: all which, with her selfe, she againe tendered him. Long had not <hi>Iames</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated on this heauenly blessing of God prouided for him, when word was brought that supper attended their comming on the Table, at which they past the time with much pleasant parley, but chiefly the Lady desires, to discourse of English La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and their guise, the maner of the Country, and such which <hi>Iames</hi> with rare perfection fitted to her content, passing from one discourse to an other, so long, that <hi>Iames</hi> calling to minde his Maister <hi>William</hi> and other good friends in England, his pleasant humour was abated, and his minde not on his halfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penny, (as our English Prouerbe is), but studied how to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them, and maintaine his credit.</p>
               <p>To this alteration, <hi>Petronella</hi> gaue good h√©ed, imagining that her Loue tooke litle regard of all her profer, wealth, loue, or beautie, yet to bring him from his passion, she said.</p>

               <p>Syr it is your bad hap to be the first messenger of any ill happe befallen me, and I pray God you may be the last: for your losse, I am more sorie then for mine owne: which I

               <p>
                  <hi>William,</hi> who tendered his seruants as himselfe, hearing this complaint, was more displeased then before: charging him with great vnkindnesse in such maner to withdrawe his loue from his people, who were for the most part Gentlemen of worship, being in number twentie, very proper men, well maintained, and of good education, the most of them, commonly on his affaires in other Countries: said in very great anger.</p>

               <p>THis pleasant company made such sp√©ede, that they drewe neare their iourneys ende: whither by the height of the Sunne, they perceiued (it was likely holding on theyr way) that they should come thither too early: wherefore instantly finding a place both pleasant and delightfull, they reposed themselues vnder the Pomegranet and Orenge tr√©es, pleasing their owne
<pb facs="tcp:11102:36"/>
fancies with those fruites, and spending the day with such pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimes as was m√©et.</p>
               <p>Time that stayeth not, calleth them forwards: before their taking horse, the auncient English Marchants, <hi>William, Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,</hi> and <hi>Otho,</hi> hauing a desire to trie their welcomes, thought it fit, to enter the Towne before the company, and lodge se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly in some other Inne, vntill the solemnitie of the wedding was consumate. And to this ende, desired the company of kindnesse so to let it passe, and to conseale their b√©eing there.</p>
               <p>The young men which durst not gainesay their Maisters, condiscended, granting them license to take their own course: and therevpon, directions being giuen, the Maisters hastneth to the towne, taking their lodging, closely k√©eping them in their Chambers. About two houres after, and not long before the Sunnes downe full in the West, these gallant Marchants, in their brauerie, all curiously mounted, entered the Towne, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their lodging in the best Osterie in the Towne: of whose comming, <hi>Iames</hi> being aduertised, he suddenly made his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> before they could shift their apparell, where you n√©ed not doubt of their welcome by <hi>Iames</hi> giuen, to that place, where he entended to be a fr√©e-Demson: as appeared by his cost and kind vsage: which with all kindnesses he shewed, in their iolytie carowsing healthes to all their friends in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: especially by name those worthy Patrons, <hi>William<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer,</hi> and <hi>Otho,</hi> who they all very heartily wished present. But <hi>William</hi> chiefly was most desired by <hi>Iames,</hi> who little suspected he was so neare.</p>
               <p>Thus met these gallant youthes with ioy and great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that not long since parted with sorrow and effusion of teares: h√©ere was their olde passed sportes reuiued, and their friendship acknowledged, with firme confirmance vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed each to others, euery man heartily reioycing for <hi>Iames</hi> his good fortune.</p>
               <p>At the good sp√©ed of this mirth, and knitting vp this new league, <hi>Iames</hi> his wife who had notice of their being, and what company they were, richly attiring her selfe, came to
<pb facs="tcp:11102:36"/>
the place where they all were: where she in all courteous manner, welcommed them to <hi>Cheryes.</hi> Beseeching them, of that loue and courtesie they beare their Countreyman her Husband, to accept his house for their lodging: where how homely so euer, your welcomes shall not be bettered amongst your dearest friends in England.</p>
               <p>This kinde profer of the Lady, so curteous and hartily performed, the Marchants admired, commending <hi>Iames</hi> his choise, to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, the worthiest in all <hi>Spaine,</hi> for bewtie, wealth, and good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, wherein they thought him blessed. Returning her many thankes for her kindnesse: besought pardon and libertie to take their pleasures in their lodging, which were like otherwaies to be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some vnto her, and her Husband. To which request, though vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, she condiscended. Taking her leaue for that time, committed them to their ease and best content.</p>

                  <hi>William</hi> and his company hearing by their espialls, how the time of dinner grew to end, was conducted to the Bridall house, where they entended to make triall of their welcome: who by a messenger, gaue <hi>Iames</hi> to vnderstand, that certaine Marchants lately arriued from England, desired to s√©e him.

His

                  </hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to take their places as they came: where being set, <hi>Iames</hi> thus began.</p>
               <p>Fellow <hi>William,</hi> of all the men England might afford, the best welcome to this place: especially at this time, where so lately you haue bene often wisht. Braue Gallants of that noble Citie of <hi>Exeter,</hi> your companies hath cheared my spirits, to s√©e you all kinde louers and friends: fall to your vyands, and be merrie, for you shall all haue cause to be merrie here, as you shall finde.</p>
               <p>These kind shews of loue and courtesie, <hi>William</hi> and his friends more accepted, then if his supposed lost monies had bene instantly tendered him: the conceit whereof, being eyewitnesse of <hi>Iames</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse, and that honour done him by the states present: for ioy made him forbeare his dyet, but hardly teares: vnto whom, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, <hi>Iames</hi> carued often, drinking healths vnto them &amp; their frends in England. Which fauour, the whole company noted: who iudged them to be of worth: their countenance and attire shewing it. To whose welcome, the Spaniards in honour of <hi>Iames</hi> and his wife, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded many good and kinde sp√©eches of fauour, which was more then ordinary in that proud Nation: all which, the graue Englishmen with like courtesie returned.</p>
               <p>Dinner ended with much mirth and pleasure, <hi>Iames</hi> in all louing and dutifull maner, imbraced his Maister <hi>William:</hi> and his friends rendering more then a Million of thankes for their paines that vouchsafed to honour him so, vnexpected at that solemnitie: yet could not his minde be satisfied, doubting some extraordinarie occasion brought them thither: loath that any question should be made of his ill husbandrie in the Towne, taking <hi>William</hi> into his withdrawing Chamber, he said.</p>
               <p>Deare Maister, and especiall friend: that you vouchsafed this vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken paines, to witnesse my happinesse this day, I render thankes: yet greatly feare, your comming so secret, and only trauell, hath bene on reports of my misdemeanor: for which, I am the more sorie,
<pb facs="tcp:11102:37"/>
that you whose years require rest, should in your age be so cumbred. But how euer, I am glad to s√©e you: end for your goods mispent, no losse to you shall redound: but your accounts, and all men of your Cittie, whose trust I was, shall be with such profit cleared, as you and they, shall haue no cause to blame my riotous demeanor. <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> to quite his seruant, hearing him so kinde to comfort him, and giue no occasion to discontent, frankely acquited him of all debts due to him: and for his comming at that time excused it, of a voluntarie match made with the Maister of the Barke, hauing his two friends a boord, and the Barke bound for <hi>Cales,</hi> to bring them vnawares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. While they were in their earnest talke, the Bride hauing some businesse, or taking occasion to giue them their <hi>Bene- Venew,</hi> s√©eing such shews of loue betw√©en them, bad them according to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey manner, very welcome. Bes√©eching them, to take her house for their Ostrey during their stay: wherein they should honour their Countreyman her Husband, and do her great fauour. To which, <hi>William</hi> and his Comperes were easily intreated, the rather to s√©e the order and manner of entertainment of the Spanish Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, which they found costly, louing, and very kinde to <hi>Iames</hi> and all his friends, as they could command no more in their owne hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>IAmes</hi> in the Hauen of Blisse, ioyfull of his good friends company, loath on the sudden to forgo them: by great sute of his wife, whom they all honoured for her kindnesse shewed, consented to spend their time, fifteene dayes with them to frolike: where hauing leisure, they viewed the Churches and Monuments of the same, and all other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of content or pleasure. Wandring thus through the Towne, <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer</hi> and <hi>Otho</hi> being alone, chanced to passe by the house of a most rare and bewtifull Curtizan: who espying these strangers, seated her in a window opposite with the str√©et, playing on her Lute. To whose tunes, two others chaunted excellent Dytties: vnto which, <hi>Oliuer</hi> and <hi>Otho</hi> gaue good eare: viewing and noting their persons and bewtie, sometimes passing too and fro by the window: which the Curtizan perceiuing, as they that were not to learn all fashions, sent her Pandora vnto them, inuiting them to taste a Cup of their Wine.
<pb facs="tcp:11102:38"/>
Who like men forgetting themselues, was suddenly entreated: en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into hells mouth, or the diuels apron: where they found the gallant descended into a lower roome to entertaine her pray, whom with kinde embracings, and shewes of fauour, she welcomemed.</p>

                  </hi> honourable Englishmen, that am so plaine, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens tongues are long hanged, and their harts thoughts at the end thereof: but howeuer you please to censure of my speech, if a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomans courtesie be not reiected, vouchsafe to accept a Cup of Wine, a Lymon, and a p√©ece of Suger: this is all your cheare, but your welcome as much, as if my gracious Duke were present.</p>
               <p>The Marchants, albeit the conditions of those alluring Syrins were sufficiently knowne, yet was their mindes so besotted, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting wife, children, and the rumours of euill speech, both hauing lustfull desires, <hi>Otho</hi> formost in the onset, thus said.</p>

Gentlemen, I s√©e our harsh musicke sounds not in your eares, they iarre too much: I wish your delight, and gladly would haue you frolike if there be anything in my power to content you. By your fauour (quoth <hi>Otho</hi>) if a man should chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge your word, you would be the first that would recant. If I doo (quoth she) let me be burned for an Heritick. I am very sory your hard opinion is such of me: for be it said, albeit not vaingloriously, neuer gaue I such cause to any Gentleman, to haue such thoughts on me: for what I promise, Ile performe<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> as it were the losse of my mayden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, by holy S. <hi>Iulian</hi> I sweare. Nay, nay (quoth <hi>Oliuer</hi>) sweare not so vainely: yea, and nay, Cock and Pye, are sufficient for honest dealers. Trust me Lady, for my part, if I promise you, or any these pretie soules to be their bedfellow, you may take my bare word with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any oath: if I faile, burne my Cap, and say Cut's a Iade. Is plaine dealing such a Iewell amongst you Englishmen (quoth she) and is it my good fortune to finde it? If you were of our Spanish minds, I should soone trie what mettall you English Marchants are made of: for your Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> are gallants that I knew by good proofe, hauing a Pilgrimage by holy vow to S. <hi>Iames</hi> in <hi>Galisia,</hi> it was my good hap, to encounter for like deuotion, a Gentleman of England, whom I found so kinde, that for his sake, what ere he be shall come in my <hi>Pater Noster,</hi> he and his Countreymen are in my credit. Let that word stand (quoth <hi>Otho</hi>) and Mistresse, because an earnest penney bindes, I take this sw√©ete Farme to mine owne, to haue and hold it this night, and for it there's my pawne, kissing her sw√©etely on the lips. As the Mistresse, so her seruants proued Tassells, gentle inough to come at any ture: how loftie so euer they Tower, downe they come with the Murren, as these honest Marchants found to their costs: who were scantly quietly laid in their beds, but a crew of Russians, birds of this neast, entred the house, swearing and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting with bitter oathes, they were assured some villaine was in the house, which they would finde. At which words, the Curtizan seemed to feare her husbands terror, and cried mainly out. Oh Sir, I am vndone: this is my husband returned from the Court, who if he finde you, will murther you. While they were in this feare, the Russians brake the doores, with two or thr√©e Toarches, entered the chamber, trailed the Curtizan by the haire from their bed, &amp; threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them with death. The Marchants in feare, pleaded for pittie: wherevnto no regard was giuen: but like tyrants they raigned ouer

To whose words he began somewhat to listen, medigated his rage, content to let the birds goe, but so pruned them, that they had neither money, Iewell or apparell left, but naked in their shirts, driuen out at doores: threatned vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently, that if they made any rumour of their losse, whereby any trouble might ensue, their liues should make them recompence.</p>
