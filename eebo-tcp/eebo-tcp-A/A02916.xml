         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Among all which Apoſtles, none was more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfullie

S. Paule, who being a bold &amp; common blaſphemer,
a bloudie and mercileſſe perſecuter, afflicting the
flocke of Chriſt with moſt terrible torments, was
notwithſtanding euen in the fire of his furie reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and became the great teacher of the Gentiles,
deliuering vnto them ſuch heauenlie doctrine, as he
receiued by diuine inſpiration, apt to inſtruct, exhort,

might be made perfect in all good workes.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Heard (Right Worſhipfull) vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a time, at the mouth of that
good and godlie man, M. <hi>Philip
Melancthon,</hi> that <hi>There is no
worke more excellent, than to
teach &amp; learne the word of God.</hi>
And it maie bée ſo verie well.
For, without heauenlie doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,<note place="margin">Ephe. 4. 17. 18.</note>
wée proll in moſt thicke
darkneſſe and ignorance: or (to vſe S. <hi>Paules</hi> ſpeach) <hi>We
walke in the vanitie of our minde, we wander through
our owne blinde vnderſtanding, and are farre off from the
life of God:</hi> becauſe our ignorance, and the hardneſſe of
our heart bringeth to paſſe,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 7. 10.</note> that we are touched with no
féeling at all of ſorowe for our ſinnes: without which fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
the voice of the Goſpell doth neuer waxe ſwéete vnto
man: but rather lie wide open, and giue vp our ſelues, to
the committing of all filthineſſe.</p>
            <p>Now, the word of God is a ſouereigne ſalue to heale vp
theſe ſores: when the ſame is ſincerelie taught, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie
learned. Which thing that kinglie Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi>
knowing well inough,<note place="margin">Pſa. 119. 9.</note> witneſſeth, ſaieng: <hi>In quo mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
&amp;c. Wherewith ſhall a young man redreſſe his
waie? In taking heede thereto according to thy word:</hi>
which word (doubtleſſe) he ſaith in the ſame Pſalme,<note place="margin">Pſa. 119. 24.</note>
is his delight and counſellers. For this cauſe the ſame
Prophet,<note place="margin">Pſa. 119. 127.</note> preferreth that verie word, before all the
riches of the world, ſaieng: <hi>Diligo mandata, &amp;c. I
loue thy commandements aboue gold: yea, aboue moſt


<pb facs="tcp:2871:5"/>
fine gold.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſa. 119. 162.</note> Againe, <hi>Laetabor ego ſuper, &amp;c. I will reioice at
thy words,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſa. 119. 72.</note> 
               <hi>as one that findeth a great ſpoile.</hi> Againe, <hi>Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
mihi lex, &amp;c. The lawe of thy mouth is better vnto me,
than thouſands of gold and ſiluer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dauid</hi> therefore confeſſeth, that the word of God, is the
moſt pretious treaſure in the world: and that our life is
vncleane, and our waie filthie, vntill they be cleanſed by
the word of God, as with water of the cleareſt fountaine.
Which thing is then done, when we obtaine faith by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and receiue the holie Ghoſt. For, then the miſtineſſe
of our mindes is driuen awaie, our vnderſtanding is ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened,
and our heart which was hard before like a ſtone, is
made fleſhie and ſoft: ſo that the lawe of God maie bée
written therein, euen to be touched with the féeling of ſin,
to defie and ſpit at ſinne, and to followe the counſels, not
of the fleſh, but of the ſpirit, in framing and ordering our
life. Séeing the doctrine of Gods word bringeth ſo manie
and great benefites, that notable man (whom euen now I
named) ſaith, euen vpon iuſt cauſe, that <hi>Among all the
workes of men, to teach and learne the word of God is the
moſt excellent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, forſomuch as the word of God is a treaſure ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
&amp; to teach and learne the word of God, a worke ſo
excellent, what ſhall we ſaie of the ſincere &amp; true teachers
of this word? What ſhall we ſaie of them, which deliuered
the word of God, as it were from deſtruction, when it laie
ouertroden with the horrible imaginations of men, and
deuiſes of diuels, as in moſt filthie mire, and made the
ſame faire and cleane with their ſound and ſincere expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
We are greatlie indebted to them, which ſée to the
prouiſion of ſuch neceſſaries as belong to the maintenance
of this life, and without which theſe fraile bodies of ours
cannot continue in health: but we are neuer able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite
them with the like, which haue reſtored and made
doctrine pure againe, béeing the verie treaſure, without
the which we fall from all hope of euerlaſting life, and


<pb facs="tcp:2871:5"/>
haue deliuered the ſame doctrine vnto vs, both by word
of mouth, and in writing, ſound and ſincere.</p>
            <p>In the number of theſe I reckon M. <hi>Philip Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">M. Philip Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note>
our ſchoolemaſter, a man worthie of the firſt place
next vnder M. <hi>Martine Luther:</hi> than whom all <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi>
neuer bred and brought vp one ſharper in wit, quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
in iudgement, perfecter in knowledge, greater in
learning, readier &amp; ſounder in expounding the ſcripture
roundlie: yea, &amp; more than that, zealouſer in godlineſſe,
and earneſter in religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In conſideration of which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and ſingular gifts, he is had in great account and
eſtimation, not onelie of them which profeſſe the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
with vs: but alſo of the verie enimies of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>When Saint <hi>Paule</hi> wrote to the <hi>Philippians</hi> of his
time,<note place="margin">Phi. 2. 29.</note> concerning <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> ſaieng: <hi>Excipite ipſum
in domino, &amp; Receiue him in the Lord, with all glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and make much of ſuch:</hi> the holie Ghoſt meaneth
indéed thereby: yea, willeth vs, to take them for Gods
inſtruments: openlie to confeſſe the benefits which wée
receiue by the meanes of ſuch men, to be of God: to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
them as our ſchoolemaſters: to loue them as
our fathers: to eſtéeme of them as the builders vp of
Gods Church: and to make accompt of them as the moſt
principall pillers of Gods Temple. Thus much doeth
godlineſſe deſire: and their trauels deſerue no leſſe.</p>
            <p>We muſt not therefore giue them anie place, whoſe
practiſe it is to deuiſe ſlauders, reproches, and foule ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
thereby doing what they can, to put out ſo great
lights of the Church: who, if they ſéems to haue done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe
in anie thing, let vs make the beſt of it, for Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
charitie, and méekneſſe ſake. It is a true ſaieng of
<hi>Xenophon:</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
Which ſound thus béeing
expounded: <hi>It is a hard matter for men ſo to do a thing,


<pb facs="tcp:2871:6"/>
that it be amiſſe in no point: and it is hard for them alſo
that do a thing in no reſpect blame-worthy, not to light
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome quareling findfault.</hi> For the weaknes of men
is great, and manie eſcapes are made in a mans life,
which are rather friendlie &amp; fauourablie to be couered,
than maliciouſlie and enuiouſlie to be made worſe.</p>
            <p>There is alſo in manie a great lightneſſe, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
men to be ſharper iudges againſt others, that haue
not offended at all. As for our weakneſſe, let vs lament
it: and as for our lightneſſe, (which is the cauſe that
they are euill thought of, whoſe labours are greater, and
their gifts excellenter,) let vs leaue it: giuing God
thankes, who ſendeth into his Church, for the edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>And although verie great thankes (as méete is) are
due to them, which haue found out &amp; made redie the firſt
waie: yet notwithſtanding, others that haue followed
after in their place, and trie all the maſteries they maie,
for the edification or building vp of the Church, and the
knitting together of the Saints, are not to bée ſette at
naught: but euerie one in his place is to be had in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt.<note place="margin">Acts. 18. 3 &amp; 20. 34</note>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat we may the more fully perceiue and
vnderſtand the argument of this moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Epiſtle, written to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> out
of the priſon at <hi>Rome:</hi> wée muſt make
declaration of thoſe foure points, which I
am wont to touch in the beginning of
mine expoſitions vpon the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The foure pointes are theſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Who was the Author of this Epiſtle. For to
knowe this, maketh very much for the winning of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe,
and authoritie to this Epiſtle.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What was the occaſion why the ſame was
written. For the marking héereof, maketh very much,
both to vnderſtand the perfect diſcourſe of the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and alſo to declare the order of the queſtions.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, What is the ſtate or principall queſtion,
whereby the kinde of the cauſe is knowne: &amp; the ende or
ſcope of him which ſpeaketh is vnderſtoode.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, What is the order of handling: which being
not vnderſtoode, the weight &amp; importaunce of things can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be obſerued. To conclude, it often times falleth out,
that the methode or manner of ſpeaking béeing not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
circumſtances contrarie &amp; beſide the meaning of the
writer, are heaped vp together, and many things are wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
of heretikes, for the confirmation of their wicked &amp;
erronious opinions: as is to be ſene in their writings, who
in iudging, vſe not the rule of Logicke: but handle all
and euery ſeuerall part or parcell, as it were members
plucked off from the bodie.</p>
            <p>Of theſe foure points therfore we will orderly intreat,
to the intent that we may the more eaſily attaine to the

vnderſtanding of this diuine Epiſtle.</p>
            <div n="1" type="point">

               <p>THe Authour of this Epiſtle is the Apoſtle <hi>Paule,</hi> that
great Doctor or teacher of the Gentiles: who, as he
was called to the office and miniſterie of an Apoſtle, by
the reuelation of Ieſus Chriſt, ſo was he inſtructed and
taught the myſterie of ſaluation, by the ſame Ieſus
Chriſt. This Apoſtle, like a valiaunt ſouldier of Chriſt,
being adorned and deckt with ſouldierlike enſignes and
armes of the field, to wit, with ſundry ſorts of tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and perſecutions,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11. 23. 24. 25. 26. 27. 28.</note> with whippings, ſtonings, buffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
reuilings, &amp;c. by the ſpace of fiue and thirtie yeres

                  <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi>
drawing to an end of his life. Forſomuch therefore
as the Authour of this Epiſtle, is a man of ſuch accompt,
it is not lawfull to call in doubt, either the weightineſſe
of the matter, or the authoritie of the writer. Wherfore,
whatſoeuer things are deliuered vnto vs in this Epiſtle,
we ought no leſſe to reuerence and conſider, than the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
things themſelues, which God by his owne mouth
hath vttered and ſpoken from Heauen. And therefore,
as the doctrine conteined in this Epiſtle, is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>:
that is to ſay, by inſpiration from God: ſo hath it
verie great weight &amp; force to confirme the articles of our
religion, and to confute errours, and that in ſuch ſort, as
that no man, vnleſſe he be altogether godleſſe, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
or ſworne enimie to Chriſt, will ſet himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the worthineſſe and authoritie of this moſt holie
Epiſtle. Many more things, touching this our Apoſtle,
may be read in the Actes of the Apoſtles, &amp; in his owne
Epiſtles to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and others.</p>

               <p>AN offence taken at the croſſe, miniſtred an occaſion
to the Apoſtle, of writing this Epiſtle. For at ſuch

time as <hi>Paule,</hi> hauing finiſhed his courſe of preaching,
was caſt into priſon at <hi>Rome,</hi> and that the godlie eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
where were afflicted, not onely by Tyrants, but alſo
of falſe Apoſtles: he thought it a part of his charge and
calling, to confirme the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> by writing to them,
whom bicauſe of his abſence, he could not teach: leaſt
that, either for his owne croſſe, or for the perſecutions of
the Church, which at that time were excéeding great, they
ſhould fall from that grace, wherof they were made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
by the preaching of the Goſpell. As therefore the
offence of the croſſe, moued this moſt holie Apoſtle of
Chriſt to write: ſo the ende of his writing was, to arme
the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that they might inuincibly ſtand, &amp; perſiſt
in that doctrine of Chriſt, which they had learned of him.</p>

                  </gap>, that is to ſay, Doctrine and Exhortation:
wherof doctrine is by nature the firſt, &amp; exhortation the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
by order. For this is the perpetual order of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of
the Prophets, of Chriſt, of the Apoſtles, and of all ſuch as
teach aright: that vpon doctrine, which they deliuer in the
firſt place, they frame &amp; bring in their admonitions, their
exhortations, their comminations or threatenings, their
reprehenſions or rebukings, their conſolations, &amp;c. For ſo
doe they applie their doctrine to the hearers. And ſurely,
a ſmall matter it is to teach well, except therwithall thou
ſtirre vp the ſlouthfull with certeine pricks, except thou
refreſh and comfort the fearefull, except thou rebuke and
chide the ſtubburne and wilfull, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the former part, which is called <gap reason="foreign">

not vpon diſputation or reaſoning: but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is
to ſay, conſiſts in expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For it conteineth an expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the myſterie of our ſaluation, &amp; that firſt in generall,
towardes all the elect or choſen, declaring, that it is not a
new myſterie of ſaluation, but in ſuch ſort ordeined and
eſtabliſhed, before the creation of the world, by the méere
goodneſſe of our heauenly Father, that he would ſaue all
beléeuers, in his beloued ſonne. Then he diuideth the
generalitie, &amp; applieth the ſame to the ſpecialties: ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That the benefit of reconciliation or attonement, doth
indifferently belong to the <hi>Iewes</hi> and to the Gentiles,
among whom were the <hi>Epheſians.</hi> And as Rhetoricians
teach, what is to be obſerued in the expoſition of things,


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2871:19"/>
ſo he beateth in more déeply the cauſes &amp; the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
For he ſetteth downe moſt diligently, the cauſes ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
materiall, formall and finall of this myſterie, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a repetition of the ſelfe ſame things yet againe, both
that a deſire of this ſo great a myſterie, might be kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the more in the mindes of the <hi>Epheſians:</hi> &amp; alſo that
they might not (for any cauſes whatſoeuer) fall from ſo
great grace. Héerevpon alſo it ariſeth, that he ſaith, he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
God thankes, for that he hath vouchſafed to reueale
his myſterie of the ſaluation of mankinde, to the <hi>Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi>
&amp; that he witneſſeth likewiſe, that he praide vnto God
for the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that they might profit daily more and
more, in the knowledge of this myſterie.</p>
               <p>Now, that he might perſuade the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
fréely giuen, doth alſo pertaine to them, he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
how he himſelfe was called and taught, by the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Ieſus Chriſt, to preach the Goſpell or glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of ſaluation freely giuen, not to the <hi>Iewes</hi> onely but
to the Gentiles alſo, the difference betwéene the <hi>Iewes</hi> and
the Gentiles being taken away by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Chriſt:
ſo that ſaluation fréely giuen, is indifferently, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

béeing the inſtrument whereby it is receiued.</p>
               <p>Hitherto haue we touched the former part of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle,

according to his vſuall manner.</p>
               <p>Héere let the Readers diligently marke, how fitly
all things are applied to the ſcope and ende of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
If grace be powred out ſo plentifully vpon all
men: if the myſterie of ſaluation decréed, and purpoſed
before the creation of the world, be preached: if in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued
ſonne he loueth the beléeuers: if he ſeale ſaluation &amp;
grace by his ſpirit: if he ſende Apoſtles and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours
with grace of this myſterie: if it bée a gift and
benefit fréely giuen: if by the preaching of this benefit the
praiſe and glorie of God is teſtified: to be ſhort, if the


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2871:20"/>
holineſſe and ſaluation of men be ſought: what man or
woman, vnleſſe they be wodde &amp; witleſſe, contemners and
deſpiſers of their owne ſaluation, but will confeſſe that it
is meruellous neceſſarie to ſtand ſledfaſtly in this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
&amp; with a valiant &amp; inuincible minde and courage,
to ſuffer rather any torments, than to fall from ſo great
grace and ſaluation.</p>
               <p>The latter part which ſtandeth vpon exhortation,
is diuerſe &amp; manifolde. For in this the Apoſtle exhorteth
firſt of all to the vnitie of ſpirit in loue &amp; charitie: then he
goeth to common dueties, as it were to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpecialties of the
generalitie. Then, by reaſons repugnant &amp; contrarie to
our vocation or calling, he weaneth and withdraweth
vs from viceſ, and declareth (by compariſon) what
the godly ought to do. Heerevnto he addeth precepts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
domeſticall diſcipline, or houſehold gouernment.
For he inioineth huſbands &amp; wiues, parents &amp; children,
maiſters and ſeruaunts, <gap reason="foreign">

proportionable duties one towards and other: all which he
draweth out of the fountaine of faith &amp; loue, applieng to
each ſeuerally that which to them is conuenient. After
this he maketh vp the panoplie or warlike furniture of
Chriſtian ſouldiers, and therwithall he armeth the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi>
againſt Sathan the enimie of mans ſaluation: vnto

whom he ſent vnto them with this Epiſtle, of whom (as
he certifieth them) they might know his eſtate: &amp; ſo at the
length, with a well wiſhing vnto them, according to his
cuſtome, he maketh en ende. Let this be ſufficient to be
ſpoken of the order and method of handling this Epiſtle.
Now, in the explication or expounding of euery ſeuerall
Chapter. I will (after my manner) kéepe this order. Firſt,

we may gather firſt of all, what accompt is to be made of
the doctrine of the Apoſtle, who was made an Apoſtle
of Ieſus Chriſt, by the will of God. Secondly, we may
learne heereby in generall, not onely what the authoritie
of Miniſters is, which bring <hi>Paules</hi> doctrine: but alſo
what manner confeſſion of their function and calling is
required. Wée muſt conclude vpon both, that we muſt
not giue place to aſſemblies of men ſitting in councell,
or to the authoritie of any man or men, if they commaund
or bring in any thing contrarie or againſt this doctrine
of the Apoſtle. For it is not méete that the authoritie and
vioce of God ſhould giue place to the traditions, or
to the ſuperioritie of men or diuels. To this agréeth that
ſaieng of Saint <hi>Paule</hi> to the <hi>Galathians. If an Angel

let him be accurſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond part of the inſcription or title, doth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
name them, vnto whome the Apoſtle writeth, to wit,
the <hi>Epheſians:</hi> but alſo adorneth and beautifieth them with
moſt excellent titles, whilſt it calleth them by the name
of <hi>Saintes</hi> and <hi>Faithfull.</hi> Which two names are ſo ioint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
linked together by nature, that of whome ſo euer the
one is ſpoken, the other alſo is moſt truely meant and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.
For they cannot be ſeparated either from other:
bicauſe, who ſo euer is faithfull is a Saint: and who
ſo euer is a Saint is faithfull. Whoſoeuer beléeueth
truly is holie: and againe, euery one that is holie doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue.</p>
                  <p>Now, we are made Saints, or holie by this meanes.

Chriſt. Whoſoeuer therefore is ſeparated from the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holineſſe
of the world, is purified by the bloud of Chriſt, &amp;
is ſlaine to be a liuely ſacrifice vnto God, through Ieſus
Chriſt, the ſame is a Saint &amp; holie in déede, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

                  <p>This place doth ſhew, as well what things are ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to a true faith: as alſo that the faithfull is reputed
a Saint or holie one before God, euen by the iudgement
of the holie Ghoſt. The wordes of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in this
place are excellent. <hi>Loe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Saint Paule calleth ſuch
men Saintes, as had wiues, children, and an houſeholde.</hi>
For afterwards followeth the proper termes whereby
he termeth them, to wit, <hi>Husbands, wiues, maiſters and

ſo often as grace is preached ſo often are the merits of

adopted, and made heires of euerlaſting life. Fourthly, he
ſheweth that this peculiar and excellent bleſſing is not to

begun firſt heere, but there ended and made perfect. Fiftly

                  <p>THis is a reaſon of that which the Apoſtle ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
For as in the laſt verſe he ſet downe a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
why we are bound by dutie, to extoll the goodneſſe
of God: to wit, becauſe he hath moſt liberallie powred
his ſpirituall bleſſing vpon vs, whereby he hath bleſſed
vs in Chriſt: ſo héere is annered a reaſon of that reaſon,
by expoſition. Wherein, as he comprehendeth the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
and matter of that heauenlie grace or ſpirituall
bleſſing: ſo likewiſe he ſhutteth vp, as it were in a verie
briefe Aphoriſme, the time and laſt ende of the ſame: to
the intent that this myſterie might the more manifeſtlie
appeare before our eies.</p>
                  <p>The foundation of our ſpirituall bleſſing, or heauenlie
grace, or of our ſaluation, the Apoſtle maketh Gods eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
election, whereby he vouchſafed to chooſe ſuch as
ſhould beléeue in him, before the creation of the world.</p>
                  <p>The matter thereof is Chriſt. For in him onelie hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie
grace doth reſt: yea, our life &amp; ſaluation is in him.
Héere we muſt take verie great héede, that we ſeparate
not election from his proper matter. For we muſt not
dreame of anie election without Chriſt. God hath not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
vs ſimplie, but in Chriſt, that is to ſay, as members
of Chriſt, knit by faith vnto Chriſt our head. He ſaith that
this election in Chriſt, was therefore wrought before the
world was made: leaſt the <hi>Epheſians</hi> ſhould thinke, that
this Goſpell or doctrine of obteining ſaluation by Chriſt,
was preached by <hi>Paule</hi> at happe hazard or aduentures,
as a doctrine but latelie hatcht: but that they might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
know, that it was the eternall counſell or purpoſe of
God, to giue ſaluation to all that beléeue in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The laſt ende of this heauenlie bleſſing is added, to
wit, (<hi>That we ſhould be holie, &amp; without blame before


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2871:24"/>
him in loue,</hi>) which is the fountaine of all other chriſtian
duties. This high and excellent calling therefore doeth
require holineſſe and innocencie of life, as the laſt end or
effect of ſpirituall bleſſing.</p>
                  <p>Thus far we haue ſhewed the meaning of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtle, now
let vs ſee what doctrine &amp; comfort is to be gotten therby.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore, where he ſaith, that (<hi>We are choſen in
Chriſt before the foundation of the world</hi>) we may ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon,
as vpon an vnmoueable principle, conclude theſe
ſpecialties: to wit, That our election is frée, that it is
without vs, that election is not to be ſought in the matter
of man, that election is firme &amp; ratified, that our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is founded in Chriſt alone, that all merits of men are
excluded, that they are called elect or choſen, which are in
Chriſt by faith: for the principle of our ſaluation ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
ſtedfaſt, <hi>He that beleeueth in the ſonne, ſhall not
periſh, but ſhall haue euerlaſting life.</hi> For by faith a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
is made fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eternal election, to glorification to come.</p>
                  <p>Some, out of this place doe reaſon in this manner, God
hath choſen ſome, in Chriſt, before the foundation of the
world, <hi>Ergo</hi> God ordeined the fall of man before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the world. For of them which fell, ſome are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
to life, and ſome are reſerued or kept to due condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
Now ſéeing it is neceſſarie, that men ſtood, before
their fall: it followeth, that God ordeined the creation of
man in righteouſneſſe, and holineſſe, from the which he
fell by ſinne. Therefore, the creation of man, his corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
his election, &amp; his reprobation are ordeined of God.</p>
                  <p>To this argument I aunſwere: That to ordeine and
bring to paſſe is one thing: to foreknow in eternall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
another. God ordeined the creation of man to his
owne Image or likeneſſe, that he ſhould be righteous and
holie: &amp; it was the fatherlie will of God, that his creature
ſhuld continue ſuch a one. He did foreknow y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> man ſhuld
fall after Sathan had deceiued him, yet notwithſtanding
he ordeined not his fall: yea rather, this his fall was


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2871:25"/>
contrarie to Gods ordinaunce, els had it not bene deadly
vnto man. But in ſo much as God foreknew mans diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe,
he ordeined a remedie, to wit, his election after his fal
in Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, the foreknowledge of God is not the cauſe of
mans fall: but contrariewiſe, his fall which was to come,
was the cauſe of Gods foreknowledge. For the thing
dependeth not vpon knowledge, but knowledge vpon the
thing. Againe, we haue to vnderſtand, that the election of
God is eternall, and before all time: ſo that therein, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of time, nothing is to be thought before or after. S.
<hi>Paule</hi> therefore when he ſaith (<hi>That God hath choſen vs
before the foundation of the world</hi>) ſpeaketh in reſpect of
vs, who are then in déede ſaid to bée elected, and choſen by
Gods eternall decrée, when we beleeue in Chriſt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
to liue in holineſſe and innocencie.</p>
                  <p>Héerevpon it followeth, that the blaſphemous ſpeaches
of ſuch are execrable &amp; accurſed which ſay: If I am elected
and choſen, why then mine iniquitie ſhall not condemne
mée, the counſell of God is vnchaungeable. If I be not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
and choſen, why then neither faith, nor deſire to liue
vertuouſly will doe me any good. The manner of election
which is conditionall, confuteth theſe kinde of ſpeaches.
We are choſen in Chriſt, <hi>Ergo</hi> we are choſen vpon this
condition, if we be in Chriſt: that is, if we ſhall beleeue
in Chriſt. Wherefore he that is condemned is condemned
through his owne default, bicauſe when he was fallen, he
refuſed to take hold of Gods right hand, whoſe wil it was
to lift him vp againe. This is proued by the ende of the
miniſterie of the word. For God ſent the Apoſtles, &amp; their
ſucceſſors alſo abroad to this end, <hi>That they ſhuld preach
the Goſpel, &amp; that they which beleeued ſhould haue life
euerlaſting.</hi> Our ſaluation therfore out of doubt is condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,<note place="margin">Col. 1. 13.</note>

ſame to our vſe, let vs lay it downe in points, and let vs
conſider and examine euerie particular member by it

ſay) to the proofe.</p>
                  <div type="points">
                     <head>Of this part, there are eight members,
which thus followe in order.</head>
                     <p>IN the firſt place he maketh mention, of the verie:
foundation or principall cauſe of our ſpirituall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
that is to ſay, of our ſaluation, namelie predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
wherby God had a foreknowledge of their ſaluation
(euen before the world was made) which ſhuld beléeue in
Ieſus Chriſt. For as our Lord Ieſus Chriſt alone, is the
matter of our election, ſo is he alſo of our predeſtination.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place he ſetteth downe the forme or
manner of predeſtination: to wit, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>: that is to
ſay, adoption: whereby we are adopted into the ſonnes,
which were before, through ſinne, the ſonnes of wrath.
This predeſtinate adoption, is applied vnto vs by faith,
according to that ſaieng of the Apoſtle.<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>Poteſtatem dedit,
&amp;c. He hath giuen power to them that beleeue in him,
to be the ſonnes of God.</hi> Now, ſeeing God, by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the Goſpell, calleth (<hi>all men</hi>) vnto faith, there is
no doubt but Gods will is indéed, that (<hi>all men</hi>) ſhould be
ſaued. For, farre be it from the mindes of the godlie, to
haue ſuch a thought: namelie, that the heart of him which
hath mercie differeth from the voice of him which calleth.</p>
                     <p>In the third place, becauſe it is come to paſſe through
the ſinne of our firſt parents, and by our owne default,
that we are eſtraunged from God and put backe a farre
off from Gods houſhold, the Apoſtle ſheweth a meane,
whereby we are ioined to God againe, receiued into his


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2871:27"/>
houſholde, and adopted for his ſonnes. This remedie or
meane is Ieſus Chriſt, the onelie Mediatour of God

that is to ſay, the bountifull, liberall, and

                     <p>In the fift place, the laſt ende of our adoption is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
which is thriſe repeated in this Chapter: to wit,
<hi>That the glorie of his grace might be praiſed.</hi> For as
our adoption is from God, ſo muſt the ſame be referred
to God, that his goodneſſe might be praiſed and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
through Ieſus Chriſt. This end is not to be ſeparated

God in our minde, in our heart, in our voice, in our

good works of Chriſtians, are not onely not neceſſarie,
but alſo hurtfull vnto men.</p>
                     <p>In the fift place, he declareth from whence, and out
of what fountaine that fatherlie good will and grace of
God towards vs doth flow, when he ſaith: (<hi>Wherewith
he hath made vs accepted in his beloued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>) This beloued
Ieſus Chriſt, is that fountaine, out of which that excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
great grace of God towards vs doth iſſue: where vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that falleth out iump which we noted before, that none
ſhall be partaker of this grace, but they which lay hands
vpon this beloued ſonne of God by faith.</p>
                     <p>In the ſeuenth place, ſome thing is ſaid of redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
to wit, That the beloued ſonne of God hath redée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
vs by his bloud, and waſhed away our ſinnes, that
how many of vs ſo euer reſt vpon him with a ſtedfaſt
faith, might appeare iuſt and righteous in the ſight of
God.</p>
                     <p>In the eight place, the principall cauſe of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
wrought by Ieſus Chriſt, is touched, where it is
ſaid, (<hi>According to the riches of his grace:</hi>) that is to ſay,
according to the euerlaſting &amp; vnſpeakable grace of God,
whereby he would that his beloued ſonne ſhould be made
a cleanſing ſacrifice for the ſinnes of men: that the iuſtice
of God, by that meanes might be ſatiſfied, and that place
might be left for his mercie. (<hi>The riches of his grace</hi>)
doe ſignifie, (after the Hebrew phraſe) Gods vnmeaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
bottomleſſe, and euerlaſting grace (as I ſaid euen
now:) which manner of ſpeach the Apoſtle vſeth vpon
eſpeciall reaſon, and ſingular purpoſe. Let vs therefore
conſider, not onely of what great price the bloud of Chriſt
is in the ſight of God: but alſo, how great the abundance
of Gods grace is, flowing from the ſame: leaſt any ſhould
thinke, that this grace of God ſtretcheth it ſelfe but to a


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2871:28"/>
few: or that it is all ſpent long agoe, conſidering the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of ages paſt, and by that meanes, not to be ſufficient
for the cleanſing of our ſinnes, vpon whom the end of the
world is come.</p>
                     <p>See how richly ſtored this ſhort point is, with moſt
excellent and heauenlie things. Wherefore let the ſame
be diligently learned, &amp; each ſeueral word therof through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

heauen, and vvhich are in earth,
euen in Chriſt.</p>
                  </q>
                  <q>VVhich grace he hath ſhed
vpon vs abundantly in all wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and prudence, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
knowne vnto vs the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie
of his will, according to
his good pleaſure, which hee
purpoſed in himſelfe, to haue
it declared when the time
was full come to gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
all things in Chriſt,
both the things which are in
heauen, and alſo the things
which are in earth, euen in
him.</q>
                  <p>LET the trim order of <hi>Paules</hi> words be marked. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
he hath handled the cauſes of our bleſſing and
ſaluation wonderfully, both with weightie words and
matter. Now he commeth to the inſtrument, whereby
that ſpirituall grace is reuealed, offered, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
vnto vs: namely, to the verie miniſterie of the
worde, of which miniſterie he ſpeaketh, not after a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
manner, but déeplie and diuinelie, euen to this
ende, that he might kindle in vs a greater zeale of this
heauenly grace. The ſumme of this point, therefore
is this. That the Apoſtle teacheth, that the grace of God
which bringeth ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to all men, is plentifully powred
vpon vs by the Goſpell, according to the good pleaſure of


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:2871:28"/>
God, that at the length all might bée gathered againe in
Chriſt. Now let vs throughly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider the ſeuerall words.
In the firſt place y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtle vſeth this word (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>to abound</hi>) whereby thoſe riches of Gods grace are ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
wherof he ſpake before: that we might know, that the
grace of God is ſufficient to ſaue all men. For the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of grace is neuer drawn ſo drie, but euerie one may
fetch fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it to ſerue their turne, ſo they carrie faith with
them: neither can the ſins of men be ſo many &amp; ſo great,
but they may be ouerwhelmed &amp; drowned in the floud
flowing from this fountaine, ſo that men ſéeke to get into
<hi>Noes</hi> Arke, that is to ſay, into the houſhold of God, by the
faith of Chriſt. Let no man therfore deſpaire for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
&amp; multitude of his ſins, but whiles the time of grace
yet laſteth, let him earneſtly repent, &amp; flie vnto him for
ſuccour who crieth out, That he came into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world to ſaue
ſinners, &amp; to receiue the repentant into grace &amp; fauour.</p>
                  <p>He addeth the effect or fruit of the Goſpell in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers:
to wit, that thereby they are inſtructed (<hi>In all wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and vnderſtanding.</hi>) For ſo doth the old Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
and <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> tranſlate the words verie well. Now
theſe words are rightly diſcerned, if we referre wiſdome
(<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) to knowledge: and vnderſtanding (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>)
to practiſe. For theſe two things we muſt fetch from the
preaching of the Goſpell. Wiſedome therefore ſignifieth
the knowledge of the Goſpell, that is ſay, the knowledge
of God, and of all thoſe things which are néedfull to be
knowne for the obtaining of ſaluation. Vnderſtanding,
being the gouerneſſe of all our purpoſes and enterpriſes,
applieth that knowledge to the framing of our life, and
practiſing of that which is good: that we may abound, not
onely in knowledge, but alſo in iudgement, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſaith to the <hi>Philippians.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Philip. 1. 9.</note> Out of this effect or fruit of
the Goſpell, theſe ſpecialties following may be gathered.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, that the preaching of the Goſpell is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation
of Gods grace towards mankinde: &amp; alſo of his


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2871:29"/>
election, whereby he choſe vs in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, that the perfect wiſdome and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of Gods children is contained in the Goſpell, ſo much
as is ſufficient for the obtaining of ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>The third, which is concluded vpon the two former,
that it is lawfull for Gods children, to ſet light by and to
haue in contempt, without feare, all doctrines of men and
Angels contrarie to the Goſpell,<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 8.</note> yea, to count them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed,
according to that ſaieng, <hi>Let him bee accurſed
which preacheth anie other Goſpell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Furthermore, whereas the Apoſtle preſently addeth,
(<hi>And hath opened vnto vs the myſterie of his will, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his good pleaſure</hi>) he commendeth yet againe
the Goſpell vnto vs, in which commendation thrée things
are principally to be marked.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that he calleth the Goſpell, a myſterie: that is to
ſay, a ſecreat: wherevpon it followeth, that it is not the
wiſdome of mans reaſon, but of heauenlie grace. For if
the reaſon of man could reach vnto it, <hi>Paule</hi> would not
haue called it a myſterie. A reaſon why he calleth it by
ſuch a name,<note place="margin">Rom. 16 25. 26.</note> is expreſſed in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
in theſe words: <hi>Iuxta Euangelium, &amp;c. According to
my Goſpell, and preaching of Ieſus Chriſt, by the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the myſterie, which was kept ſecreat ſince the
world began: But now is opened and publiſhed among
all nations, by the Scriptures of the Prophets, at the
commaundement of the euerlaſting God, for the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, that the Goſpell is the myſterie of Gods
will, according to his good pleaſure? But what is that
will of good pleaſure in God? That all nations might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue,
and obey the Goſpell. For ſo we taught euen now
out of the Apoſtles words.</p>
                  <p>Now, in that the euent or ſucceſſe is not aunſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the will of Gods good pleaſure, the default is in
men, who (to their owne deſtruction) maliciouſly refuſe


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2871:29"/>
ſaluation fréely offered. Therefore, the preaching of grace
if thou looke to the purpoſe of God, and his good pleaſure,
is vniuerſall, and ſtretcheth vnto all. But if thou conſider
the euent or ſucceſſe, it ſéemeth to be particular, &amp; to reach
but to ſome, which (doubtleſſe) commeth to paſſe through
mans owne fault, not through the appointment of God
which created him,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 4.</note> &amp; gaue his ſonne to redéeme him. <hi>For
God in deede would haue all men ſaued, and come to the
knowledge of the truth:</hi> as we haue ſhewed before at
large, where we declared that our election was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditional.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that the Apoſtle maketh the good pleaſure of
God the Father, the cauſe of the reuelation of this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie,
as before he made it the cauſe of our election and
predeſtination. Whereby we are admoniſhed, that wée
muſt iudge of our election and predeſtination by our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:
which calling, ſéeing it is as well vniuerſall, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſaieng: <hi>Ite in vniuerſum, &amp;c. Go ye throughout
the whole world, and preach the Goſpell vnto euerie
creature,</hi> (whiles he nameth (<hi>euerie creature),</hi> he taketh
away the difference of people and perſons:) as alſo condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall,
namely, the condition of faith, according to that
ſaieng: <hi>Qui credident, &amp;c. He that beleeueth ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:</hi>
therefore ſhall election and predeſtination be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
conditionall, which are not to bée ſeparated from
Chriſt, who is the matter of them both.</p>
                  <p>Now followeth a double circumſtance of this good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of God, the firſt is, of the time of the reuelation of the
myſterie of the Goſpell: the ſecond iſ, of the ende of the
reuelation. For when he ſaith (<hi>In the diſpenſation of the
fulneſſe of the times</hi>) he ſignifieth, that the good pleaſure
of God was then reuealed, when the time was come,
which God had appointed with himſelfe. Now, this time,
as it was marked of the Patriarch <hi>Iacob</hi> with a ſpeciall
ſigne &amp; token: ſo was it noted of <hi>Daniel</hi> the Prophet with
a certaine bound &amp; limit.<note place="margin">Gen. 49. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> 
                     <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaith, <hi>Non auferetur, &amp;c.
The ſcepter ſhall not depart from Iudah, vntill Shilo


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:2871:30"/>
come:</hi> that is to ſay, The ſeed promiſed to our forefathers.
<hi>Daniel</hi> reckoneth thrée ſcore &amp; ten wéekes of the yeares
from the captiuitie of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 24</note> vntill the comming of
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Of this time ſpeaketh <hi>Paule,</hi> ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 4. 5</note>
                     <hi>Quando vent, &amp;c. When the fulneſſe of time was
come, God ſent foorth his ſonne made of a woman, and
made vnder the law, that he might redeeme them which
were vnder the lawe.</hi> The word (<hi>Diſpenſation</hi>) which
<hi>Paule</hi> vſeth in this place, is called in Gréeke <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
of which word there is a double vſe. For one while (and
that according to the Etymologie or right propertie of the
ſame) it ſignifieth a care or charge, &amp; good ordering of an
houſe and houſhold. An other while (but Metaphoricallie,
or by tranſlation,) it ſignifieth a diſpoſing and fit framing
of things which are to be done: or, a certaine kéeping of
order in handling of matters.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond circumſtance is of the ende of the reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Gods good pleaſure, which is (<hi>To gather together
in one, all things euen in Chriſt.</hi>) The Greeke word
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which Saint <hi>Paule</hi> vſeth, doth
ſignifie, to ioine together into one bodie as it were, things
ſet a ſunder and ſcattered, and to knit them to one head.
For the Subſtantiue <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, (from the which the
Verbe is deriued) is (as it were) a certain ſummarie, &amp; a
gathering together of ſundrie parts in one whole bodie.
The Apoſtle therefore meaneth, that creatures, which
were ſcattered, are gathered together in one, through Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, that béeing gathered together, they might bée
all vnder one head. The diuiſion following comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the whole Church. (<hi>Which are</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in heauen</hi>)
that is to ſay, the holie Angels, and beléeuers, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
this life, before the ſonne of God tooke fleſh of the
Virgin: (<hi>And which are in earth,</hi>) that is to ſaie, all
ſuch as doe beléeue, and ſhall beléeue in Chriſt, alreadie
reuealed and come into the world, ſhall be vnder one
head, as it were a bodie conſiſting of many and ſundrie


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2871:30"/>
members. Héere we are put in minde of faith, whereby
we are knit vnto Chriſt our head: and of loue, wherby we
are coupled in brotherhoode one with an other. This
brotherhood or fellowſhip, is commended vnto vs by the
Sacraments of the Church. Baptiſme beareth witneſſe
that we are baptiſed into one bodie. The ſupper of the
Lord, is a token of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Communion which we haue with
Chriſt: &amp; it is a certaine teſtimonial &amp; aſſured warrant of
ſpiritual fraternitie and felowſhip betwéene our ſelues.</p>

                  <p>THus farre the Apoſtle hath ſpoken of all the elected
and choſen in Chriſt generallie: now by diſtribution
he applieth the generalitie, vnto two ſpecialties: and firſt
he toucheth the <hi>Iewes,</hi> declaring that they are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of heauenlie grace. And he ſetteth downe in order
three cauſes of this heauenlie grace: to wit, the efficient,
the finall, and the inſtrumentall cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Hée ſheweth the efficient cauſe, when he ſaith, (<hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate
according to the purpoſe of him.</hi>) Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
this cauſe, read that which we haue noted before
alreadie.</p>
                  <p>He addeth the finall cauſe, (<hi>That we ſhould bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the praiſe of his glorie,</hi>) that is to ſaie, that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
might be praiſed for the greatneſſe of his grace and
mercie ſhewed vnto vs.</p>
                  <p>He ioineth héer vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inſtrument, when he ſaith, (<hi>That
we which firſt hoped or truſted in Chriſt.</hi>) For vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
name of hope, he doth in this place comprehend faith alſo.


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2871:31"/>
Now, whereas I expound that of faith, which is héere as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed
to hope, therein is no obscuritie or hardneſſe. For,
as faith is oftentimes taken for hope, ſo is hope taken for
faith, by reaſon of a mutuall conſequence, or following
one of an other. For that, which faith laieth hold vpon &amp;
poſſeſſeth preſently, that doth hope looke and waite for to
come héereafter. Theſe thrée cauſes of grace the Apoſtle
ſetteth downe in this place, which grace, (as before he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it Gods bleſſing, or his adoption:) ſo héere it may be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
by this word (<hi>Choſen</hi>) or choice: euen to this end,
that we may know it is Gods frée gift. For it goeth not
by lot that man is choſen, but it is the will of God which
offereth ſaluation fréely vnto all. Now, where he addeth,
(<hi>Which worketh all things after the counſell of his owne
will</hi>) he giueth vs a double doctrine, or leſſon to learne.
The firſt is, that God is not tied (according to the deſtinie
of the Stoikes) to ſecond cauſes, but at frée &amp; full libertie
to doe what hée liſt. For hee, which by his counſell can,
and by his power will do, is not compelled by any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of neceſſitie at all to doe this or that. For things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
vpon neceſſitie, are neither gouerned by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
nor diſpensed withall by will. The ſecond is, that
God worketh in his Church all things that are whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
and good: and nothing that is euill, or commeth of
ſinne: as ſome out of this place vnaduiſedly conclude, ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng:
He that ſaith all things, excludeth nothing. But their
reaſon is ouerthrown by the Apoſtles words. For if God
worketh all things by the counſell of his will: &amp; his will
be moſt holie, &amp; ſo good as nothing better, intending no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is euill in anie reſpect,<note place="margin">Pſal. 5, 4.</note> as the Pſalmist moſt
plainly pronounceth, <hi>Non volens, &amp;c. Thou art a God
which canſt not away with iniquitie:</hi> truly it cannot be
that God ſhuld be the author of ſin, or of anie euill procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of a fault. Laſtly, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> circumſtance of the place reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vniuerſal word (<hi>all things</hi>) to one certeine kinde of
action or déede. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> text hangeth thus together, (<hi>Which


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:2871:31"/>
worketh all things, that we ſhould be vnto the praiſe of
his glorie,</hi>) that is to ſay, he bringeth to paſſe, that we
both wil &amp; do thoſe things, which turne to the glorie and
praiſe of God. The Apoſtle therefore ſpeaketh manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
of the wholſome or healthful workings of God in his
Church. For he moueth our will, that we may will, and
our ſtrength, that we may not will in waſte.</p>

day of redemption: (<hi>Of the poſſeſſion purchaſed,</hi>) that
is to ſay, for vs, who by our redemption wrought in his
bloud, are put in poſſeſſion of the promiſed inheritance.</p>
                  <p>Hetherto we haue vntwiſted, as it were, and laid open
this preſent point, in his proper parts or members: in
the which our Apoſtle ſetteth out verie trimlie, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and order of our reſtitution or redemption. For he
beginneth at the preaching of the Goſpell, and teacheth
vs, that faith muſt be added therevnto: which being
done, the ſealing of the holie ſpirit is felt in the heart,
which is a certaine earneſt as it were of the promiſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.
The laſt end of all theſe, is the glorie of God,
of his mercie healing, and alſo ſauing all ſuch as beléeue.
For (saith Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi>) as it is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Phyſicians praiſe
and commendation, if he heale manie: ſo the praiſe of
Gods glorie is, when manie are wonne to beléeue with
vnfeigned faith. Finallie, we muſt marke, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
decketh the Goſpell of Chriſt with a double title.
For firſt, by the figure <hi>Antonomaſia,</hi> he calleth the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
(<hi>The word of truth:</hi>) which title is taken of the
matter conteined in the Goſpell. For the Goſpell doeth
conteine the euerlaſting truth of God, &amp; an vndeceiuable
teſtimonie of obteining ſaluation through Chriſt. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is, (<hi>The Goſpell of ſaluation,</hi>) which is taken of the
end of the Goſpell. For the Goſpell was ordeined and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
for our ſaluation. For, as the Law, whiles it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
righteouſneſſe, promiſeth ſaluation and life to them
which fulfill the ſame: &amp; contrariwiſe, threateneth dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
&amp; death to all the tranſgreſſours thereof: ſo the
Goſpell, becauſe we haue not the righteouſnes which the
Lawe requireth, ſheweth Chriſt vnto vs, who is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of
the Law to all them that beléeue. Thus y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righteouſnes &amp;
ſaluation, which we could not reach vnto in doing, we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
in beléeuing, whiles y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righteouſnes of Chriſt being
imputed vnto vs, &amp; our ſins waſhed away by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacrifice
of himſelf, we are made righteous, &amp; heires alſo of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2871:33"/>
Neither is this ſlightlie to be ouerſlipped, that as
before he made the glorie of God the end of our election,
of our predeſtination, and likewiſe of our calling: ſo héere
alſo, he maketh the ſame the ende of our ſanctification.
Wherevpon it followeth, that all glorie of ſaluation,
muſt be taken quite away from euerie creature, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
of man, and giuen to God alone by Ieſus Chriſt.
Wherefore, as in all things that are good, ſo héere chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

vpon theſe benefites wrought in himſelfe: namelie,
a mouing and ſtirring of him vp to giue God thankes,
who is the Authour and fountaine of ſo great good. It is
méete that this deede of the Apoſtle, ſhould be vnto vs a
rule well worthie the marking, throughout the whole
courſe of our life: that the remembraunce and calling to
accompt of Gods good gifts and benefits, might ſtirre vs
vp to thankeſgiuing. For he which thinketh vpon Gods
benefites, or heareth them rehearſed or named, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth
not foorth with an affection of heart into thankeſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
beſides that he is vnthankfull to God, and therfore

of things, not onelie the right of poſſeſſing, but alſo the


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2871:33"/>
lawfull vſing of them is required: ſo it is méete, that a

this place teacheth vs, that the profiting of men in
godlineſſe, is the méere benefit of God. For, whiles
<hi>Paule</hi> giueth God thankes, that the <hi>Epheſians</hi> profit in

that God is the Author of this good. For he, of his frée

that, he is forceable in working by his ſpirit, in the hearts
of the hearers of his word, both whiles they are preſent

they ſhould both beléeue and loue him. Moreouer, this

of the Goſpell, which the ſpirit reuealeth, when the

onelie that he might haue a common Father with vs, but
alſo a God: from whom the greateſt comfort of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
floweth. For thus doth faith conclude. The Father

benefits with Chriſt, our copartner. Therfore his will &amp;
pleaſure is to doe vs good: and he both knoweth and alſo
can giue vs thoſe things, that are healthfull to ſerue for
our ſaluation. But how hangeth this together? What?
Is not the ſonne equall to the Father? As (doubtleſſe) he
is conſubſtantiall, ſo is he coequall with the Father: <hi>But
the ſonne abaſed himſelfe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phi. 2. 7. 8.</note>

perſon, in reſpect of the vnitie of the perſon, bicauſe
Chriſt is both God &amp; man. Furthermore, God is called
(<hi>The Father of glorie:</hi>) firſt, bicauſe all things are full of
his glorie: ſecondlie, bicauſe all glorie belongeth to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone:
Laſtlie, bicauſe he is the Author &amp; fountaine of all
glorie. Now the cauſe why Saint <hi>Paule</hi> in this place
giueth God this title, is this. He praieth vnto God, that
it would pleaſe him to giue the <hi>Epheſians</hi> the ſpirit of
wiſedome, &amp;c. Which gift (doubtleſſe) both tendeth to the
glorie of God: and alſo bringeth to paſſe, that the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi>
are made partakers of heauenlie glorie. For it is a
common thing and much vſed in the ſcriptures, to giue
certeine titles vnto God, in conſideration of the matter
which is handeled. Wherevpon it followeth, that one

                  </p>
                  <p>Héerevnto we will adde a fuller definition for decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
ſake. The paſſion and death of our Lord Ieſus
Chriſt, God and man, is a propitiatorie ſacrifice, or ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of attonement, wherein the eternall ſon of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
God, béeing made man, offered himſelfe by the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
ſpirit vnto his father, that by this his oblation &amp; obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
he might both purge the ſinnes of the world, and
appeaſe the wrath of God, to the ende that all ſuch as
beléeue, might be ſanctified vnto life euerlaſting through


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2871:37"/>
him. As by this definition our vnderſtanding and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is rightly informed and taught concerning the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and death of Chriſt: ſo our faith muſt be ſtirred vp
and ſtedfaſtlie reſolued, that ſinne is ſo waſhed awaie by
the death of Chriſt, as that God doth remember it no
more. Moreouer wee muſt and ought, with continuall
thankfulnſſe, and innocencie of life, to aduaunce and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll
this great benefit.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond point of this firſt member is, of the
Lordes reſurrection, wherof wée will ſhew brieflie what
is to be thought faithfullie and godlie. Firſt of all we
muſt holde faſt the teſtimonies of his reſurrection, which
are of thrée ſortes, as commonlie I make them: touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe, the Catechiſme, and the hiſtorie of Chriſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
ſet foorth in the Goſpell, muſt bée looked vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and conſidered. The definition of the Lordes reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
muſt bée maintained: to wit, that the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Chriſt from the dead, is Chriſts victorie, and his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
ouer ſinne, death, hell, and ouer the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Sathan. For Chriſt by his reſurrection, fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the promiſe:<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>Semen mulieris, &amp;c. The ſeede of the
woman ſhall bruſe the Serpents head:</hi> that is to ſaie,
(as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Lords Apoſtle expoundeth it,)<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. 8</note> 
                     <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus
apparuit, &amp;c. Chriſt appeared that hee might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie
the workes of the diuell.</hi> Chriſt therefore riſing
againe, is conquerour ouer Sathan, which Sathan li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
conquered and cruſhed vnder the féete of Chriſt the
conquerour, that hée is no more able to drawe the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
that is to ſaie, the members of Chriſt, into death
and deſtruction, although he beare full ſwaie ouer the
reprobate and obſtinate: and vſeth manie and ſundrie
guilefull ſleights, to prouoke the faithfull to taſt the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
fruite, and ſo to be caſt againe out of the
Lordes Paradiſe: that is to ſaie, hée goeth about with
corrupt doctrine, and lewde manners, to infect and poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
the faithfull, that the holie Ghoſt might be driuen


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2871:38"/>
out of them, and ſo they, through the loſſe of faith, might
bée ſhut out of Gods houſholde, and ſo become caſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies.
In the third place the fruites of the Lords reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
muſt bée gathered, which the godlie alone enioie:
the firſt wherof is,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 17.</note> remiſſion of ſinnes. <hi>Si Chriſtus, &amp;c.
If Chriſt bee not riſen, ye are yet in your ſinnes.</hi> Héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
ſerueth that ſaieng of the Prophet <hi>Daniel:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 24</note> 
                     <hi>Aufe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur,
&amp;c. Wickedneſſe ſhall be finiſhed, ſinnes ſhall be
ſealed vp, and iniquitie reconciled.</hi> And although the
reconcilement of iniquitie, bée moſt properlie appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to Chriſts paſſion and death, as before is declared:
yet notwithſtanding, it is alſo verie well applied to his
reſurrection, bicauſe this is the accompliſhment of all
Chriſts benefits. The ſecond is, our iuſtification: <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrexit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 25</note>
                     <hi>&amp;c. Chriſt is riſen againe for our iuſtification.</hi>
And <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Dan. 9. 24</note> 
                     <hi>Adducetur, &amp;c. Euerlaſting righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
ſhall be brought in.</hi> Doth not Saint <hi>Paule</hi>
likewiſe define the obedience of Chriſt to bée our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe?
Both are true. For whatſoeuer is giuen to one
action or déede of Chriſt, the ſame is rightlie giuen to
them all, by reaſon of the ordinarie appointment and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
common to all his works and actions. The third
is,<note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 7</note> the giuing of the ſpirit. <hi>Niſi, &amp;c. Except I goe my
waie, that comforter ſhall not come.</hi> And <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 15</note>
                     <hi>&amp;c. He hath ſent the ſpirit of his ſonne into your
hearts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>which crieth, Abba Pater, Abba Father.</hi> The
fourth is, the confirming of the couenant of grace, or an
aſſurance and certaine warrant of a good conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God. For ſo ſaith S. <hi>Peter, Habentes, &amp;c. Hauing
a good conſcience.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 16, &amp;. 21</note> And, <hi>In that a good conſcience ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
requeſt vnto God,</hi> The words at large lie in this
order, <hi>Cui reſpondens, &amp;c. To the which alſo the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
that now ſaueth vs (euen Baptiſme) agreeth: (not
the putting awaie of the filth of the fleſh, but in that
a good conſcience maketh requeſt vnto GOD) by the
reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> The fift is, the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2871:38"/>
of our ſelues, which is after two ſortes, to wit, of
our ſoules, and of our bodies. Of our ſoules, according
to that ſaieng of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Reſurrexit, &amp;c. Chriſt
was raiſed vp from the dead, by the glorie of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that wee alſo ſhould walke in newneſſe of life.</hi>
Of our bodies, according to the wordes of the Apoſtle,
<hi>Chriſtus reſurrexit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 20. 21. 22</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c. Chriſt is riſen from the dead,
and was made the firſt fruites of them that
ſlept. For ſince by man came death, by man came alſo
the reſurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die,
euen ſo in Chriſt all ſhall be made aliue.</hi> The ſixt is,
the bonde of mutuall fraternitie and brotherhoode.
For ſo the Lorde himſelfe riſing from the dead, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
to the women by, <hi>Aſcendo, &amp;c. I go vp to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and to your Father: my God, and your God.</hi> If
therefore wée all haue but one Father in common
to vs all, if wée all are brothers and ſiſters in Chriſt:
it is méete, that like brothers and ſiſters wée bée all of
one minde, and tender one an other with brotherlie
affection and loue. The ſeuenth is, a generall reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
againſt all calamities, againſt all woundes or ſores
of the ſoule, of the bodie, of our name and fame. Heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
ſerueth the ſaieng of the Apoſtle to <hi>Timothie,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 8.</note>
                     <hi>Memento, &amp;c. Remember that Ieſus Chriſt is riſen from
the dead:</hi> as if he ſhould haue ſaid, In this thy miniſterie
and office thou ſhalt féele manie diſtreſſes, thou ſhalt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
manie temptatious of the Diuell, and of men: but in
all theſe, take vnto thée for thy ſuccour &amp; ſaftie, this nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Treacle, namelie, the meditating of the Lordes
reſurrection: which as in the Lorde himſelfe it was the
victorie ouer all temptations and afflictions: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in vs it ſhall bée the ſame victorie, when we ſhall
be raiſed vp from the dead, by the power of Chriſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.
The eight is, a perfect hope, or aſſured per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion
of our glorious ſtate and immortalitie. Saint


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2871:39"/>
                     <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 3</note> 
                     <hi>Regenuit nos, &amp;c. Hee hath begotten vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
vnto a liuelie hope, by the reſurrection of Ieſus
Chriſt from the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third point of this firſt member is, of the power
whereby the Lord was raiſed from the dead.<note place="margin">Ioh. 10. 17.</note> Chriſt ſaith,
<hi>Poteſtatem habeo, &amp;c. I haue power to put away my life
from me, and to take it againe.</hi> Now, in this place, God
the Father is ſaid to haue raiſed him vp. In theſe words
there is no contrarietie of ſpeach. Chriſt in déed raiſed vp
himſelfe, as God, that is to ſaie, hée raiſed vp the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of his manhood, by the power of his Godhead: and
the Father raiſed him vp, as man. To bée ſhort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the eſſence or béeing of the Father, the Sonne, and
the holie Ghoſt is all one, and the ſelfe ſame, as touching
their diuinitie or Godhead, their works are vnſeparable.
Let theſe things ſuffice to be briefly ſpoken, concerning
the firſt member of this point: whereof in generall
there is a double vſe: to wit, that wée ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
and eſtabliſhed in the knowledge of Chriſts death
and reſurrection: and that we ſhould proue and trie in our
ſelues a liuelie and quicke féeling of the ſame. In which
ſenſe S. <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh to the <hi>Romanes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 4. 6, &amp;c.</note> where he aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
mortification &amp; viuification (or for the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of the words, the making of vs dead, &amp; the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of vs aliue) that is to ſaie, newneſſe of life, vnto the
Lords death and reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond member now followeth, wherof the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſpeaketh, ſaieng: (<hi>And hath ſet him at his right hand
in the heauenlie places.</hi>) This member conteineth two
Articles of our beliefe: the firſt is, The Lords aſcending
into Heauen: the ſecond is, his ſitting at the right hand
of God. For his aſcending thether went before his ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
there. Nowe, this aſcending of the Lord was
done viſible. For hée was carried vp into heauen in
a bodilie and naturall manner from the ſight of his
Diſciples. For ſo it is ſaide in the Actes, <hi>Cernenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2871:39"/>
ipſis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts. 1. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c. While they beheld, hee was taken vp:
for a clowde tooke him vp out of their ſight. And
from thence was he caried aboue al heauens, &amp; placed in
heauenlie places, at the right hand of God his Father:</hi>
as Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſheweth in this place, and in the fourth
Chapter following. The Article therefore of the Lords
aſcending, ought to be vnderſtood of Chriſts true and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
bodie, and of the naturall placing thereof in heauen,
leaſt we ſhould thinke, that Chriſts manhood was ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
vp of his Godhead, as <hi>Stenkfield</hi> dreamed: or that
it was extended &amp; ſpread throughout all places with his
Godhead, as the heretike <hi>Eutyches</hi> doted. For both their
opinions doth take away the truth of his humanitie or
manhood. The ſaieng therefore of Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> is to
be allowed, in theſe words: <hi>Aſcendit in coelis, &amp;c. He
aſcended into heauen, not where God the word was not
before: but where the word being made fleſh ſate not
before, to wit, in a bodilie place.</hi> The ſitting at the
right hand of God his Father, belongeth to the power of
ruling, wherein the ſonne being equall with his Father,
doth as it were part ſtakes, and poſſeſſeth equall rule and
regiment with him. For the right hand of the Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokeneth
a diuine power, maieſtie, and dominion. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to ſit at the right hand of the Father, is to be equall
with the Father in diuine power, maieſtie, and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And becauſe the Apoſtle maketh mention of (<hi>The
right hand of the Father in heauenlie places,</hi>) he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
giueth vs to note by the right hand of the Father,
the place of bleſſedneſſe, happineſſe, and euerlaſting
reſt and quietneſſe, promiſed to all faithfull belée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
which place the bodie of Chriſt alreadie poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth.</p>
                  <p>But this is not againſt the ſaieng of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Matth. 28. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>Ero vobiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,
&amp;c. I wil be with you euerie where, euen to the end
of the world:</hi> neither doth it take away the truth of the
Lords bodie and bloud in the holie Supper. For Chriſt


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2871:40"/>
is all whole, whereſoeuer it is his will to be. More of
this matter, and that verie learned and godlie, is to be
read in the Commentaries of <hi>Philip Melancthon</hi> vpon
the firſt Chapter to the <hi>Coloſsians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Furthermore the fruite of either article: namelie, of
the Lords aſcending, and of his ſitting at the right hand
of the Father, is declared at large in the fourth Chapter
folowing,<note place="margin">Pſa. 68. 18</note> where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtle expoundeth this ſaieng of the
Pſalmiſt, <hi>Aſcendit in altum, &amp;c. He aſcended vp on
high, he lead captiuitie captiue, &amp; gaue gifts vnto men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third member is an expoſition of the ſecond.
(<hi>Farre aboue all principalitie, &amp; power, and might, and
domination, and euerie name that is named, not in this
world onelie, but alſo in that which is to come.</hi>) For in
theſe words the Apoſtle ſheweth verie notablie, what
Chriſt, ſitting at the right hand of his Father in heauenlie
places, is. For, by theſe words, the Apoſtle meaneth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe, than to ſignifie Chriſts rule, which is noted to
be excéeding great, as the Article of his ſitting at his
Fathers right hand importeth: and that he hath no rule,

Now, whereas <hi>Dionyſius</hi> out of theſe words of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,
maketh I wot not what orders of Angels, it is
but weake. Neither is it to anie purpoſe to knowe, what
orders of Angels, and what degrées of dignities are in
Heauen: ſéeing that the word of God ſheweth no ſuch
thing vnto vs. Onelie let this be inough for vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
That Angels are miniſters: &amp; (as in the Epiſtle
to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> is declared, miniſtering ſpirits miniſters
of the Churches,<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 14.</note> of Commonwealths, &amp; of houſholds in
the world. Now, touching the words of Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> this
is worth the knowing, that he maketh difference verie

(<hi>Principalitie, Power, Might,</hi> and <hi>Domination.</hi>)</p>

that is, at no mans call or commaund, to giue a recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

whom he is compelled as a ſubiect to be obedient, &amp; to

his Father touching his Godhead: ſo hath he equall
rule with his Father. Héerehence let euerie faithfull

againſt all principalities of the world and of Hell: yea,
let him make full accompt, that it ſhall one day come to
paſſe, that whatſoeuer is alofte, ſhall be brought downe,
and made ſubiect, (will they, nill they,) to the rule of
Chriſt. Let no Chriſtian therefore, if he loue godlineſſe,

thus much, That Chriſt is far aboue all things, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
in this tranſitorie world now preſent, but in the

therefore or ſouereigntie of Chriſt, aboue all principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
power, might, and domination, is not temporall, but
eternall: for it ſtretcheth out euen to the world to come.
There is no cauſe therfore why the faithfull ſhould feare,

                  <p>The fift member conteineth the largeneſſe of his rule

                  <p>The ſixt member conteineth a certeine ſingular forme
or manner of Chriſts rule and regiment, whereby he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth
the Church of God. For the Apoſtle ſaith) (<hi>And
hath appointed him ouer all things, to be the head to
the Church.</hi>) Now whereas Chriſt is héere ſaid (<hi>To be
appointed of the Father the head to the Church,</hi>) this
doth neuer a whit leſſen or diminiſh the maieſtie of
Chriſt, whereby (according to his nature, as he is God,)
he hath rule ouer all things with his Father. For Chriſt
(as <hi>Gregorie</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> ſaith) is ſaid to take or receiue that
as man, which he hath naturallie as God.</p>
                  <p>By this tearme <hi>Head,</hi> is ſignified, both that ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſie
or ſouereigne rule of Chriſt, which he alone hath
ouer the Church: and alſo the glorie of the Church. For,
if Chriſt be the head, and the Church the bodie, then
(no doubt) great is the glorie of the Church. For,
where the head is, there is likewiſe the bodie. For there
is no middle place, whereby the head ſhould be ſeparated
from the bodie. Whoſoeuer therefore (beſides Ieſus
Chriſt alone) taketh vnto himſelfe this honour, and will
be counted, called, and knowne the head of the Church,
he is a right Antichriſt, and one which traiterouſlie ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
to robbe Chriſt of his honour. As for that which the
Popes mainteiners bring, who imagine that the Church
hath two heads: the one gouerning, as principall: the
other obeieng as vaſſall: it is nothing. For the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Church of God, though ſome haue this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée
of dignitie, or place of preeminence: other ſome
that, for the better ordering of the Church: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2871:42"/>
all are miniſters, neither is one the others head,
but fellowe ſeruants in the Lord. So Saint <hi>Paule</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
them which were miniſters vnder him, <hi>Fellowe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 1. 7. &amp; 4. 7. 9.</note>
                     <hi>fellowe ſouldiors, fellowe workers of God, &amp; bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren.</hi>
Furthermore, Chriſt is called (<hi>The head of the
Church,</hi>)<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 25.</note> foure waies. Firſt, in power and force. For
as the powers of man,<note place="margin">3. Ioh. 1. 2.</note> comming from the head, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueied
throughout the whole bodie, by the veines and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes:
ſo the faithfull, what force ſoeuer they haue,
they receiue it from Chriſt. For, in that the faithfull are
mortified in the fleſh, and quickened in the ſpirit, they
haue that by the power of Chriſts death and reſurrection,
who is their head. For the power and vertue of Chriſts
death kéepeth the fleſh vnder in the beléeuers: and by the
efficacie and force of Chriſts life, a new ſpirit is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in man: whereby it commeth to paſſe, that he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in newneſſe of life. Secondlie, Chriſt is called (<hi>The
head of the Church</hi>) in perfection. For he alone deſerueth
the praiſe of perfection in the Church. For all vertues in
him are moſt perfect, from whom certeine beames (as it
were from the Sunne) doe ſhine &amp; ſhoote vpon the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
Thirdlie, Chriſt is called (<hi>The head of the Church</hi>)
in merit. For he alone in the Church hath merits, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he merited and deſerued for vs the heauenlie inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritaunce.
Fourthlie, Chriſt is called (<hi>The head of the
Church</hi>) in dignitie, order and authoritie. For he alone is
the Monarch of the Church, and a Prince at no mans
controllment.</p>
                  <p>But leaſt anie ſhould thinke, that S. <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh,
of Chriſt onelie, as of the Prince of the Church, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
a ſeuenth member, and ſaith: (<hi>Of the Church, which
is his bodie.</hi>) Chriſt therfore is the head, &amp; the Church his
bodie, to whom all efficacie force, &amp; power floweth from
the head Heere we haue to marke a verie trimme defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Church, whereby it is defined to be (<hi>The bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
of Chriſt,</hi>) not naturall, but myſticall. Of this bodie


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2871:42"/>
there are two ſorts of members: to wit, dead and liuing.
They are dead members, who with the outward aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
of the Church, &amp; viſible congregation make confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their faith, but yet are void of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit of faith: ſuch
are Heretikes, Hypocrites, &amp; carnall Goſpellers. The li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
or liuelie members are they, which being indued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
a liuelie faith walke not after the fleſh, but after the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
whereby they are lead to be briefe, whoſoeuer do ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerelie
liue in Chriſtianitie, they are the liuelie members
of Chriſt As for the Turkes, vnbeléeuing Iewes, &amp; other
Heatheniſh hearted people, they all are to be reputed &amp;
thought neither liuelie nor dead members of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, when the Apoſtle ſaith, (<hi>Euen the fulnes of
him, that filleth all in all things,</hi>) he ſheweth why he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the Church (<hi>The bodie of Chriſt:</hi>) and therewithall
declareth, how great the loue of Chriſt is towards his
Church: which he calleth (<hi>The fulneſſe of himſelfe.</hi>) For,
ſuch is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue of Chriſt towards his Church, that althogh
he perfourme all healthfull things in all men: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
he thinketh himſelfe a head halt &amp; lame, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
he haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church as his bodie knit vnto him. Héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
it followeth, that Chriſt is oftentimes taken for the
whole Church together, ioined vnto hir head, as when it
is ſaid:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 12. &amp;. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Sicut enim vnum corpus, &amp;c. For as the bodie is
one, &amp; hath many members, &amp; all the members of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
which is one, though they be manie, yet are but one
body: euen ſo Chriſt.</hi> For by one ſpirit are we all baptiſed
into one bodie: that is, that we might be made one bodie
with Chriſt, that we might grow into one body of Chriſt,
that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole church might be nothing els but one Chriſt:
of which growing together, Baptiſme &amp; the Lords ſupper
are effectuall ſignes. Héerevnto ſerueth the ſaieng of the
Apoſtle, <hi>Abrahae dictae ſunt, &amp;c. To Abraham and his

                     <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>He ſaith not, And to the
ſeedes, as ſpeaking of manie: but, And to thy ſeede, as of
one, which is Chriſt.</hi> Héere the Apoſtle calleth Chriſt.


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:2871:43"/>
(<hi>The whole bodie gathered together in one,</hi>) whoſe
head and life Chriſt alone is: the members of whom are
the faithfull, being partlie Iewes, and partlie Gentiles.
This he concludeth in the ende of the Chapter more
plainlie in theſe words,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>Omnes vos, &amp;c. Ye are all one

To be with Chriſt, Chriſt to be in vs, To be lead by

&amp; iuſtified in Chriſt, To liue in Chriſt, To die with
Chriſt, To be crucified, buried, and riſe againe with
Chriſt.</hi> Héereto alſo ſerueth that which followeth in
the third Chapter following,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>That the Goſpell was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
and reuealed to the Gentiles, that they ſhould be
inheritours alſo, and of the ſame bodie, and partakers of
the promiſe in Chriſt.</hi> Héerevnto alſo perteineth the
words of Saint <hi>Paule</hi> to the <hi>Galathians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 20.</note> where he ſaith,
<hi>That he liueth in Chriſt, and Chriſt in him.</hi> And to this
alſo belongeth that ſpeach of Chriſt:<note place="margin">Actes. 9. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Saule, Saule, why
perſecuteſt thou me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, what haue the faithfull to gather héereby? Euen
to build their hope and comfort vpon this, that Chriſt
cannot periſh, of whom they are members by faith. Héer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
alſo haue the faithfull to ſuccour &amp; ſtrengthen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
in life, in death, and euerie daunger: bicauſe
they are aſſured that the time will come, when Chriſt
ſhalbe glorified with his whole bodie: howſoeuer his
members amidſt the hurlie burlies of this world be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned,
and ſpitefullie ouertroden. But to the end we
may knowe, that Chriſt of himſelfe néedeth not this ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
the Apoſtle addeth, (<hi>That filleth all, in all things.</hi>)
For indéed, if Chriſt filleth and perfourmeth all in all
things, then doubtles he ſtandeth not in need of anie mans
helpe hérein towards this fulneſſe: but ſo far forth as it
pleaſeth him, of his vnmeaſurable &amp; bottomles bountie,
to vouchſafe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church to be ioined vnto him, as if it were


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2871:43"/>
his bodie. This place likewiſe containeth a plentifull
teſtimonie touching Chriſts Godhead. For ſéeing it doth
properlie belong to the nature of God, (<hi>To fill all in all
things:</hi>) &amp; ſeing this abilitie is héere aſcribed vnto Chriſt,
<hi>That he filleth all in all things:</hi>) it followeth, that
Chriſt is true God, and in perſon infinite and eternall.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore well ſaid in the Church: <hi>Chriſt is all
in all euerie where, Chriſt filleth all in all, The ſonne of
the virgin is God.</hi> For theſe titles are right wel applied to
his perſon, in reſpect of the nature of his Godhead, not in
reſpect of the nature of his manhood, which hath his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
properties, the taking awaie wherof, is the taking
awaie of the truth of Chriſts manhood, &amp; the ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the hope of our reſurrection. Wherefore that ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng
of S. <hi>Paule</hi> to the <hi>Philippians</hi> is throughly to be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in memorie,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>Noſtra corpora, &amp;c. That our vile bodies
ſhall be changed, and faſhioned like vnto Chriſts glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
bodie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, if Chriſts manhood were turned into his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head

Chapter.</head>
               <p>THe beginning of this Chapter doth fitlie agrée with
the end of the Chapter going before. For the Apoſtle
héere applieth a generall doctrine to the Iewes and the
Gentiles: that is to ſaie, turneth ouer the generalitie,
to the ſpecialties. For, in this Chapter hée repeateth in
particular, that which in the former Chapter hée ſette
downe in generall: howbeit, in an other forme and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of ſpeach, for the more approuing of the matter, and
giuing of it greater force. Now he vſeth a compariſon of
the ſtate of man, which is of two ſortes: namelie, of the
former, to wit, before grace: and of the latter: that is, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
grace. Before grace, men were dead in their tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and ſins, vnder grace they were quickened &amp; made
aliue by Chriſt, through faith. This compariſon firſt of


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2871:54"/>
all, as in the propoſition, he applieth vnto them both: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
he turneth it both to the Iewes, and alſo to
the <hi>Epheſians:</hi> adding therevnto a certaine ſhort Aphoriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
wherein he laieth wide open the ſumme of ſaluation.
Then he applieth the ſame compariſon more at large to
the Gentiles, vnder the name of the <hi>Epheſians:</hi> declaring
how the Gentiles, who in times paſt were ſtraungers
from the Commonwelth of God, are made Citizens with
the Saints, and of Gods houſhold: all which is wrought
by the croſſe of Chriſt, the vertue and power whereof is
made knowne vnto men, by the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.
Laſtlie, he ioineth héerewithall a concluſion, with a
notable enlargement. All theſe things tend wholie héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto,
that the <hi>Epheſians</hi> might eſtéeme and thinke of the

In the ende of the former Chapter, the Apoſtle calleth
Chriſt, (<hi>The head of the Church:</hi>) and héere he placeth
the <hi>Epheſians</hi> vnder Chriſt the head, that they might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſedlie
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider, to how great dignitie &amp; glorie they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,

become more ſweet to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> he ſetteth downe a
compariſon of a double ſtate, common to the Iewes and
the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that is to ſaie, the Gentiles. The former
ſtate is of them both before their conuerſion: the latter af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their conuerſion. Before their conuerſion, S. <hi>Paule</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoucheth,
that they both were dead in treſpaſſes &amp; ſinnes.
After their conuerſion, hée ſaith, that they were diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from the guiltineſſe of their ſinnes, and were
quickened in Chriſt. By (<hi>Treſpaſſes</hi>) vnderſtand the
beginnings as it were of ſinnes: and by (<hi>Sinnes</hi>) the
cuſtome of ſinning. And that the <hi>Epheſians</hi> were dead
in treſpaſſes and ſinnes; before their conuerſion, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
by two reaſons. For, hée ſendeth them both to
experience or proofe, and alſo to the cauſe and Prince
of all euill and miſchiefe. Experience would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

man. From whence alſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> death, which we call the firſt

                  <p>Firſt, we learne héerehence, that men deſtitute of
Gods grace, can doe nothing elſe but ſinne, in euerie
thing that they take in hand. Secondlie, that Sathan
hath full ſwaie in the children of vnbeliefe: that is to
ſaie, in them which beléeue not the Goſpell. Thirdlie,
that the life and conuerſation of men, is a teſtimonie
and witneſſe, by what ſpirit they are lead, whether by
the ſpirit of God, or the ſpirit of the Diuell. Fourthlie,
that ſuch as beléeue in Chriſt, are ſet frée from the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie

out of theſe daungers, and remoueth vs into his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

                  <p>The firſt is the fleſh it ſelfe. Now this word (<hi>Fleſh</hi>)
is diuerſlie taken in the Scripture. For, ſometimes it
hath a proper, and ſometimes againe a figuratiue or
borrowed meaning. When it is properlie taken, it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
the fleſhie ſubſtance of liuing creatures: as when

                     <hi>Non omnis caro eadem, &amp;c.
All fleſh is not the ſame fleſh, but there is one fleſh of
men, and another fleſh of beaſts, and another of fiſhes,

                     <hi>&amp;c. An ende of all fleſh is come before me.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by the figure <hi>Metaphora:</hi> for as the fleſh doeth
properlie ſignifie, a thing ſenſible, which maie be fealt and
ſéene: ſo Metaphoricallie it ſignifieth the outward ſhewe
or appearaunce of things: as in that place, where it is
ſaid:<note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 15.</note>

by the figure <hi>Metalepſis:</hi> for, bicauſe the fleſh is
ſoft, it is otherwhiles taken for ſoft, and ſet againſt hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
as in that ſaieng of the Lord, <hi>Auferam, &amp;c. I will

                     <hi>&amp;c. That which is borne of the fleſh,
is fleſh.</hi> And in this ſenſe is the word (<hi>Fleſh</hi>) taken,
when we make it the firſt cauſe of ſinnes, reigning and
ruling among men. Againſt this is ſet, as it were
flat contrarie, the ſpirit of the new borne: that is
to ſaie, a motion or working, which the holie ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

                  <p>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:2871:57"/>
The ſecond cauſe of ſinnes ſwaieng in ſuch ſort, is
the luſt of the fleſh, whereby the fleſh, or originall ſinne
is made luſtie &amp; effectuall to bring foorth verie ill fruits.
The force of this luſt all men féele &amp; trie in themſelues.
Againſt this is ſet, as flat contrarie, the luſt of the ſpirit,
which hath place onelie in the godlie, and in ſuch as haue
chaunged their copie by repentaunce: and this is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
cauſe of godlie purpoſes and exerciſes in the good.</p>
                  <p>The third cauſe of treſpaſſes and ſinnes is the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
or (as Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith) <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: that is,
the minde: when the minde or vnderſtanding being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted,
&amp; raiſed vp of luſt, beginneth to talke and reaſon
with it ſelfe of thoſe things, wherevnto the luſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
and pricketh it. Againſt this is ſet (as flat contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie)
the vnderſtanding of the ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>The fourth cauſe of ſinnes and offenſes is, the will
of the fleſh, and thoughts of the ſame: as Saint <hi>Paule</hi>
ſaith. And although the will ſometimes replieth vpon
the reaſoning of the fleſh: yet notwithſtanding, in them
that are not new borne, it is violentlie caried away (yea
verie often) with the force of the fleſh: euen as a Pinniſſe
or ſmall Barke is with contrarie windes and weather,
though the mariners doe what they can for the ſafegard

                  </q>
                  <p>Againſt this will of the fleſh, and the thoughts of the
ſame, is ſet (as flat contrarie) the will of the ſpirit,
commanding things, which the fleſh can in no wiſe awaie
with: and this is the fourth cauſe of godlie purpoſes and
actions in the good.</p>

                  <p>THis is an amplification or enlargement, and an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titheſis</hi>
or oppoſition, whereby the common ſtate of
the Iewes and Gentiles vnder grace is declared. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the Apoſtle ſpake ſeuerallie of them both: now he
comprehendeth and putteth them both together, that he
might ſhew the equall condition and ſtate of them both.
The ſumme of the ſentence is this. As God made the
Iewes partakers of heauenlie glorie, euen thorough his
méere grace &amp; goodneſſe: ſo did he alſo the Gentiles. But
the Apoſtle, to the ende he might enlarge his ſpeach, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifieth
the ſame according to his manner, by the place of
cauſes and effects: rehearſing the ſelfe ſame things here,
which he ſpake in the firſt Chapter touching this myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
For in the firſt place he ſetteth downe the principall
ground, or chiefe cauſe of our reſtitution and recouerie: to
wit, the méere mercie of God, wherewith he loued vs in


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:2871:58"/>
Chriſt. After that, he maketh mention of the fruites of
this mercie, which is of thrée ſorts: namelie, of life, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
and of heauenlie grace in Chriſt. For the life
of Chriſt, his reſurrection, and his ſitting in heauenlie
places, is a certeine aſſurance, a pledge, and merit of our
life, our reſurrection, and heauenlie grace. For ſeeing we
are the members of Chriſt, we ſhall be partakers of the
ſame happineſſe and glorie with our head. And as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
maketh Chriſt the meane, by whom theſe ſo great
benefits are conueied vnto vs: ſo he maketh the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of Gods grace towards men, the end of theſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
giuen and beſtowed vpon vs. Neither is this a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
of Gods temporall goodneſſe, but an vnſpeakable
token and ſigne of his perpetuall goodneſſe. For, that
which Chriſt once did, that remaineth for euer, as an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
warrant of Gods goodneſſe towards vs. Now, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
that which is incloſed in a Parentheſis, (<hi>By grace
ye are ſaued,</hi>) it is indéed a verie ſhort ſaieng, howbeit the
ſame conteineth the whole ſumme and cauſe of all Gods

it ſelfe, is (<hi>Saluation:</hi>) the cauſe is (<hi>Grace:</hi>) that is, the
honour of God, which is grounded in Chriſt, and from
him conueied vnto vs, as from the head to the members.
Héere againe is commended vnto vs a generall doctrine
of the Church of God: to wit, that vnto God alone, for

To obteine the ſame by deſart of workes. This is auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
by S. <hi>Paule,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 6</note> ſaieng: <hi>Si ex gratia, &amp;c. If it be of grace,
it is no more of workes, or elſe were grace no more grace:
but if it be of workes, it is no more grace, or elſe were
worke no more worke.</hi> How often ſoeuer therefore our
ſaluation is ſaid to be either the gift of God, or to be of
grace, or to be obteined by faith, or to be ours without
works, all manner of merit in man, touching the worke
of our ſaluation, is tript and throwne vnder foote.</p>
                  <p>Now, why ſaluation is not of works, he ſheweth a reaſon

ſinne: the Apoſtle méeteth them in the mouth, and lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
againſt them, the verie next or néereſt end of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which he did beate vpon in the firſt Chapter: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
our ſanctification. (<hi>For we are his workmanſhip, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
in Chriſt Ieſus vnto good workes, that we ſhould
walke in them.</hi>) The word (<hi>For</hi>) is oftentimes ſo taken in
an obiection, that it ſéemeth to carrie a reaſon or cauſe
of a thing with it. But yet notwithſtanding, it doth not
render a reaſon or cauſe of the former ſpeach, but rather
giueth a priuie aunſwere to the aduerſaries obiection.
For when Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, that we haue ſaluation
without workes, one or other maie thus obiect and ſaie:
If we obtaine ſaluation without workes, then what néed
we doe good workes? The Apoſtle aunſwereth that it
followeth not. For we are created in Chriſt vnto (<hi>good
workes.</hi>) And thus the word (<hi>For</hi>) conteineth a reaſon to
reproue the replie of the aduerſaries: whoſe obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Apoſtle aunſwereth in this place. The obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the vſe of this word (<hi>For</hi>) is profitable, that we may
knowe and vnderſtand whereto the ſame ſerueth.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre touching the meaning of this Aphoriſme.
Now let vs to the ſpecialities of the ſame in due order.
The firſt, The frée goodneſſe of God is the onelie cauſe
of our ſaluation. The ſecond, By faith alone we are made
partakers of ſaluation freelie giuen. The third, Mans


<pb n="86" facs="tcp:2871:60"/>
workes are neither the cauſes, nor the merites, nor part
of our ſaluation. The fourth, Good workes are ioined
with faith, as a neceſſarie and vnſeparable accident. The
fift, All mans reioiſing or boaſting in the worke of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
is excluded. The ſixt, Regeneration or new birth
in Chriſt, is the cauſe of good works. Theſe ſixe ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are in the words of this ſhort péece of doctrine, which
containe the principall and chiefe grounds of Chriſtian
Religion, &amp; confute manie foule and groſſe errours. For,
firſt of all, they are confuted héere, which will haue ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to ſtand vpon faith and works together, as vpon the
parts thereof. But Saint <hi>Paule</hi> in this place doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtlie
exclude works, and ſetteth downe faith, not as a
part, or as a cauſe of ſaluation, but as an inſtrument only.</p>
                  <p>Secondlie, they are alſo confuted by this ſaieng of S.
<hi>Paule,</hi> who, whiles they graunt with vs, that men are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
by faith alone, exclude works, not onelie as cauſes
and merits, but alſo as neceſſarie conſequents: as though
good works were not neceſſarilie required in ſuch as are

which manner ſtandeth vpon circumſtances. Nowe the

of God in two circumſtances: firſt, in the ſigne: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
in grace. In the ſigne, bicauſe that, as the Gentiles
were vncircumciſed, in witneſſe of their vncleanneſſe: ſo
the Iewes had the circumciſion of promiſe. In grace, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that, as the Gentiles were (<hi>Without Chriſt,</hi>) who
is the onelie waie of ſaluation, (<hi>Out of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
of Iſrael,</hi>) that is to ſaie, not of Gods people,
(<hi>Straungers from the couenants of promiſe,</hi>) that is to

bound himſelfe to his people, (<hi>Without hope, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
God,</hi>) that is to ſaie, men liuing in the world, vtterlie
voide of Gods feare &amp; ſeruice: ſo the Iewes had all theſe
things of grace. For they had the promiſe of the Meſſias,
they were in the Commonweath of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they were
heires of the couenants of promiſe, they had the hope of
ſaluation, and they knewe God.</p>

To this he addeth an <hi>Antitheſis</hi> or oppoſition, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
that the Gentiles are now reconciled vnto God, by
the bloud of Chriſt, &amp; receiued into the Commonwealth

they ſhould ſlide backe from the Goſpell, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
with the wilie ſlights of Sathan and the world.
This is the ſumme of all. Nowe, to touch the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of the text particularlie, which néedeth both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding,
and aduiſe, we will thus procéede. Firſt, hée
willeth the <hi>Epheſians</hi> to (<hi>Remember.</hi>) And whie ſo? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
when men are aduaunced from a lowe degrée to a
higher, they quicklie &amp; eaſilie (God wot) forget their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

Apoſtles minde to humble the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> &amp; to admoniſh
them of conſtancie, of continuance, &amp; of thankeſgiuing:
that they might diſcharge themſelues by their duetiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

that of his frée goodneſſe and liberalitie.</p>
                  <p>Héerehence haue we alſo, which liue at this daie, to be
warned and well aduiſed, that becauſe God hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed,
of his méere goodneſſe, to call vs out of the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Poperie, into the cléere light of the Goſpell, that

béeing vnthankfull, which before he gaue vs of his

euill vnthankfulneſſe, when men vouchſafe not to giue

abhominable is that, whereby we ſhew our ſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull
vnto God, who would that his déere ſon ſhould

ſaith thus, (<hi>Gentiles in the fleſh, and called vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
of them which are called circumciſion in the
fleſh, made with hands,</hi>) he noteth two things: Firſt,
that the Iewes called the Gentiles, by the reprochfull
name of vncircumciſion: which Iewes indéed bragged
much more than they néeded, of that outward marke in
their ſkinne or fleſh. Of this bragging and boſting, there
is an example in <hi>Geneſis:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 34. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Non poſſumus, &amp;c. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi>

hath railed on the hoaſt of the liuing God.</hi> Againe, S.
<hi>Paule</hi> in this place maketh two ſorts of Iewes, and two
ſorts of Gentiles. For ſome of the Iewes were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
in the fleſh, and in the ſpirit: as <hi>Moſes, Aaron, Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue,
Phinees, Abraham, Iſaach, Iacob, Ioſeph, Dauid, Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,
Daniel, Simeon, Nathanael, &amp;c.</hi> to be ſhort, all that
receiued the outward circumciſion of the fleſh, with faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
of heart in the Meſſias promiſed. Some were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed
in the fleſh onlie: to wit, they which had the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
marke without the ſpirit, ſuch were manie: yea, the
moſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes, ſpeciallie at the time of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming:
the firſt are called (<hi>The children of promiſe:</hi>) the laſt,
(<hi>The children of the fleſh:</hi>) which names the Apoſtle
giueth to them both. In like manner <hi>Paule</hi> maketh two
ſorts of Gentiles. Some were Gentiles onelie in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſh,
hauing vncircumciſion, the badge of their Gentiliſme:
howbeit in ſpirit they were circumciſed: namelie, which


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:2871:62"/>
had the vncircumciſion of the fleſh, with a liuelie faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
in and vpon the frée promiſe of ſaluation. In the
number of theſe were <hi>Iob, Melchiſedech, Iethro,</hi> the thrée
<hi>Wiſemen,</hi> &amp; all, as manie as trulie beléeued in the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as.
Otherſome were Gentiles, both in the fleſh &amp; in the
ſpirit: namelie they, who by the outward badge in their
fleſh, declared y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vncircumciſion &amp; vncleanes of their hart.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, where he addeth, (<hi>Yee were without
Chriſt, ye were aliants from the Commonwealth of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
and ye were ſtrangers from the couenants of promiſe</hi>)
theſe words are ment, &amp; muſt be vnderſtood by compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
For the Gentiles, in reſpect of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> &amp;
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> certein time, are ſaid to be without Chriſt. Now, in ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng
(<hi>They were without Chriſt,</hi>) he meaneth that they
had not ſuch cléere knowledge of Chriſt as the Iews had.
(<hi>And aliants from the Commonwealth of Iſrael,</hi>) that
is to ſaie, (<hi>Straungers from the couenants of promiſe:</hi>) by
theſe words he noteth, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
diuided &amp; parted from the Gentiles, as one
houſhold is ſet aſunder from an other. For the Iewes
had their couenants, their ordinances, and ſeruice of God:
their promiſes, their kingdome, and their Prieſthood, &amp;c.
of which S. <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh to the <hi>Romans.</hi> Of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in like maner,<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 4.</note> the Pſalme maketh mention, ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng:<note place="margin">Pſal. 147. 19. 20.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>The words which folowe, (<hi>And had no hope, &amp; were
without God in the world,</hi>) are concluded vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words
which went before. For whoſoeuer is without Chriſt,
how is it poſſible he ſhould haue hope. Whoſoeuer is
without Chriſt, he indéed is without God: for all that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
not in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of Chriſt, haue not God. Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,<note place="margin">2. Iohn. 9.</note>

the doctrine of Chriſt, hee hath both the Father and
the Sonne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The compariſon which followeth, (<hi>Yee which once

doth ſignifie the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> which were before out of the
Church, but now, through grace, receiued and brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and reconciled vnto God by the bloud of
Ieſus Chriſt. All theſe things tend herevnto, as I haue
ſaid alreadie, that we remembring ſo great a benefit of

mindfull, that this our ſtate requireth new maners, and
a new life: to wit,<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 12. 13. 14.</note>

                  <p>IT is ſaid, that the Gentiles, which were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
out of Gods houſholde, are nowe taken in,
and made of the number, by Chriſts bloud. Nowe,
there is added a notable figure of Rhetorike, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:2871:63"/>
                     <hi>Expolitio,</hi> wherby that is expounded more at large,
which was ſaid before brieflie &amp; in ſum. For the maner
of reconciliation or attonement betweene both people: to
wit, Iewes and Gentiles, is declared. And to begin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
Chriſt is made the foundation of this reconciliation or
attonement, when it is ſaid thus of the Apoſtle, (<hi>Hee is
our peace,</hi>) that is to ſaie, He is the Author of the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
or attonement, whereby of two people: namelie,
Iewes &amp; Gentils, there is made one: that is, one Church,
which is the peculiar houſhold of God. After this is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the manner of reconciliation, firſt in a ſimilitude: then
in plaine and euident words.</p>
                  <p>The ſimilitude is this, (<hi>The ſtop of the partition wall</hi>)
that is to ſaie, the hedge put betwéene them is cut downe
and laid waſt. The ſimilitude muſt be expounded in this
ſort. As he that is minded of two houſholds to make but
one, pulleth downe the wall which was betwéene them,
and made them two ſundrie houſholds, whereby they are
now made but one: ſo God, minding to make one peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
one Church, or one houſhold of the Iewes &amp; the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
tooke awaie (<hi>The partition wall</hi>) which ſet them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder.
Now what this (<hi>Partition wall</hi>) betwéene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iews
and the Gentiles was, he ſheweth in theſe plaine words,
(<hi>The hatred, that is, the lawe of commandements which
ſtandeth in ordinances.</hi>) Here, by the figure <hi>Metonymia,</hi>
he calleth (<hi>Hatred</hi>) the cauſe of the ſeparation betwéene
the Iewes and the Gentiles, which cauſe he maketh to
be (<hi>The law of commandements which ſtandeth in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces.</hi>)
Now, when he maketh this cauſe to be the
lawe, he meaneth not the morall lawe, which is perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all:
but the ceremoniall lawe onelie, which was a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe
of things to come. And this is that which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſaith, (<hi>He hath taken awaye hatred, euen the
lawe of commandements, which ſtandeth in ordinaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>)
that is, in rites and ceremonies: (<hi>Through his
fleſh,</hi>) that is, by offering vp his fleſh a ſacrifice. A ſigne


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:2871:63"/>
or token of this abrogation or taking awaie of the lawe,
was the renting of the temple in ſunder,<note place="margin">Mat. 27. 5.</note> when the Lord
gaue vp the ghoſt vpon the altar of the croſſe. He addeth
alſo the end of this abrogation or aboliſhment,<note place="margin">Mark. 15. 38.</note> ſaieng: (<hi>To
make of twaine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke. 23. 45.</note> 
                     <hi>one new man in himſelfe.</hi>) By the figure
<hi>Metonymia,</hi> he caleth two nations of people, as it were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe
houſholds, by the name of (<hi>two men.</hi>) He calleth the
Church of God one man, which is as it were one houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold:
yea rather, one man, whoſe head is Chriſt: he calleth
this man, (<hi>the new man:</hi>) hauing an eie to the faſhion
&amp; cuſtome of the world, which vſeth to call them (<hi>new
men</hi>) that being but baſe borne, or comming but of meane
ſtocke and parentage, become noble and honourable. For
we being the ofſpring of <hi>Adam,</hi> our forlorne father, are
made (<hi>new men,</hi>) and adopted into the ſonnes of God,
whiles we faſten our faith vpon Chriſt: ſo that we are
no longer called the children of <hi>Adam,</hi> but the children
of God. He rehearſeth this ende yet more plainlie, ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng,
(<hi>That he might reconcile both vnto God in one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
by his croſſe,</hi>) that is: by the oblation which he
made vpon the croſſe. For vnder this word (<hi>Croſſe</hi>) is
meant the manner of making the oblation, whereby a
double reconciliation or attonement was made: the one,
of men with God: the other, of men with men: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
of the Iewes and Gentiles betwéene themſelues.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre concerning the meaning of Saint <hi>Paules</hi>
words, now let vs marke the ſpecialties, which this place
doth offer and affoord.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, that betwéene the Iewes and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils
there is no difference, in reſpect of the communion
and partaking of grace. Wherefore let none be proud,
becauſe he is a Iew: and let none deſpaire, becauſe he is
a Gentile. For one nation hath no more prerogatiue or
excellence than another,<note place="margin">Actes. 10. 34. 35.</note> before God. <hi>God is no regarder
of perſons: but in all people, he that feareth him is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
before him: and he that worketh righteouſneſſe


<pb n="94" facs="tcp:2871:64"/>
is eſteemed.</hi> Grace is common vnto all, and it is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to euerie one.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is, That the lawe of <hi>Moſes</hi> is abrogated
and put downe, (I meane for outward rites and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies:)
inſomuch, that none ſtands compellable to receiue
it: yea, whoſoeuer receiueth it, denieth Chriſt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth
the vertue of Chriſts croſſe.</p>
                  <p>The third is, That the death of Chriſt is the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
&amp; attonement of man with God: wherin we are
borne (<hi>new men</hi>) &amp; ingraffed into Chriſts bodie, as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the ſame. The fourth is, That without the croſſe
of Chriſt, we can, by no meanes, be at peace with God.</p>
                  <p>The fift is, That as in Chriſt we haue peace with
God: ſo it is méete, that in him alſo we labour to be at
peace and vnitie one with another: which (doubtleſſe) can
neuer be, vnleſſe we be lead by Chriſts ſpirit, and haue
faith in him. For by faith we are ingraffed into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
that all of vs, as manie as beléeue in Chriſt, maie be

what they haue gotten by grace. Indéede they were ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants

                  </p>
                  <p>Now, Ieſus Chriſt is called (<hi>The foundation,</hi>) both
becauſe the promiſe of ſaluation was made in him, and


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:2871:65"/>
alſo, becauſe Chriſt alone is the ſaluation of the Church,
vpon whom ſhe ſtaieth her ſelfe. For, without Chriſt, the
whole building of the Church ſhrinketh and falleth flat
to the ground: yea, without him, it cannot be ſo much as
once begun. He is alſo called (<hi>The foundation of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles

being built vpon that foundation obteined ſaluation: but
alſo, and that much more in reſpect of the Church. For,
the Apoſtles did build the Church vpon this foundation.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, when the Apoſtle addeth, (<hi>Ieſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

Beſide that which is ſaid, we haue to gather out of

                  <p>The firſt is, That of Iewes and Gentiles there is
one Church of Chriſt made and ioined together, as we
haue ſhewed alreadie.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is, That Chriſt alone is the foundation of
the Church.</p>
                  <p>The third is, That whoſoeuer is without Chriſt, he
alſo is without the Church.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is, That the doctrine of the Apoſtles and
Prophets alone, ought to haue authoritie in the Church
of God, and is the onelie badge and cogniſance of the true
Church.</p>
                  <p>The fift is, That Chriſt alone vpholdeth, kéepeth, and
mainteineth the Church.</p>
                  <p>The ſixt is, That the Church is not without miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,

exhortation. He ſaid that the <hi>Epheſians</hi> were built vpon
the foundation of the Apoſtles &amp; Prophets: now he appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
this to all the faithfull in generall. For, he ſaith, that
(<hi>The whole building,</hi>) that is, the whole Catholike
Church, and all the members thereof, being builded vpon
this one corner ſtone, (<hi>Groweth into an holie temple:</hi>)
that is to ſaie, that the whole building is made one holie

that is (<hi>coupled together</hi>) wherby is ment, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> building

that they hang one by an other verie orderly, as the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

of the ioints is done in this manner. Firſt, all the

they cleaue together among themſelues, one w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> another,
according to the meaſure of faith in euerie one of them,
and according to the diuerſitie of gifts, which God hath

knit together, &amp; wrought in one, that there is not a

whole Church, or the ſeuerall members thereof, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
(<hi>The holie temple of God,</hi>) let vs thus ſuppoſe
with our ſelues: Firſt, That the Church is Gods
building. Secondlie, That God dwelleth, in this temple,
which is appointed and ordeined for his glorie. Thirdlie,
That as it is a fowle and hainous offenſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to defile this

through their default it come to paſſe, that the Maiſter
builder caſt them out, and throwe them awaie, as rotten
and mooldering ſtones ſeruing to no good vſe. I would to
God this could ſinke into their hearts, which either with
their owne priuate lewd dealings blemiſh the Church: or
with their vnprofitable quarelings, cut in péeces the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
or agréement of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Heere the reaſon muſt be marked, why the whole
Church of God is called (<hi>One temple:</hi>) and why euerie

                  <p>THis is an amplification or enlargment by compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
wherein a reaſon is rendered, why the Goſpell
of the calling of the Gentiles is named (<hi>A Myſterie:</hi>) to
wit, bicauſe it was vnknown to the world, till ſuch time
as it was opened by heauenlie reuelation: that it was
not made manifeſt to all the Gentiles indifferentlie, one
with an other: that the knowledge of this myſterie was
not ſo euident to the olde Prophets, as it was to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.
For, although the olde Prophets propheſied
much of the calling of the Gentiles to the Goſpell: yet
notwithſtanding, the time and the manner thereof were
not ſo cléere to them, as to the Apoſtles, Nowe, what
kinde of myſterie this is of the Goſpell, which hee hath

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:2871:69"/>
myſterie of the Goſpell therfore is this, That the Iewes
and the Gentiles are made ioint-heires of the heauenlie
inheritaunce, that they all make one bodie in Chriſt, and
that the promiſe of grace, which is offered by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,

                  <p>THat which the Apoſtle had brieflie touched, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſeth

vpon euerie part of this amplification or enlargement,


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:2871:71"/>
and make the ſame ſerue to our vſe</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore when he ſaith, (<hi>Vnto me the leaſt of
all Saints, is this grace giuen,</hi>) he doth not abaſe his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
but acknowledgeth the condition of his own perſon:
and that for this purpoſe, that the greatneſſe of: Gods
grace towards him might the more excell. What learne
we by this? Euen to magnifie &amp; aduance our office, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto

                  <p>Secondlie, when the Apoſtle addeth, (<hi>That I ſhould
preach among the Gentiles the vnſearchable riches of
Chriſt,</hi>) hée ſheweth the ende of his Apoſtleſhippe. For
he ſaith, he was made an Apoſtle. Whie? Not that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this title hée ſhould boaſt in idlneſſe: but (<hi>That hee
ſhould preach the vnſearchable riches of Chriſt,</hi>)
which (as Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith) hée vouchſafed to
beſtowe vpon the Gentiles, a people paſt hope, that
without workes they might bée ſaued, euen through

                  <p>Nowe, he calleth them (<hi>Vnſearchable riches of

beyond the reach of reaſon: but alſo bicauſe they cannot
be found out at the full in this world: no, not of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
but a taſt onelie giuen vnto them, which is inough
for the hope of ſaluation. By this ſpeach therfore of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,
not onlie their arrogancie is rebuked, which thinke
that they haue in their heads, whatſoeuer is conteined in

Gods holie word: but there is alſo commended vnto vs
a ſingular and ſpeciall diligence, that we ſhould trauell

riches of Chriſt,</hi>) touching remiſſion of ſinnes
fréelie giuen: but either liue like idle and lazie lubbers:
or elſe bring a doctrine, which is at defiance and daggers
drawing with the Goſpell of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdlie, when this is added, (<hi>And to make cleare
vnto all men, what the fellowſhip of the myſterie is,</hi>)
the Apoſtle expoundeth the clauſe going before. For that
which he called euen now (<hi>That vnſearchable riches of
Chriſt,</hi>) he expoundeth now a certeine fellowſhip &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
of the benefits of Chriſt, which the Goſpell offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth:
to wit, That the Iewes and the Gentiles are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of the ſelfe ſame redemption in Chriſt. Herehence
let vs therefore learne, that all difference of people, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
eſtate, and degrée, is taken awaie: for the kingdome
of Chriſt meddeleth with no ſuch matter:<note place="margin">Ro. 10. 12</note> 
                     <hi>For one and
the ſame Chriſt is rich inough vnto all that call vpon
him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthlie, when it is thus ſaid, (<hi>Which from the
beginning of the world hath bene hidde in God, who
hath created all things by Ieſus Chriſt,</hi>) he cutteth off
their obiection, which deſpiſed the Goſpell, as a doctrine
but latelie hatcht: as manie alſo in the Apoſtles time
did. Héereby let vs take heart at graſſe againſt the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the Goſpell, which fowlie béelie vs; calling vs
brochers and builders of a certeine new and ſtraunge
doctrine. For, our cauſe is common with the holie Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
of God. Neither are theſe words added in waſte,


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:2871:72"/>
(<hi>Who hath created all things by Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>) For this
ſaieng is a teſtimonie and witneſſe of our new creation.
For it is méete and conuenient, that by him we ſhould
be newlie created, by whom we were firſt created. As
therefore God, in olde time, created the world by Ieſus
Chriſt: ſo is his good pleaſure, by the ſame Ieſus Chriſt,
to reſtore the world againe, and to create it anew. Out
of this place is likewiſe gathered, not onelie the eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and euerlaſtingneſſe of the ſonne: (For if God by his
ſonne created all things, then ſurelie the ſonne himſelfe
was not created, becauſe he was before euerie creature,
and therefore God:) but alſo a vnitie of two natures: to
wit, of the Godhead, and the Manhood: being ſuch a vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
that the properties of both, by reaſon of the vnitie of
the perſon, are communicated: and yet the properties vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confounded.
Therefore Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith héere verie
well, (<hi>That God made and created all things by Ieſus
Chriſt:</hi>) becauſe this Ieſus Chriſt is verie God.</p>
                  <p>And although it be rightlie ſaid, Ieſus the sonne of
Marie created all things: yet notwithſtanding, it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe
to ſaie, That the nature of Chriſts manhood crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all things. For the nature of Chriſts manhood is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
a creature, and not a creator. For the interchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of properties, whereby that which is proper to one,
is aſcribed and giuen to the other, for the communion of
them in the ſame perſon, is at no hand to be allowed or
graunted in names of nature, or (as the vſe is to ſpeake)
in the Abſtract: becauſe, neither thoſe things which
are proper to the Manhood, are to be aſcribed to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head:
as, To be created, To ſuffer, To be temporall,
To be limitted, &amp;c: neither are thoſe things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
onelie to the Godhead, in anie caſe to be attributed
to the Manhood: as, To be vncreated, Not to ſuffer, To
be eternall, To be vnlimitted, &amp;c: but in the Concrete
either naturall, or perſonall, either expreſſing one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

                  <p>Fiftlie, when he ſaith, (<hi>To the intent that now vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

the <hi>Epheſians</hi> in admiration and wondering at this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie.
For, why ſhould it not be wonderfull, that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
things are made of contrarie things? For, by death,
life was recouered: by weakneſſe, power was obteined:
by ſhame, glorie was gotten: to be ſhort, by death and
the curſſe, life and ſaluation was giuen to them that were
dead and damned. And héereof it commeth, that the

this is not ſo to be taken, as though the Angels profited
by the preaching of the Church: but becauſe in the

Church aſſembled and gathered out of Iewes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
they behold, as in a glaſſe, this wiſedome of God,

that we haue peace with God, by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.

                  <p>THe ſecond part of the Chapter now followeth, which
ſtandeth vpon exhortation. For the Apoſtle exhorteth
the <hi>Epheſians</hi> that they fall not from the Goſpell, becauſe
he being their Teacher is perſecuted &amp; troubled. Now,
this propoſition is brought in vpon the former matter,
in this ſort: Becauſe the myſterie is ſo excellent, which
God hath opened vnto you, concerning the obteining of
ſaluation fréelie giuen, by me, whom God hath called to
be your Apoſtle, I would not wiſh you to plaie the ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backes,
or to growe out of heart, for the afflictions
and croſſes ſake which I ſuffer, and am preſſed downe
withall.</p>
                  <p>To this propoſition he addeth two reaſons: the firſt,
from the cauſe efficient: the ſecond, from the end of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,
and the fruite of conſtancie. (<hi>For your ſakes,</hi>)
ſaith the Apoſtle, that is to ſaie: For this cauſe haue the
ſpitefull Iewes deliuered me vp priſoner into the hands
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> becauſe I haue preached the Goſpell vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

diſcharging my dutie and office, whereto God hath
appointed me.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards, in ſaieng: (<hi>Which is your glorie,</hi>) he
noteth, that the ende of his perſecution is not the ſhame
of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> but rather their glorie, ſithence they
maie ſee themſelues embracers of ſuch a doctrine: as for
the truth and excellencie whereof, their teacher is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feard
to ſuffer, euen extreame troubles. Wherefore, it is
meete, that they alſo be conſtant to mainteine this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
and valiant likewiſe againſt the ſharpe ſtormes of
afflictions. Hetherto we haue declared the Apoſtles mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
now let vs gather a fewe ſpecialties to ſerue our
owne vſe.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, The godlie, knowing the worthineſſe and
excellencie of the Goſpell, ſhall take héede, that they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
not themſelues to be pulled from the ſame, either
with ſmooth flatterings, and alluring meanes: or with
bitter threats, and ſharpe perſecutions.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, The godlie ſhall take héede, that they be
not deceiued with the iudgement and cuſtome of the
world. For, the world is woont to ſet light by thoſe things,
which men of authoritie make no accompt of. Againe,
which waie ſoeuer Fortune turneth her ſelfe, that waie
will the fauour and eſtimation of men be ſure to bend.
For preſent proſperitie, Oh: that is welcome to all.
This errour of the world being verie great, as it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
ſo it muſt be auoided of the godlie. For godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
muſt not be iudged by the outward appearaunce,
but the nature and qualitie of the thing is rather to be
looked into, and a deliueraunce patientlie to be waited vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
according to the vndeceiuable promiſe of God.</p>
                  <p>The third, Let the miniſters of the Goſpell learne (by
the example of Saint <hi>Paule</hi>) a godlie and holie careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
for their flocke, that it maie be kept and continued
in ſinceritie of doctrine. For, it is not inough to haue

wherein this is to be learned, and borne awaie, that the
croſſe of the godlie is not ſhamefull before God, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
glorious: and then chiefelie, when anie one ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
for the confeſſion of true doctrine. As Saint <hi>Peter</hi>
alſo teacheth, who ſaith, that to ſuffer for Chriſts ſake,
is the great glorie of Chriſtians. For the counſell and
purpoſe of God in this point is to be conſidered,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 13. 14. 15. &amp;c,</note> whoſe
pleaſure it is, to make them like to his ſonne in this
world, whom he determined with himſelfe long ſince to
glorifie with him.</p>
                  <p>The ſixt, Héerehence let the miniſters of the Goſpell
peculiarlie learne, not onelie when they are well, and
all things ſafe, ſtoutlie to doe their dutie, and to followe
their office manfullie: but alſo to ſhewe themſelues vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
hearted, &amp; noble Champions: yea euen then, when
the burthen of the Croſſe doth bow them, euen till they
bend vnder it. <hi>A ſmall matter for vs</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which are
in health, to giue good counſell to the ſicke:</hi> A ſmall
matter conſtantlie to teach the Goſpell, when all things
are in ſafetie, when there is no ſhewe of danger toward.
But this is the propertie of a right noble heart, in the
middeſt of afflictions, in the middeſt of the flaming fire,
(as Saint <hi>Paule</hi> and other Saints haue done,) couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſlie
to comfort ſuch as neuer yet taſted the Croſſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſharpe ſhowres and tempeſts of tribulations to

                  <p>THis is the third part of this Chapter, conteining a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie
or witneſſe-bearing of Saint <hi>Paules</hi> praier
for the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> which praier hath thrée circumſtaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
the firſt whereof is concerning God, whom Saint
<hi>Paule</hi> doth call vpon, who is the Father of our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond conteineth a reaſon why God alone
ſhould be called vpon: to wit, becauſe vpon him alone
all fatherlie rule &amp; gouernment doth depend, both in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
and alſo in earth. The word (<hi>Fatherhood</hi>) is héere
taken for fatherlie rule &amp; gouernment. Now, ſeing he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
is to be called vpon, in whoſe power the ordering of


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:2871:75"/>
all things is, it followeth, that the Father of our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt alone muſt be called vpon. But yet, this
ſpeach doth not exclude the Sonne and the holie Ghoſt:
becauſe there is one diuine eſſence or béeing, power,
and glorie of the Father, the Sonne, and the holie
Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>The third circumſtance conteineth a rehearſall of thoſe
things, which the Apoſtle wiſheth to the <hi>Epheſians:</hi> to
wit, that in the partaking and poſſeſſing of heauenlie
things, they might be verie rich and plentifull. But the
Apoſtle doth firſt make his rehearſall, and afterwards in
the end compriſeth all things in generall.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe in this point of doctrine, there is much
to be marked, I will laie it downe in partes, to the end,
that euerie thing maie the plainlier be conſidered, and
the more easilie applied to our vſe.</p>
                  <p>The firſt part therefore of Saint <hi>Paules</hi> praier is
contained in theſe words: (<hi>That he might graunt you,
according to the riches of his glorie, that yee maie bee
ſtrengthened by his ſpirit, in the inner man.</hi>) Héere S.
<hi>Paule</hi> wiſheth to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> ſpirituall ſtrength: and
he ſheweth the fountaine from whence euerie good thing
floweth vnto all creatures: to wit, (<hi>The riches of his
glorie,</hi>) that is to ſaie, the euerlaſting &amp; bottomleſſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of God. When we are praieng therefore, what muſt
wée doe? reckon vp our merits and deſeruings? No, but
boldlie truſting to Gods exceeding great goodneſſe &amp; cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie,
we muſt praie with faith in Chriſt. So praieth
<hi>Dauid,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 1.</note> ſaieng: <hi>Miſerere, &amp;c. Haue mercie vpon me, O
God, according to thy great mercie, &amp; according to the
multitude of thy mercies.</hi> He addeth the cauſe efficient,
or the working cauſe, which is inward: to wit, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
Ghoſt, wherby we are ſtrengthened: &amp; what maner of
ſtrength it is, which he wiſheth vnto them, he expreſſeth
in theſe words, ſaieng: (<hi>That your inner man may bee
ſtrong in the Lord.</hi>) Now, our inner man is our ſoule,


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:2871:76"/>
ſo farre forth as it is broken and trained vp in obedience
vnto God: ſuch a ſoule as mindeth inward things, and not
outward, eternall &amp; heauenlie things, not temporall and
earthlie things. The ſtudies and endeuours of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man are diuerſe from this. For he neglecting that
which is inward and heauenlie, is buiſie in outward,
temporall, and earthlie toies and traſh.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond circumſtance is declared in theſe words:
(<hi>That Chriſt maie dwell in your hearts by faith.</hi>) This
circumſtance ſheweth plainlie from whence the ſtrength
of Chriſtians doth come. For it defineth our ſtrength, to
be Chriſt himſelfe. But how? Euen by dwelling in vs.
How is this dwelling brought to paſſe? Euen by faith.
Where, or in what part of vs? Euen in our hearts. For
it is not inough to haue a kinde of knowledge of Chriſt,
it ſkils not what, or how: but the affection of the heart
muſt be preſent, which is a ſtedfaſt confidence in Chriſt,
with which confidence béeing armed, we cannot be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
but are able to withſtand hell gates, according to
that ſaieng of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Iohn. 5. 4</note> 
                     <hi>Haec eſt victoria, &amp;c. This is the
victorie which ouercommeth the world, euen your faith.</hi>
This place deſerueth chieflie to be marked. For it doth
not onelie teach, that Chriſt dwelleth by faith in them
that belieue: but it diſproueth the Papiſts, which define
faith to be a certaine knowledge and agréeing to the<note n="*" place="margin">The meaning of this place is before ſet dovvne.</note> ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
without confidence of heart.</p>
                  <p>The third circumſtance, (<hi>That ye maie be rooted
and grounded in loue,</hi>) teacheth vs what is the force of
faith, in reſpect of our neighbour. For, ſo ſoone as he had
made mention of faith, by and by hée ſetteth downe the
effect or fruite of the ſame: to wit, true and heartie loue
towardes our neighbour: which hée doth for a double
purpoſe: namelie, to ſhewe the true qualitie of faith: and
alſo to teach vs, in what thing the perfection of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
doth conſiſt. But what manner of loue doth faith
require? Forſooth, ſuch a loue as is rooted and grounded:


<pb n="119" facs="tcp:2871:76"/>
that is to ſaie, ſuch a loue as is ſound &amp; ſteddie, which is
not moued &amp; made to vaniſh like ſmoke, vpon euerie light
occaſion. Héerehence let vs learne, that how much more
we profit and doe good in the ſchoole of Chriſt: ſo much
more we growe and increaſe in the workes of loue, and
are, as it were rooted. For it cannot bée, that he ſhould
be voide of loue, which poſſeſſeth Chriſt truelie by faith.</p>
                  <p>The fourth circumſtance is, (<hi>That yee maie be able
to comprehend with all Saintes, what is the breadth, &amp;
length, and depth, and higth:</hi>) to wit, of the myſterie
of Gods grace, and Chriſts loue towards vs. For ſo the
Apoſtle expoundeth himſelfe, ſaieng: <hi>That ye maie know
the vnmeſurable loue of Chriſt towards you.</hi> For as the
mercie of God the Father paſſeth all his workes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the wordes of <hi>Dauid:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 145. 9</note> ſo the loue of God the
Sonne, is beyond all meaſure alſo. For, if thou beholdeſt
the breadth thereof, it cannot be compaſſed within anie
boundes: if thou conſidereſt the length thereof, it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
euen to all the ends of the world: if thou caſt thine
eies vpon the deapth thereof, it ſtoopeth downe, euen to
the vileſt and baſeſt things in the world: if thou looke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft
vpon the higth thereof, it is farre aboue the heauens.
This is the plaine and true meaning of this place: as
for the trifles and toies of the Lordes woodden croſſe,
and of the round globe or compaſſe of the whole worlde,
let vs leaue them, they are nothing: and therefore let
them goe.</p>
                  <p>This place miniſtreth a moſt fruitfull comfort againſt
all lets and impediments, which ſéeme to hinder our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.
For, if Chriſt loueth vs ſo déerelie, it cannot be,
(ſo that we abide in him by faith, euen to the end) that any
creture ſhould caſt a blocke betwéene vs &amp; our ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>The fift circumſtance, (<hi>That ye maie be filled with
all fullneſſe of GOD</hi>) comprehendeth in a ſumme,
whatſoeuer belongeth to that perfection and fulneſſe,
which GOD requireth of vs. Nowe, the fulneſſe


<pb n="120" facs="tcp:2871:77"/>
of God, is Chriſtian perfection, whereby we doe fullie,
that is to ſaie, without colourable diſſembling and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie,
ſubmit our ſelues vnto God. Such are all they,
which kéepe the faith, and a good conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Héerehence we learne, in what things Chriſtians muſt
chieflie finde themſelues occupied: namelie, in labouring
more and more to come by perfection. For there is none,
that hath profited and done ſo much good in the ſchoole of
Chriſt, but hath néede of increaſe. Héere therefore is their
vanitie and péeuiſhneſſe reproued, which hauing ſcarſlie
had anie ſmacke at all of things belonging to God; and
ſauouring of heauenlie wiſdome, thinke none ſo ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
as themſelues, not once minding to profit anie more,

                  <p>THis is the fourth part of this Chapter, conteining a
praiſing or glorifieng of Gods name, whereinto the
Apoſtle falleth, anon after he had made rehearſall of
Gods benefits. For, the whole benefit of our redemption
ſerueth héereto, that all glorie might be giuen to God.
Wherefore the Apoſtle (ſurelie verie well) hath ſhut vp
the firſt part of his Epiſtle with thankeſgiuing.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, bicauſe there are diuerſe circumſtances
of this place, let vs conſider and ſkanne them ſeuerallie.
The firſt is, a making mention of Gods (<hi>Power</hi>) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he is able to do all things whatſoeuer hée will: and


<pb n="121" facs="tcp:2871:77"/>
will performe all things whatſoeuer he hath promiſed.
This (<hi>Power</hi>) of God ſhould firſt of all eſtabliſh our hope
touching Gods promiſes, then it ſhould be ſette againſt
the Diuell, death, and hell: yea, againſt the ſubtile rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of the fleſh, whereby the faith of weaklings is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
ſhaken. Beſides theſe, it ſhould ſtirre vs vp to
the feare of God: for God by his (<hi>Power</hi>) can puniſh
the ſtubburne, and make them ſtoope. Laſtlie, it maie bée
laide in their waie, which erroniouſlie and blaſphemouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
robbe God of his glorie, and giue the ſame to Saintes
and Idols.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is a mention making of Gods liberalitie,
who beſtoweth vpon vs farre greater benefites, than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we can craue or conceiue. This ought not onelie to
pricke vs vnto thanksgiuing: but to kindle in vs a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and a feruenter faith.</p>
                  <p>The third, from whence the deſire and delight in vs
to praie doth procéed and come: namelie from hence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the (<hi>Power</hi>) of God is forceable in vs: which (<hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>)
doubtleſſe, is not of fleſh, or bloud, but of the ſpirit of
God, and of faith.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is a pointing out (as it were) of the
place, where true glorie maie be giuen to God, which is
the Church of the Saintes, or congregation of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
For the Church is a certaine Theatre in the
world, whereon God will haue his glorie ſhewed and
ſéene, according to that ſaieng of <hi>Dauid: Laus eius in
Eccleſia Sanctorum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 149. 1</note> 
                     <hi>His praiſe bee in the congregation
of Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fift is a declaring of the meane or waie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
glorie ought to be giuen unto God, (<hi>By Chriſt Ieſus,</hi>)
ſaith the Apoſtle. For none can giue praiſe and glorie to
God, vnleſſe they be in Chriſt by faith. Therefore ſaith
Saint <hi>Ambroſe, Per Chriſtum, &amp;c. Through Chriſt we
muſt giue God thanks, becauſe God giueth vs all things
through Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:2871:78"/>
The ſixt is the continuance and long laſting of the
praiſe and glorie which is to be giuen to God. (<hi>Through
out all generations,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>for euer, Amen.</hi>)
This euerlaſting praiſe and glorie of God, putteth vs
in minde of two things. The firſt is, that we which are
the members of Chriſt, ſhould perpetuallie and for euer
praiſe and glorifie God in Chriſt, after the example of
<hi>Dauid,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 164.</note> who ſaith thus: <hi>Septies in die, &amp;c. Seuen times a
daie I haue ſong praiſes vnto thee, bicauſe of the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of thy righteouſneſſe.</hi> The ſecond is, that we
ſhould knowe, that the Church of God ſhall perpetuallie
and for euer remaine, and neuer haue end. For, if glorie
and praiſe muſt be giuen to God (<hi>For euer),</hi> &amp; that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be done elſe-where, ſaue in the Church, it followeth
that the Church ſhall neuer be put downe, or come to an
end. Then ſéeing it is ſo, it ſhall be preſerued and
maintained héere in this world, till the daie of
iudgement: and alſo after the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all fleſh it ſhall continue
in all eternitie and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingneſſe,
praiſing and
glorifieng God
for euer.</p>

and perſuadeth the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> to the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

this propoſition there are manie things
to be marked. Firſt, the Apoſtle maketh

                  <p>Secondlie, when the Apoſtle ſaith, (<hi>I praie you that
you walke worthie of the vocation wherevnto ye are

which are called to the partaking of heauenlie
grace. Now, in this place that generall vocation or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of all Chriſtians is to be vnderſtood, whereby we
are called from darkneſſe, to light: from ſinne, to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe:
from curſſe, to bleſſing: from death, to life:
from damnation, to iuſtification and ſaluation: from
hell, to heauen: to be ſhort, from the kingdome of the

workes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdlie, becauſe the Apoſtle is exhorting the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi>
to (<hi>Vnitie of ſpirit,</hi>) that is to ſaie, to concord and
agréement, he laieth the foundations thereof, whiles
he requireth at their hands, (<hi>Humbleneſſe of minde,
meekneſſe, long ſuffering, and bearing one with an
other through loue.</hi>) Of theſe Chriſtian vertues I
will ſaie ſomewhat, to the ende that the differencies
and properties of them maie the better be ſeene and
knowne.</p>
                  <p>(<hi>Humbleneſſe,</hi>) which the <hi>Greekes</hi> call <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
is a vertue of the minde, which doth ſo rule a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
man, that he thinketh not too well, either of himſelfe,
or of his giftes: but rather abaſeth himſelfe vnder all
men, in the feare of God, giuing to God all glorie and
praiſe. This vertue is the verie next fruite of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce,
which taketh vnto it dailie new increaſings,
ſo that it be true and naturall, and not falſe and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fait.
Now, this holie (<hi>Humbleneſſe</hi>) increſeth &amp; groweth
by foure things. The firſt is, by the acknowledgement
of our owne vnableneſſe and weakneſſe. The ſecond is,
by conſidering the ende of Gods giftes, which he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vs: for our giftes are diuerſe. And why? Euen that
the benefite of them maie be common: that is to ſaie, to
the edifieng one of another, in the bodie of Chriſt. The
third is, by binding our ſelues to ſerue others, according
to the parable in the Goſpell. For, <hi>Of him which hath
more, more ſhall be required.</hi> The fourth is, by think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="127" facs="tcp:2871:80"/>
throughlie vpon Gods counſell, purpoſe, and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
who oftentimes bringeth to paſſe, that they which
ſéeme to haue but ſmall giftes, beſtowe more trauell in
building vp Gods Church, than they which excell in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie
of gifts.</p>
                  <p>(<hi>Meekneſſe</hi>) followeth Humbleneſſe aptlie, after the
Apoſtles order: and it is the childe as it were of Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe.
Now, (<hi>Meekneſſe,</hi>) which the <hi>Greekes</hi> call
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is a kind of calmeneſſe in the mind, whereby as
anie one bridleth himſelfe from being angrie or wroth:
ſo he ſheweth himſelfe gentle and faire ſpoken to others.
The contraries to this, are fierceneſſe, madneſſ, fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe,
ſtubborneſſe, waiwardneſſe, and ſuch like vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which turne the calmeneſſe of the minde, into a
ſtorme and tempeſt.</p>
                  <p>(<hi>Long ſuffering,</hi>) which the <hi>Greekes</hi> call <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>:
the Latiniſts, <hi>Longanimitas:</hi> is a companion of
Méekneſſe: and it is a certeine mildeneſſe of the minde,
giuing place vnto wrong, and parting from ones owne
right, for quietneſſe ſake. For ſo Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſéemeth
to define this vertue, when he addeth theſe words, (<hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
one another through loue, endeuouring to keepe
the vnitie of the ſpirit,</hi>) that is, the concord or agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of mindes, (<hi>In the bond of peace.</hi>) For loue knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
vs together as it were with linkes: euen as the
members of the bodie, béeing faſtened together by
ioints, are ruled by one ſpirit. When therefore the
heart is reformed by Gods ſpirit, and brought vnder,
by true humbleneſſe, méekeneſſe, and long ſuffering,
we ſhall then well inough awaie with others, amend
them that haue done amiſſe, and alſo loue one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with true loue, according to the Lords comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</p>
                  <p>This place of the Apoſtle is diligentlie to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.
For he ſheweth, at what thing the true agréement
of mindes in the Saints muſt take beginning: namelie,


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:2871:81"/>
at the rooting out of all ſuch vices, as are plagues to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
and vnitie: ſuch are theſe, hawtineſſe, haſtineſſe, fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe,
fierceneſſe, waiwardneſſe, &amp;c. Heereto ſerueth

deſire of reuengement. Chriſt ſaith, that the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deling
of theſe affections, is the bearing of his yoke. For
he that hath found reſt in Chriſt, and a refreſhing after
his labours, &amp; an acquittance from the Lawe which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth,
ought not therevpon to take libertie to ſinne:

THis is a confirmation of the propoſition, wherein is
ſet downe before vs, a heape of reaſons or argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
all which hang vpon this one principle: That
which is one, ought in no caſe to be at ſtrife and debate
with it ſelfe. The aſſumption or minor is this: The
Church is one: héervpon followeth the concluſion, which
is this, <hi>Ergo</hi> the Church ought in no caſe to be at ſtrife
&amp; debate with it ſelfe. The aſſumption or minor, becauſe
it is to be proued, is confirmed with ſtore of reaſons.
But that all things maie be knowne at the full, we will
conſider euerie thing by it ſelfe ſeuerallie, and that
briefelie.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore he ſaith, that (<hi>There is one bodie, and
one ſpirit,</hi>) that is to ſaie, Euen as Chriſtians are the
members of one and the ſelfe ſame bodie:<note place="margin">1. Co. 12. 12</note> ſo it is meete,
that they being quickened by one and the ſelfe ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
ſhould agree together in holie loue. For, as all the
members of one and the ſelfe ſame bodie, are quickened
and gouerned by one and the ſelfe ſame ſpirit: euen ſo
muſt all Chriſtians behaue themſelues one towards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
that they maie ſeeme to be lead and guided by one
minde &amp; heart, ſéeing they are all but one bodie in Chriſt.
Whoſoeuer therefore departeth from vnitie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
he muſt néeds depart from the bodie of Chriſt,
which is the Church.</p>
                  <p>Héerevpon it followeth, that they, which mainteine
not ſtedfaſtlie holie loue and vnitie among themſelues,
doe boaſt and bragge of the title of the Church, all in
waſte. And leaſt we ſhould ſuffer our ſelues to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne
and pluckt awaie from the Church, vnder a
vaine ſhewe &amp; counterfaite colour of vnitie, let vs marke
the reaſon of vnitie, which followeth: (<hi>Euen as ye are
called in one hope of your vocation,</hi>) ſaith the Apoſtle:
that is to ſaie, I would ſo haue you all to be one, euen as
ye are called to one and the ſelfe ſame inheritance, which
at this inſtant ye poſſeſſe by hope, according to the word


<pb n="130" facs="tcp:2871:82"/>
of your calling. It is the Apoſtles will therefore, that
we ſhould not depart from the word of our calling, that
is to ſaie, from the pure doctrine of our calling, from
whence the ſoundation of loue and vnitie muſt be fetcht.
For he that departeth from the Goſpell, whereby God
calleth: he departeth from the vnitie of the Church,
from the which when a man is once ſeparated, it cannot
be that he ſhould be gouerned by the ſpirit: euen as anie
member or limme of the bodie, being cut off from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
is no more ruled by the life, which is in the bodie.</p>
                  <p>Now followeth the heape of reaſons. (<hi>There is one
Lord,</hi>) to wit, of the Catholike or vniuerſall Church:
namelie, Chriſt Ieſus, whom all the faithfull ought of
dutie to ſerue, in vnitie of ſpirit, and agréement of mind.
For, if it be a fowle and reprochfull thing, that houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
ſeruaunts, which haue but one and the ſelfe ſame
earthlie maiſter, ſhould fall out and brall among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues:
and not rather with one conſent &amp; agréement do
that which they are commanded: what (I beſéech you)
ſhall be more fowle and reprochfull, than that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
which haue but one maiſter in heauen, the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, ſhould be at diſagréement &amp; defiaunce among
themſelues? ſpeciallie, ſéeing there is (<hi>But one faith</hi>) of
all in him, whereby they ſtaie and reſt themſelues vpon
him alone, being the onelie Lord and alone redéemer of
all: which (<hi>Faith</hi>) indéed, ſéeing it is but one and the
ſelfe ſame: that is to ſaie, of one and the ſelfe ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe:
it is méete, that they to whom this (<hi>One faith</hi>)
is giuen, ſhould alſo maintaine among themſelues, one
vnitie, or oneneſſe.</p>
                  <p>To this alſo belongeth that which followeth. (<hi>One
baptiſme:</hi>) to wit, common to all, whereby we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed
into Chriſts bodie, &amp; as it were incorporate with
him. (<hi>One God and Father of all, which is aboue all, and
through all, and in you all:</hi>) that is to ſaie, which ruleth
ouer all, and by his prouidence and gouernment ordereth


<pb n="131" facs="tcp:2871:82"/>
and diſpoſeth all, dwelling in all the godlie by faith. And
although theſe words, (<hi>Aboue all, &amp; through all,</hi>) maie
be referred to the vniuerſall gouernment and rule of all
things: yet the circumſtanunce of the place maketh a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint,
ſo that they are to be applied to the Church, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
in this place. The meaning of the words therfore is
this, (<hi>Aboue all</hi>) noteth the ſouereigne rule of one God
ouer the Church: (<hi>Through all,</hi>) betokeneth his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
ouer ſpreading all and euerie member of the
Church: (<hi>In all</hi>) ſignifieth the coupling or knitting of
vs together with Chriſt. Whoſoeuer therefore break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
brotherlie loue or agréement, he neither knoweth nor
confeſſeth theſe thrée doctrines. To be briefe, whoſoeuer
is not moued with theſe reaſons and arguments of vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
to deſire and endeuour to liue in loue and concord, we
maie well enough thinke that he or ſhe hath not ſo much

then commeth it to paſſe, that we are not equall in
giftes belonging to the Church? Why hath this man
a greater gifte, and that man a leſſer? Surelie this

                  <p>The Apoſtle anſwereth, that grace is giuen to euerie

not onelie to the priuate vſes of euerie one for himſelfe,

ſhewed the authour and giuer of diuerſe gifts in the

be marked, becauſe it conteineth a Propheſie concerning
the triumph of Chriſt aſcending vp into heauen, which
triumph <hi>Dauid</hi> ſawe in ſpirit, a thouſand yeares before
it came to paſſe. This teſtimonie is taken out of the
68. Pſalme, which is a praiſing of Chriſt triumphant,
whom Dauid confeſſeth openlie to be <hi>Iehouah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 68. 4.</note> that is,
the true God.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, this verſe of the Apoſtle, borrowed of
<hi>Dauid,</hi> conteineth two things. The firſt, a Propheſie of
Chriſts aſcending into heauen. The ſeconde, a double
fruite of his glorious aſcending: the firſt whereof is, his


<pb n="133" facs="tcp:2871:83"/>
triumph ouer death, ſinne, hell, and the Diuels king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
which is to be vnderſtood vnder this word (<hi>Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie.</hi>)
This triumph, as it began in Chriſt our head: ſo
it ſhall be ended in the reſt of his bodie, which is his
Church, at ſuch time as we ſhall all riſe againe, at the
commaundement and voice of Chriſt. For then ſhall all
the godlie enioie euerlaſting victorie with Chriſt, their
enimies béeing vanquiſhed and ſhaken off with ſhame.
The thinking vpon this our triumph to come, ought of
right to comfort vs, when we be kept vnder the Croſſe.
For he, which is certaine of a glorious deliuerance, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
leſſe by his preſent gréeuance.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond fruit of the Lordes aſcending, which the
Apoſtle toucheth, is conteined in theſe words, (<hi>And gaue
gifts vnto men.</hi>) For, to this purpoſe Chriſt aſcended,
that he might deale gifts vnto his Church, whereby ſhée
might be edified &amp; maintained in this life. For, as on the
day of Pentecoſt, he ſent the holie Ghoſt downe to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
appearing in a viſible ſhape vnto them, &amp; likewiſe
gaue them power againſt the Diuell and his members:
euen ſo at this daie alſo, the ſame Lord Ieſus beautifieth
his Church with diuerſe gifts, and he alone mainteineth
the ſame, neuer purpoſing to forſake and leaue her
vnprouided.</p>
                  <p>Héerehence therefore let vs fetch comfort, when wée
lie groning vnder the Croſſe. For, although the Diuell
ſetteth vpon the Church, with ſundrie kindes of engines,
&amp; by ſubtile ſnares violentlie ruſheth vpon euerie mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the ſame: yet ſhall he not in triumph tread ſtill
vpon her necke, &amp; kéepe her vnder alwaies, though ſhée be
held downe for a time. For Chriſt is the triumpher, who
ſitting at the right hand of God, maintaineth his Church,
defendeth her, and ſtrengtheneth her: yea, hée comforteth
all and euerie one of her members with his holie ſpirit.</p>

                  <p>THeſe words muſt be read in a <hi>Parentheſis.</hi> For, out
of the teſtimonie of the Pſalmiſt alreadie cited, the
Apoſtle gathereth two things, by the figure of <hi>Digreſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
The one is of Chriſts abaſing: the other of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieng.
For, in that (<hi>He aſcended</hi>) he ſignifieth that (<hi>His
deſcending),</hi> that is to ſaie, his abaſing went before,
which came to paſſe, by taking vpon him mans nature,
by his paſſion, and by his death. This argument or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Apoſtle were altogether weake, if hée had not
vnderſtood and knowne, that the word which was in the
beginning, and euerlaſting, abaſed himſelfe, in taking vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him the ſhape of a ſeruaunt, wherein hée was alſo
mad? obedient euen to the death of the croſſe. Againe, in
that he (<hi>Aſcended),</hi> Saint <hi>Paule</hi> gathereth the glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng
of Chriſt, and his power, whereby hee now ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filleth
all things, which make for the perfect eſtate of his
Church.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, they which out of this place doe conclude,
that Chriſt deſcended and went downe into hell, and to
the place of the damned, build (God wot) vpon a verie
weake foundation. For, the Apoſtle heere doth not make
a compariſon of one part of the earth to an other: but
compareth the whole earth with heauen, as if he ſhould
ſaie: The eternall word vouchſafed to come downe from
his heauenlie glorie, vnto vs miſerable men, which
liue and are conuerſant héere in earth, that he might be
made man, and become an oblation for mankinde.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:2871:84"/>
Furthermore, becauſe the Lord is heere ſaid, (<hi>To haue
aſcended farre aboue all heauens,</hi>) there are ſome which
gather thervpon, that the bodie of Chriſt is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
not limitable. For (as they ſaie) aboue the heauens there
is no place. But as for this ſubtile ſhift, let vs leaue it
to Sophiſters and Queſtioniſts: and let vs conſtantlie
kéepe and ſticke to the Articles of our beliefe, wherin we
confeſſe, that Chriſt was verie man, &amp; ceaſeth not yet ſo
to be: wherefore it is true, that he hath a verie bodie, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable:
and a verie ſoule, limitable likewiſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he ſhall come at the latter daie to iudge the quicke &amp;
the dead. For, he aſcended not to chaunge the nature of
his manhood, into the nature of his Godhead: but, as the
Apoſtle ſaith (<hi>I'o fill all things),</hi> and that by the maieſtie
and power of his godhead, wherewith he will be preſent

                  <p>Of (<hi>Prophets</hi>) we maie make two orders, whereof

which béeing taught by ſpeciall reuelation from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
euen of God himſelfe, propheſied of things to come:
which when they came to paſſe, warranted the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers

out of their propheſies, and the ſucceſſes of the

which they deliuered to the Church. The (<hi>Prophets</hi>)

to expounde the Scriptures, but alſo to gouerne
and keepe in order the Churches, which the Apoſtles
had aſſembled and edified: and that one while in one

which worke appeareth to haue bene inioined to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
in beſtowing their trauell in preaching the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
of Chriſt euerie where. The (<hi>Euangeliſts</hi>) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were not ſent next &amp; immediatlie of Chriſt, as the
Apoſtles were. They had not the ouer ſight and rule of


<pb n="138" facs="tcp:2871:86"/>
the Churches, now theſe, now thoſe, which the Apoſtles
had planted, as the Prophets did: but they were the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
companions onelie, whoſe helpe and ſeruice they
vſed, in the diſcharging of their office. And although that
the name of an (<hi>Euangeliſt</hi>) ſignifieth generallie, anie
Preacher of the Goſpell, whom ye will: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
it is héere taken for one certaine charge and
office, as we haue alreadie ſhewed. Sometimes alſo
thoſe foure, which wrote the hiſtorie of our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, commonlie called the Goſpelles, are named
(<hi>Euangeliſtes),</hi> of whome two were likewiſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles:
to wit, Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> and Saint <hi>Iohn:</hi> and two
were companie-kéepers with the Apoſtles: namelie, S.
<hi>Marke,</hi> and Saint <hi>Luke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe were (<hi>Paſtours),</hi> whom at this daie we call the
Rectors or Miniſters of Pariſhes, (ſome, after the
olde faſhion, <hi>Pariſh Prieſts.</hi>) Theſe were appointed and
ſet ouer certaine Churches, that by preaching or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Sermons, by miniſtring the Sacraments, and
by a kinde of holie diſcipline and order, they ſhould rule
and gouerne them. Theſe are not for a time, but for
euer, euen to the daie of iudgement: their office is ſo
néedfull in the Church.</p>
                  <p>They are (<hi>Teachers,</hi>) whom the Church in olde time
called by the name of Catechiſers: whoſe office was to
ſet downe a forme and order of doctrine, and to deliuer
certaine foundations and grounds of doctrine, which the
Paſtours afterwards ſhould tie themſelues vnto, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligentlie
folowe. Such are they which at this daie teach
and inſtruct youth in ſchooles the principles and rules of
Chriſtian religion. Theſe haue an eie to this: to wit,
that true expounding, and right order in teaching, be
kept in the Church.</p>
                  <p>But although in the Apoſtles time, the ceremonie of
promotion &amp; preferment was not receiued, which at this
daie is in vſe: yet notwithſtanding, thus much we muſt


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2871:86"/>
knowe, that the godlie gouernors of Churches &amp; ſchooles,
ordeined degrées of promotions vpon good and profitable
aduiſement: both that the arrogant and hautie hearted,
ſhould not vſurpe and challenge vnto themſelues the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of honour and worſhip, without the iudgement of the
Church: and alſo, that by open witneſſe they might be
warranted fit for that place &amp; office, and growe in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
and eſtimation. Neither is this againſt the
dignitie of the<note n="*" place="margin">Or Churches holie go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> eccleſiaſticall <hi>Hierarchie:</hi> which the holie
Ghoſt commendeth vnto vs. For, when the holie
Ghoſt commendeth vnto the <hi>Epheſians</hi> an order and
comelineſſe to be kept, he leaueth vnto himſelfe, the
authoritie to eſtabliſh and make rites and ceremonies,
which doe tend vnto the kéeping of order and comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p>There is no cauſe therefore, that we ſhould care
for the ſpeaches of proud praters, (Diuels in déed,) which
haue theſe degrées in contempt: ſo that they, on whome
theſe degrées are beſtowed, remember who they be that
ſo deſpiſe them, and alſo bethinke them, that their places
of preferment, are not ſignes or tokens of an arrogant
ouerlooking and ouerruling of others: but rather open
witneſſes of their office and charge, which they
owe vnto the Church: and to the performance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they are bounde, as it were, by ſacred and ſolemne
oth.</p>
                  <p>But the aduerſaries peraduenture laie this in our
waie. The Church of Chriſt ſhould not be acquainted
with pompe, ſhe ſhould not be ſkilfull in ſuch things: let
her haue the triall and examining of faith and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
let her haue praiers, and the laieng on of handes.
I aunſwere, that it is not a thing vnworthie for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
to beſtowe vpon godlie and learned men,
teſtimonies of their learning and honeſtie: that the
Church ſhould knowe, to whom ſhée might ſafelie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
and boldlie put in truſt, the gouernement and charge

that wée reſerue and keepe in Churches and Schooles,
ſuch things as are profitable and neceſſarie: all droſſe and

faithfullie followe our onelie Maiſter Ieſus Chriſt, in

                  <p>Now let vs come backe to the expoſition of our text,
where the Apoſtle ſetteth downe the end of thoſe giftes,
wherewith Chriſt hath and doth beautifie his Church.

and ſignifieth properlie, a reſtoring or repairing of a

the bones, or ſuch like, are looſe, out of order, or beſide
their right place: but afterwards ſet in againe, faſtened,
and made ſound and whole, that all and euerie part of
the bodie, maie be in good making and liking.</p>
                  <p>Héerehence Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> who compareth the Church
to the bodie, applieth the word to the ſtate of the Church
well ordered and gouerned. The diuerſitie of gifts ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
wherewith Chriſt beautifieth his Church, belongeth
to the well ordering and gouerning of the Church. For
to this thing, as it were to the proper end, theſe gifts are
appointed. This followeth, (<hi>For the worke of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie,</hi>)
that we might knowe, what inſtrument Gods

                  <p>Now followeth an amplification or enlargement, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

in faith and in the knowledge of Chriſt. In that he
ſaith, (<hi>Till we all meete together,</hi>) it is to good purpoſe.
For he ſignifieth, that it is not one daies worke for all
of vs to be made full and perfect in Chriſt: but that it
muſt be our dailie labour, till at length we come to that
vnitie of Chriſts bodie, the cauſe of which (<hi>Vnitie</hi>) is
faith. This (<hi>Knowledge</hi>) is not a knowledge onelie of
the minde concerning Chriſt, but alſo a confidence of the
heart. For, it is not enough to knowe that Chriſt is God,
man, one perſon in Trinitie, King, Prophet, and Prieſt:
vnleſſe with ſtedfaſt confidence and boldneſſe we build
vpon him.</p>
                  <p>Héere the degrées of (<hi>Vnitie</hi>) muſt be marked, the
firſt whereof is, the (<hi>Knowledge</hi>) of Chriſt: from
whence (<hi>Faith</hi>) ſpringeth. By this (<hi>Faith</hi>) we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed
into Chriſt, and made as it were of his bodie.
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eing therefore ingraffed into him, &amp; made of his bodie,
it is our part, like members of one &amp; the ſelfe ſame bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
to haue care &amp; regard one of anothers health and good
caſe, through loue: this (I ſaie) is our dutie, who are
ioined together one with another among our ſelues, by
the ſpirit of Chriſt. Out of theſe things therefore is to
be gathered, that the (<hi>Vnitie</hi>) of the Church conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not in traditions of men, nor in ceremonies, but in
the conſent of true doctrine and faith, from whence the
loue of one another doth ſpring.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, when it is ſaid, (<hi>Vnto a perfect man, &amp;
vnto the meaſure of the age of the fulneſſe of Chriſt,</hi>)
the Apoſtle expreſſeth, by a notable &amp; trimme Metaphore,
the increaſe &amp; growing of the Saints. For, as there are
diuerſe degrées of age: as, infancie, childhood, middleage,
oldage, dotage, &amp;c. ſo muſt Chriſtians growe by litle
and litle, in the faith &amp; knowledge of Chriſt. They muſt
not kéepe ſtill at the nethermoſt ſteppe, and ſtaie there:
but they muſt goe vp higher and higher, till they come to
perfectneſſe: which notwithſtanding they ſhall not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine


<pb n="143" facs="tcp:2871:89"/>
at full, before they, hauing put off the olde man,
ſhalbe glorified both in ſoule and bodie, with a bleſſed life.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words therefore of the Apoſtle muſt not be
referred to the bodie, which is but an idle lumpe: but
to the light of the minde, and the affection of the heart:
to wit, that we ſhould knowe Chriſt trulie, and leane vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him with a liuelie faith, that we ſhould not be waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
like children, who by reaſon of their young yeares
haue not a ſettled iudgement: but like men growne to
full age, whoſe iudgement being ſteddie, they conſtantlie
mainteine the truth.</p>
                  <p>For, whatſoeuer is héere ſpoken of the bodie, and of
the (<hi>Meaſure of age,</hi>) it is to be applied vnto the ſpirit,
and the increaſe of the ſame. For, as the Lord himſelfe
grewe in bodie, till ſuch time as he became (<hi>A perfect
man,</hi>) and had the iuſt meaſure of his full age: euen ſo
we muſt growe in faith, and the knowledge of Chriſt,
till we are come to perfectneſſe. This to be the true
and naturall meaning of Saint <hi>Paules</hi> wordes, that
which followeth is witneſſe. For the Apoſtle is not in
hand héere with our bodies, wherewith we ſhall riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
as ſome verie vnaduiſedlie doe gather in this

                     </gap>, that is to ſaie, ſo knit and
coupled together, that it maie well and fitlie be ioined to
the head: euen as an houſe built and raiſed vpon the

Vnder this word therefore, the relation of the bodie to
the head, that is to ſaie, of the Church vnto Chriſt, is
meant, and vnderſtood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:2871:91"/>
Afterwards, the Apoſtle ſaith, that the Church is (<hi>A
bodie knit together by ioints:</hi>) the Gréeke word is,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is to ſay, ſo coupled &amp; faſtened,
that the members of the ſame hang one vpon another in
due proportion, and agrée verie well together. And thus
the relation and proportion of the members betwéene
themſelues, one with another, is ſignified (as you ſée,)
vnder this word. He ſaith this bodie is (<hi>Knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by euerie ioint, for the furniture thereof:</hi>) that is to
ſaie, by ioints, which carrie breath and life from one
limme to another: which breath and life is diſperſed
from the head, through all and euerie member of the
bodie, euen by the benefite and good ſeruice of the ioints,
by whoſe meanes the members of the bodie, hang one
by another, (<hi>According to the effectuall power of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
part,</hi>) that is to ſaie, of euerie member. For ſome
members receiue, and haue more breath and life from
the head than other ſome, whereby the whole bodie ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
increaſe.</p>
                  <p>Now, the ſimilitude ſhalbe eaſier to vnderſtand. As
the bodie of man is to the head, euen ſo is the Church of
Chriſt vnto Chriſt her head: but the bodie of man ioined
vnto the head, &amp; knit together by ioints in euerie mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
by due proportion and order, receiueth all breath and
life from the head: <hi>Ergo</hi> the Church of Chriſt ioined vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Chriſt her head by faith, and made fit by ſundrie ſorts
of ſeruices &amp; vſes of loue betwéene themſelues, as it were
members, draweth all ableneſſe, and life from her head,
euen Chriſt Ieſus. Or if you pleaſe, frame the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
in this manner.</p>
                  <p>As breath and life deſcending or comming
downe from the braine, by and through the ſinewes,
veines, and artires, bringeth féeling and liueli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
vnto all the members, according to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of euerie one in his kinde: euen ſo Chriſt giueth
vnto vs, who are his members, his gifts, and that not at


<pb n="148" facs="tcp:2871:92"/>
happe hazard or raſhlie, but according to the meaſure of
euerie member: that is to ſaie, as euerie member is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to receiue and take: and thus he maketh the whole
bodie to be builded vp, and growe together into him.
This point of doctrine deliuered vnto vs by Saint <hi>Paule,</hi>
offereth vnto vs manifold leſſons for our learning. For
firſt of all, we haue to gather héerehence, that all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
of them are out of the Church, how manie ſoeuer,
which ſubmit not themſelues vnto Chriſt, in the true
knowledge of Chriſt, and in faith: and which ſetting
light by loue, are at daggers drawing one with another,
ſo excéeding great is their hatred betwéene themſelues.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Furthermore, a true and euident deſcription of the
Church maie heerehence be taken, that it is</hi> An aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of ſuch as beleeue in the Goſpell, who cleaue ſo
cloſe vnto Chriſt their head, and are ſo knit and ioined
together betweene themſelues, according to the meaſure
of euerie ones faith, according to the diuerſitie of the
giftes of the holie Ghoſt, &amp; according to the condition
of callings, that they all, &amp; euerie of them liue and are
lead by one and the ſelfe ſame ſpirit, and that they ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
and maintaine one another in mutuall goodwill,
charitie, and loue.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, this place alſo ſheweth vs the trimme,
handſome, and neate order of Chriſtes Church. For, ſuch
is the order of the Church, as of the members of one and
the ſame bodie, vnder one and the ſame head. Againe,
this preſent place teacheth vs, what manner of like-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
&amp; conſent, or agréement, there ought to be among
Chriſtians one with another. For, as in one bodie, when
one member is pained and ſuffereth, the reſt of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
all and euerie of them, are partakers of that paine,
and ſuffer therewithall: euen ſo Chriſtians, who are
members of the ſame bodie, ought to be like minded one
towards another, that as well in aduerſitie, as in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie,
one ſhould take part with another. To this

which in Gréeke is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is that
naturall abilitie, whereby we deuiſe, determine, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
reaſon, and gather ſomewhat by and out of thoſe
things, which our minde quietlie ſéeth and perceiueth,
without debating or reaſoning: but the Apoſtle ſaith,
that this vnderſtanding was darkened or blinded: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it came to paſſe, that the Gentiles béeing ignorant
of God, became eſtraunged (<hi>From the life of God.</hi>)
Now (<hi>The life of God</hi>) in this place is that, wherby God
liueth within, in the heart, and vpon the which, all abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
and deſire to doe anie good, dependeth.</p>
                  <p>Vnder the word (<hi>Heart</hi>) the Apoſtle compriſeth all the
luſts and appetites, attributing (<hi>Hardneſſe</hi>) vnto them:
whereof it commeth, that men are not touched with anie
ſparkle of the feare of God, but rather runne headlong
whether ſo euer their lewd luſtes, &amp; filthie affections car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
or driue them. Theſe are the beginnings and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of morall actions, or behauiours (touching religion) in

                  <p>But that theſe things maie ſomewhat the more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

by examples. The (<hi>Minde</hi>) of man ſéeth that there is a
God, and iudgeth that he is to be worſhipped: which
iudgement, although it be true, yet notwithſtanding it is
héere accuſed of vanitie by the Apoſtle: and good reaſon
whie: euen becauſe it vaniſheth to nothing, and by the
corruption and naughtineſſe of nature is choked and
ſtrangled, before the matter commeth to action &amp; practiſe.</p>
                  <p>For, when the (<hi>Vnderſtanding</hi>) reaſoneth out of this
beginning, principle, or ground, &amp; yet ſtraieth from the
true God, &amp; from the right waie of worſhipping him, the
(<hi>Minde</hi>) in deed ſéeth that there is both a God, and that


<pb n="151" facs="tcp:2871:93"/>
he alſo is to be worſhipped, but the (<hi>Vnderſtanding</hi>) in

that <hi>Apis,</hi> &amp; ſo in other nations other idols are to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped:
&amp; that one while by oblations of men, an other
while by other rites and ceremonies, the méere deuiſes of
men. And this is that which Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh of,
ſaieng,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 23</note> that <hi>The Gentiles turned the truth of God into

the Creator.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Furthermore, the Apoſtle addeth the fit fruites of ſuch
cauſes: namelie, (<hi>Ignorance of God, eſtraunging from
the life of God, and hardneſſe of heart,</hi>) which is, ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
blockiſhneſſe, or numneſſe, not ſuffering them to
féele the greatneſſe and gréeuouſneſſe of their ſinnes, but
to growe paſt all remorſe of conſcience or repentance: ſo
that they ceaſſe vtterlie, and altogether leaue off to bée
ſorrie for their ſinnes. A certaine inclination to all (<hi>Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe,</hi>)
followeth this ſenſleſſe duineſſe, or blockiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
yea rather, a certaine vnbrideled deſire to ſinne,
which the Apoſtle tearmeth heere by the name of (<hi>Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe.</hi>)
This gréedie luſt burſteth out into all kinde
of villanies and abhominable miſbehauiours, which are

in theſe remaineth ſome libertie, in ſuch as are not yet
regenerate or borne a new: but he ſpeaketh onelie of
the actions which concerne Gods worſhip and ſeruice: of
which actions there are thrée cauſes. The firſt is, the
word, which inſtructeth the minde, and frameth the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The ſecond is, the holie Ghoſt, which is effectuall
in the word, to the inlightening of the minde, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination

in the ignorance of the Goſpell of Chriſt: to wit, bicauſe
they haue learned Chriſt. For, as a little before, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed
the cauſes of manie fowle ſinnes in the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
which cauſes are theſe: namelie, (<hi>The vanitie of

the hardneſſe of their heart:</hi>) ſo in this place he ſetteth
flatlie againſt all theſe, the knowledge of Chriſt aloue:


<pb n="153" facs="tcp:2871:94"/>
and further auoucheth, that the ſame is the cauſe of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a godlie and an honeſt life.</p>
                  <p>This knowledge therefore of Chriſt ought to bréed in
vs an other manner of liuing, than is in the Gentiles,
which are not yet (to this daie) turned vnto God, by and
through the preaching of the Goſpell. For, this effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
&amp; forceable knowledge of Chriſt, what doth it? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth,
it reformeth the minde, it inlighteneth the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,

the Apoſtle ſaith, (<hi>As the truth is in Ieſus:</hi>) that is to

one mite of true and healthfull light remaining in you.
But now you are light, walke therefore as children of
light. The word (<hi>Light</hi>) is attributed and giuen to the

                  <p>THe Apoſtle maketh the ſinnes and offenſes of the

therewithall the fruite of rebuking and reprouing:
whereby the godlie, through their honeſt and holie life,
may rebuke the vncleanneſſe and wickedneſſe of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlie.
For, by ſuch kindes of rebuking, wicked men
come to the knowledge of themſelues: and when they
take a view of the manners of the godlie, they confeſſe
their owne beaſtlineſſe: and ſo at length beginne to bée
aſhamed of the filthineſſe of their faultes and vices.

                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:2871:106"/>
But, becauſe the words of the Apoſtle haue neede to
be erpounded, we will ſaie ſomewhat, that the weight of
his words maie be marked. For firſt of all, when he
ſaith, (<hi>It is ſhame euen to ſpeake of the things which
are done of them in ſecret,</hi>) it is a making of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
worſe, by laieng two euill things together. It is
leſſe to ſpeake of offenſes and faults, than to commit or
doe them: now, if ſo be it is ſhame, euen to ſpeake or
talke of ſuch miſdéeds as they haue done, trulie then the
doing of a filthie déede is moſt of all to be defied and ſpet
at. Anon after, when he ſaith, (<hi>All things, when they
are reproued of the light, are manifeſt,</hi>) he declareth the
fruite of brotherlie rebuking or chiding one another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſenſe or meaning of the words is this, as Saint</hi>
Ambroſe <hi>doth expound them,</hi> Then doe wicked men
and offenders appeare, and are ſeene in their colours,
when they are taken vp for their faults: becauſe he
which offendeth, ſo long as he is not rebuked, hee ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
in his owne eies not to offend at all. Now they
are made manifeſt by the light, becauſe the children of
God, who are called, The children of light, rebuke them
by their life, their doctrine, &amp; wholſom admoniſhments.
<hi>The proofe of this ſpeach followeth, euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the nature
of light.</hi> (Light, <hi>ſaith the Apoſtle,</hi> maketh all things
manifeſt.) <hi>For, as darkneſſe ſhadoweth and couereth all
things, and maketh them ſecreat and hidden: ſo the
light bringeth that out into open ſight, and bright noone
tide, which laie lurking and ſhroonke vp in darkneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this alſo he addeth another compariſon drawne
from authoritie of Scripture: (<hi>Awake,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thou
that ſleepeſt:</hi>) that is to ſaie, thou that ſnorteſt in thy
ſinnes, forſake thy ſinnes, and (<hi>Ariſe from the dead:</hi>)
that is to ſaie, abſteine from ſinnes which bring death
with them. (<hi>And Chriſt ſhall giue thee light:</hi>) that is to
ſaie, thou ſhalt féele conſolation by the ſpirit of Chriſt.
For how much more we ſlie from the darkneſſe of


<pb n="177" facs="tcp:2871:106"/>
ſinnes, ſo much more ſhall Chriſt the ſunne of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſhine in our hearts. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> denieth that
this ſaieng is anie where to be found in the Scriptures.
Some there be, which thinke that the Apoſtle had an
eie to that place of the Prophet, where it is ſpoken thus,
<hi>Surge, illuminare, &amp;c. Ariſe, be bright: for thy light
is come,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eſai. 60. 1</note> 
                     <hi>and the glorie of the Lord is riſen vpon thee.</hi>
Other ſome referre it vnto an other place, becauſe it

thus, <hi>Populus qui ambulat, &amp;c. The people that wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

                     <hi>they that

                     </gap>, by
waie of imitation. For, all the Prophets and ſincere
preachers of Gods word, whiles they doe their ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
to call men backe from ſinne, doe vſe theſe or ſuch

indéede it is meete) to repentaunce and amendement.
Secondlie, they ioine therevnto the word of promiſe,
and conſolation alſo, whereby the repentaunt are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

learne, that the ſpirit of Chriſt ſpeaketh vnto euerie one

in proper and familiar ſpeach. (<hi>Take heede

                  <p>THe Apoſtle (for example ſake,) ioineth vnto his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
exhortation, certeine ſpecialties: and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth
vnto vs in the firſt place ſpirituall reioicing,
perſuading vs from fleſhlie reioicing or carnall glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
For, as ſpirituall reioicing as a certeine ſpirituall
wiſedome: ſo fleſhlie or carnall reioicing, which is dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe,
is a kinde of fooliſhneſſe. As therefore he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
vs counſell to leaue this: ſo his aduſe is, to take
the other: the argument, which he vſeth in this caſe, is
drawne from the effect of either of both, and that by
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, demonſtration. For, there is a reaſon
framed orderlie againſt either of both, as in manie like
things before hath bene done. (<hi>Be not dronke with wine</hi>)
ſaith the Apoſtle: that is to ſaie, Take not occaſion by
ouer drinking your ſelues, to be merie &amp; reioice. Why ſo?


<pb n="181" facs="tcp:2871:108"/>
Bicauſe therein conſiſteth ſottiſhneſſe: that is to ſaie,
all kinde of wantonneſſe, lewdneſſe, filthineſſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance.
For, dronkenneſſe cauſeth a man to runne
headlong into all manner of miſdemeanour, &amp; to commit
much miſchiefe, according to theſe verſes, not ſo olde as
true: <hi>Quid non ebrietas, &amp;c.</hi>

and hauing ſurfetted, goe againe afterwards, and

doth not onelie offend God moſt gréeuouſlie, and put out

                  <p>Againſt this the Apoſtle ſetteth (<hi>The fulneſſe of the
ſpirit,</hi>) that is to ſaie, ioie in the holie ſpirit, whereby we
burſt out into godlie ſpeaches, concerning God and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie
things, into (<hi>Pſalmes, hymnes, ſpirituall ſongs, &amp;

who giueth all things abundantlie to his children,
for his ſonnes ſake Ieſus Chriſt our Lord. For, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ioineth (<hi>God</hi>) and (<hi>Father</hi>) together in this place,
not that they are two, but one God: whoſe great power
doubtleſſe, is ſignified by the name of (<hi>God:</hi>) and his
good will noted, vnder the true name of (<hi>Father.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, the difference betwéene (<hi>Pſalmes, hymnes,

that is to ſaie, not idle, fooliſh, and wanton: but
tending wholie to edification. For this word (<hi>Spirituall,</hi>)

As for the words of S. <hi>Paule</hi> which followe, they are not

againe, (<hi>Singing and making melodie in your hearts:</hi>)
For the phraſe of Scripture, (<hi>Speaking to your ſelues,</hi>)
is as much as, betweene or among your ſelues: &amp; (<hi>Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in your hearts,</hi>) as much as, from your heartes. The
Apoſtle cannot awaie with wanton ſongs, and vaine pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings,
twangings, whiſtlings, and ſuch like, wherewith
the conſcience is neuer a whit edified: but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
by them is rather troubled, godlie prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
hindered, deuotions ſlackened, and the heate of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
God quenched. The ſongs which he requireth are
ſuch onelie, as proceeding from a pure and cleane heart,
bring ſpirituall gladneſſe and reioiſing to godlie Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
                  <p>This place of the Apoſtle therefore doth teach, in what
things the reioiſings of the godlie doe conſiſt: to wit,
in ſpeaking one to an other of God, and heauenlie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and in godlie ſongs, whereby our hearts are ſtirred

                  <p>Furthermore, although dronkenneſſe is to bée defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and fled from, as a moſt noiſome plague or peſtilence:
yet notwithſtanding, honeſt and ſober meetings of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,

the <hi>Epheſians</hi> the ſundrie duties of ſeuerall perſons, he
ſetteth downe firſt of all a generall rule or precept con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

bringeth in certeine degrées and particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
touching the ſame matter. Moreouer, in this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie
two things are diligentlie to be marked: to wit,
the precept, and the rule, or tho reaſon of the rule. The
precept is this, (<hi>Submitting your ſelues one to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>)
This precept perteineth to all men, of all ſtates
and degrées whatſoeuer. For, there is none, but ought
of dutie to doe good vnto others, and to ſerue them in
loue and charitie So kings and princes ſerue their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.

                  <p>The rule of ſubmiſſion one to an other, is (<hi>The feare

faith and ſubmiſſion. This (<hi>Feare</hi>) taketh awaie quite
all arrogancie, whereby men, as it were ouerlooking
one an other from aloft, deſpiſe each other. This

and that we might be knit one to an other in all duties

ought to be laid vp in ſtore, euen in the ſecreteſt place of

                  <p>THE Apoſtle laid before vs a generall doctrine of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion

in the firſt place, the duties of wiues towards their
huſbands. He confirmeth his propoſition by compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and ſheweth the manner of ſubiection or ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>The propoſition ſtandeth vpon compariſon, in this
ſort:<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 16.</note> (<hi>Wiues ſubmit your ſelues vnto your husbands,
as vnto the Lord.</hi>) This lawe of obedience is laid vpon
the woman, becauſe ſhe ſuffered hir ſelfe to be deceiued of

wife was made ſubiect to the huſband: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
that ſubiection differed from the other, which
was afterwards laid vpon the woman. For the firſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection
was, as it were frée and not hard a whit: but
the ſecond ſubiection brought with it a heauie yoke,
which kept hir vnder, and this was the puniſhment of
hir ſinne. But this yoke is made pleaſant, rather than
gréeuous, to godlie women, when they looke vpon the
Lords will, for whoſe ſake they owe ſubiection to their
huſbands.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle addeth a reaſon to his propoſition, which
reaſon riſeth from the ordinance of God, and from that
which is profitable. (<hi>Becauſe the huſband is the wiues
head,</hi>) ſaith Saint <hi>Paule:</hi> that is to ſaie, not onelie the
higher, as the head in the bodie: but alſo, as the head gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
power &amp; ableneſſe to the bodie, whereby the health of
the bodie is mainteined: ſo the huſband ought to haue a
regard to the welfare of his wife. That this was the
meaning of S. <hi>Paule,</hi> by this word (<hi>Head,</hi>) the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
following doth declare. (<hi>As Chriſt is the head of the
Church, and the ſame is the ſauiour of his bodie.</hi>) Now,
Chriſt is the (<hi>Head</hi>) of the Church, both becauſe he alone
is chiefe gouernour thereof, and alſo bicauſe that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
good thing the Church hath, it procéedeth from
Chriſt hir (<hi>Head:</hi>) as we haue declared in the ſecond
Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Now followeth the manner of ſubiection. (<hi>Therefore
as the Church is in ſubiection to Chriſt, euen ſo let the
wiues be to their husbands, in euerie thing.</hi>) This (<hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection</hi>)
therfore ought to be frée, voluntarie, willing, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
chéerefull, pleaſant, dutifull, chaſt, honeſt, godlie, and ſo
foorth. And although Chriſt and the huſband, are not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall

                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:2871:111"/>
The firſt is, that wiues which are diſobedient and
ſtubburne againſt their huſbandes, are ſo farre from
béeing obedient vnto Chriſt, that they intangle and
winde themſelues in Sathans nettes and ſnares.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is, that wiues maie receiue great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit

which cleaueth vnto the head, borroweth and
taketh from thence all his liuelineſſe and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</p>
                  <p>The third is, that wiues muſt be content with their

of their might, to pleaſe, with all godlie dutie, and
honeſt ſeruice.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is, that the ſubiection of wiues, is not
onelie to be allowed, for domeſticall or houſholde pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
ſake: but alſo bicauſe it is a ſeruice pleaſing God,
when it iſſueth and commeth from true faith and
loue.</p>
                  <p>The fift is, that the errour of the olde heretikes is
héere ouerthrowne, who eſtéemed and tooke marriage for
a prophane and vnholie thing, and after a ſort vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
for Chriſtians. But the holie Ghoſt in this place

our ſinnes. The fourth is, (<hi>The word</hi>) that the force and
vertue of Baptiſme maie be vnderſtoode by the worde of
promiſe. The fift is, the analogie or proportion of the
ſigne to the truth: which analogie or proportion is dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlie
to be conſidered in euerie ſacrament. The ſigne
is, The waſhing of water: the analogie or proportion is,
As water cleanſeth the bodie without: ſo the bloude of


<pb n="189" facs="tcp:2871:112"/>
Christ waſheth awaie the filth of ſinne from the ſoule
within. This analogie or proportion the Apoſtle ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
vnto vs, under this word (<hi>Cleanſing.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>Theſe things throughlie conſidered, and rightlie
weighed: it is eaſie to knowe, in what accompt the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
of the Church ought to be. For, they are
ſignes, ſeales, &amp; tokens, whereby God offereth his grace:
and giueth euidence, that he will indéed perfourme that,
which the outward things themſelues do repreſent. For,
the truth of the thing vnséene, is alwaies ioined with the
ſacraments ſéene: and ſo is the giuing it ſelfe, which is
throughlie done by the ſecret working of the holie ghoſt.
Not that the holie Ghoſt ſtandeth in neede of anie out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
helpe, but there is conſideration had of our
weakneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Out of these things it is eaſie to gather, that a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
is rightlie defined in the new Teſtament, to bée
a ſigne ſéene and fealt, ordeined euen of Chriſt himſelfe,
to ſeale the word of grace and promiſe, which is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
by faith. And although the wicked are neither
waſhed with Baptiſme, nor nouriſhed by the Lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:
yet notwithſtanding, the ſacraments kéepe their
force and vertue, in reſpect of God: becauſe howſoeuer
the vnthankfull will none of it, Gods grace is offered
vnto them neuertheleſſe.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, the deſcription of the Church, which
followeth, doth not belong to outward ſhewe and faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but to the inward cleanneſſe of the heart. This is
rightlie to be vnderſtood, becauſe of them which denie

or ſtaine whatſoeuer. To the boulſtering vp of which

If (ſaie they) the Church haue no spot, and no wrinkle:
if the Church be holie and without blame:<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 26. 27.</note> then ſhall
not this aſſemblie, where ſo manie miſliuers are met


<pb n="190" facs="tcp:2871:113"/>
together be the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This errour is diſprooued, by the order of praieng,
which the Lord left vs for a paterne. For we are bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to praie thus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 12.</note> Remitte nobis debita, &amp;c. Forgiue

                  <p>The Apoſtle doth not therefore meane, that the
Church is alreadie cleanſed, and void of all blemiſhes or
freckles: but rather, that ſhe groweth vp dailie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuallie
profiteth, directing her courſe wholie thither,
whither ſhe will neuer be able to come, whiles this
world laſteth. For, ſo long as the Church abideth in this
world, ſhe is ſtained and ſpotted two waies. For, firſt of
all, there is no member of hers ſo pure and perfect, but
is attainted with diuers ſinnes and vices. All the
faithfull therefore,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 16. 17. 18. 19 20. 21. 22. &amp;c.</note> for the time of their tarrieng heere,
haue alwaies ſome vncleanneſſe, which remaineth in
their fleſh, as plainlie is proued, by the experience of the
Saints, or holie ones.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, Hypocrites and fowle offenders, who
with their filthineſſe infect the whole Congregation, are
alwaies mingled with the good and godlie in the Church:
as Saint <hi>Paule</hi> manifeſtlie teacheth, writing to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians.</hi>
For, he adorneth and beautifieth the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
with the title of the Church: howbeit, there
were among them manie high-minded, manie defiled
with things offered vp vnto idols, ſome that had ill

in the Epiſtles. The Lord alſo himſelfe ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
this, by the parable of the darnell.</p>
                  <p>Whereto then ſerueth that ſtatelie and loftie ſpeach
of the Apoſtle, calling the Church of Chriſt his ſpouſe,
(<hi>Not hauing ſpotte or wrinkle, holie, and without
blame?</hi>) I aunſwere: the Church is to bée conſidered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
two ſorts: to wit, in her ſelfe, and in Chriſt. As
the Church is conſidered in her ſelfe, ſhe hath manie
ſpottes doubtleſſe, wherewith ſhée is blemiſhed: which
notwithſtanding are not imputed and laide to her
charge, whiles the ſpirit hath the vpper hand in her.
But as ſhée is conſidered in Chriſt, ſhée is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
without ſpotte, but alſo excéeding gorgeouslie gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed:
to wit, with the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt,
which ſhée hath obteined by frée gift. Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>
maketh a difference betwéene the ſtate of
the Church in this life, and in the life to come. <hi>In
this life preſent, the Church hath her ſpots. In the life
to come ſhe ſhall be without all ſpot, pure, holie, and
without blame in verie deede.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This place of the Apoſtle teacheth, comforteth,

waſhed with holie Baptiſme: namelie, that wée
ſhould endeuour our ſelues to bée pure and cleane.
It comforteth them which grone vnder the burden
of their ſinnes, and lament that they are ouerladen
with them. For the time will come, when their

following:<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 24. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>Infoelix homo, quis me eripiet ex hoc

                  <p>THe Apoſtle defendeth and proueth that we muſt loue
our wiues, and ſetteth downe in the firſt place, two
ariomes, principles, or grounds, which are the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of two ſyllogiſmes. Afterwards he addeth other
two arguments: the firſt whereof is fetcht from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Chriſt, the ſecond from the ordinance of God.
Theſe latter arguments are added, to confirme the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
The firſt ſyllogiſme is this, being made vpon the
firſt principle: (<hi>He that loueth his wife, loueth his owne
ſelfe:</hi>) But euerie huſband loueth his owne ſelfe: <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi>
he ought to loue his wife. The ſecond ſyllogiſme ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
out of the ſecond principle, in this wiſe: (<hi>No man
euer yet hated his owne fleſh, but nouriſheth and cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth
it:</hi>) but the wife is the fleſh of her owne huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band:
<hi>Ergo,</hi> the huſband ought not to hate his wife, but
rather to nouriſh and cherriſh her. To this he ioineth an
argument drawne from example: (<hi>Becauſe ſhe is fleſh
of his fleſh, &amp; bone of his bones.</hi>) This he proueth and
defendeth by authoritie out of Geneſis, ſaieng: (<hi>For this
cauſe ſhall a man leaue his father and his mother,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 24</note> 
                     <hi>and
ſhall cleaue to his wife, and they ſhall bee two in one


<pb n="194" facs="tcp:2871:115"/>
fleſh.</hi> As if he ſhould ſaie. A man were better forſake
his father and his mother, though he be bound vnto them
by the lawes of nature: than to leaue his wife, with
whom he is one fleſh, ſo long as the ſubſtaunce of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie
remaineth ſafe and ſound. For if adulterie
creepe in betwéene, the guiltie partie is cut off from that
vnitie or oneneſſe of the fleſh, which the Lord requireth
in honeſt matrimonie. Now, the huſband and the wife
are ſaid to be (<hi>One fleſh,</hi>) not in ſubſtaunce, but in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and loue. For, the huſband ſhall loue his wife and
cherrish her, euen as his owne fleſh: the wife in like

out of the ſide of the man, as he laie a ſléepe: euen ſo the
Church groweth vp by the power and vertue of Chriſts
death. And as ſhe forſaking father and mother, cleaueth

with him alone, like an honeſt wife: euen ſo the Church
forſaking idolatrous fornication, ſhall cleaue vnto her

marriage leadeth vs after a ſort, by the thing ſeene, to a
thinking vpon the inward coupling together of Chriſt &amp;
the Church, which marriage firſt repreſented. And this
is Saint <hi>Paules</hi> meaning, when he ſaith: (<hi>But I ſpeake

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His is the third ſpecialtie: to wit, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of children towardes their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
wherin we méet with two things
to be marked. The firſt is, that vnder
this word (<hi>Obedience,</hi>) the holie ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
compriſeth honour, whereof obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is a moſt aſſured token: by the figure <hi>Synecdoche,</hi>
commonlie in vſe. This honour hangeth vpon two
points: namelie, in affection, and in effect. The honour
which ſtandeth vpon affection, is true godlineſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
our parents, true loue, and feruent good-will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
wherewith we make much of them, and dutiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
behaue our ſelues towards them, bicauſe they are our
parents.</p>
                  <p>The effect of honour due to our parents is, to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
perſuaded in minde and conſcience, that their eſtate
is in déede a diuine order and degrée appointed by God:
&amp; for that cauſe to bée had in eſtimation and account. Let
children therefore, euen willinglie, ſtand in awe of their
parents, ſubmit themſelues vnto them, obeie them in all
things that are honeſt and lawfull, let them ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
thankfull, gentle, dooing them good in word and
in déed, couering the faults of their elders with méeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
or at leaſt wiſe making the beſt of that which is
amiſſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing, which I ſaid was to be marked in
this place, is: that this obedience ought to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
(<hi>In Domino, In the Lord:</hi>) which putteth chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in minde of two verie great things. The firſt is,
To obeie for the Lords ſake, or for his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſake, and that faithfullie, or in faith. Héereto
ſerueth that ſaieng of Ieſus the ſonne of <hi>Syrach, Qui
timet, &amp;c. He that feareth God, honoureth his parents.</hi>
The ſecond is, To knowe that a meaſure of obedience is
appointed them: leaſt they ſhould obeie their parents
in things which withſtand the Lordes will. For, if pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents


<pb n="201" facs="tcp:2871:118"/>
ſhall take in hand anie ſuch thing, let children
learne and knowe, that the lawe of their parents after
the fleſh, laid vpon them in that ſort, is quite diſplaced by
the commandement of a higher gouernour, euen their
heauenlie Father.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If parents therefore inioine and charge their children
to doe anie thing, either againſt religion, or againſt hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie,
or to the hurt of their common countrie: the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
owe no obedience at all vnto their parents in this
caſe: yea rather, let them ſet themſelues flatlie face to face
&amp; fiſt to fiſt againſt them, prouided alwaies, that they paſſe
not beyond the bounds of godlineſſe. To this belongeth
that notable ſaieng of</hi> Auſonius: Parentibus, &amp;c. Then
doth a child obeie his father &amp; his mother, when hee or
ſhe doth that of their owne will &amp; accord, which they
are rightlie &amp; well commanded to do. <hi>With this alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréeth
that ſaieng of our Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 37.</note> Si quis vult, &amp;c. If anie

feed and cheriſh our parents: ſo it biddeth vs giue them
ouer and forſake them, if they ſhall bee hinderers of a
deſire and diſpoſition to holineſſe and deuotion.</p>
                  <p>The hate therefore which Chriſt teacheth vs to beare
towards our parents, is but a diſſembled hate, or a hate in
ſhew: whereby we ſeeming deafe and hard of hearing,
regard not, but lightlie paſſe by the ſwéete ſugred ſongs
of <hi>Syrens:</hi> that is to ſaie, of our parents, dooing what
they can, with the balmed baites of this world to vndoe
vs, and to drowne vs in the waues of wickedneſſe: but


<pb n="202" facs="tcp:2871:119"/>
we ought not to giue them the hearing, much leſſe the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
This hate therefore is the hate of diſſimulation, not
of perſecution: of auoiding, not of annoieng: of eſchew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
not of vndoing: of godlineſſe, not of cruelneſſe. For,
then ought we, as it were to hate them, to paſſe by them,
to kéepe vs from them, when we cannot ſerue God and
them both at once. But ſurelie, if both could conuenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
be done, then doubtleſſe God firſt of all muſt haue his
honour, &amp; ſecondlie our parents their dutie and ſeruice.</p>

and it ſtandeth vpon thrée pointes: namelie,
vpon that which is honeſt, vpon the cauſe commanding,

to giue thanks for good turnes: to our parents ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
which begot and brought vs vp. The cauſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding,
is the lawe of God, which chargeth chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to honour their parents. It is profitable ſo to doe.
Whie? Bicauſe of the happie ſucceſſe, good lucke, and long
life, which followeth therevpon.</p>
                  <p>But héere certeine queſtions are to be canuaſſed and
ſifted out, the firſt whereof is this: Doth it not often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
fall out, that godlie and vertuous children die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their time, and too too ſoone? How then ſhall this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of long life vpon earth be ſure, ſteddie, and
vndoubted, to truſt vnto? Doe not vngodlie and vngra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
children liue a long time, and ſée manie daies? I
aunſwere.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:2871:119"/>
This muſt firſt of all bée conſidered, that what earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
benefite, or temporall gifte ſo euer, our moſt louing
and heauenlie Father doth promiſe vs, the ſame is to
bée receiued vpon this condition: to wit, ſo farre foorth
as it turneth vs to good, and ſerueth for the ſaluation of
our ſoule. Wherefore it commeth to paſſe, and that not
ſeldome, that how much more God loueth his childe, ſo
much the ſooner he taketh him out of this life: according
to that ſaieng, <hi>Ablatus eſt iuſtus, &amp;c. The iuſt and
righteous man is taken awaie before his time, leaſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe
ſhould chaunge his diſpoſition, and maliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
marre his manners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, becauſe it happeneth ſometimes, that wicked
and vngratious children liue long: the cauſe thereof is
the long ſuffering and gentleneſſe of God, calling them
to repentance, which if they ſet at naught, they laie
vp for themſelues, treaſure againſt the daie of wrath,
that they maie euen then be tormented with euerlaſting
paines for their ſtifnecked ſtubborneneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Whie doth the Apoſtle call this commaundement,
(<hi>The firſt with promiſe,</hi>) béeing in déede the fourth in
place and order: ſéeing alſo the firſt commaundement
hath a promiſe ioined with it, euen the promiſe of Gods
fauour and mercie? I aunſwere: Wée muſt marke,
that in the lawe of God, promiſe is of two ſortes: the
one generall, the other ſpeciall or particular. That is
a generall promiſe, which the firſt commandement hath
hanging vpon it, which is in déede a promiſe of a vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall
or whole obedience to the lawe of God: that
is to ſaie, it doth not properlie belong to the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement,
but vnto all the commaundements, or to
the vniuerſall and whole obedience of the lawe. The ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
or particular promiſe is that, which particularlie and
ſeuerallie by it ſelfe is tied to ſome one commandement:
as, long life is promiſed in the fourth commandement, to
be the reward of obedience towards our parents,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:2871:120"/>
Furthermore, the demand touching the neceſſitie of
the end of euerie ones life, appointed by deſtinie, is aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
out of this place. For theſe words of the Apoſtle
do manifeſtlie diſproue &amp; ouerthrowe them, which ſaie,
that the terme of life cannot be ſhortened by ſinne &amp; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe:
nor yet prolonged by dutie &amp; obedience. Which if
it ſhould be true, the holie Ghoſt would not in anie wiſe
promiſe happie ſucceſſe, and long life vnto them, which
honour their parents: and it were flat againſt all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
if this obedience ſhould doe no good at all, either for
the proſperous falling out of things, or for the lengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of life.</p>
                  <p>Againſt this falſe imagination therefore of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ikes,
which doth not onelie hurt and rauiſh manners, but
alſe quite putteth out and deſtroieth all exerciſes of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
moſt ſure and ſtedfaſt teſtimonies muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided,
and learned: of which teſtimonies there are thrée
kindes ſpeciallie, which ouerthrowe this neceſſitie of
the terme or end of our life, which deſtinie hath made
certeine, vndoubted, and vnmoueable, as ſaie the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ikes.
the Teſtimonies are theſe, promiſes of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
threatenings for ſtubborneneſſe, and examples of
both.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Teſtimonies of promiſes, becauſe they are manie,

                  <p>Theſe are in a manner, the things which our Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Aegyptians, or Aſtrologers profeſſe themſelues ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
&amp; cunning to tell, before they come to paſſe. For, as
we denie not vnto that moſt noble Art, which they name
naturall Aſtrologie, the knowledge of Natures order,
and the mouings of heauenlie bodies: euen ſo we vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
miſlike their ſuperſtition, who profeſſing indiciall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologie,
(for with this great and glorious title they
decke and garniſh their ſuperſtition,) doe meaſure and
geſſe euerie mans fortune by the houre of his birth. For,
to ſpeake of euerie mans manners, and of their health or
ſickneſſe, ſtrength or weakneſſe, diſpoſitions and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions,
I ſaie and auouch it, that there can no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teintie


<pb n="207" facs="tcp:2871:121"/>
bée concluded by the ſtarres.</p>
                  <p>And although there be ſome conſent &amp; accord of the
ſtars with theſe inferiour bodies, wherby the properties
&amp; eſtates, which peculiarlie belong to bodies, are framed:
and ſometimes alſo perteine to affections in men, which
for the moſt part conſiſt in complexions: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
the Natiuitie-caſters, and Fortune-tellers,
doe farre ouerſhoote the marke, when they giue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
according to the time of birth. For, whiles they
confeſſe, that recourſe muſt be made from the time of
bearing, to the time of begetting: what doe they elſe, but
bewraie their owne vanitie? For, it is not poſſible, that
Natiuitie-caſters and Fortune-tellers ſhould heare and
knowe for certeintie, the verie time of conception or
begetting.</p>
                  <p>For, ſeeing that the time of birth, is not onelie often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſooner than it ſhould be: but alſo (and that not ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome)
put off and delaied the longer, through the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the woman with child, or which lies in labour:
how is it poſſible (I beſéech you) to knowe the verie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
of ones begetting? Speciallie, if but in the miſſing
of a verie few minutes of an houre, there is woont to be
a verie great inclination and mouing of the heauens
and the ſtarres? He therefore that will certeinlie, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedlie
tell before hand, by the time of birth, what
ſhall happen héereafter, he had néede, taking his Aſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lobe,
and holding it in his hand, to ſtand by, euen at the
time of begetting, when the verie deede is a doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
For, it is no ſure truſting of Clockes or Dialls in ſo
weightie a matter.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, ſéeing manie are borne at one and the
ſelfe ſame inſtant of time, and yet nothing like in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and manners, what man béeing well in his wits,
will beléeue, that the manners of men depend vpon the
ſtarres? Beſides that, the force of the seede, which brée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the childe, is much greater than the force of the


<pb n="208" facs="tcp:2871:122"/>
ſtarres, as touching the framing of manners. For we ſee
manie expreſſe the nature and manners of their parents,
of whoſe ſeede they were begotten. As for the ſpirituall
begetting, whereby the manners of the ſaints are fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
it hath no place héere. For, that begetting depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not vpon the ſtarres, but vpon the will of God.</p>
                  <p>Now, touching bodilie health, although I iudge that
in ſome part, the ſtarres haue to deale therein: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
I flatlie denie, that it can be certeinlie
told of Natiuitie-caſters, and Fortune-tellers: becauſe
of the vncerteintie of begetting. Vpon the ſelfe ſame
foundation are their flim flam tales builded, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
that they can tell (as right as a rams horne,) what
ſhall chaunce to euerie man in his life: and this (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth)
they will ſhewe you by the ſtarre, vnder which they
were borne. For as the time of begetting is vncerteine,
as hath bene alreadie declared: ſo the cauſes of chaunces
in a mans life, proceed from ſome other meanes &amp; place.

                  <p>Touching their tittle tattle of the kinde and time of
death, it is a tale as vaine as the reſt. For this is to bée
abidden by, that in one ſkirmiſh, and in one houre thrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
thouſand men were ſlaine, all which (out of doubt)
had diuers and ſundrie birthſtars. It is as true alſo, that
at one inſtant of time, children haue bene borne, who
notwithſtanding died at ſeuerall times.</p>
                  <p>Out of theſe I conclude, that their ſuperſtition is
moſt vaine, which will haue mens chaunces and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
ſubiect to their iudiciall Aſtrologie. Let them
gainſaie what they can, theſe reaſons maie ſuffice to
ſpie their iugglings, and to auoid their wiles. The birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarre


<pb n="209" facs="tcp:2871:122"/>
of a man, it dependeth either vpon the time of his
conception or begetting, or elſe vpon the time of his nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie
or birth: but both are vncerteine vnto ſuch, which
holding in their hand an Aſtralobe, ſtand not by them
that are a begetting, and them that are in childbearing.
Againe, if the iſſue of things commonlie called (<hi>Lucke</hi>)
depend vpon the ſtarres, then ſhall the deſtinie of all ſuch
as haue one and the ſelfe ſame birthſtarre, be alike: but
euerie one that is well in his wits, will ſaie that this is
ſtarke falſe.</p>
                  <p>If good lucke depend vpon the ſtarres, then ſhall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to Godward, depend vpon them too. For this is the
proper cauſe of that. Furthermore, if the kind of death,
and all manner of miſfortunes depend vpon the ſtarres,
then ſhall ſinnes depend vpon them too: which is hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
to be ſpoken. Séeing the caſe ſtandeth ſo, I wiſh
the wiſer ſort to be warned, that as it is méete to ſette
ſtore by true and naturall Aſtrologie, which is verie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
in our life, and a notable and excellent gifte of
God: ſo to take héede and auoid theſe deceiuers, theſe
Iacke iugglers, and common Couſeners, which profeſſe
that they can certeinlie tell, by birthſtarres, what good
lucke, and what ill lucke, ſhall light vpon a man, or a
woman in this life: ſpeciallie, ſéeing that ſuperſtition is
meruellous hurtfull to good manners, flat againſt honeſt
and good lawes, and as it were a diſgracing of God: who
witneſſeth, his owne ſelfe, that as a proſperous eſtate,
and happie ſucceſſe of all things, are the rewards of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
ſo miſfortunes, and all kinde of diſcommodities
and miſchiefes are the puniſhments of ſinne.</p>
                  <p>As for that which ſome bring in, going about to make
the beſt of theſe mens madneſſe: to wit, that the ſtarres
haue not a ſure, a ſtedfaſt, &amp; an vndoubted working: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
that ſtarres doe gentlie incline or drawe to, and
not roughlie compell: I ſaie ſo too, ſo that this inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or bending be referred onelie to bodies, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions


<pb n="210" facs="tcp:2871:123"/>
of bodies, by their leaue: and not vnto the
mindes &amp; willes of men, which haue in them <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
that is, election or choice: which is an abilitie,
not bound, but at libertie, whereby the will hauing great
choice of things, taketh this and that, according as it is
lead: as, to followe vertue, and auoid vice.</p>
                  <p>But this is little agreeable to the goodlie and gaie
promiſes of our Chaldeans, Aegyptians, or Aſtrologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
who will haue their Art and cunning ſo firme, faſt,
and vnmoueable, as they dare boaſt, that nothing can
be done, but according to the rule and appointment ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
For, an inclination is not a neceſſarie cauſe of anie
thing, ſpeciallie in men, who maie be gouerned by the
iudgement of the minde, euen contrarie to inclination, if
it be euill. And, to hold my peace a while, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more fooliſh and vnfit, than certeinlie to conceiue the
effect and full accompliſhment of a thing, vpon a péece of
a cauſe, the ſame being of the baſeſt order, &amp; leaſt force
to bring forth an effect and full accompliſhment.</p>
                  <p>Now, in that the Mathematicians can foreſhew the
Eclipſes, and change of weather: this commeth to paſſe,
becauſe they depend vpon certeine cauſes, which cauſes,
according to the ordinance of God, do ueuer alter or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
And theſe: to wit, change of weather dependeth vpon
the inclination of ſtarres, which inclination neuer decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
for the moſt part in things that lacke life. Wherfore
as Eclipſes ſtand vpon demonſtration: ſo change of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſtandeth vpon coniecture. It is far otherwiſe in the
reaſonable abilities of the minde, ſpeciallie in the wils
of men, which are indifferenlie inclined vnto contraries,
as hath bene alreadie ſhewed.</p>

THis is the fourth ſpecialtie, anſwerable to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
For, as that required of children their obedience:
ſo this aſketh a dutie of parents, like in proportion and
meaſure towards their children. And in the firſt place,
the Apoſtle ſetteth downe, of what things fathers ought
to take heede: ſecondlie, what they ought to do with their
children. He giueth them warning, to beware in anie
wiſe of too ſtreight and ſharpe handling, ſeaſoned with
no loue or gentleneſſe. For hard handling, wherein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
no fatherlie loue or affection, hath manie incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences
ioined with it. For, firſt of all, it maketh their
children dizzards, dolts, blocke-heads, heauie-hearted,
and dull of ſpirit. Secondlie, it bréedeth hatred by little
and little in their tender mindes, againſt their parents.
Thirdlie, this hatred, which they haue continued, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
place for ſtubborneſſe and rebellion: ſo that, when
thou wouldeſt win them by gentlenes &amp; faire meanes,
the miſchiefe being ſo far growne, thy labour is but loſt.
But where parents execute their rule and power well o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
their children: there doth authoritie hold them in
feare, &amp; willingneſſe to obeie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and kindneſſe keepeth them
in loue and readineſſe to pleaſe. As therefore too much
making, and as we ſaie, cockering of our children, is the
next waie to make them ſluggards, &amp; wantons: ſo a wiſe
bringing of them vp, &amp; a right and orderlie vſing of them,
maketh them quicke ſpirited, honeſt, &amp; thriftie. Now, the
apoſtle addeth, what parents ought to do with their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and that brieflie, when he ſaith: (<hi>But bring them vp
in inſtruction, &amp; information of the Lord.</hi>) Saint <hi>Paule</hi>
in this place requireth thrée things of godlie parents.
Firſt, (<hi>Bringing of them vp,</hi>) which thing parents are

maie be enured to the knowledge of godlie &amp; honeſt

in ſo much that their wiſe conuerſation and


<pb n="212" facs="tcp:2871:124"/>

                  <p>SAint <hi>Paule</hi> addeth a confirmation or proofe, taken
from a well knowne ſpeach vttered in Scripture.
For God beateth much vpon this promiſe euerie where
in the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Ruth. 2. 12</note> that he will remember our labour,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 26. 23.</note> and
the worke of our hands, promiſing a large reward to all
them that obeie his voice.<note place="margin">2. Chro. 15. 7.</note> Seruants therefore ought to
haue an eie to this promiſe in their labours and handie
works,<note place="margin">Pſal 18. 20</note> making this full account,<note place="margin">Prou. 13. 21</note> that God is true &amp; iuſt
in his promiſes,<note place="margin">Eſaie. 1. 19</note> and that the reward promiſed for their
obedience,<note place="margin">Eſaie. 40. 10.</note> is to be looked for from God.</p>
                  <p>But, becauſe the Papiſts abuſe ſhamefullie, theſe and
ſuch like ſaiengs,<note place="margin">Eſaie. 62. 11.</note> concerning the rewards of good works,
to the ouerthrowing of Gods truth touching frée iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:<note place="margin">Eſaie. 65 6 7. 8. 9.</note>
therefore I will brieflie declare, how theſe and
ſuch like ſaiengs are to be vnderſtood,<note place="margin">Iere. 31. 14</note> according to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogie,<note place="margin">Tob. 4. 19.</note>
proportion,<note place="margin">Eccle. 11. 17.</note> and rule of faith.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all we muſt knowe, that theſe and ſuch like
generall promiſes,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 11.</note> are to bée applied vnto all men, but
not after one and the ſelfe ſame manner.<note place="margin">Pſal. 62. 12</note> For, there are
two ſorts of men, according to whoſe diuerſitie, the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the promiſe muſt be made. For, ſome are god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
that is to ſaie, borne a new, and the children of God.
Otherſome are vngodlie, not borne a new, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of wrath.</p>
                  <p>If thou wilt applie the ſaiengs touching promiſes of
rewards, to the latter ſort of men, thou proueſt nothing
elſe thereby, but that they remaine the children of wrath,
vnder wrath. For, they are able to doe nothing that can
pleaſe God, although their workes heare an outward
ſhew of ſpeciall holineſſe. For, this Oracle of the holie
Ghoſt abideth alwaies ſure and ſtedfaſt, <hi>Impoſsibile eſt
placere Deo, ſine fide: It is vnpoſsible to pleaſe God,
without faith.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> So long therefore as men are voide of


<pb n="217" facs="tcp:2871:126"/>
faith, they are like rotten trées, which can beare no fruit.
So that it maie be concluded héerevpon, euen by moſt
manifeſt and ſound proofe, that when God giueth the
wicked, the reward due to their works, hell and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhall be their recompenſe.</p>
                  <p>But if thou wilt applie the promiſes of reward to the
former ſort of men: to wit, the children of God, then muſt
thou thinke vpon theſe points in thy mind, orderlie. Firſt
of all, thou ſhalt build vpon this, that the godlie are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
from the rigour of the lawe, through Chriſt, as S.
<hi>Paule</hi> ſaith:<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſtus redemit nos, &amp;c. Chriſt hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
vs from the curſſe of the lawe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 4. 5</note> 
                     <hi>beeing made a
curſſe for vs.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tit. 2. 14.</note> The condemning ſentence therefore of the
lawe, cannot hurt the children of God: that is to ſaie, the
beléeuers. Secondlie thou ſhalt conſider, that the beléeuer
maie pleaſe God, by faith, and maie be an heire of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
life. Thirdlie, thou ſhalt perſuade thy ſelfe, that
God doth not onelie require new obedience at the hands
of the beléeuer: but alſo promiſeth a reward: howbeit,
not of dutie, for the worthineſſe of the worke: but of his
méere grace, for his fatherlie promiſe ſake. Fourthlie, thou
ſhalt make this reckoning, that works done by faith, are
witneſſes of faith: and the effects of faith, moſt aſſured
ſignes of their proper cauſe. Héerevpon God is ſaid to
paie euerie man his reward, according to his workes:
becauſe works are true euidences of faith, and the feare
of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>This ſolution or anſwere maie trimlie be made plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
by a compariſon betwéene the heauenlie Father, and
an earthlie Father. For, as an earthlie Father doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
vnto his children, ſometime a large inheritaunce,
ſometime a rich reward, &amp;c. as the wages or reward for
their worke, if they ſhew themſelues dutifull and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
although they were not heires before by nature:
euen ſo God the heauenlie Father, promiſeth to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
whom he loueth in Chriſt, euerlaſting life, as the


<pb n="218" facs="tcp:2871:127"/>
reward for their obedience ſhewed by faith. The promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of reward, being thus applied, ſtirre vp in the godlie
an endeuour to obeie: beſides that, they make nothing at

of one to an other, in their calling: and it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth
that which went next before. The Apoſtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
two things of maiſters. The firſt is, (<hi>To do the
ſame things vnto them:</hi>) to wit, vnto their ſeruants, that
they kéeping the right rule of proportion, maie ſhew to
their ſeruants good will againe for their ſeruice. For, the
Apoſtle doth not require in maiſters, ſuch and the like la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
ſuch and the like diligence, ſuch and the like ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
as he requireth in ſeruants: but a dutie anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to their place and perſon.</p>
                  <p>Let the ſeruant therefore labour faithfullie, and let
the maiſter againe on the other ſide, make much of his
ſeruant, giue him his wages for his worke, &amp; ſée that hée
lacke nothing that is neceſſarie: all this muſt be done,
(<hi>In Domino, In the Lord.</hi>) For this is the meaning of
the Apoſtle, when he ſaith, (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>The ſame things,</hi>)
to the intent, that a iuſt proportion of duetie might bée
kept, betwéene the maiſter, and the ſeruant. The ſecond
thing, which the Apoſtle requireth of maiſters, is: (<hi>To
put awaie threatning.</hi>) By which word of (<hi>Threatning,</hi>)
he meaneth all manner of hard handling towardes
their ſeruants.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="219" facs="tcp:2871:127"/>
To this exhortation he addeth a reaſon drawne from
like matters, and ſaith: (<hi>And knowe, that euen your
maiſter alſo is in heauen.</hi>) As if he ſhould ſaie, There is
no cauſe whie ye ſhuld ouercrowe your ſeruants, &amp; think
your ſelues iollie fellowes, in reſpect of them, for your
maiſterſhip ſake: no, no. For, euen ye your ſelues haue
a maiſter alſo in heauen, who can be with you to bring,
notwithſtanding your maiſterſhip, or the pouertie of your
ſeruants, which are not things that he is lead by. For,
there is no reſpect of perſon with him, as there is with
wicked and vniuſt iudges: but according to the truth &amp;
vprightneſſe of the cauſe, ſo he frameth his iudgement.
<hi>For the Lord</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Ambroſe) is a righteous iudge,
looking vpon the cauſe, and not eieng the perſon.</hi> The
word (<hi>Perſon</hi>) in this place, doeth not ſignifie the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
but the qualitie: that is to ſaie, whatſoeuer
is regarded in iudgement, beſides the trueth of the
cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe wordes therefore (<hi>Of reſpect of perſons,</hi>)
ought not to be wreſted to a contrarie meaning. For,
there is in them a compariſon betwéene God and men
Men (for the moſt part) giue iudgement after the things
which they ſée with their eies, and which outwardlie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare:
they are moued with linage or birth, with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
with kinred, and with friendſhippe: againe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with hatred, with loue, and other affections:
whereby it commeth to paſſe, that they ouerſlipping the
trueth and equitie of the cauſe, giue wrong iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>As for God, whoſe iudgement is right, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to truth, he chaungeth not his righteous iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the maiſters ſake, not yet for the ſeruaunts
ſake: but he iudgeth according to the truth of the cauſe,
not hauing anie regard to this or that perſon. For hée
followeth without ſtint, &amp; inceſſantlie, this vnremoueable
rule of iuſtice. For, he receiueth the repentant into fauor:


<pb n="220" facs="tcp:2871:128"/>
as for the vnrepentant and ſtubborne, he cannot awaie
with them, they are outlawes.</p>
                  <p>Héerehence all godlie maiſters haue to learne to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

as their ſeruants maiſter: and let them be mindfull, by
his example, not to ſet their ſeruants at naught, becauſe
of their outward perſon: that is to ſaie, their vile &amp; baſe
eſtate: but rather to make more account of them. And
whie? For, although the condition of ſeruaunts differ

                  <p>THE Apoſtle returneth to a generall exhortation,
where (after the doctrine of grace, after exhortations
to vertues worthie of the Goſpell, &amp; after peculiar duties
belonging to certeine ſeuerall degrées of men,) he calleth
vpon all the godlie, vnder the name of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> and
exhorteth them to be ſtrong in minde: taking vnto them
ſuch armour, as maie withſtand the ſnares of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell:
a verie mightie enimie doubtleſſe, if we ſhall
looke vpon his manifolde aſſaultes, his ſubtile vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minings,
his ſundrie waies of laieng in waite,
and our owne ſtrength, which is but weakneſſe:
howbeit, a diſcomfited enimie, and not able to reſiſt, if
we beholde him, in whome reſteth our whole power


<pb n="221" facs="tcp:2871:128"/>
and valiantneſſe. For, when we leane vpon him, with a
ſteddie and ſure confidence: it commeth to paſſe, that the
Diuell, be he neuer ſo big, ſuffereth ſhipwracke himſelfe,
though he ſtirreth vp tempeſts, and raiſeth ſtormes, to
ſinke the ſeruants of God.</p>
                  <p>In the Apoſtles words, the manner of exhortation is
to be marked. He ſaith thus, (<hi>Be ſtrong in the Lord, &amp;
in the power of his might.</hi>) Firſt, there is ſignified vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
to vs, by this manner of exhorting, that without the
Lord, and without his mightie power, we can preuaile
nothing at all, againſt ſo terrible and violent an enimie
as the Diuell. Secondlie, that we being made members
of the Lord, are alſo made ſtrong by his ſtrength, to reſiſt
Sathan and his fierie weapons.</p>
                  <p>Of this ſtrength we are then made partakers, when
we truſt to, and ſtaie vpon our Lord Chriſt, with a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
confidence, when we are made the children of God,
and the members of Chriſt: which is euident by
theſe words of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Haec eſt victoria, &amp;c. This
is the victorie which ouercommeth the world, euen
your faith.</hi> Therefore, that ſtrength which maketh vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to withſtand Sathan and the fleſh, is not of nature,
but of grace. And Chriſt is that ſtrength, on whom wée
laie faſt hold by faith. Héereto ſerueth that ſaieng of
Saint <hi>Paule,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Tim. 18. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>Milita honeſtam militiam, &amp;c. Fight a

                  </p>
                  <p>And although this ſtrength commeth from the Lord:
yea, the Lord himſelfe is that ſtrength: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
when the Apoſtle exhorteth vs to (<hi>Be ſtrong,</hi>)
and to (<hi>Put on the whole armour of God,</hi>) he requireth
our trauell and endeuour. It is neceſſarie therefore, that
our will ſhould runne actiuelie therewithall, and not
onelie paſſiuelie. For, as we maie, if we will, caſt off
faith, and reſiſt the holie ſpirit: ſo being conuerted and


<pb n="222" facs="tcp:2871:129"/>
turned, we can kéepe faith and the holie ſpirit by grace,
and ſtirre vp the gift of God in vs,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 1. 6.</note> as Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.
For, the gift of God is a certeine quicke and liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
flame, as it were, in the hearts of beléeuers, which
Sathan and the fleſh can ſmoother and choke vp: whiles
we lie ſlugging &amp; ſnorting in our neaſts. Wherefore, S.
<hi>Paules</hi> warning to <hi>Timothie</hi> is not in waſte, where he
ſaith:<note place="margin">2. Tim. 1. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Stirre vp the gift of God which is in thee.</hi> This
gift therefore muſt not be quenched and put out. To
the ſame purpoſe alſo ſerueth that ſaieng of the Apoſtle
to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Theſ 5. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>Quench not the ſpirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is the part of a Chriſtian man therefore to walke
warilie, and carefullie before his God: and euermore to
take héede, that he loſe not the gifte, which he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
by grace, through his owne ſlothfulneſſe and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
To this belong all exerciſes of goodlineſſe, all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
of godlie Shepheards, and the whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
of the Church. For, theſe are certeine bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
as it were, which doe quicken and raiſe vp
the flame kindeled in vs from aboue, by Gods good
grace.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, this place of Saint <hi>Paule</hi> doeth teach all
the godlie, that they are ſet in a verie hot and heauie ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh,
where they muſt fight it out, euerie one in his
ſtanding: looking for no truce, becauſe there is none to
be graunted. For, our aduerſarie is alwaies harneſſed,
weaponed, and keeping the field. And indéede (as Saint
<hi>Peter</hi> ſaith) <hi>He neuer reſteth raunging vp and downe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 8.</note>
                     <hi>roaring (like a Lioneſſe that hath loſt her whelpes,) and
ſeeketh whom he may deuoure.</hi> This doth he one while
by offering open violence, another while by craftie ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng
in waite.</p>
                  <p>For, when he putteth men in the head, to caſt from
them, as a thing of naught, the doctrine of God: when
he bringeth in a traine of moſt filthie manners, ſlatte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the lawe of God: when he filleth all places with


<pb n="223" facs="tcp:2871:129"/>
offenſes, and ſlaughters: then offereth he open violence,
and profeſſeth himſelfe the ſworne enimie of Chriſt. But
when he diſguiſeth himſelfe into an angel of light, and
putteth vpon vices the vizards of vertues: when he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
ſuperſtition a counterfaite face of holineſſe: when
he dealeth in this wiſe, then he lieth in waite craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilie
to catch vs. To them therefore, which are
not furniſhed with the whole armour of GOD,
the diuell is more terrible, furious, violent, and preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
                  <p>What ſhall we gather by this? Séeing the life of a
Chriſtian in this world, is a certeine ſpirituall warfare
and that againſt ſo mightie an enimie: it is méete vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
that we be like to, and alſo plaie the part of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
hearted ſouldiers, whom ſwilling, ſurfetting, or
ſléeping make not ſlouthfull &amp; heauie-headed, béeing to
ſéeke in the time of moſt néede: but alwaies prouided
and prepared at the pinch, readie to fight with their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
hand to hand: leaſt they ſhould be ſette vpon,
and ouerrunne at vnwares. Thus if we doe, we néed
doubt no daunger. For, when the Apoſtle addeth theſe
words, (<hi>That ye maie be able to ſtand againſt the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults
of the diuell,</hi>) he meaneth, that we ſhall ouercome,
and get the victorie, if we holding faſt the armour, which
God reacheth out and giueth vs, ſhall fight ſtoutlie vnder
Chriſts banner, hauing full confidence in him.</p>
                  <p>The righteſt waie to ouercome this inuiſible enimie, is,
if thou begin with thine inward and houſhold enimie, to
tame him, &amp; bring him vnder. This enimie is the fleſh, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
whom the ſpirit maketh batell. For the fleſh temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
vs with nothing, but that fleſhlie thing, which bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
rule in vs: &amp; thither ſhe bendeth her full force, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhe ſéeth men inclined of their owne accord. And ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
fleſh turneth our owne weakneſſe, to the weapons of her
wickedneſſe, &amp; vſeth the diſeaſe of our owne fleſh againſt
our ſelues: that is to ſaie, ſetteth vpon vs with our owne


<pb n="224" facs="tcp:2871:130"/>
affections, luſts, and deſires, as it were with warlike en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines.</p>
                  <p>But if anie one demand, why God giueth the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
leaue to haunt and laie ſuch hard hold at mankind,
in this manner? <hi>Athanaſius</hi> anſwereth in theſe words:

                  <p>THis is a reaſon of the exhortation, drawne from the
greatneſſe of the daunger. For, after he hath ſet foorth
the fearefull power of a fearefull enimie, he ſtirreth vp
the <hi>Epheſians</hi> to the greater watchfulneſſe, leaſt they
ſhould ſuffer themſelues to be ouerrunne of ſo craftie

this ende: that thereby he might make vs the more

readie and couragious to fight. Now, in that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſaith, (<hi>We wreſtle not againſt fleſh and bloud,</hi>) hee
doth not denie, that we muſt haue a ſkirmiſhing againſt

                  <p>By this manner of ſpeach therefore, the greatneſſe of
the daunger, the kinde of the battell, and the qualitie of
the enimies, are ſignified and meant. Our enimies are
not fleſh and bloud: therefore our enimies are ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
The battell which we muſt abide, is ſpirituall, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and daungerous: therefore ſpirituall weapons are

and that they hold them vnder their yoke, which

For this word (<hi>World</hi>) doth not ſignifie in this place,
this goodlie frame and compaſſe, created of God, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed

ſignifieth worldlie minded men, ſléeping in ſinne, and the
verie ſinnes themſelues: as plainlie is proued by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
following, when he defineth the world to be dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
Now, it is commonlie knowne, that by darkneſſe,
the ignoraunce of God, and anie other ſinne whatſoeuer,
is meant. As therefore Chriſt ruleth and gouerneth
them, which are light: ſo the diuell pricketh forward,
and throweth headlong into all miſchiefe and villanie,
thoſe that are darkneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Laſtlie, when Saint <hi>Paule</hi> addeth theſe words:
(<hi>Againſt ſpirituall wickedneſſes, which are in the
high places,</hi>) he giueth vs thereby to note, the nature
of our enimies. For, they are ſpirituall enimies.
Thereby alſo he ſheweth vs, that they are ſwift and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible:
by the former we are willed to take heed, becauſe
the daunger is great: by the latter to beware, becauſe
the ſnares and aſſaults are ſecreat. For, when our
enimies are inuiſible, they are about our ouerthrowe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
then, when we doe leaſt of all thinke it. We ought
therefore to bée preciſe and warie, leaſt we be ſet vpon,


<pb n="227" facs="tcp:2871:131"/>
ſooner than wée thinke.</p>
                  <p>Héereto ſerueth the word (<hi>Wickedneſſes,</hi>) whereby,
as the endeuour and order of diuels to deceiue is ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
ſo are the godlie warned, continuallie to watch and

will take no conditions of trace, nor enter into anie

Touching that which is added: to wit, (<hi>In the high or

vnderſtandeth the firmament of the world, by high

things. And ſurelie, although the matter be ſo indéed: yet
notwithſtanding, the plainer meaning is this: to wit,
that the place is noted from whence our enimies ſhall lay
load at vs. For, they ſet vpon vs from aloft, &amp; are euen
vpon our neckes: in ſuch ſort, that they neuer reſt from

therfore wherto ſerueth it? Euen to put vs in mind, how

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:2871:132"/>

méete, that Chriſtians, being furniſhed with the whole
armour, or complet harneſſe of God, ſet themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their enimies: at this time ſpeciallie, when all
things are full of doubts, troubles, and dangers. For, the
Apoſtle calleth the whole time of ſkirmiſhing, by the
name of (<hi>The euill daie:</hi>) which indéed is not euill of
it ſelfe, or by nature: but it is called euill, in reſpect of
the troubles and dangers which then doe chaunce. The
reaſon of the propoſition rehearſed, is verie full of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
For, it promiſeth, that the children of God ſhall
certeinlie haue the victorie, if ſo be they hold out, and
abide the brunts ſtoutlie, vnder the banner of Chriſt.
For, when the Apoſtle ſaith, (<hi>And hauing finiſhed all
things, ſtand faſt,</hi>) he requireth labour in ſkirmiſhing,
without wearineſſe, and continuall conſtancie, euen
till the encounter be done: that is to ſaie, euen to the end
of this fraile life, after which ſhall followe a glorious tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph

                  <p>Out of this place of Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> our Auncients ſéeme

The Church militant: the other, The Church trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant:
not that they are two ſundrie Churches: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

For, whiles we are in this life, our whole life is a kinde

take from Gods people this ſword of the ſpirit: not onlie
by falſifieng &amp; wreſting the Scripture to a contrarie and

ſhould not be ſet forth in a common and knowne tongue,
for the behoofe of Gods Church, that euerie one might

THe Apoſtle hauing furniſhed the Chriſtian ſouldier,
with double armour, bringeth him vnto his Captaine,
to march ſtoutlie and manfullie vnder his banner:
and if the ſkirmiſh bée too daungerous, to flie for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
vnto his Captaine, leaſt he be ouertroden of his
mightie and ſtrong enimie. For, by praier we come to
Chriſt our Captaine: prouided alwaies, that this praier
be not a babbling with the lips: but a lifting vp of the
heart in faith vnto God, ioined with a deuout ſound of the
mouth, all béeing done with a ſure tr<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>, and confidence
in Chriſt our mediatour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now, what it is to praie in ſpirit, Saint</hi> Ambroſe
<hi>ſheweth by a verie trimme antitheſis or oppoſition, in
theſe words:</hi> Hoc eſt ergo, &amp;c. This is therefore to praie
alwaies in ſpirit, euen to make our praiers vnto God,
with a cleane conſcience, and an vpright faith. For, hee
praieth in the fleſh, which praieth with a defiled mind.
<hi>Thus farre hée.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for that which is added: to wit, (<hi>For all Saints, &amp;
for me,</hi>) it ſerueth to this end, that the endeuour of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couring
and aſſiſting one an other in this ſpirituall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
might bée commended vnto vs. For, we ought to
vſe theſe two weapons: namelie, (<hi>The ſword of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>)
and (<hi>Praier,</hi>) not onelie in defence of our ſelues:
but alſo for the helping and aiding of others, ſpeciallie,
when we ſée them in danger. And although we muſt
praie for all men: yet notwithſtanding, we muſt haue
principall care and regard to the Saints: that is to ſaie,
to them that are ioined with vs by faith and loue, béeing
in déede members of one, and the ſame myſticall bodie, as
well as we.</p>
                  <p>Touching the words of the Apoſtle laſt ſet downe:
(<hi>And for me,</hi>) they put the godlie in minde of their due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
which is, to praie continuallie for the miniſters of
Gods word, and for the preſeruation and maintenance of
their miniſterie.</p>

praie for him, are ſet downe, &amp; they are thrée in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
The firſt, (<hi>That he might open his mouth boldlie:</hi>)
that is to ſaie, that a conſtant mind might be giuen vnto
him, whereby to confeſſe and profeſſe the doctrine of the
Goſpell, without feare, before the whole world. For, he
calleth the opening of the mouth, a frée confeſſion of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
ſimple, plaine, cléere, without diſſembling, counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting,
and cauilling, without feare, and doubting to
diſpleaſe, which often times doth ſo ſhut vp and make faſt
the mouthes of a great manie, as they remember not,
that it is the ambaſſage of Chriſt Ieſus, which they haue
in charge.</p>
                  <p>Héere all the godlie, and ſpeciallie the miniſters of
Gods word, are admoniſhed, what boldneſſe of confeſſion
ought to be in them: to wit, that no feare, no heauineſſe,
no threatenings, no torments make them giue ouer:
but that they maie teach and preach the Goſpell with a
courage.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond cauſe is, (<hi>That I ſhould publiſh the
ſecret of the Goſpell.</hi>) For, this is peculiar to <hi>Paule,</hi>
and the miniſters of the word, that by preaching, euen
with their owne voice, they ſhould publiſh the ſecret of
the Goſpell. This place therefore is at defiance with
the Anabaptiſts, who coutemning the worde vttered by
voice, looke for reuelatious, viſions, inſpirations, and
I wot not what. But what is that which is added.</p>
