         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>(Not with more Loyalty but greater Wit)</l>
               <l>'Twas celebrated with a Noon-day-Star,</l>
               <l>And wondring Princes alſo came from far,</l>
               <l>Congratulating this moſt happy Iſle:</l>
               <l>Happy indeed! 'twas one continued Smile.</l>
               <l>But ſoon alas black Tempeſts did ariſe,</l>
               <l>Eclips'd this Star, our Hearts drown'd, and our Eyes,</l>
               <l>Hell by his Saints this Princes Father ſlew,</l>
               <l>Slew? Murther'd! Martyr'd!—ah Zealous Crew!</l>
               <l>—By Heav'n this is not Poetty—'Tis true!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>'Tis a miſtake ſure—<hi>Puritans</hi> do this!</l>
               <l>O tell it not in <hi>Gath &amp;c.—</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Permit me Reader to be ſtartled here,</l>
               <l>Humanity would ſtop to drop a Tear,</l>
               <l>Had I no Loyalty, no Love nor Fear.</l>
               <l>The Father Dead! what next is to be done?</l>
               <l>Surely the Crowning his illuſtrious Son;</l>
               <l>[That expiate might in part] ah! nothing leſs;</l>
               <l>They'l kill the Heir, the Vineyard then poſſeſs.</l>
               <l>Therefore when Forces he to <hi>Worceſter</hi> brought</l>
               <l>To claim his Rright, thoſe Sons of <hi>Belial</hi> fought</l>
               <l>Againſt their King: by fraud and force o'rcame;</l>
               <l>And to extirpate Root, and Branch and Name,</l>
               <l>They ſet a thouſand pounds upon his Head,</l>
               <l>[Their Head] to bring great <hi>Charles</hi> alive or dead:</l>
               <l>But God the Ruler both of Peace and War,</l>
               <l>Did ſecretly preſerve this falling-Star;</l>
               <l>And by a feeble Inſtrument, a Woman,</l>
               <l>Fool'd all their Toyls: to ſhew Kings are not common.</l>
               <l>Say not, then, ſay not Miracles are ceas'd,</l>
               <l>This muſt be one, to a conſidering Breaſt.</l>

               <l>Where ſeveral years he liv'd obſcure and poor;</l>
               <l>His loyal Subjects begg'd from Dore to Dore,</l>
               <l>Brewers and Tinkers did uſurp his Throne,</l>
               <l>Nobles were murther'd Biſhops tumbled down;</l>
               <l>And though <hi>France</hi> proffered Men and money (too)</l>
               <l>To ſcourge Rebellion, miſta'n Zeal ſubdue;</l>
               <l>Yet leaſt our antient Faith ſhould ſullyed be</l>

               <l>Submitting rather to be thus abus'd:</l>
               <l>Then that his Subjects ſhould by Forreign Force</l>

               <l>O Miracle of Mercy, and of Love!</l>
               <l>That ſuch flagitious Crimes could never move!</l>
               <l>He loſt this Crown, to ſecure that above:</l>

               <l>And this *<note place="margin">1660.</note> day plac'd him on his Fathers Throne.</l>
               <l>On which ſtupendious Miracles of Fate,</l>
               <l>It well becomes us to expatiate</l>
               <l>That day! that ſecond Birth of <hi>Charles</hi> our King,</l>
               <l>True Laws, true Faith, new Life, new joys did bring.</l>
               <l>All were tranſported, 'twas a continual Spring,</l>
               <l>Not one ſower Look appeard in any thing</l>
               <l>Except thoſe Fiends, whoſe Foreheads branded were</l>

               <l>Swarms of three Kingdoms <hi>Subjects</hi> did him throng,</l>
               <l>The Roads brought forth all ſorts of Flowers, the Trees</l>
               <l>Bedeck'd with Garlands, bent their humble Knees.</l>
               <l>The Bells from every neighbourig place did ſound,</l>
               <l>All Loyal Hearts with Extaſies abound:</l>
               <l>But when to the Metropolis he came</l>
               <l>Bleſs me! one could not gueſs it was the ſame</l>
