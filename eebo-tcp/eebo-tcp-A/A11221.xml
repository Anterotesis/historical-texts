            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> made by the City of <hi>London;</hi> For <hi>Regulating the Markets of</hi> Blackwell-Hall, <hi>and</hi> Leaden-Hall: do upon an impartial Survey and Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of each, look upon the <hi>Clothiers</hi> to be much abuſed and ſeduced into the ſaid Complaints by ſome evil Inſtruments between them and the City, who labour to make a Difference where none was, or can be, if rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood: and having vizzorded their own contemptible Intereſt (under the <hi>Clothiers</hi> Name) do carry on their private deſignes, to the manifeſt Injury both of the Citizen and Clothier.</p>
            <p>The matters complained of are chiefly three;</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>The Reſtraining their Clothes to lye 20. dayes in the Market, except Sold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The Raiſing the Duty of Hallage: And a new Impoſition of a Duty for the Lying of their Goods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Requiring of their Factors to be Approved and Admitted by the Lord Maior and Court of Aldermen, and to enter into a Recognizance of 200 l. that they ſhall not Buy in, nor Sell out of the Markets any of thoſe Commodities they are Factors in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not meddle with the Cities indubitable Right to make Lawes, for Conſervation of their own Priviledges and Cuſtomes; nor Diſcourſe the Legality of this perticular Act of Common-Councel, being out of my Sphere, and already done by Learned Councel before the Reverend Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of His Majeſties Court of Common Pleas: But only argue the reaſonableneſſe of it from grounds of Common Benefit and Advantage to the <hi>Clothiers</hi> themſelves, That it may appear (as is alledged) that the <hi>Clothiers</hi> are abuſed into this Complaint. And</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>As to the Reſtraining their Clothes to lye 20 dayes in the Market, except ſold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> A <hi>Clothier</hi> bringing his Goods to <hi>London</hi> to be ſold: It will not by any rational Man be preſumed, that he brought them ſo many ſcore Miles with Intent to remove them out of the Market till he had tryed it for their Sale two or three Market dayes at the leaſt: and therefore the City could not imagine they did the <hi>Clothier</hi> any wrong by letting his Cloth lye in a publique Market ready for Sale, with ſo good Accommodations (that no Citizen of <hi>London</hi> hath the like) for 20 dayes: They only intending by that Clauſe,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:10999:2"/>
1. <hi>To abate the Rigour of former Acts of Common Councel, which injoynes the lying of their Goods in the Market till they were ſold: which though much more ſevere, yet neither then, or ſince (till now) was it either counted a grievance by the Clothier, or never complained of as ſuch: Yet the City in Tenderneſſe to the Clothier by this Act, thought a convenient time of 20 dayes more fitting to be Inſerted; that might in ſome meaſure obviate the Abuſes done to the City on the one hand, and be a Benefit and Advantage to the Clothier on the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That Forraign Buying and Selling might the better be prevented, which by preſent Removing of Goods out of the Markets have been ſold to Forraigners and Aliens,</hi> Dutch, French, Germans, <hi>and other Nations, in private places and Warehouſes, without all poſſibility of Diſcovery, to the almoſt Ruine of the Cities Franchiſes, and great Diſcouragement and almoſt Deſtruction of Trade in the hands of our own</hi> Engliſh <hi>Merchants. And beſides, ſuch private and Clandeſtine Sales have given the greateſt Countenance to the making of ſuch bad and deceitful Cloth, to the general diſrepute of our Manufacture in Forreign parts; and raiſing the Credit, and much advancing the Trade of Forreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made-Cloth: which in time may have a dangerous tendency to the utter overthrowing of our Engliſh Trade, and putting of it into the hands of Aliens and Forraigners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>For the Clothiers good, That he may have the Benefit of the publique Market, and not have his Goods removed into Holes and Corners to gratifie the private deſigns of his ſubtile Factors; oft proving to the Clothiers Hinderance, by undervaluing Sales; or to his Hazzard, by Sales to Irreſponſible perſons: Having no Check upon his Factor as he hath in the publique Market, by the Regiſters that the Act or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to be kept of all Goods brought in, ſold, and to whom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe being the ends of the 20 dayes, how can their Accompliſhment (if the time were ſtrictly ſtood upon, which is not) be any Greivance or Inconveniency to the <hi>Clothier?</hi> Conſidering</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>There is no penalty Annexed by the Act upon any Clothiers Removal of his Goods before the 20. dayes are expired, and their Printed Petition is miſtaken that affirms there is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>There Goods lyes in a publique Market, where they are expos'd to Sale three dayes in every Week, to all perſons that come into the Halls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>They have Security for their Goods all that time, if they ſhould be ſtollen, or the Markets broke open, or any way miſcarry: and no place in</hi> London <hi>will afford the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>They have moſt neat Accommodations for the laying up of their Goods, better cannot be in any private Houſe, or Warehouſe whatſoever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>They are much more ſafe from all Hazzards and dangers of Fire then any Factors Houſe or Warehouſe can be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>They pay nothing for all this for three Weeks time (the City intending to take off for the lying for the latter 14. dayes, as well as for the firſt Week.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I do believe: That there is not an Ingenious <hi>Clothier</hi> but will acknowledge, That there is never a Market or Fair in <hi>England,</hi> or in the three Nations, that affords them ſo much of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency and Safety upon ſuch cheap and eaſie terms as he enjoyes the ſame within the Markets of the City of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If the</hi> Clothier <hi>objects,</hi> Why may he not ſell his Goods in any place of <hi>London,</hi> if he ſhall ſee Cauſe?</p>
            <p>I will only give this ſhort Anſwer, That ſuch a Permiſſion were not only Irrational in it ſelf, but a palpable Invaſion of the Freeman's Right, (and here by the way take notice of that equal Juſtice, that hath been ever us'd in the Cities Markets) aſwell as a priviledging of the Forraigner to more then the Freeman hath a Right to, or can claim. All the publique Markets of the City are for the Forraigners uſe: and no Freeman (as ſuch) ought to Invade the Forraigners Right by ſelling there. All the reſt of the City, (the Houſes, Shops, and Warehouſes of <hi>London)</hi> are the Freemens-Market, Now there is the ſame reaſon, That the Forraigners ſhould not Invade this Right: So that by keeping theſe diſtinct, they cannot be hurtful each to other. But to admit a <hi>Clothier</hi> to Sell in, and out of the Markets too, is to priviledge him beyond a Freeman, who hath power of Sales only in the latter. And thus I ſhall diſmiſſe this firſt Complaint: As to the</p>
            <p>Second, <hi>The Raiſing the Duty of Hallage, and new Impoſing a Duty for Lying.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I think the falſitie of this Clamour beſt Confuted by ſetting down in two diſtinct Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns the Ancient and Preſent Rates, both for the one and the other; with ſome Obſervations upon them: that ſo by an Impartial Comparing the one with the other, and weighing the Lengths, values of Goods, Times then, and now; a Right Judgement may be had of the thing, and the notorious abuſing of the City in this unjuſt Charge, more palpably diſcovered.</p>

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:10999:3"/>
By all which it appears, that the difference between the old and the new rates for Hallage is little other then in form, the new being more abreviated and ſuccinct, taking things in more by their lengths, then names, which is the ſurer and more equall way, and ſo the rates will be found to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leſſened then augmented; and as to the duty it ſelf, it is conſonant and agreeable to Toll taken in all Fairs and Markets, and is leſſe then is taken in any Fair or Market in <hi>England,</hi> (though their Goods be pitched in open places without any ſhelter from weather, as here) and is no more then every Freeman of <hi>London</hi> payes for that he buys, by pre-contract in the Country, or receives in Cuſtome from any Clothier, who hath no benefit (or can have) of ſelling his Goods in the publick Markets as the Clothier hath, and therefore hath more reaſon to be agrieved at the <note place="margin">[Note.]</note> Duty then he.</p>
            <p>And as to the Duty for Lying, it is ſo equall and juſt a thing that no Ingenious Clothier can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of it as a burden, when the enſuing benefits he reaps by the ſame, are ſeriouſly weighed and conſidered: as,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He hath his Goods lye in a publick Market, and not thruſt into a private Corner, as was partly hinted before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He hath ſecurity not only for 20 dayes, but ſo long as they continue there, ſo that for a penny, he hath 20 or 30 l. value oftentimes ſecur'd to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>He hath conveniency of ſtowage in the Hall private to himſelf or his Factor (beſides his Market place) with Pile Benches, Tables, and other fitting accommodations, all made and maintained to his hand, at the Cities charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>He hath the Halls, Markets, and Ware-houſes, conſtantly repaired, which coſts great ſums yearly, together with Sallaries for Officers to attend the Markets, and to Regiſter and look after his goods; all likewiſe at the Cities charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>He hath freedome to eaſe himſelf of the charge when he will (without giving warning as is required in all other places of the City) by ſale or removall of his Goods, he paying little when he hath little, more when he hath much, nothing when he hath nothing; his payments alwayes bearing propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to what he hath, and what can be more juſt and equall? Any of which Priviledges no Freeman of</hi> London <hi>enjoyes, and the leaſt of which is of more worth to the Clothier, then what he payes for all; To all which let me ſubjoin (though not ſo properly under this head)</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>If the Clothier ſhould remove his Goods to his Factors houſe, the very Porteridge to and fro, will coſt him more then a fortnights lying in the Hall, and yet can enjoy none of thoſe priviledges in his houſe that he doth in the Markets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now let any indifferent man judge whether any thing can be hard upon the Clothier in theſe reſpects? and whether he hath not a full pennyworth for his penny? Or whether any Fair or Market in <hi>England,</hi> can or doth afford him the like accommodations and advantages as he here injoyes for ſuch petty and inconſiderable values as he here pays. I confeſſe I am not apt to think that any Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Clothier whatever ſhould boggle at theſe petty payments wherein he reaps ſo reall a benefit, and is to ſo noble, Chriſtian, and Charitable a uſe as it goes to (when all charges are born) when in other things, for leſſe advantages (and often for reall miſchiefs) he ſhall be ſo generous as to Cram his Factors pockets with Hundreds by the year. But I ſhall ſpare that Generation for the ſake of ſome among them, that I believe are as juſt and as honeſt dealing-men as lives by bread, and as true to their principles as their own ſons and meniall Servants could be; and ſo ſhall diſmiſſe this Second Complaint. Their next is,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>The requiring their Factors to be approved and admitted by the Lord Maior and Court of Aldermen, and to enter into a Recognizance of 200 l. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This, this is that which hath made all this Rattle, and ſtrongly to be ſuſpected hath occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned all the other Complaints, we never hearing any thing of the Factors zeal for the Clothier in reſpect of the other, till he was preſt upon this. And here I would be rightly underſtood, that what I ſhall have occaſion in the carrying on of this diſcourſe to ſpeak concerning Factors in generall, not to mean thoſe Factors whoſe peaceable and obedient ſpirits carried them on to a juſt and ready ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the City in what was required of them, who deſerve a fair and honourable mention; But thoſe who have been the Incendiaries, thus cauſeleſſely to inflaim the Clothier againſt the City, the better to carry on their own By-ends to the prejudice of both. Nor ſhall I here defend the Cities Legall Right to what is required (that more properly belonging to another hand) but ſhew the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiteneſſe and abſolute neceſſity of it in reſpect of the Clothiers intereſt only.</p>
            <p>As to that of the Lord Mayors and Court of Aldermens approving and admitting of who ſhall be conſtant Factors or Broakers (for in that notion I muſt now take them) in any of their publique Markets; I ſhall give theſe few Reaſons for it.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:10999:3"/>
1. <hi>It hath been the conſtant practice and cuſtome of the City (time out of mind) to allow and admit of perſons that make bargains between man and man, and theſe men muſt not think that becauſe of late years they have aſſumed to themſelves the more Gentile-name of</hi> Factors, <hi>therefore the Cities priviledges, and the Common good thereby, muſt by that means be ſo eaſily evaded and avoided.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That their Illimited Numbers may be abated, and room made for the honeſt Clothier to ſell his own goods in, if he hath a mind to it; the Factors of late years, by their great increaſe and taking of Apprentices to increaſe more, have quite juſtled out the Clothier from the Market, for whom it was primarily Intended; or elſe making him ſtand by as a uſeleſle un-concerned Hangby, while he ſells his Goods to whom he pleaſes, and then receives a reward and Sallary for abuſing him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>To ſee that they be perſons of honeſt fame and reſponſible condition, as the better to ſecure the truſt the Clothier repoſes in them; ſo in regard of that ſecurity, the City gives the Clothier for his Goods, in the Caſe of Theft or any miſcarriage (as before is hinted) It not being fit that every perſon that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends himſelf a Factor ſhould have opportunity fraudulently to convey away other mens Goods, that the City may afterwards pay for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The City being the proper Judges of any Nuſances ariſing in their Markets, finding by long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience both the Factors increaſe and miſcarriage (in making the publique Market his own private ſhop to ſell his own goods in) to be ſuch both to Buyer and Seller; takes upon them to approve of thoſe that ſtand or broak between man and man; that the Market may not be Huckstered and Foreſtalled, but kept Indifferent between Clothier and Citizen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Factory, or Broakery in it ſelf being no Trade, are not Subject to any Rules or Regulations of perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Societies and Companies as Trades are, otherwiſe then by the Lord Mayor and Court of Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; therefore they ought to have a perticular inſpection over their perſons and wayes, to ſee they do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the excercize of that feat, by combination and confederacies among themſelves to the ſetting of the Market, raiſing or lowering of the Commodities, to the prejudice of the Subject in General, or of the perticular Buyers and Sellers of thoſe Commodities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now as to their being required to enter into a Recognizance of</hi> 200 l. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here take notice of the Condition of this Recognizance, which is nothing elſe but that he ſhall not buy in, or ſell out of the Market any of the Commodities that he is a Factor in, and that during ſo long time (only) that he ſhall continue a Factor,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hence Note,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Clothier is no way concerned in the Condition of this Recognizance, this not relating to the Factor as he is the Clothiers Servant, nor reſtraining him in any thing that is properly the Clothiers Service. His Service being only to ſell his Goods in the Market (out of the Market the Clothier ought not to ſell himſelf within the City) which notwithſtanding his Recognizance, he is left free to do.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That from what the Recognizance reſtrains him, is only from exerciſing a By-Trade of his own in thoſe Commodities wherein he is the Clothiers Servant; and if this be not common Juſtice, the world muſt ſeek out new-Rules to ſhape commerce by; there being nothing more common between man and man, then if a man imploys a ſervant to bind him up from dealing in thoſe Commodities (himſelf) wherein he is his ſervant; and oft-times from dealing in any thing elſe: that ſo his Servants time and head may be more occupied in his Maſters buſineſſe, then otherwiſe by driving ſeverall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſts it can be: If this were not, it were impoſſible to carry on any Trade or Dealing in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome out of our own hands, the many continuall undiſcovered Cheats would be ſo rife upon the Imployers, that they could never otherwiſe be prevented, then by tying up their Factors from uſing a By-Trade in thoſe Commodities that they are Servants in: for want of which reſtraint upon the Factors, all thoſe many ſecret and undoing-miſchiefs that hath peel'd the Clothier to nothing, hath flowed in upon him, and he knew not what to impute his undoing too; certainly had this been done, the honeſt Induſtrious Clothier had found better Markets, better payments, better accompts, better cuſtomers, ſurer debts, better dealing in every kind then of late (ſince their Factors have been Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for themſelves) they have had; the continuance of the Factors By-Trade (except Factors be Saints) muſt neceſſarily draw upon the Clothier theſe and many other inconveniencies,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Clothier can never have the true benefit of his Market; as for Inſtance, A Clothier ſends up half a dozen or more of Clothes to his Factor in</hi> London <hi>to ſell for his beſt advantage: His Factor liking them well, and knowing their requeſt, either buyes them all himſelf, or elſe culls out the beſt Colours, and Clothes among them, leaving the refuſe to run the hazzard of an uncertain Market, to the Clothiers no ſmall loſſe, he thinking in the Countrey that he hath 2 or 300 Chapmen looking upon his Goods in the Market, hath indeed only his own ſingle Factor; whoſe By-Trade hath prompted him, in ſtead of making the beſt Market for the Clothier, to make the beſt Market of the Clothier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:10999:4"/>
2. <hi>As a conſequent of this, this By-trading-Factor, makes the Clothier pay Factorage for the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief he hath done him, for thoſe very Goods he hath bought himſelf; and in this ſenſe, can truely be ſaid to under-buy any man living; no man having that priviledge but himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>He can create a neceſſity upon the Clothier when he pleaſes, by keeping his Clothes unexpoſed from Sale, and ſo in want of moneys, that (if their Rates be ſet higher then he would have them) he may the better make his own Markets of them, and have his Goods at his own price, the eaſier to carry on his own private Trade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>He can bring what Debts and Loſſes he will upon the Clothier, if the Factor hath ſold off any Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers Goods out of the Market (which before he had taken to his own Accompt) if the Chapman proves bad or Inſolvent, then that's the Clothiers debt; But if good, the Clothier never hears on't, though the Cloth be ſold for never ſo much profit; ſo that the Clothier ſtands only to the Loſing Trade, his Factor to the Getting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>The Factor in Deſign often keeps the Clothier Ignorant of his Cuſtomer to whom he ſells his Goods, it may be for a double end; But I'le inſtance only in one, to make him the more to depend upon himſelf, that ſo all Goods that come to the City, may come through the Factors hands, that thereby they may have opportunities the better to drive the Markets for the benefit of their private Trade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were endleſſe to innumerate the conſtant flux of evils that the Factors buying and ſelling beyond the Clothiers imployment will and hath occaſioned, but the Clothier knows and feels enough of them, but knows not how to help himſelf; theſe are Greivances indeed upon the Clothier, and yet ſome of theſe are petty things, to what the Clothier finds; had not his Factor had a By-Trade of buying and ſelling for himſelf, as well as for him, he might have got many Hundred pounds into his own purſe, which is now crept into his Factor's. Whence is it, that the Clothier (of late years) hath grown poor and the Factor grown rich? The Maſter declined, and the Servant hath thriv'd? Is't in the Sallary of 3, 4, 5. <hi>s. per</hi> Cloth that he hath paid to the Factor for ſelling his Goods? No, no it's the By-Trade, the Trade of the Clothier, not for the Clothier that hath done the Deed, theſe have been like Moaths in his Cloth, that hath eaten him and his Clothes thread-bare: And yet now that the Clothier may be ſecured againſt theſe, and the apparent miſchiefs that theſe have brought, is all the hurt the City hath done them, by taking this Recognizance of their Factors, that they ſhall not buy in, or ſell out of the Markets, any of the Commodities that they are Factors for; and in this narrow Compaſſe is the Quarrell between the Clothier and the City brought, I mean what appears; The true Quarrel being only between the Factor and the City, for the Clothiers good, as well as their own from the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier, the City hath rather deſerved their thanks, then their complaint, and beleive from the moſt Ingenious of them would find it.</p>
            <p>There may be as much reaſon given from the Cities concernments, why the Factor ſhould be reſtrained from his By-Trade: (elſe the Markets will be overthrown as to the City, no man can buy Goods, but through the Factors Grate, or after he hath made his choiſe and cull'd the Market, or at ſecond hand; and this being a notable encouragement for a few Factors to joyn together, and to ingroſſe the beſt of the Manufacture unto themſelves, and thereby ſpoil the Trade of the reſt of the Citizens of <hi>London:)</hi> But I ſuppoſe theſe and many more inconveniencies that will attend the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen in the Market, will be of leſſer regard to the Clothier, then his own Intereſt, therefore ſhall forbear to ſay more of it, except provoked by a further occaſion. And truly all this diſcourſe I have managed more as an <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> then a Citizen (which I confeſſe I am) regarding more the Clothiers Intereſt then the Cities, though cannot eye one without the other they are ſo twiſted and link'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and well knowing the City hath and ever had a tender regard of the Clothier, and of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, and have been alwayes, and ſtill are, ready to deny themſelves in ſome of their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges for their encouragement and accommodation, and will upon any addreſſe made unto them (which yet was never done by any one Clothier (that ever I heard of) ſince the Act was made) be ready to redreſſe any thing that may be found in that, or in any thing elſe to be unreaſonable or hard upon them, and therefore (in Relation to this very Act) dare in behalf of the City, promiſe the Clothier theſe three things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That notwithſtanding the expreſſion in the Act of their Goods lying in the Market 20 dayes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſold; that there's none of their Clothes, that either by wet in coming to Town, or by other Caſualties ſhall be unfitted for Sale; But they ſhall have them out at their pleaſures, to fit and dreſſe up for the Market.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Or if any Clothier having Goods in the Market, would take up moneys upon them for the ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his preſent occaſions, He ſhall have liberty to take them forth, to make them ſecurity to any one that he ſhall borrow money on. Provided theſe be not uſed as Artifices to evade the Cities Franchizes by private ſelling them out of the Market to Forraigners and Strangers.</hi> And further,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>If the Clothier deſires it, they ſhall have liberty granted them upon any one of the three dayes, that are not by the Act appointed Market dayes in every Week, for the ſpace of a whole Forenoon freely to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:10999:4"/>
come into any of the ſaid Market places, to See, Count, or lay up their Clothes unſold, the better to make up, and even their Accompts with their Reſpective Factors; or any thing elſe, that may be for the diſpatch, or Accomodation of their Affairs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now whether it be the Hoſpitall-pence, or the Factors pounds, got by his By-Trade, that wrings, and is a reall Grievance to the Clothier, I leave it to Impartiall men to judge; with this one conſideration (for a Concluſion) to be duely weighed by every ingenious Clothier, which may ſerve as a demonſtration to the verity of what hath been ſaid; The vaſt and great eſtates that are got by a ſort of men crept in between them and the Buyers of their Commodities, which is all dreyned out of the Trade by the By, and which muſt be felt by ſome body; and were there but the bare conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their great numbers of late years Multiplyed, and continually encreaſing by the Apprentices they take, though they were all of plain and honeſt dealing, yet the very maintainance of them and their ſeveral Families (for they are not kept with a ſmall matter) muſt needs beget a charge upon the Manufacture, that if it do not inhaunce the price to the Buyers, yet muſt certainly go out of the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers profit; and ſo doth neceſſarily call for the leſſening of their Numbers, if not Quallifying of their perſons.</p>
