            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

adorn the Goſpel by a meek, Holy Converſation. That
all our Tongues and Pens, freed from the unwelcome

celebrating the Praiſes of the Divine Majeſty,

Bond of Love and Unity) is by the Ignorance, the
Prejudices, the Paſſions and ſecular Intereſts of men,
made one of the greateſt occaſions of Difference, or a

publiſh'd amongſt us by the Gentlemen of the

out of Diſpute, <q>That St. <hi>Peter</hi> not only Preached the
Goſpel at <hi>Rome,</hi> but by Gods command fixed his
Chair there (that is, became the proper Biſhop of

               <p>'Tis true indeed,<note place="margin">Proteſtants not much concerned in the Queſtion.</note> That it does not much concern

of the Church there, will nothing prejudice our

ſome ſolid proof.</p>
               <p>1. That <hi>Peter</hi> was conſtituted by Chriſt Prince of

               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:98580:4"/>
2. That this Empire of his was not only Perſonal,
but <hi>Succeſſive,</hi> and to be continued to the end of the
World in ſome other Perſons in the quality, and upon
the account of being his Succeſſors.</p>
               <p>3. Why this ſuppoſed right devolved to his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
in the Biſhoprick of <hi>Rome,</hi> rather than to thoſe of
<hi>Antioch,</hi> which they ſay, was his firſt Epiſcopal See?
Or that St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s removal from thence to <hi>Rome,</hi> was
by Gods <hi>ſpecial Command</hi> to make <hi>That</hi> the Seat of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Empire; and that accordingly he did actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
bequeath his Authority to the <hi>latter</hi> rather than to
the former? for his being put to Death at <hi>Rome</hi> (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it true) will not alone prove any ſuch matter.</p>
               <p>4. That the modern Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> (after eight or
nine and twenty<note n="*" place="margin">Onuphirus in Chron. Pont. <hi>confeſſes</hi> 30.</note> acknowledged <hi>Schiſms</hi> in that <hi>See,</hi>
God knows how many Uſurpations, and <hi>Simonaical,</hi> or
other undue Elections; and notwithſtanding manifeſt
<hi>Depravations</hi> of, and <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> from St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Doctrine,
and a Converſation, for the moſt part, Diametrically
oppoſite to his humble Holy Life) have yet every one
of them been undoubtedly his true and <hi>Lawful</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.</p>
               <p>All theſe Particulars, I ſay, as well as St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> muſt be undeniably proved, before
their modern Pretenſions can be adjudged good and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid:
Yet in the mean time their continual noiſe of
St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and of his being <hi>Biſhop of Rome,</hi> and they
his <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> may be apt to inveigle ſome ignorant
People, if no oppoſition be made thereto, nor <hi>Caveat</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
That what they thus avouch as a notorious Truth,

               <p>'Tis but reaſonable, That the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
which pretends to hold ſo vaſt a Lordſhip by
Succeſſion from St. <hi>Peter,</hi> ſhould in the firſt place as
clearly as ſhe can, make out her <hi>Relation</hi> to him. Now
the ſtory ſhe tells, is in ſhort to this effect, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>That
ſome time after our Lords Paſſion, St. <hi>Peter</hi> went
into <hi>Syria,</hi> and became Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
there, or (as they love to ſpeak) <hi>held that See</hi>
ſeven Years; and then he remov'd his Seat from
thence to <hi>Rome,</hi> and thenceforth was Biſhop of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and held the ſame four or five and
twenty Years, <hi>viz.</hi> until he was Martyr'd there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Nero.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I am forced to uſe <hi>General Terms,</hi> becauſe moſt of

vary in the Particulars, and cannot agree either in
the <hi>Year</hi> wherein his Biſhoprick at <hi>Antioch</hi> ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin;
or in the time of its continuance; nay, there is
a diſpute amongſt them, whether his being Biſhop of
<hi>Antioch</hi> were <hi>before</hi> he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>after</hi> he had
been there. The time too, when he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and
the length of his Epiſcopate there, and other material
Circumſtances, are very differently delivered. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

That which at preſent lyes before us, is to conſider
what ſpecial Relation St. <hi>Peter</hi> had to <hi>Rome</hi> above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Churches. Concerning which, the Learned and
Laborious Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi> (whoſe Works, with thoſe
of his no leſs diligent Brother <hi>Baronius,</hi> are the <hi>grand
Magazine</hi> of that Party, and both whoſe Induſtry might
juſtly claim the higheſt Commendation, if beſtowed in
a Cauſe that deſerv'd it) ſtates <hi>four Queſtions.</hi> 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Peter</hi> were ever at <hi>Rome?</hi> 2. Whether he dyed
there? 3. Whether he was Biſhop of <hi>Rome?</hi> 4. Whether
after he had once aſſum'd that Biſhoprick, he ever
chang'd it for another? All which he handles (after
his manner) ſeverally, and at large. But indeed the
<hi>ſecond</hi> comprehends the <hi>firſt;</hi> for if <hi>Peter</hi> were Martyr'd
at <hi>Rome,</hi> he muſt needs be there: And the <hi>fourth,</hi>
though he puts moſt ſtreſs upon it, may fitly be inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
under the <hi>third;</hi> for if they can prove, That St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
was at any time Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> we ſhall not much
trouble our ſelves, whether he afterwards remov'd from
thence, both becauſe I think the practice of a Biſhops
<hi>Tranſlation</hi> from one See to another, was not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>ſo early</hi> in the Church (their talk of the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's
removal from <hi>Antioch</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhall be further
conſidered anon) as alſo becauſe I remember not any
but their own <hi>Onuphrius</hi> that hath inſiſted upon, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
any ſuch matter: ſo that the main Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is only this, Whether St. <hi>Peter were ever in a proper

in the higheſt degree, if (beſides other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons)
it cannot plainly be made appear, that he was at
ſome time or other <hi>there;</hi> It will therefore be ſufficient

conſider.</p>
               <p>The firſt from that Text, 1 <hi>Pet. 5. 13. The Church
that is at</hi> Babylon <hi>ſaluteth you.</hi> By <hi>Babylon</hi> here (ſaith
he) is meant <hi>Rome;</hi> therefore <hi>Peter</hi> when he wrote that
Epiſtle, was <hi>there:</hi> Now that <hi>Peter</hi> did mean <hi>Rome</hi> by
the word <hi>Babylon in that place,</hi> he would prove, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>Euſebius</hi> Records, that one <hi>Papias</hi> did ſay, That
this Epiſtle <hi>of</hi> Peter <hi>was written from the City of</hi> Rome,
<hi>which the Apoſtle did there Tropically call</hi> Babylon: To
which purpoſe the Cardinal alſo cites St. <hi>Hierom</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as being of the ſame Opinion, or rather following
<hi>Papias</hi> therein. 2. Becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> in the <hi>Revelations</hi> is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
call'd <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I anſwer.</p>
               <p>1. This is proving <hi>Ignotum per Ignotius,</hi> a doubtful
thing by a thing utterly <hi>Improbable;</hi> a controverted
matter of <hi>Fact</hi> by an uncertain groundleſs <hi>Opinion.</hi> Does
not all the World know, that there were at that time
two great Cities, whoſe proper name was <hi>Babylon?</hi> One
in <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> famous in all ancient Hiſtories, as being the
ſeat of the firſt Monarchy: The other in <hi>Egypt,</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
in <hi>Strabo,</hi> l. 17. and by <hi>Ptolomy</hi> called <hi>Babulis,</hi> the
ſame (if I miſtake not) which at this day is called
<hi>CAIRO,</hi> or near it; and why might not <hi>Peter</hi> date his
Epiſtle from one of theſe? For as he, for the moſt part,
preached to the diſperſed Jews, of whom, no doubt, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
were ſcattered through <hi>Chaldaea</hi> and <hi>Aſſyria;</hi> ſo he
might probably exert his Miniſtry at the <hi>firſt mentioned</hi>

by <hi>Babylon,</hi> is far more likely to be underſtood one of
thoſe places, rather than <hi>Rome.</hi> For,</p>
               <p>2. What an extravagance is it to imagine that S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
ſhould <hi>diſguiſe</hi> and <hi>conceal</hi> from whence he wrote?
or qualifie the place, which he had choſen to be his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal
See, and perpetual Seat of Church-Soveraignty
(as they would have it) with ſo <hi>uncouth</hi> a Title, when
there was not the leaſt colour of reaſon (as far as we
can now learn) or occaſion why he ſhould ſo do, nor
any example of the like kind to be found? For though
S. <hi>Luke</hi> in the Acts, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtles, frequently
ſpeak of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet they never call it <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now when the Apoſtle ſays, the <hi>Chruch at Babylon</hi>
ſalutes you, certainly he intended (as all men do in
their Epiſtles) that they ſhould know <hi>where</hi> he was,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98580:10"/>
and <hi>who</hi> they were that ſaluted them; but this was (I
think) impoſſible for them to do, if by <hi>Babylon</hi> he meant
<hi>Rome,</hi> no Author either Civil or Sacred having <hi>then</hi>
ever call'd it ſo.</p>
               <p>3. That St. <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelations</hi> above fifty Years
after (for <hi>Baronius,</hi> who ſays this Epiſtle was wrote
<hi>An. Chr.</hi> 45. tells us alſo that the <hi>Revelation</hi> was wrote
<hi>An.</hi> 97.) did call <hi>Rome Babylon,</hi> is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
for though a <hi>Tropical</hi> Denomination ſuit well
with a <hi>Prophetick</hi> Style, yet it will not follow, that in
a plain Epiſtolary Salutation, a proper Name muſt be
wreſted from its genuine ſignification to ſuch an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe
and remote ſenſe. St. <hi>John,</hi> writing myſterious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies,
uſed <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> to expreſs future things;
but that <hi>Peter</hi> in a familiar Recommendation, ſhould do
ſo, has neither <hi>Truth</hi> nor <hi>Probability.</hi> The Reaſon why
St. <hi>John</hi> denominates <hi>Rome, Babylon</hi> (though repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a Viſion) was not yet <hi>actually in Being;</hi> for it was
by way of alluſion, That as <hi>Babylon</hi> of old held the
Jews, the then People of God, in Temporal Captivity, ſo
<hi>ſhe</hi> ſhould in time to come bring Chriſtians into a <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Vaſſalage;</hi> and thence ſhe is call'd <hi>Myſtery Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ſeems the Learned Cardinal thought ſome Text
of <hi>Scripture</hi> would be expected to prove <hi>Peter</hi>'s being at
<hi>Rome,</hi> and finding nothing looking that way, was forc'd
to hedge in this, though it coſt him <hi>dear;</hi> for thereby
he confeſſes and proclaims <hi>Rome</hi> to be the <hi>Apocalyptical
Babylon.</hi> But though an <hi>hard pinch</hi> reduced him to this
neceſſity, yet he hopes to ſecure his retreat, by affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>That</hi> Rome <hi>is termed</hi> Babylon, <hi>not in reſpect of the
future Roman Church, but as it was the Seat of the Roman
Empire that then domineer'd over the Earth, as</hi> Babylon
<hi>did of old.</hi>—But this evaſion is as <hi>groſs</hi> as the occaſion of
it, ſince 'tis plain, the <hi>Revelations</hi> from the <hi>4th</hi> Chapter,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98580:11"/>
eſpecially; is a <hi>Prophetick</hi> Book, not <hi>Hiſtorical;</hi> for ſo are

all along to the future ſtate of the <hi>Church,</hi> not to
the preſent condition of <hi>Worldly Empire;</hi> and almoſt
all Interpreters agree, That this <hi>Babylon</hi> which, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.
is called <hi>The Scarlet Whore,</hi> &amp;c. deſcribed by this Title,
<hi>Myſtery Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots, and
Abominations of the Earth;</hi> can be no orher than that
<hi>Antichriſt</hi> which was to ſit in the Temple of God, that
is, in the Church, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>4. As for what is alledged, that <hi>Papias,</hi> St. <hi>Jerome,</hi>
or others, thought this Epiſtle of <hi>Peter</hi> might be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
from <hi>Rome,</hi> Tropically call'd <hi>Babylon;</hi> it is at moſt
but <hi>their Opinion</hi> touching a matter of Fact long before
their time; and as we have ſhewn that there is no <hi>need</hi>
or <hi>Reaſon</hi> for admitting any ſuch Trope, ſo the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
may be excuſed, if they underſtood not the true
occaſion <hi>why,</hi> or in what reſpect <hi>Rome</hi> was call'd <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
ſince that which qualified it ſuch, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be ſignified by the Divine Viſion, appeared
not in the World till ſome Ages afterwards. Whence
that Mighty <hi>Monarch of Letters,</hi> as well as of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
King <hi>JAMES</hi> the Firſt (Grandfather to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Gracious Soveraign) in his <hi>Proemonition</hi> to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Princes, judiciouſly obſerved in a like Caſe. That
<hi>the Fathers of the firſt Ages ſpeak of this matter but only
by conjectures, whereas we ſpeak of it by experience.</hi> For
Scripture Predictions after the Events, become Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
and the Promiſes, Performances; and ſo are much
more intelligible.</p>
               <p>5. As for the credit of <hi>Papias,</hi> the firſt Suggeſter of
this Interpretation, and conſequently the <hi>firſt Author</hi> in
the World (for ought I can hear) that gave occaſion to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98580:11"/>
the Conceit of <hi>Peter</hi>'s ever <hi>being at</hi> Rome, we ſhall give
a further account anon.</p>
               <p>In the mean time cannot but remark, That this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
is yet the more <hi>abſurd,</hi> becauſe the ſame
<hi>Bellarmin,</hi> who to maintain <hi>Rome</hi>'s Supremacy, becauſe
of <hi>Peter's</hi> being <hi>there,</hi> doth here, without any probable
grounds, expound <hi>Babylon</hi> to be <hi>Rome,</hi> does elſewhere<note n="*" place="margin">Preface to his Treatiſe <hi>De Pontif.</hi>

aſcribe that Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> cited 1. <hi>Pet. 2. Behold I
put in</hi> Sion <hi>a corner-ſtone elect and precious,</hi> &amp;c. to be
meant of the <hi>Pope</hi> (at leaſt ſecondarily) contrary not
only to St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s expreſs Interpretation,
who attribute the ſame (as indeed it wholly and ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
belongs) <hi>to Chriſt, 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 6. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 32. but
alſo to that of <hi>our Lord,</hi> who refers thoſe words to
himſelf, <hi>Matt.</hi> 21. 42. ſo that the Cardinal makes <hi>Rome</hi>
to be both <hi>Sion</hi> and <hi>Babylon;</hi> he will have it <hi>Babylon;</hi>
to prove <hi>Peter</hi> there, and <hi>Sion</hi> to exclude (in effect)
Chriſt from being Head of the Church, and advance
the Pope in his ſtead.</p>
               <p>The ſecond <hi>thing</hi> (for I know not how to call it an
Argument) brought to prove St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s being at <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarmins</hi> ſecond Proof.</note>
is this, There were many Chriſtians at <hi>Rome,</hi> nay, a
large and flouriſhing Church gathered there <hi>before</hi> Paul
came thither, as appears by his Epiſtle (which 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
he wrote before ever he had been at <hi>Rome</hi>) But
<hi>who</hi> gathered that Church, if <hi>Peter</hi> were not at <hi>Rome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no doubt but the <hi>Learned Author</hi> ſaw through
the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of this Diſcourſe,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> and therefore put it by
way of <hi>Query</hi> to amuſe weak heads, rather than as an
Argument to convince the Learned; for how odly
would ſuch a Syllogiſm look from the Pen of a Cardinal?
<hi>There were Chriſtians at</hi> Rome <hi>before</hi> Paul <hi>come thither,</hi>
ergo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>St.</hi> Peter <hi>was there before him,</hi> as if there were no
other Preachers of the Goſpel of the bleſſed Jeſus, but
thoſe two For,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:98580:12"/>
1. Not to urge, That though we read of Saints at
<hi>Rome,</hi> yet we no where find the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome, or a
Church at <hi>Rome</hi> mentioned <hi>in terminis;</hi> the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
poſſibly forbearing to qualifie it with that Title in
Holy Writ, as a check to their foreſeen Uſurpations.
And although it expreſly tell us of ſeveral other Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
firſt planted by <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> Apoſtle, yet it ſays not
that <hi>any Apoſtle</hi> was the firſt Seeds-man of the Goſpel <hi>at
Rome.</hi> Not to inſiſt I ſay upon this,</p>
               <p>2. Let us conſider how and by whom Churches were
gathered in <hi>Samaria</hi> and at <hi>Antioch</hi> (which they make
<hi>Peter</hi>'s other and firſt Biſhoprick); if we may be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to read and credit the <hi>Bible,</hi> there we find, that by a
great Perſecution at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Diſciples (except the
Apoſtles) were ſcattered abroad, <hi>every where</hi> (and ſo
who knows but ſome of them to <hi>Rome) preaching the
Word,</hi> Acts 8. 4. particularly <hi>Philip,</hi> a Deacon in <hi>Samaria,</hi>
made great numbers of Converts, <hi>v.</hi> 6. which when the
Apoſtles heard of, <hi>they ſent thither</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> John (an odd
procedure for Subjects to ſend their <hi>Soveraign</hi> on an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand,
if they had thought <hi>Peter</hi> ſuch) who having fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſpread the Goſpel in <hi>Samaria,</hi> return'd again to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
v. 25. others of the ſaid ſcattered Diſciples Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Lord Jeſus to the Grecians at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and <hi>many
believed and were turned unto the Lord,</hi> Acts 11. 19, 20.
whereupon <hi>Barnabas</hi> was ſent to them, who brought <hi>Paul</hi>
into <hi>Antioch,</hi> and a whole Year <hi>they</hi> (viz. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas)
aſſembled themſelves with the Church</hi> (ſo that there
was <hi>a Church</hi> there before) and taught much People,
and the Diſciples were firſt called <hi>Chriſtians</hi> there, <hi>v.</hi> 26.
If therefore Chriſtianity (both <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Thing</hi>) were
firſt planted at <hi>Antioch</hi> (which they ſay was <hi>Peter</hi>'s firſt
Dioceſe) neither by <hi>Peter,</hi> nor by any Apoſtle, but by
certain <hi>ſcattered Diſciples,</hi> why might not the like hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
at <hi>Rome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:98580:12"/>
3. 'Tis evident that the Goſpel had been Preached to
many <hi>Romans</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> immediately after Chriſt's Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention;
for when the Apoſtles received the Gift of the
Holy Ghoſt, and Preached in other Tongues, 'tis expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſaid, That amongſt the multitude that came to hear
them, <hi>There were strangers of</hi> Rome, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 10. St. <hi>Paul</hi>
alſo witneſſes, That <hi>Andronicus</hi> and <hi>Junia</hi> (who dwelt at
<hi>Rome</hi> when he wrote his Epiſtle, that is, before he came
at <hi>Rome) were in Chriſt</hi> (that is, profeſſed the Chriſtian
Faith) <hi>before himſelf</hi> (which muſt be at leaſt 5 or 6
years before <hi>Peter</hi> is pretended to come at <hi>Rome</hi>) And
that <hi>they were of Note amongſt the Apoſtles,</hi> Rom. 16. 7.
Why then might not <hi>They</hi> by their pains and zeal, at
leaſt in ſome meaſure, gather a Church there? Beſides,
the Scriptures mention not which of the Apoſtles, or
who elſe in particular, collected divers other Churches,
muſt they therefore <hi>all</hi> be aſcribed to the particular
pains of St. <hi>Peter?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. What the Cardinal affirms, That <hi>none of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients</hi>
name any other but <hi>Peter</hi> that ſhould firſt Preach
the Goſpel at <hi>Rome,</hi> is not ſtrictly true; For he himſelf
a little after confeſſes, That <hi>Clemens</hi> (whom they will
have to be <hi>Peter</hi>'s Succeſſor) in the firſt Book of his
<hi>Recongnitions,</hi> and <hi>Dorothoeus Tyrenſis,</hi> Record, <hi>That</hi>
Barnabas <hi>Preached at</hi> Rome <hi>in the Reign of</hi> Tiberius;
that is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſaid to Preach at <hi>Rome</hi> before <hi>Peter.</hi>
                  </note> within 3 or 4 years after our Lords <hi>Crucifixion;</hi>
Whereas their moſt common ſtory is, That St. <hi>Peter</hi>
came not there till the ſecond of <hi>Claudius,</hi> which muſt
be about five years at leaſt after the Reign of <hi>Tiberius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true the Cardinal endeavours to weaken the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of thoſe Authors, by ſaying, <hi>That the firſt is thought
to be Apochryphal; and the latter contains many things fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous
and falſe;</hi> yet ſtill as they are of their <hi>own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing,</hi>
and he will not deny but they are <hi>Ancient;</hi> ſo
whenever they ſerve his Turn, he is ready enough to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98580:13"/>
make uſe of them, as <hi>Authentick Witneſſes.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
if all Authors muſt be diſcarded that contain many
things <hi>fabulous and falſe,</hi> His numerous Citations from
pretended Antiquity would grow very thin and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable.</p>
               <p>Beſides, That Teſtimony which he himſelf mentions
from <hi>Oroſius</hi> and <hi>Platina,</hi> That the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> in
the Reign of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> when upon a Letter from <hi>Pilate</hi>
concerning the <hi>Miracles of Chriſt,</hi> that Emperor mov'd
them to <hi>Canonize</hi> or receive him amongſt the number
of their Gods, not only refuſed ſo to do, becauſe <hi>Pilate</hi>
wrote to <hi>him</hi> and not to <hi>them</hi> about it, but alſo made
a Decree <hi>Exterminandos</hi> [or <hi>Pellendos,</hi> as <hi>Platina</hi>'s word
is] <hi>ex <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbe eſſe Chriſtianos;</hi> That <hi>Chriſtians ſhould be
baniſht or driven out of the City:</hi> Propoſing alſo (ſays
<hi>Platina) Rewards to the Informers againſt them;</hi> ſeems to
me a plain Evidence, That there were <hi>Chriſtians there</hi> in
the Reign of <hi>Tiberius.</hi> And I dare appeal to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſenſe of any indifferent man, whether the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal's
<hi>Gloſs,</hi> That the meaning thereof was only this
[That if any Chriſtians <hi>ſhould come there,</hi> they ſhould
be Baniſht] be not forced, and almoſt Ridiculous; Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
ſince with <hi>Oraſius</hi> he confeſſes, <hi>Tiberium poenam
statuiſſe Accuſatoribus Chriſtianorum;</hi> That, <hi>Tiberius made
a Law to puniſh the Accuſers of the Chriſtians;</hi> and <hi>Platina</hi>
ſays the puniſhment threatned was <hi>Capital;</hi> For tho it be
not hard to Believe, That <hi>Tiberius</hi> acting as an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Emperor, and having received an affront in this
very matter from the Senate, might ſet forth an Edict
contrary to the Senates Vote; yet it is altogether ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
to imagine, That he ſhould threaten to puniſh the
accuſers of Chriſtians, if indeed there were there no
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> to be accuſed.</p>
               <p>Now if there were Chriſtians at <hi>Rome</hi> in the days of
<hi>Tiberius,</hi> ſince <hi>Peter</hi> is not pretended to have come to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98580:13"/>
                  <hi>Rome</hi> till the time of <hi>Claudius,</hi> before whom, after <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius,
Caligula</hi> reigned very near four years; it follows
undeniably, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was not <hi>first
planted by St.</hi> Peter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s third Argument is,<note place="margin">The Third Argument.</note> That <hi>Grave Authors</hi>
write, That <hi>Mark</hi> wrote his <hi>Goſpel at</hi> Rome, according
to what he had heard <hi>Peter</hi> Preach: Therefore <hi>Peter was
at Rome.</hi> And here cites in the firſt place his Friend
<hi>Papias</hi> again, and after him others.</p>
               <p>1. What value we are to have for <hi>Papias</hi>'s Teſtimony,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
will appear hereafter; and 'tis moſt likely that the other
Authors followed him, ſo that the whole depends upon his
Authority; but the notion it ſelf is indeed <hi>Impious</hi> and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating
from that reverence we ought to pay to the <hi>Books
of the Goſpel;</hi> For there is no well-inſtructed Chriſtian but
believes, that St. <hi>Mark</hi> and every other Evangeliſt wrote
by the ſpecial aſſiſtance and inſpiration of the Holy
Ghoſt, and not only by <hi>Hear-ſay,</hi> either from <hi>Peter</hi> or
any others.</p>
               <p>2. The meaning of thoſe Authors may be, That
<hi>Mark</hi> wrote his Goſpel by the excitement or privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> but that therefore <hi>Peter</hi> preached at
<hi>Rome,</hi> follows not; and moſt of the Ancients reckon
St. <hi>Mark</hi> the Evangeliſt to be Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in
<hi>Egypt,</hi> therefore it is not probable, that he ever was, or
continued long at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. That which might deceive <hi>Papias,</hi> and the reſt,
might be, that, whereas they had heard ſome-body ſay,
St. <hi>Mark</hi> the Evangeliſt was a Companion of St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
and wrote his Goſpel partly at his motion, and alſo
found one <hi>Mark</hi> mentioned in ſeveral places of the New
Teſtament to have been at <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Coloſſ. 4. 10. Philem.</hi>
v. 24. They thence concluded, That St. <hi>Peter muſt be
at Rome,</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> write his Goſpel there. But in
truth, <hi>that Mark</hi> whom in Scripture we find to have
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98580:14"/>
been at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſeems not to be the Writer of the Goſpel,
but the ſame that is mentioned, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 12. Who is
there ſaid to be otherwiſe named <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> only
his ſirname; The ſame whom <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> (whoſe
Siſters Son he was, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 10.) took along with them
from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Antioch,</hi> v. 25. But after ſome time he
left them, and return'd from <hi>Pamphilia</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
Chap. 13. 13. About whom, on that occaſion, a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy
aroſe between <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> with which laſt
he went into <hi>Cyprus,</hi> Ch. 15. 32. But was afterwards at
<hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Paul,</hi> as appears by the Texts before cited,
and ſometimes imployed by him to viſit the Churches
abroad, as is probable from <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 4, 10. Now that <hi>this
Mark</hi> could not (according to their own account) be
the Evangeliſt, appears,</p>
               <p>I. Becauſe St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in his ſecond Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi>
Ch. 3. 11. <hi>ſends for him again to Rome;</hi> which Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſays was written in the <hi>Fourteenth
year of Nero;</hi> and indeed it ſeems to be but very
little before St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Death,</hi> from his words, <hi>Chap.</hi>
4. 6. <hi>I am now ready to be offered, and the time of
my departure is at hand;</hi> whereas <hi>Mark</hi> the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt

               <p>II. Becauſe themſelves make the Evangeliſt, not only
to write his Goſpel at <hi>Peter's</hi> motion, but to have
been his common Attendant or Aſſiſtant in his
Travels and Preaching the Goſpel, and by him to
have been made Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi>
where he ſuffered Martyrdom. Whereas the <hi>other
Mark</hi> that was at <hi>Rome</hi> did (as we find in Scripture)
generally accompany <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> or one of
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:98580:14"/>
So that when any of the Ancients talk of <hi>Mark</hi>'s
writing his Goſpel at <hi>Rome</hi> after <hi>Peter</hi>'s Dictates, they
ſeem unwarily to <hi>confound</hi> the ſtory of the two <hi>Marks,</hi>
and <hi>jumble</hi> them into one, and ſo contradict themſelves.
And therefore, Whether St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s being at <hi>Rome</hi> can
thence be ſufficiently proved (eſpecially when 'tis moſt
probable the whole was borrowed and derived at firſt
from the Hear-ſay of <hi>Papias,</hi> or ſome ſuch <hi>Apocryphal

               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s fourth Argument is drawn from the ſtory

the ſame, if we may credit their Authors, is not

for the Pontifical Dignity, and alſo for that he underſtood</hi>
Simon Magus <hi>was gone thither:</hi> So that it ſeems his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> being at that time Metropolis of the World,
he thought no other place ſo worthy to be the ſeat of

                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:98580:15"/>
I. We read <hi>Acts</hi> 8. That <hi>Simon Magus</hi> lived at <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
and having long <hi>Bewitcht</hi> (or ſeduced) the people
there with Sorceries (or Jugling Impoſtures) was
highly eſteemed: But upon <hi>Philip</hi>'s Preaching, ſeemed
to Believe the Goſpel, and was Baptized, and wondred at
the Signs and Miracles which were done; but when <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>

Thou haſt neither part nor lot in this matter, for thy heart
is not right in the ſight of God. Repent therefore of this
thy wickedneſs, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of
thine heart may be forgiven thee; for I perceive thou art
in the gall of bitterneſs, and in the bond of Iniquity.</hi> Then
anſwered <hi>Simon,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Pray ye to the Lord for me,

the Conjurer could do, the Lad lay breathleſs as before;
yet at the Command of <hi>Peter,</hi> in the Name of Jeſus,
he revived, and ſtood on his feet: Which <hi>Simon</hi> the
Magician took ſo much in dudgeon, that he told the

when he was got upon the wing, at the Prayer of

beſeeching God, That he would <hi>not ſuffer ſo many

the Sorcerer: That he who was ſo far convinced
of the mighty Power of God in <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Samaria,</hi> as to

               <p>And what man of ſenſe will give ſo much as a common

if truly tranſacted at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhould have eſcaped the
notice and mention of ſome of thoſe <hi>Roman Hiſtorians</hi>
who have ſo exactly given us the Memoirs of that
curious and very Learned Age.</p>
               <p>2. This Tale does not <hi>quadrate</hi> or hang well together;
for <hi>Platina,</hi> as 'tis plain by his Words, makes this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit
done at <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>firſt coming</hi> to <hi>Rome;</hi> for as he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
one main part of his Errand in going thither, to
be for obviating the miſchiefs of that Impoſtor; ſo
by his Relation the matter ſeems to have been quickly
determined after <hi>Peter</hi>'s arrival; and he expreſly ſays
<hi>Simon Magus dyed of that fall,</hi> non ita multo poſt, <hi>not
long after:</hi> Now they ſay <hi>Peter</hi> went to <hi>Rome</hi> in the
ſecond Year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> Anno Chr. 43. and ſo in that

<hi>Peter</hi> went firſt to that City. Did St. <hi>Peter</hi> go to
<hi>Rome</hi> almoſt on purpoſe to ſuppreſs the Magician, and
yet could not meet with him in all that time? Or did
the Sorcerer lye ſick of the bruiſes of his fall, four or
five and twenty years? Then how did he die <hi>quickly
after?</hi> If <hi>Simon</hi> were playing his tricks at <hi>Rome,</hi> and
making the People believe he was a <hi>Great God</hi> in the

the end of <hi>Nero</hi>'s, that is 25 years after, (juſt the term

               </p>
               <p>In a word, That <hi>Simon Magus</hi> might be at <hi>Rome,</hi> I
will not much diſpute; ſince ſo many Tracks of his
footſteps ſeem to have been viſible there theſe thouſand

which was ſhewn there, and the <hi>Pilgrimages</hi>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98580:17"/>
at all (much leſs publickly) to Interr his Corps, or
build him a ſumptuous Monument. For we find in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius,</hi>
l. 4 That the Chriſtians had very much ado to
obtain the body of their Biſhop <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> which was
refuſed them by the Heathens, thinking they would
<hi>make a God</hi> thereof, and adore it; but the Chriſtians pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted

who knows but a <hi>forged Story</hi> might boulſter up an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous,

you ſhall hear more in a ſubſequent Chapter.</p>
               <p>2. However, could they evidently and beyond all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
demonſtrate that they have indeed St. <hi>Peters</hi>
bones at <hi>Rome,</hi> yet this would be <hi>no proof</hi> that he was
ever there in his Life-time, much leſs that he was the
particular Biſhop of that Church; for nothing is more
frequent amongſt them, than the Tranſlation of the
bodies of Saints from one place to another, many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years after their Deceaſe. But as they have no
Authentick evidence, that they have one <hi>true Grain of
that bleſſed Apoſtle's duſt,</hi> ſo we are too well acquainted
with their Art in Counterfeiting <hi>Relicks,</hi> and building
glorious Shrines (for drawing together vain ſuperſtitious
People, and bubbling them of their money) to credit
them on their bare words about the Body of <hi>Peter,</hi> any
more than concerning the <hi>Head</hi> of St. <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, the

being none of the Apoſtles that ſuffered by way of

and not only mentions the Death of St. <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt
and Chriſt in <hi>Judea,</hi> but of many Chriſtians put to
Death at <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Nero,</hi> yet takes no notice of <hi>Peters</hi>
Crucifixion; which he was not likely to omit, if <hi>Peter</hi> had
been then accounted the head of the Chriſtian Church,
and did ſuffer at <hi>Rome.</hi> So that <hi>Peter's</hi> being at <hi>Rome</hi> and

that talk of it, ſeem all to follow the before mentioned

               <p>There is yet another Argument urg'd by ſome <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi>

would ſcarce ſet the firſt Pattern of <hi>Non-reſidency</hi> that
ever was in the world. Nor do I ſee any neceſſity for
calling <hi>Clemens</hi> the <hi>5th,</hi> and the other <hi>French</hi> Popes,
<hi>Biſhops of Rome,</hi> rather than Biſhops of <hi>Avignion;</hi> For
I am taught by a very Learned <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick,<note n="†" place="margin">Camer acen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, Qu. Veſper. Act. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>That
the Papacy and Biſhoprick of</hi> Rome <hi>are two diſtinct things,
and not ſo neceſſarily conjoin'd but they may be ſeparated:
As for example, If a Pope and a Council think it conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
he may leave the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and unite himſelf
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98580:19"/>
to another Church; in which caſe the Church of</hi> Rome
<hi>ſhould no longer be Head, nor have any Soveraignty over
Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But letting that paſs, we come now to conſider the
Arguments brought to prove <hi>Peter</hi>'s being Biſhop of
the particular Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and becauſe they who
affirm he was ſo, do with equal confidence maintain,
That he was alſo Biſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi> for about ſeven
years, we will here take that part of the Story into
our thoughts.</p>
               <p>1. That <hi>Peter</hi> was an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> no man that believes
the New Teſtament can doubt; but that there is ſome
difference between an Apoſtle and a <hi>Biſhop</hi> properly ſo
called,<note place="margin">A Difference between be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of ſuch a particular place.</note> will, I think, not be denied: For, the Apoſtles
were immediately called by Chriſt, and all the World
was their Dioceſs; for ſo runs their Commiſſion, <hi>Mark</hi>
16. 15. <hi>Go you into all the World, preach the Goſpel to
every Creature;</hi> ſo that it was an <hi>Extraordinary Office,</hi>
conſiſting of Perſonal Priviledges, as <hi>Immediate Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
power to work Miracles, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality of Juriſdiction,</hi>
and <hi>Infallibility</hi> in all things they preached or writ rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the Goſpel, being dictated unto, and ſpecially
guided by the Divine Spirit. But Biſhops are choſen by
<hi>men,</hi> and have a certain Seat and Church, and their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
is ordinary, 1 <hi>Tim. 3. 1. Tit. 1. 5. 1. Pet.</hi> 5. 2. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Peter</hi> being an Apoſtle, could not, I conceive, be
Biſhop either of <hi>Antioch</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi> in the proper ſtrict
ſenſe of the word, for this had been a kind of <hi>Degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>
him from a ſuperior and more <hi>ample</hi> Office, to one
Inferior and Reſtrained.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant, That as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
at large an <hi>Inſpecter</hi> or <hi>Overſeer,</hi> every Apoſtle
where ever he happen'd to come, might be ſaid to be
Biſhop of that place (but not excluſively to others.)
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98580:20"/>
And thus you may (if you pleaſe) call <hi>Paul</hi> a General
Biſhop,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 28.</note> becauſe he teſtifies, <hi>That he had the care of all
the Churches.</hi> And in this reſpect we read of the <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate
of Judas,</hi> Act. 1. 20. <hi>His Biſhoprick let another
take,</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] and in ſuch a ſenſe
St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls himſelf <hi>Presbyter</hi> or <hi>Elder,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 1.</p>
               <p>I alſo agree, that <hi>Peter</hi> or any other Apoſtle might,
wherever he came, act and diſcharge all parts of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
Function, whether <hi>Ministerial</hi> or <hi>Governing.</hi>
But all this will not Conſtitute him proper Biſhop of
this or that particular Church, or of one more than
another; for tho a Prince in his Progreſs may do ſome
acts that belong to the Office of a <hi>Mayor,</hi> or other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Governor of that Town, where he happens to
lodg; yet it cannot be ſaid that he is the Mayor or
particular Governor of ſuch a Corporation, for that
would be a Diminution of his Royal Dignity; no more
did the Apoſtles become <hi>Local Biſhops,</hi> becauſe of their
exerciſing Epiſcopal Power in any particular Church by
virtue of their Power Apoſtolical, wherein the other
was included. Nor can the <hi>firſt Planter</hi> or Eſtabliſher
of a Church as ſuch, be ſtiled the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of ſuch a
Church, for then both <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and all the reſt
of the Apoſtles muſt be <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>many</hi> ſeveral Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes.</p>
               <p>2.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Peter</hi> was not Ordained Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of any particular Church.</note> If <hi>Peter</hi> were Biſhop either of <hi>Antioch</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi>
then either he muſt be <hi>Ordain'd</hi> ſuch by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or by
<hi>men</hi> after Chriſt's Aſcenſion; or elſe he conſtituted <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi>
Biſhop there: But nether of theſe three can be
ſaid.</p>
               <p>Not the <hi>firſt,</hi> for as there appears no footſteps of
ſuch an Ordination in Scripture; ſo if by Chriſt he
were Conſtituted Preſident over any one particular
Church, how could he ſhare in that Command, <hi>Go forth
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98580:20"/>
and preach to every Nation?</hi> Nor were there before our
Lords Aſcenſion any ſuch <hi>Churches</hi> in being.</p>
               <p>Not the <hi>ſecond;</hi> for then he muſt relinquiſh the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical
Office, which he received of Chriſt, and ſuffer
himſelf to be ſo far Degraded by men, as to undertake
a meaner and more limited Office: As if the Biſhop of
<hi>London</hi> ſhould be made <hi>Parſon of Pancras.</hi> Hence too, it
would follow, That St. <hi>Peter</hi> thenceforth, inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Prince of the Apoſtles, ſhould as Biſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi>
or <hi>Rome</hi> be inferior to the other Apoſtles, who were not
<hi>Ordained of men, nor by men,</hi> Gal. 1.</p>
               <p>Not the <hi>third;</hi> for no man <hi>aſſumeth this honour to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi>
Heb. 5. 4. <hi>Peter</hi> or any other Apoſtle might Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
<hi>others</hi> to be Biſhops in ſuch places as needed them:
But that they ſhould or would Create <hi>themſelves</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
of this or that Peculiar Church, we have no
Ground to believe: By what Words, what Rites,
what Ceremonies did they do it? Or how, when, where,
did <hi>Peter</hi> declare himſelf to be the proper Biſhop either
of <hi>Antioch</hi> or <hi>Rome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is it not utterly incredible, That <hi>Peter</hi> the Supream
Head and Monarch of the Church on Earth (as they
pretend) ſhould for thirty two years be Biſhop, and have
the particular Charge and Cure of Two of the greateſt
Cities in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and that too, whilſt moſt
of the other Apoſtles were living, and yet none of them
(nor he himſelf) in any of their Writings ſhould ſay
one ſyllable of it, nor mention ſo much as one <hi>ſingle
Epiſcopal Act</hi> done by him in either of thoſe Cities in all
that time? No, nor St. <hi>Luke</hi> in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi>
nor St. <hi>Paul</hi> who lived long in <hi>Antioch,</hi> and longer at
<hi>Rome,</hi> and had opportunity, nay (had it been true) we
may ſay a kind of neceſſity to have mentioned it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:98580:21"/>
I confeſs,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Peter</hi> more likely to be Biſhop of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> than of <hi>Antioch</hi> or <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </note> were it pretended, that <hi>Peter</hi> had been <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of Jeruſalem,</hi> it might ſeem ſomewhat probable; for
as he is ſtiled the <hi>Apostle of the Circumciſion;</hi> ſo 'tis appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from Scripture, that he took much pains, and ſpent
ſeveal years in Preaching there, and in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Territories; and if he were the chief, or moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
of the Apoſtles, and they were all to have ſeveral
and reſpective Biſhopricks, ſince <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was
the firſt and <hi>Mother Church,</hi> from whence the Goſpel
was ſpread abroad into all the Earth; (other Churches
being but as ſo many Colonies derived from thence)
'twas reaſonable he ſhould have the conduct <hi>thereof,</hi> and
be Biſhop of the firſt that was planted in the World;
but there appears nothing ſo much colour of Reaſon to
call him <hi>Biſhop</hi> either of <hi>Antioch</hi> or <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For as the Goſpel was firſt Preached at <hi>Antioch</hi> by
ſome of the ſcattered Believers from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
advanc'd by <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and afterwards more fully
Eſtabliſht there by <hi>Paul,</hi> who both labour'd there for one
whole year, and with Eminent ſucceſs; inſomuch that
the Diſciples were firſt called Chriſtians at <hi>Antioch,</hi> Acts
11. It might thence ſeem reaſonable, to Intitle one of
them to <hi>that Biſhoprick;</hi> but to aſſign <hi>Peter</hi> thereto, is
to make him <hi>build on other mens foundations,</hi> and to
<hi>reap where he had not ſown;</hi> eſpecially ſince we find no
Intimation of his ever being there, ſave <hi>once</hi> mentioned
by the by, and then ſo far from acting as Biſhop there,
that he ſeems not throughly to have underſtood the
ſtate and uſages of that Church, but was withſtood and
rebuked by St. <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> had planted ſo flouriſhing a
Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> would <hi>Peter</hi> meerly to ſhew his
<hi>power,</hi> thruſt himſelf in to be <hi>Biſhop</hi> there? Or if he
did, why would he leave it and go to <hi>Rome?</hi> Was it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98580:21"/>
the latter was the Richer, the larger and the more
Honourable? So indeed <hi>Platina</hi> (as you heard) ſeems
to intimate, ſaying, that it was becauſe that <hi>Imperial
City was more ſuitable to his pontificial Dignity.</hi> But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<hi>Peter,</hi> who heard Chriſt telling him, amongſt the
other Diſciples, when they began to vye for ſuperiority,
that <hi>it ſhould not be ſo amongſt them;</hi> and who himſelf
charges the Miniſters of the Goſpel, not to <hi>carry it as
Lords over the Flock committed to their charge,</hi> could not
ſo quickly forget <hi>both,</hi> and abandon that Humility ſo
much recommended by his Maſter and himſelf, to ſeek
out a ſplendid place to be Biſhop of, that thereby he
and his <hi>Succeſſors</hi> might ſeem great in the World.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe <hi>Peter</hi> once Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> how could he
<hi>Tranſlate</hi> his See from thence to <hi>Rome,</hi> unleſs he were
removed by ſome <hi>Order</hi> or Miſſion of the reſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
or elſe that he himſelf had ſome ſpecial Viſion
or Revelation ſo to do? But neither of theſe are as yet
proved, nor ſo much as attempted. <hi>Oſius</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Corduba</hi> (one of no ſmall account amongſt the 318 Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the firſt Council of <hi>Nice</hi>) in the Council at <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi>
held about the year 340, did Declare, That <hi>it was not
Lawful for a Biſhop to leave his City, and undertake an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
for thereby it would appear that he was inflam'd
with Covetouſneſs, or a ſlave to Ambition, that he might
domineer,</hi> which was Synodically by the word <hi>Placet,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
unto by all the Fathers.</p>
               <p>This was likewiſe the ſenſe of ſeveral other Councils,
<note n="*" place="margin">Con. Nic. Can. 15. 16. l Conc. <hi>Antioch.</hi> can. 21. 22. Conc. Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. Can. 10.</note> and that all the Acts of ſuch a Biſhop at the ſecond
place, ſhould be accounted <hi>Null and Void,</hi> and he <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
back to his former Church.</hi> Theſe being the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
of thoſe Ancient Fathers, certainly if <hi>Peter</hi> had
removed his See from <hi>Antioch</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> they would
out of Reverence to the Prince of the Apoſtles, have ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98580:22"/>
their Opinions in the Caſe. If Councils are <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi>
in their Decrees, then it appears <hi>Peter</hi> being once
Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> did an ill act in Tranſlating himſelf
to <hi>Rome;</hi> if <hi>Peter</hi> did <hi>well</hi> in Tranſlating his See from
<hi>Antioch</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> as being the much greater and Imperial
City, then theſe Councils were <hi>Raſh,</hi> and did Err in ſuch
their General Condemnations of the like Removes; ſo
that either way, the Authority of <hi>Peter,</hi> or that of
Councils, muſt be Impaired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> indeed tells us, That <hi>Peters</hi> Remove from
<hi>Antioch</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> was <hi>Jubente Domino, by the Lords
Command;</hi> but offers no kind of proof of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
when yet all the ſtrength of his Argument to
Confirm the Supremacy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Chair, muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
thereon. Let them but ſhew that Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
for <hi>Peters</hi> fixing his Epiſcopal Chair at <hi>Rome,</hi> and
it will put an end not only to <hi>this,</hi> but divers other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies;
we will then readily obey our bleſſed Lords
Command, and the Popes too; but they cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
any ſuch Command, nay confeſs that there is none,
<hi>Nullum Chriſti ea de re Decretum Extat, no Decree of
Chriſt is extant about that matter,</hi> ſays <hi>Cornelius</hi> a <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pide,</hi>
in <hi>Apoc. 17. v.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>If it be alledged,<note place="margin">Object.</note> That the <hi>Fact of the Apoſtle does
argue Gods command</hi> as its precedent Cauſe, and they ſhall
urge, That <hi>Peter</hi> did remove to <hi>Rome;</hi> But <hi>Peter</hi> was
<hi>Inſpired</hi> by the Holy Ghoſt, Therefore we ought to
believe that this Tranſlation of his ſeat was by the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Dictates or Guidance of the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>I anſwer,</p>
               <p>1. This Argument has no place nor force until ſuch
time as they have ſubſtantially proved the fact it ſelf,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
that is, That <hi>Peter did remove from</hi> Antioch <hi>to</hi> Rome,
and with an intent to eſtabliſh at the latter place, the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98580:22"/>
ſeat of Eccleſiaſtick Empire; but this cannot at all be
proved, or at leaſt as yet is not.</p>
               <p>2. Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi> of all men, ought not however
be allow'd to plead this; for in his Treatiſe <hi>De Verbo Dei,</hi>
L. 4. C. 4. he ſticks not to <hi>deny,</hi> That <hi>Peter, Paul, or
other of the ſacred Penmen wrote the Holy Scriptures by
Gods ſpecial command:</hi> And will the ſame man, without
any proof, obtrude on us a Command of God for placing
<hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair at <hi>Rome?</hi> Juſtly may we retort his own
words (<hi>Mutatis mutandis</hi>) in the place laſt cited. <q>If
it had been the purpoſse of Chriſt and <hi>Peter</hi> to place the
ſeat of Chriſtian Empire, or viſible Headſhip of the
whole Church, at <hi>Rome,</hi> undoubtedly, it being a thing
of ſuch moment, Chriſt would have commanded it,
and <hi>Peter</hi> would ſomewhere have witneſſed, That he
by the Lords command fixed his ſeat there; But this
we no where read, no not ſo much as one word, that
he ever was at <hi>Rome,</hi> or had any thing to do there;</q>
Therefore we are not bound to believe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Euſebius</hi>'s <hi>Chronicon</hi> is commonly cited to prove <hi>Peter</hi>
was Biſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi> ſeven years,<note place="margin">Euſebius abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to colour <hi>Peter's</hi> being Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </note> and of <hi>Rome</hi> Twenty
five years. Now <hi>Euſebius</hi> does there indeed ſay, That
<hi>Peter founded the Church of Antioch</hi> (which yet is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contrary to Scripture) but ſo far is he from ſaying,
That he was Seven years Biſhop there, That he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tells us, <hi>Euodius was its firſt Biſhop.</hi> And ſo far like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
from affirming that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was Twenty five years
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he does not ſay he was <hi>Biſhop of</hi>
Rome <hi>at all;</hi> but only, that <hi>Peter</hi> having firſt founded
the Church of <hi>Antioch, went to</hi> Rome <hi>to Preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.
Peter</hi>'s being Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> Twenty five years is
none of <hi>Euſebius</hi>'s Teſtimony, there being not a Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to that purpoſe in the Original <hi>Greek</hi> (in which
Language he wrote) but thoſe words were foiſted into
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98580:23"/>
the <hi>Latin</hi> Copies, which are very much Interpolated
and corrupted, as may be ſeen by <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.

(with the reſt) had the care <hi>of all Churches</hi> (that is, as
far as every one was able) committed unto him; As an
Apoſtle he was <hi>Divinely inſpired</hi> and enabled infallibly
to reveal the mind of Chriſt: Now, all theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to him as a Believer and Apoſtle, I deſire to
know what further Priviledg could accrue to him beſides,
as Biſhop of any particular place, were it either <hi>Antioch</hi>
or <hi>Rome?</hi> If the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will ſhew us any body ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<hi>Peter</hi> in the enjoyment of thoſe extraordinary
Priviledges before mentioned, they muſt beſpeak ſuch
perſon to ſucceed him in his <hi>Apoſtleſhip,</hi> and not in his
pretended <hi>Biſhoprick:</hi> For whatever Authority, Power
or Juriſdiction <hi>Peter</hi> had over all Churches in the World,
or whatever unerring Judgment in matters of Faith, the
ſame belonged unto him as he was an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> long before
he is fancied to have been the Biſhop of any particular
place; ſo that if it were neceſſary that ſome one ſhould
ſucceed <hi>Peter</hi> in his <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> Why not much more
neceſſary in his <hi>Apoſtleſhip?</hi> And then why was it not
needful that <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould have a <hi>Succeſſor</hi> as well as <hi>Peter?</hi>
and <hi>John</hi> the ſurvivor of all the reſt of the Apoſtles, as
well as any of them?</p>
               <p>Again, If we muſt believe the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to be
<hi>Peter</hi>'s Succeſſor, it will, I hope, not be unlawful to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<hi>wherein?</hi> And therefore I demand,</p>
               <p>1. Doth the Pope ſucceed St. <hi>Peter</hi> in all that he had
in Commiſſion, and was empowered to do in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
unto the Church of God? Doth he ſucceed
him in the <hi>manner of his Call</hi> to his Office? <hi>Peter</hi>
was called <hi>immediately</hi> by Chriſt in his own perſon;
The Pope is Elected by the Conclave of <hi>Cardinals,</hi>
concerning whom, their Office, Priviledges, Power
and Right, to chooſe the Succeſſor of St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:98580:24"/>
there is not one ſyllable, either in Seripture, or any
Monuments of pure Antiquity for divers hundred
years; and how many times the Cardinals have
been Influenc'd by powerful <hi>Strumpets, Baronius</hi>
himſelf has inform'd us; and how much in latter
Ages to this day, <hi>the Factions</hi> of ſeveral Princes
prevail, cannot be unknown to any that is not a
ſtranger to Hiſtory, and the Modern Tranſactions
of the World.</p>
               <p>2. Doth the Pope Succeed <hi>Peter</hi> in the way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his perſonal <hi>Diſcharge</hi> of his Office and
imployment? Not in the leaſt: For <hi>Peter</hi> in the
purſuit of his Commiſſion and Obedience unto
the Command of his Lord, travel'd to and fro
Preaching the Goſpel, and planting and watering
the Churches of Chriſt in Patience, Self-denial,
Humility, Zeal, Temperance and Meekneſs;
whereas the Pope Reigns at <hi>Rome</hi> in eaſe, exalting
himſelf above <hi>Kings,</hi> and without taking the leaſt
pains in his own perſon for the Converſion of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
or edification of the Diſciples of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>3. Doth every Pope or Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſucceed <hi>Peter</hi> in
his <hi>perſonal qualifications,</hi> which were of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
advantage to the Church of God in his
days, <hi>viz.</hi> His <hi>Faith, Love, Holineſs, Light</hi> and
<hi>Knowledg?</hi> This cannot with any modeſty be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
ſince the beſt Hiſtorians of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Caſt, confeſs many Popes to have been groſly <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,</hi>
and flagitiouſly <hi>Wicked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Doth the Pope ſucceed <hi>Peter</hi> in the way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Exerciſing his Care and Authority towards
the Churches of Chriſt? As little as in any of the
reſt: For <hi>Peter</hi> did it by his <hi>Prayers</hi> for the Churches,
by his <hi>perſonal Viſitation</hi> and Inſtruction of them,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98580:24"/>
by his <hi>Writings</hi> Divinely inſpired for their direction
and guidance according to the Will of God. But
the Pope proceeds by <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Conſiſtorial Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,</hi>
executed by <hi>Intricate Proceſſes</hi> and Officers,
unknown not only to <hi>Peter,</hi> but all Antiquity; and
whoſe Ways, Orders, Terms and Practices St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
himſelf, were he here again upon Earth, would
as little underſtand, as approve.</p>
               <p>5. Doth the Pope ſucceed <hi>Peter</hi> in his perſonal <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility?</hi>
Let the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> agree, if they can, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
themſelves upon an Anſwer to this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Or doth he ſucceed him in his power of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Mirales?</hi> I do not hear that his <hi>preſent Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
pretends to that Talent, tho Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> 7.
ſeems to have had ſome inclinations that way, when
he was wont to ſcare the people by <hi>ſhaking fire out
of his ſleeve,</hi> as Cardinal <hi>Benno</hi> relates the Story.
<hi>Laſtly,</hi> Doth the Pope ſucceed <hi>Peter</hi> in the <hi>Doctrine</hi>
that he taught? It hath been prov'd a Thouſand
times (and we are ready when ever call'd upon, to
demonſtrate it again) That he doth not, but hath
<hi>added</hi> to, <hi>detracted</hi> from, and many ways <hi>pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
it.</p>
               <p>Wherein then doth <hi>this Succeſſion</hi> of the Pope to <hi>Peter,</hi>
which they talk ſo much of, conſiſt? Why, in his Power,
Authority, Juriſdiction and Supremacy over the whole
Church; In the Eccleſiaſtical Monarchy, with the ſecular
Advantages of Riches, Honour and Pomp that attend it.
An excellent contrivance! In the things that <hi>Peter</hi> really
enjoy'd, and which were of ſingular advantage to the
Church of God, the Popes diſclaim, or dare not pretend
any Succeſſion unto him; but fix it on things wherein
he was no way concern'd, but which vaſtly make for
their own worldly Intereſt. On this <hi>ſuppoſititious Anvil</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:98580:25"/>
do they forge out to themſelves a Monarchy <hi>direct</hi> and
abſolute in Eccleſiaſtical things over the whole Church;
<hi>Indirect</hi> at leaſt, and <hi>in Ordine ad Spiritualia,</hi> over the
whole World. And this is the great <hi>Diana,</hi> in making
of Shrines for which, the main buſineſs and livelihood
of many Thouſands of their inferiour <hi>Craftſmen</hi> does
conſiſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ſtill to prove</hi> Peter<hi>'s being Biſhop of</hi> Rome,<note place="margin">Whence the Dignity of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>the
Cardinal argues from the</hi> Dignity of the Roman Church;
<hi>which (ſaith he) was</hi> ever accounted the chiefeſt of all
others: But there can be no other Reaſon why it ſhould be
ſo, but becauſe St. <hi>Peter</hi> the Prince of the Apoſtles was the
proper Paſtor and Biſhop of that Church; <hi>Bellarm. de Rom.

               <p>For Anſwer to which, be pleaſed to obſerve,</p>
               <p>1. What a pretty <hi>Circle</hi> is here; The Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
is the chief of all Churches, becauſe St. <hi>Peter</hi> was its
Biſhop; But how does it appear, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was its
Biſhop? Becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> is the chief of all Churches—
<hi>Riſum teneatis?</hi>
               </p>

condemn'd it, allowing none to be called <hi>Princeps ſacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotum,
the Prince of Prieſts</hi>) ſo neither is it true, That
<hi>Rome</hi> was always accounted the chief of all Churches;
for <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was the Mother Church, planted by our
Saviour in perſon, and his Twelve Apoſtles, with whom
were the Seventy Diſciples, ſuch Teachers as no other
Church ever had at once; and from thence the Goſpel
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98580:25"/>
was propagated to the reſt of the World, and to <hi>Rome it
ſelf.</hi> The Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> is celebrated in Scripture
for being <hi>enriched with all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tterance, and all knowledg,
and for coming behind in no Gift,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 5, and 7. The
Church of the <hi>Epheſians</hi> (for I think that place may
much more juſtly be reſtrained to that particular Church,
than it can be applied to the <hi>Roman,</hi> which we often ſee
done) is called, <hi>The Church of the Living God, the Pillar
and Ground of Truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 15. The Church of the
<hi>Theſſalonians</hi> is commended for <hi>following the Churches of
Judea</hi> [not that of <hi>Rome,</hi> tho the Epiſtle was wrote
from thence] 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 14. 'Tis true the Primitive
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> wants not its praiſes too; For St. <hi>Paul</hi>

was <hi>the ſame</hi> that was in all Nations; amongſt (not <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove)
whom are ye alſo,</hi> Rom. 1. 5, and 6. But what is
this commendation of their Faith <hi>then,</hi> to the Church of

                  <note n="*" place="margin">In Catalog.</note> mentions

the fourth St. <hi>Peter's Revelations,</hi> and the fifth a
<hi>Book of Judgment—</hi> All which he owns to be <hi>Apocryphal.</hi>
And <hi>Euſebius</hi> tells of a long tedious <hi>Diſputation</hi> between
<hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Apion</hi> far different from Apoſtolical Purity
and ſimplicity; which (ſaith he) <hi>came forth but yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
under St.</hi> Clement's <hi>Name, never once heard of in

in the Fathers, than complaints of <hi>ſuppoſitious</hi> Books,
<hi>Interpolations</hi> and <hi>Forgeries</hi> made in their Works, or
thoſe of their Anceſtors, by Hereticks of one ſort or other.
Thus <hi>Dionyſius</hi> of <hi>Corinth</hi> in <hi>Euſebius</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 4. Ca. 22.</note> bewails, That
the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> (Meſſengers or Agents) <hi>of Satan had ſown
Tares in his Epiſtles, omitting ſome things, and adding o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
And hence it is, that many Books wearing the
Names of Orthodox Fathers, and inſerted in their Works,
are even by the moſt Learned of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves
confeſs'd not to have been Penn'd by thoſe to whom they
are attributed, but foiſted in under their Names.</p>

Since therefore ſuch <hi>ill practices</hi> were riſe ſo early, We
muſt not take all for <hi>Gold</hi> that Gliſters with the Gloſs of
Antiquity; but make uſe of the <hi>Touchſtone</hi> of Judgment

For all the Authors vouch'd in this Diſpute by the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi>

will tell us, He was a moſt <hi>Pious Learned Man,</hi> a
Diſciple of St. <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, and ſome of their
Chronologers place him in the firſt Century. Nor will
this Compariſon (I hope) be though too <hi>ſevere</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming,
when the judicious Reader ſhall have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the following juſt Animadverſions, wherein we
ſhall make it appear, both that there has been groſs <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery</hi>
committed to inhance the credit of this <hi>Papias,</hi> and
that he was indeed a perſon whoſe Judgment or Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
ought to be but of very little value.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, be it obſerv'd, That in the latter Editions
and Tranſlations of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> there is an high Character
given of <hi>Papias—At the ſame time</hi> (ſays <hi>Euſebius,</hi>
as <hi>Valeſius</hi> renders him) <hi>Papias was famous, a Man very
Eloquent and Learned, well skill'd in the Scriptures. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopherſon</hi>
in his Tranſlation, adds further beyond the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98580:28"/>
Text, That he was a perſon <hi>moſt excellently skill'd in the
knowledge of all other Arts—</hi> But the Truth is, all this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of <hi>Papias</hi> is a <hi>Forgery; Euſebius</hi> is corrupted,
and theſe Encomiums (by I know not whom, but we may
gueſs for <hi>what end</hi>) ſhuffled into the Text long after <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
was dead; which I prove by the following Reaſons:</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Ruffinus</hi> who tranſlated <hi>Euſebius</hi> above 1200 years ago
in that place, has only this—<hi>About theſe times flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed</hi>
Polycarp <hi>Biſhip of</hi> Smyrna, <hi>and</hi> Papias <hi>of</hi> Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropolis—giving
us not one world of that praiſe of him,
which is now extant in <hi>Euſebius;</hi> whence we juſtly
conclude that anciently it was not there, ſince no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
can be Aſſigned why <hi>Ruſſinus</hi> ſhould omit it.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Valeſius,</hi> a very Learned <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, who laſt
publiſh'd <hi>Euſebius,</hi> confeſſes, that of 3 or 4 <hi>Greek</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts
of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> which he made uſe of in his Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not any of them had that commendation of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pias:</hi>
And therefore he doubts not, but thoſe words
were added by ſome <hi>Ignorant Scholiaſt contrary to the
Judgment and ſenſe of</hi> Euſebius <hi>[Non dubito quin haec
verba ab Imperito Scholiaſte adjecta ſunt praeter Euſebii
mentem &amp; ſententiam—</hi> Valeſ. in Not. ad L. 3. <hi>Euſeb.</hi>
ca. 36.] For.</p>
               <p>3. The Addition of theſe Words (as the ſame Learned
man obſerves) makes <hi>Euſebius</hi> write <hi>Nonſence</hi> and
contradict himſelf, by calling <hi>Papias</hi> a <hi>moſt Learned</hi>
man, and <hi>moſt skill'd in the Scriptures;</hi> of whom in the
ſame Book, he ſays, That he was a <hi>Rude and ſimple
perſon,</hi> of very <hi>little wit</hi> and judgment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which
he gives ſeveral Inſtances: So much for the Forgery.</p>
               <p>2. Our ſecond Obſervation touching <hi>Papias,</hi> ſhall be, That
he is ſaid to have been a friend to, or familiar with <hi>Polycar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus;</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Euſeb. l. 3. c. 39.</note> But <hi>Polycarpus</hi> according to <hi>Baronius,</hi> ſuffer'd Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom
in the year of our Lord 167.<note n="†" place="margin">Baron. Mart. ad diem Jan 26.</note> And the ſame <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
places <hi>Peter</hi>'s Martyrdom, <hi>Anno Chr.</hi> 69. So that <hi>Papias</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:98580:29"/>
muſt flouriſh near. 100 <hi>years after Peter</hi>'s Death, a diſtance
long enough in thoſe times when ſo many <hi>falſe things</hi> were
bruited abroad touching the Apoſtles Acts and Sufferings,
for one that dwelt at a great diſtance of place, and took his
Information but upon Hear-ſay to be deceived.</p>
               <p>3. Since none of <hi>Papias</hi>'s Books are Extant, whereby we
might be enabled to judg of the man by his <hi>own Works,</hi> it
will be requiſite to remark what Character <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who
brings him on the Stage, gives of him; which in brief is this—
<q>That he was one that neither <hi>heard</hi> nor <hi>ſaw</hi> any of the
Apoſtles, but received what he heard from their <hi>followers,</hi>
as <hi>Ariſto</hi> and <hi>John</hi> (not the Apoſtle, but) a certain Elder.
That he thought he could not benefit ſo much by reading
the <hi>Scriptures</hi> as by Conference with men that had been
<hi>acquainted</hi> with the Authors of them. That he was ſo
little acquainted with the Scriptures, that he miſtook <hi>that
Philip</hi> whoſe Daughters were Propheteſſes, to be <hi>Philip</hi> the
Apoſtle</q> [when the Text, had he read or remembred it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly,
ſays, It was <hi>Philip</hi> the Deacon] <q>That he had, by ſuch
Traditions, ſtrange Parables and Preachings of our Bleſſed
Saviour, and other things very <hi>Fabulous;</hi> amongſt the reſt
advanc'd the Hereſy of the <hi>Millenaries;</hi> and that he fell
into thoſe Errors through Ignorance, and not underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aright thoſe Narrations that were told him as from the
Apoſtles; That he Expounded a certain Hiſtory of a
Woman accuſed before Chriſt of many crimes written in
the Goſpel according to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> [which was a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit].
In fine, That he was a man of <hi>little wit,</hi> or ſmall
judgment, as appear'd by his Books; yet gave unto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Eccleſiaſtical Writers occaſion of Error, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
his Antiquity,</q> ſee <hi>Euſeb.</hi> l. 3. c. 22. 35, 39. and
<hi>Nicephorus</hi> l. 3. c. 20.</p>
               <p>Here you have both the <hi>Genius</hi> or Humor of the Man,
eaſy to be impoſed upon, taking up things by Hear-ſay;
one that was not aſham'd to own, That he thought hearing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98580:29"/>
                  <hi>Oral Tradition</hi> more profitable than Reading the <hi>Scriptures,</hi>
that is, That to hearken to the Stories and <hi>Tales</hi> of private
<hi>fallible</hi> perſons (in matters of Religion) was more benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
than to ſtudy the <hi>Sacred Oracles</hi> of God penn'd by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely
inſpired infallible perſons, and able to make the <hi>man
of God perfect in all good works;</hi> one of ſmall judgment, and
who embrac'd Fables, Hereſies and Counterfeit Goſpels: As
alſo you are told the <hi>bad effects</hi> of all this, <hi>viz.</hi> That he miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
many ſubſequent Eccleſiaſtical Authors into Error, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too great a reverence to his Antiquity, without due
enquiry into the Truth of his Aſſertions, or Examination of
the Grounds whereon he delivered them.</p>
               <p>Now ſince ſuch a perſon was the firſt that <hi>inſinuated Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
being at <hi>Rome</hi> (for I do not find that he plainly <hi>affirm'd</hi>
it (much leſs that <hi>Peter</hi> was Biſhop there) only inferr'd it by
interpreting <hi>Babylon</hi> in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Epiſtle to ſignify <hi>Rome</hi>)
if, I ſay, <hi>ſuch an one</hi> were the firſt (as for ought appears he
was) that ever intimated any ſuch thing, how far either his
<hi>Talk,</hi> or that of thoſe that <hi>relate it after him,</hi> is to be valued,
I leave the intelligent Reader to judg; ſince nothing is
more common in <hi>Hiſtorics,</hi> than for the miſtake of <hi>one</hi> to
draw others into error; and that this <hi>Papias</hi> actually did
miſlead many, we have the home Teſtimony of <hi>Euſebius</hi>
before recited; and why not in this buſineſs of <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>being
at</hi> Rome, as well as in that of the <hi>Millenary</hi> Reign, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi>
Nay rather in the <hi>former</hi> than the <hi>latter,</hi> ſince good inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
men were more like to ſwallow this report of an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<hi>matter of fact</hi> (as they could not but apprehend this
of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Writing from <hi>Rome,</hi> to be, not imagining what
fine conſequence after-times would thence derive) than to
entertain a <hi>Doctrinal point</hi> without Examination, and to be
more eaſily inveigled into a miſtake in Hiſtory, than into
<hi>Hereſy;</hi> for under no better figure was that opinion of the
<hi>Chiliaſts,</hi> look'd upon in ſucceeding Ages, tho for ſome time
on the credit of the ſaid <hi>Papias</hi> receiv'd (or at leaſt unop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed)
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98580:30"/>
by not a few Fathers of the Church—So much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Papias,</hi> who (for ought I know) might in the main
be a very honeſt <hi>well-meaning man,</hi> though miſled by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
reports, and a Zeal not according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
Nor ſhould I thus have repeated his Failures (which
I charitably hope God has forgiven) did not the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of ſome People, vapouring with his <hi>Name</hi> and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
render theſe Reflections neceſſary.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Egeſippus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of Egeſippus.</note> when he lived is doubtful, ſome ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Year 101. others 145. others 170. but this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
That <hi>what</hi> we have now abroad in his Name, could
not be wrote by the ſame Perſon whom <hi>Euſebius</hi> mentions
<hi>l. 4. c.</hi> 8. For whereas he is ſaid to have gathered his Books
out of the Goſpel <hi>ſecundum Hebraeos</hi> [the beſt of their
Vouchers you ſee followed counterfeit Goſpels] and wrote
Commentaries of the Doctrine and Acts of the Apoſtles, and
that too in a <hi>plain homely ſtile,</hi> as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> notes; this
counterfeit <hi>Egeſippus</hi> affects a very <hi>loſty Phraſe,</hi> and affords
us only five Books of the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> out of
<hi>Joſephus;</hi> and particularly makes mention of the City of
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> a name not known in the World till the
great <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who, beginning to Reign (alone) but in
the Year 327. cauſed <hi>Byzantium</hi> to be called ſo; therefore
the Writer thereof, whoever he was, muſt of neceſſity live
near 200 Years, if not much more, after that good man
in whoſe name they would obtrude it.</p>
               <p>We come now to the <hi>decretal Epiſtles;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of the Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Epiſtles.</note> and indeed were
theſe Genuine, they would not only diſpatch the Buſineſs
of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s being Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> but of the Popes Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
too, and many other of their modern <hi>Articles of
Faith.</hi> But touching ſuch <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> we ſhall briefly obſerve;
1. What they are, and when, and by whom firſt Midwiv'd
into the World. 2. Offer Reaſons demonſtrating (as I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend)
that they are generally <hi>ſpurious.</hi> 3. Recite the
ſubſtance of <hi>two</hi> of them more peculiarly relating to our
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98580:30"/>
preſent Argument, with a few Animadverſions thereon.</p>
               <p>Theſe Decretal Epiſtles are <hi>Letters ſuppoſed to be Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatively
written upon emergent Occaſions by the Primitive
Biſhops of</hi> Rome,<note place="margin">What they are.</note> beginning with <hi>Clement</hi> (one of <hi>Peter</hi>'s
pretended immediate Succeſſors) in whoſe name there are
five; four in the name of <hi>Anacletus,</hi> two of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s,
three of <hi>Sixtus</hi>'s, and ſo downwards, ſometimes one, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timetimes
two, ſometimes three, from every ſucceeding
Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> for the firſt 300 Years, and further.</p>
               <p>All which Epiſtles came firſt abroad about the Year of
our Lord 790. under the Title of <hi>A Collection of Councils
and Decretal Epiſtles,</hi> pretended to be made by <hi>Iſidore</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Hiſpalis</hi> (that is <hi>Sevil</hi>) in <hi>Spain,</hi> with a Preface in
his Name, wherein he declares that he collected the ſame
by the Advice <hi>of fourſcore Biſhops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the truth is,<note place="margin">The Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on aſcribed to <hi>Iſidore</hi> a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit.</note> to make the piece uniform, not only
the materials are <hi>Forgeries,</hi> but the Collection it ſelf, and
its Author <hi>are Counterfeits;</hi> for although there were ſuch
a man (and of eminent note in the Church) as <hi>Iſidore</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Sevil,</hi> yet he could not be the Author of this Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Preface, as is proved at large by <hi>Blondel</hi> in his
Book Intituled <hi>Pſeudo-Iſidorns,</hi> or <hi>Turrianus Vapulans,</hi> where
<note n="*" place="margin">Pſeudo Iſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. <hi>cap.</hi> 2.</note> he obſerves, that thoſe that write of <hi>Iſidore</hi>'s Death, at
higheſt, fix it on the Year 647. as <hi>Vaſaeus;</hi> in his Chronicle;
others on the Year 643. as<note n="†" place="margin">Hiſtor. l. 2. c. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Rodericus Toletanus;</hi> or on the
Year 635. as the <hi>proper office of the Saints of</hi> Spain; or laſtly,
on the Year 636. as <hi>Redemptus Diaconus,</hi> who ſaith he was
himſelf an <hi>Eye-witneſs</hi> of <hi>Iſidore</hi>'s Death; and with whom
agree <hi>Baronius</hi> and many others of the beſt Learned Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts;
ſo that the ſame is the common Opinion.</p>
               <p>Now this counterfeit <hi>Iſidore,</hi> that is, the Prefacer in <hi>Iſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi>'s
Name before this Collection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> makes mention of <hi>Pope
Agatho,</hi> who came not into the Chair until the year 679.

father'd upon <hi>Iſidore</hi> of <hi>Hiſpalis,</hi> and that all thoſe Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops, <hi>from St.</hi> Peter <hi>down to</hi> Siricius
(that is, till the year 387.) <hi>are juſtly ſuſpected.</hi> Nay, he calls
them <hi>Infirm, Adventitious,</hi> and lately <hi>Invented:</hi> And (to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the ſcandal of forging them, from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>)
tell us, <hi>They were firſt brought out of</hi> Spain <hi>into</hi> France <hi>by

               </p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding they were firſt ſtarted in <hi>Spain,</hi> the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may ſtill not unjuſty labounr under a ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of having an hand in the intrigue, if we conſider, firſt,
That the main drift of theſe Epiſtles is to advance <hi>her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:</hi>
Now if (as moſt plain it is) they are Forged, <hi>Cui Bono?</hi>
Who ſhould do it but they, whoſe intereſt alone is thereby
promoted? <hi>2dly,</hi> That when <hi>Hincmarus</hi> oppoſed them, he
was by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſo rigorouſly dealt with, that 'tis
ſaid he was forced to <hi>retract. 3dly,</hi> That when <hi>Benedictus

               <p>Thus much touching <hi>the Author</hi> of this Collection; and
indeed to ſhew the Epiſtles themſelves to be Forgeries, or of
no Credit, we need go no further, having proved that they
were handed into the World by <hi>a Counterfeit;</hi> For what
need <hi>falſe Lights,</hi> where the Wares are not <hi>Braided?</hi> Why a
Vizard in an affair otherwiſe ſo ſafe and honourable, if no ill

taken from the ſubject Matter, Phraſe, Abſurdities, and late
appearing of theſe Epiſtles, which to me are <hi>Invincible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,</hi>
That they are altogether ſpurious.</p>

Holy men zealous of Gods Glory and the good of Souls,
living under afflictions and dreadful Perſecutions, ſcarce one
of them but was <hi>a Martyr</hi> for the Goſpel: Now if ſuch men
had indeed left behind them any <hi>Letters</hi> or written Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs
ſurviving the fury of their Pagan Enemies, to our
times, there is no doubt but we ſhould there find the ſweet
Breathings of the <hi>Spirit of Meekneſs,</hi> the Myſteries of the
Goſpel, Gods infinite Love to miſerable mankind, manifeſted
in the Incarnation and Suffering of the Bleſſed Jeſus for
their Redemption, and the Terms of the Salvation thereby
purchaſed, freely offered to Sinners: We ſhould obſerve the

every where ſeriouſly inculcated: But of all this in
theſe Epiſtles there is <hi>Altum Silentium,</hi> their drift looks not
that way; they forget the ſtate of the Church in that time,
handle nothing of Doctrine, nothing of the neceſſary Office
of the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> nor main Duties of Chriſtian People, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
any thing elſe ſuitable unto that Age, or much worth

to be by wreſting of Scriptures, falſifying <hi>ſtories,</hi> and other
indirect means to advance and lend Colours to the ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or ſpreading the Honour, the Pomp and Empire of the

of all Churches; for as the door is turned about on the Hinge,
ſo all Churches are ruled by the Authority of this Holy See;</hi>
and (not to be tedious in numerous Inſtances) the effect of
all is, That all thoſe <hi>good humble men,</hi> whoſe Names are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed

daily in jeopardy of their Lives, and put to Death for Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

World fill'd with ſuch <hi>Impoſthumated Extravagancies?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The <hi>stile</hi> of theſe Letters is remarkable as well as their
<hi>matter;</hi> they are pretended to be originally written <hi>in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi>
and why not, if from Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe mother
Tongue was at that time <hi>Latine,</hi> and that too not yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated,
but famous for its Elegancy; and underſtood
through a very great part of the then known World? But
in theſe <hi>Decretals,</hi> inſtead of the purity of the <hi>Roman Phraſe,</hi>
you ſhall familiarly encounter ſuch expreſſions as theſe, <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutiones
patienter portare; Peto ut pro me Orare debeas; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopi
Obediendi ſunt, non Inſidiandi. Ab illis omnes Chriſtiani
ſe Cavere debent, &amp;c.</hi> Wherein there is nothing of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity
or <hi>Natural Idiom</hi> of the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue: And ſhall
we think that for 300 years and more, there was not <hi>one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of Rome</hi> that could write <hi>true Latin,</hi> at a time when the
common people there, Men, Women and Children did ſpeak
the ſame as their common Language? It is a Text of the
Popes own Law<note n="*" place="margin">Extrav. de Reſcriptis; Ad Audientiam.</note>

the <hi>Gothic Incurſions</hi> into <hi>Italy, Barbariſms</hi> had overran the
<hi>Roman Tongue,</hi> as well as error and ambition the <hi>Roman Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The abſurdities and falſe <hi>Chronology</hi> of theſe Epiſtles
loudly proclaims them to be <hi>Antedated</hi> and ſpurious; as
St. <hi>Clemens</hi> informs St. <hi>James</hi> of the manner of St.
<hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Death,</hi> yet it is as certain as any thing we have of
thoſe times, and St. <hi>Clemens</hi> undoubtedly knew it, That
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98580:33"/>
                  <hi>James</hi> was put to death 7 years <hi>before St. Peter; Anacletus</hi>
(whom ſome make next Succeſſor to <hi>Peter</hi>) willeth and
ſtraitly chargeth, That all Biſhops once every year do <hi>viſit
the Threſhold of St.</hi> Peter<hi>'s Church at</hi> Rome (<hi>Limina Petri</hi>)
touching which, beſides the abſurdity of ſuch an injunction,
whereby moſt part of the Biſhops throughout the World,
muſt have ſpent all their time in trudging to and fro to
<hi>Rome,</hi> 'tis obſervable, that there was not then, nor for a long
time after any Church built there in the Name of St. <hi>Peter.
Zepherinus</hi> (Epiſt. 1.) ſaith, That Chriſt commanded his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi>
to appoint the 72 Diſciples, but St. <hi>Luke, Ch.</hi> 10. teſtifies,
That <hi>Chriſt himſelf</hi> appointed them. <hi>Antherus</hi> (Ep. 1.) makes
mention of <hi>Euſebius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and of <hi>Faelix</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> yet was neither <hi>Euſebius</hi> nor <hi>Foelix</hi> either
<hi>Biſhop,</hi> or <hi>Born</hi> all the time that <hi>Antherus</hi> lived. <hi>Fabianus</hi>
writes of the coming of <hi>Novatus</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> yet 'tis clear by
St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Euſebius,</hi> That <hi>Novatus</hi> came firſt into <hi>Italy</hi>
in the time of <hi>Cornelius</hi> who ſucceededed this <hi>Fabianus.
Marcellinus</hi> (Epiſt. 2. <hi>ad Oriental</hi>) ſaith, That the Emperor
<hi>might not preſume to attempt any thing againſt the Goſpel,</hi> yet
was there then no Emperor that own'd or underſtood the
Goſpel. <hi>Marcellus</hi> writes to an Heathen Tyrant, and charges
him <hi>very gravely</hi> with the authority of St. <hi>Clement.</hi> And
whereas St. <hi>Luke,</hi> Ch. 3. ſets forth how <hi>John</hi> adviſed the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to be content with their Pay, <hi>Meltiades</hi> quite alters the
ſtory, and names <hi>Chriſt</hi> inſtead of <hi>John;</hi> divers the like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruities
may frequently be met with in theſe Epiſtles.</p>
               <p>4. If theſe Letters had been <hi>real,</hi> Where did they lye hid
4 or 500 years or upwards? Who after ſo long a burial was
able to demonſtrate their ſincerity? How came the Decretals
of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> firſt of all to be heard of, and found
by no body can certainly tell who, in a corner of <hi>Spain?</hi> Tis
evident, neither St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> or <hi>Gennadius,</hi> nor <hi>Damaſus,</hi> nor
any Ancient Father ever alledged any of them, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
we may conclude knew nothing of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:98580:33"/>
Nay the former Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> never inſiſted upon them,
when they might have been <hi>very ſerviceable,</hi> as for example,
at the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> held <hi>An.</hi> 418. by 217 Biſhops (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
whom the great <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was one) where two pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<hi>Canons</hi> of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> ſent thither by <hi>Zozi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
then Pope, to give colour of Right to his receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Appeals</hi> from Foreign Provinces, were detected to be
<hi>forged,</hi> and ſo the claim of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> rejected, and
his Ambition and ill practice ſmartly reproved by Letters,
as by the <hi>Acts of the ſaid Council</hi> yet extant, appears. Now
had <hi>Zozimus</hi> known or dreamt of ſuch a number of <hi>Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals</hi>
ſent abroad by his Predeceſſors, wherein their Right of
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Headſhip, Appeals,</hi> &amp;c. was ſo plainly derived and
aſſerted all along <hi>down from St.</hi> Peter <hi>himſelf,</hi> and that not
by <hi>the Canon</hi> of any Council, but by Abſolute <hi>Divine Right,</hi>
undoubtedly he would have produced or referr'd unto them,
rather than ſtoop to ſo poor and ſhameful a <hi>ſhift</hi> as that of
two counterfeit Canons. But that you may the better
judge of the Genius of theſe Decretal Epiſtles, I ſhall here
preſent you with the effect of <hi>two</hi> of them, which parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
relate to our preſent ſubject.</p>
               <p>The firſt <hi>a Letter</hi> pretended to be wrote by St. <hi>Clemens</hi>
to St. <hi>James,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Letter from <hi>Clement</hi> to St. <hi>James.</hi>
                  </note> wherein an account is undertaken to be given
of <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>laſt words,</hi> and how he ſolemnly appointed the
ſaid <hi>Clement</hi> his <hi>Succeſſor,</hi> in which, after a tedious Harangue
as from St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s mouth, concerning the Dignity and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Chair, he proceeds thus, <q>When he
[St. <hi>Peter]</hi> had ſaid theſe things in the midſt before them
all, he put his hands on me, and compelled me (wearied
with ſhamefacedneſs) to ſit in his Chair, and when I was
ſat, I beſeech thee (ſaid he) O <hi>Clement!</hi> That after (as the
Debt of Nature is) I have ended this preſent Life, thou
wouldeſt briefly write to <hi>James</hi> the Brother of our Lord,
after what ſort thou haſt been a Companion unto me from
the beginning even to the end of my Journey, and my
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98580:34"/>
Acts, and what, being a ſollicitous Hearer, thou haſt taken
from me, diſputing throughout all the Cities, and what in
all my Preaching was the <hi>Order</hi> both of my <hi>Words</hi> and
<hi>Actions,</hi> as alſo <hi>what End</hi> ſhall find me in this City. All theſe
things write unto him; Nor fear that he will be too much
grieved at my End, ſince he will not doubt but I endure it
for the ſake of Piety; but it will be a great ſolace to him to
learn that no <hi>unskilful man,</hi> or unlearned and ignorant of
the Diſcipline of Eccleſiaſtical Order, hath undertaken <hi>my
Chair,</hi>—Wherefore my Lord <hi>James,</hi> when I had received
theſe Precepts from him, I held it neceſſary to fulfil what
he commanded, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> And ſo goes on to tell St. <hi>James</hi> he had
there ſent him the <hi>whole story</hi> of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Preaching under
the Title of the <hi>Itinerary</hi> (or Journies) of <hi>Clement;</hi> For ſo he
ſays St. <hi>Peter</hi> order'd him to call it.</p>
               <p>Now not to inſiſt on the matter of this Epiſtle, there are
two Conſiderations beſides, which I conceive very clearly
demonſtrate it to be a Forgery.<note place="margin">A Forgery.</note>
               </p>
               <p>1. That this very Book call'd the <hi>Itinerary</hi> (amongſt other
Writings aſcribed to <hi>Clement</hi>) was by Pope <hi>Gelaſius, Anno</hi> 494.
Condemn'd as aforeſaid, Therefore he did not believe this
Epiſtle to be written by <hi>Clement;</hi> for if he had, he would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
have received the <hi>Itinerary</hi> with Reverence, ſince
he could not imagine ſo Holy a Man would have given ſo
large a teſtimony thereto, nor taken ſuch pains to have ſent
it to St. <hi>James,</hi> if it had not been true and authentick; when
therefore Pope <hi>Gelafius</hi> expreſly condemn'd the Book, he <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
condemn'd the Epiſtle,</hi> that pretends to recommend it;
for if the <hi>former</hi> be Apocryphal, the <hi>latter</hi> muſt needs be
Counterfeit.</p>
               <p>2. By the Teſtimony of St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> and current ſtream
of Antiquity, St. <hi>James</hi> to whom St. <hi>Peter</hi> takes ſuch care to
have his <hi>Memoirs</hi> communicated, was Martyr'd in the 7th
year of <hi>Nero,</hi> whereas they ſay <hi>Peter</hi> ſuffer'd not till the 14.
year of of that Tyrant; ſo that <hi>Clement</hi> muſt write to a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98580:34"/>
that was dead 7 years before. Nay more, this being rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd
a <hi>Decretal Epiſtle,</hi> and the greater part of their Authors
not placing <hi>Clement</hi> actually in the Chair till after <hi>Linus</hi> and
<hi>Cletus</hi> (of whom they ſay one ſat above 11 years,<note place="margin">Vide <hi>Platin.</hi>
                  </note> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
above 12) this muſt be wrote above 30 years after St.
<hi>James</hi>'s death; for tho <hi>Clement</hi> might at any time write <hi>an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle,</hi>
yet he could not write a <hi>Decretal Epiſtle</hi> till he was <hi>Pope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another of theſe Epiſtles notably relating to our preſent
buſineſs, is in the name of <hi>Cornelius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in the
year 254. which is publiſht amongſt the reſt of the Decretal
Epiſtles in theſe words:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cornelius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to his dear and moſt beloved
Brethren,<note place="margin">A Decretal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle about Removing St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Boues.</note> the Sons of the Holy Church of God, and to all
them that ſerve our Lord in the right Faith.</p>
                  <p>Conſidering the Benevolence of your Charity, becauſe
ye are Lovers of the Apoſtles, and hold their Faith and
Doctrine, I determined to write unto you, (<hi>THE LORD
BEING THE A<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>THOR</hi>) ſome of thoſe things, which are
at this time <hi>NECESSARY TO BE KNOWN,</hi> and which
the Lord aſſiſting by the <hi>MERITS</hi> of the Apoſtles were
lately done amongſt us in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or, are
now in doing, becauſe Charity patronizing, I believe, with
Fatherly Grace, ye willingly receive the <hi>WRITINGS OF
THE APOSTOLICAL SEE,</hi> and perform <hi>THE COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MANDMENTS
OF THE SAME,</hi> and <hi>REJOICE IN THE
ENCREASES</hi> thereof: Becauſe whoſoever engrafts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in the Root of Charity, neither fails of Greatneſs, nor
becomes void of Fruit, neither does he by Love loſe the
efficacious work of fruitfulneſs; for Charity it ſelf does
exerciſe the hearts of the Faithful, corroborates their ſences
that nothing ſeemeth grievous, nothing difficult, but all is
eaſy, which is done while its property is to nouriſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
to keep the Commandments, to join things diſſevered,
to correct evil things, and to conſolidate all other virtues
by the Bulwark of its perfection.</p>

                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:98580:35"/>
Wherefore I beſeech you to <hi>Rejoyce</hi> with us, becauſe by
the entreaty of a certain devout Woman and moſt <hi>Noble
Matron Lucina,</hi> the Bodies of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were lifted out

               <p>This Epiſtle is a <hi>Quiver</hi> whence the Modern Church of

               <p>But that the ſame is wholly a <hi>Forgery,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proved to be a <hi>Forgery.</hi>
                  </note> beſides what
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98580:35"/>
we have objected againſt all theſe Epiſtles in general,
and waving too the <hi>odd matter</hi> and conceited Phraſe
of this in particular, we need but Animadvert, That 'tis ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to be written by <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who they ſay was Biſhop of
<hi>Rome, Anno Chr.</hi> 254. Which happens to be a time when
that cruel Tyrant, <hi>Decius,</hi> was Emperor, and in the very midſt
of the 7th Perſecution, one of the fierceſt that ever Harraſs'd
the Church from Heathen hands: Now during that <hi>Horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſtorm,</hi> when no Chriſtian could appear at <hi>Rome</hi> without
certain danger of his Life, Who can imagine this Biſhop ſo
much at leiſure as to write Letters to all the World, requiring
them to rejoyce for the removal of <hi>a parcel of Bones,</hi> as one
of the moſt important Adventures, or ſingular Bleſſings of
that Age? What probability is there why Madam <hi>Lucina,</hi>
in that diſmal time, ſhould attempt to diſquiet the Apoſtles
duſt, and bring both her ſelf and all other Chriſtians then at
<hi>Rome</hi> into jeopardy on ſo frivolous an occaſion? Or how was
it poſſible that the Bodies of the Apoſtles, ſuppoſing they
could be found after nigh 200 years private Burial, ſhould
however be then removed and interr'd ſo gloriouſly? How
the Chriſtian Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> even in the height of <hi>Pagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
and Idolatry, came to be buried in the <hi>Temple of Apollo?</hi>
or how <hi>Peter</hi> could be laid in ſo many places at once, <hi>viz.</hi>
amongſt the <hi>Biſhops of Rome,</hi> in the <hi>Temple of Apollo,</hi> in the
<hi>Golden Mountain,</hi> and in the <hi>Vatican</hi> of <hi>Nero</hi>'s Palace?</p>
               <p>But further, ro convince you of the Fraud, <hi>Binius,</hi> tho he
ſet down this Epiſtle very formally as a good Record, as his
Predeceſſors in that kind had done before him, yet tells us,
That <hi>this story of the Tranſlation of the Apoſtles. Bones, which
it attributes to</hi> Cornelius, <hi>ſeems to be an Error crept in from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the reſt of the Miſtakes of the Pontifical attributed to
Pope</hi> Damaſus (who lived above 100 years after this <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius)
For more truely</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this Tranſlation happen'd in the
firſt Age a little after their Paſſion; for</hi> which he cites St.
<hi>Gregory</hi> the Pope, who lived long after both the other <hi>Two.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:98580:36"/>
So that it ſeems amongſt them 'tis no ſtrange matter for
a <hi>Prior</hi> Author to ſuck in Errors from a <hi>latter,</hi> and yet for
a <hi>modern</hi> Authors Teſtimony to overthrow that of others
<hi>more Ancient,</hi> and therefore more Authentick, one would
think (in a matter of Fact relating to their own times, or
much nearer them) than himſelf.</p>
               <p>But this mention of the Pontifical, brings into my mind
2 or 3 other pretended Ancient Authors whom I had almoſt
forgot, that are ſometimes alledged to prove St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>I have the longer inſiſted on theſe counterfeit Ancients,
becauſe the Romaniſts frequently do flouriſh with their
Names to amuſe the ignorant, not only in this matter, but
ſeveral other important Controverſies; but I hope by theſe
few Remarks, our People will learn what value is due to
ſuch Authors; for though by dint of Reaſon and Authority
our Opponents are now and then forced to brand theſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
yet they ſhall for all that, continue to vouch them
(of which, you had but now <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Confeſſion, and
the ſame might be made out by a multitude of Inſtances)
which as it is the higheſt <hi>diſingenuity,</hi> ſo it argues ſome <hi>great</hi>
but very <hi>bad.</hi> Deſign. And as it is an undoubted mark of
an ill Cauſe, wherein there is found <hi>Subornation, Perjury</hi> or
<hi>Forgery;</hi> ſo to me it is a ſhrewd ſign, that the <hi>whole Story</hi>
of <hi>Peter</hi>'s being at <hi>Rome, is falſe,</hi> ſince there have been ſuch
<hi>ill means</hi> contriv'd, or at leaſt made uſe of to ſupport and

               <p>I ſhall conclude this Chapter with a very remarkable Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
from Cardinal <hi>Baronius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Baronius</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs of any certainty of the Apoſtles Actions not mentioned in Scripture.</note> one as well skill'd

by them [the Apoſtles] after they were once ſeparated
one from another, 'tis very obſcure; for ſince there are
both Actions and Writings in the name of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
found to be ſuppoſititious; and if any thing were
told of them by true and ſincere Writers, the ſame
does not all remain intire and uncorrupted, it will plainly
make one <hi>deſpair</hi> of ever obtaining any truth and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty

were ſo confuſed, ſuppoſititious and corrupted, we ought
ſure at leaſt to <hi>ſuſpend</hi> our opinions touching <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>being

               <argument>
                  <p>The improbability of Peter's being Biſhop of Rome, argned
from the Incoherences of their Teſtimonies who write
thereof.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WE have gone through the proofs offered for the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative,
<hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome</hi> and Biſhop
there; we now proceed to ſome Conſiderations, which if
they do not evince the contrary to every impartial mans full
ſatisfaction, muſt yet at leaſt be acknowledged of <hi>ſuch weight</hi>
as may juſtly render the <hi>Negative</hi> probable to the higheſt
Degree. All which I ſhall reduce to two Heads. 1. The
<hi>Incoherences</hi> of the Story. 2. Its <hi>unlikelihood</hi> from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
given of <hi>Peter</hi> in Sacred Scripture.</p>
               <p>1. Then, the Reader muſt be reminded, that the buſineſs
of <hi>Peter</hi>'s being at <hi>Rome,</hi> or Biſhop there, depends wholly on
<hi>Humane Teſtimony;</hi> for there is but one only Text, <hi>viz.</hi> That
of, <hi>the Church of</hi> Babylon <hi>ſaluteth you,</hi> produced in favour
of the Story; and how impertinently, and not without groſs
wreſting, we have ſhewn. Now there is nothing that more
invalidates Humane Evidence than <hi>Diſagreement;</hi> for as
Truth is always <hi>uniform,</hi> ſo falſhood being various is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentyl
attended with <hi>Repugnancies</hi> and Contradictions. In

not dye in the fourteenth Year of <hi>Nero;</hi> but almoſt
all Writers of the ſtory atteſt that he dyed in the <hi>14th</hi>

               <p>Well, but if one out-liv'd the other at leaſt a year, ſince
<hi>Paul</hi> ſeems likeſt to be the ſurvivor, becauſe, as St. <hi>Peter</hi>

Prince of the Apoſtles, Soveraign Head of the Chriſtians,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98580:38"/>
and Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> he was on that account likeſt to incur
the fury of <hi>Nero.</hi> If, I ſay, <hi>Paul</hi> did (as he might for what
appears to the contrary) outlive <hi>Peter,</hi> why might not he
have been as fit to ſucceed as another? Would it it not be
very hard, that <hi>Paul</hi> who avow'd himſelf not inferior <hi>to the
chiefeſt of the Apoſtles,</hi> ſhould in his old Age be made
Subject to a <hi>Linus,</hi> a <hi>Cletus,</hi> or a <hi>Clement?</hi> Or ſuppoſe
he was put to Death before or with <hi>Peter,</hi> yet if <hi>Peter</hi>
did as they ſay conſtitute a Supream Paſtor over the
Univerſal Church to ſucceed him, why ſhould he not have
committed that Charge to ſome other of the Apoſtles?
eſpecially ſince all Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorians ſeem agreed,
That St. <hi>John</hi> (who is honoured with the Title of <hi>the
Beloved Diſciple</hi>) did ſurvive for many years after, and
conſequently muſt become inferiour to ſome one that was
no Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>But not only <hi>Prudentius</hi> tells us, That <hi>Paul</hi> ſuffered
a Day after <hi>Peter,</hi> but <hi>Abdias</hi> (one of our Adverſaries

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Linus</hi> a <hi>Tuſcan</hi> (ſaith <hi>Platina</hi>) for eleven Years,

But the difference is not only in point of <hi>time</hi> of their

ſays was for the moſt part abſent from <hi>Rome</hi>) ſave only
twenty ſix Days, which he ſurvived after <hi>Peter,</hi> and then
was Martyr'd; during which 26 Days he was not <hi>chief</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
neither, but only a <hi>Coadjutor</hi> to <hi>Clement</hi> as he had been
to <hi>Peter.</hi> For (ſaith he) <hi>Clement</hi> was the immediate <hi>Succeſſor

<hi>Cletus,</hi> and he ſate ſix Years, five Months, and three Days as

for if <hi>Peter</hi> had juſt cauſe to Elect <hi>Clement,</hi> then

If <hi>Peter</hi> were appointed by our Lord to Govern all the

would he take upon himſelf the Biſhoprick of <hi>Rome,</hi> from
whence he was ſo often to be <hi>abſent,</hi> and thereby give a
dangerous Precedent of <hi>NON-RESIDENCY,</hi> and truſting
to the Care of Delegates in the Government of the

as either <hi>Linus</hi> or <hi>Cletus?</hi> Again, If <hi>Peter</hi> thought

than <hi>Clement</hi> did his in urging <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Antecedent

another Succeſſor? Or why in his Letter to St. <hi>James</hi> does
he not take notice <hi>how,</hi> and on what ſcore he had declined
that Office, which <hi>Peter</hi> ſo formally conferr'd upon him?
Or in a word, If <hi>Peter</hi> did ſo ſolemnly inveſt <hi>Clement</hi> with

at that City on the Eighteenth of <hi>January:</hi>
From whence to the time of his death was about
Twenty-five years. But four years after, <hi>viz.</hi> the

               <p>This Account <hi>Onuphrius</hi> ſays he has gathered out

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98580:41"/>
full five years after our Lords Aſcenſion in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea,</hi>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall not undertake here to Umpire the Caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
theſe two Eminent Authors; But in another
Chapter may poſſibly make it appear, That not only
<hi>one,</hi> but <hi>both</hi> of them may be miſtaken; In the mean
time by this brief ſtate of the Caſe, you cannot but
ſee, that there is no one particular of the ſtory <hi>clear</hi> or
<hi>certain,</hi> but that the Witneſſes every where thwart and
trip up each others Heels, and how hard their moſt
Learned Advocates are forc'd to labour colourably to
Reconcile them, yet can by no means agree in their
Inventions for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>From whence it will not be difficult to collect what
Judgment we are to make of the whole Story: For
'tis no Excuſe to ſay that their Diſagreements are
but <hi>ſmall,</hi> and only in Circumſtances; for where there
is every where ſuch a punctual Exactneſs pretended,
as not only to years, but months and days, and yet
all different from, and inconſiſtent with each other,
'tis methinks a great Argument that the Original Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
were all forged; or at leaſt, that the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Authors took up their Stories on Truſt, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
knew nothing of the matter.</p>
               <q>But to all this, Bellarmine ſays,</q>
               <p>1. That difference touching the Time of any thing
done,<note place="margin">Object. 1.</note> does not weaken the Truth of the thing it
ſelf; There are various Opinions how long it is
ſince the Creation of the World, and touching the
time of Chriſts Crucifixion; Shall we therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that the World was not created, or our Saviour
not Crucified?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:98580:42"/>
I Reply,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> That where a thing it ſelf is certain, it is
not by a difference of that kind rendred uncertain;
but where a thing it ſelf is doubtful, depending only
on ſuſpected Evidence, the ſame by Contradictory
Circumſtances is render'd much more uncertain and
improbable. That the World was Created, That
our Saviour Suffer'd, we have Infallible Witneſſes,
who in nothing material diſagree, but confirm each
others Teſtimony: Whereas here is no ſound Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of <hi>Peter</hi>'s being at <hi>Rome,</hi> or Biſhop there; And
they that undertake to tell the Fact, do with equal
Aſſurance and pretended Punctualneſs relate Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances;
and if they are Deceivers, or deceived in one,
they may as well in the other.</p>
               <p>2.<note place="margin">Object. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>As to the various Accounts given about Peter</hi>'s
<hi>Succeſſor, the Learned Cardinal ſays,</hi> That tho'
we ſhould be ignorant who it was that ſucceeded him,
yet we ought not for that cauſe to doubt but ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
did ſucceed.</p>
               <p>But this Anſwer comes not home to the purpoſe;<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note>
For the Queſtion is not ſo much who did Succeed, as
whether <hi>Peter</hi> did at all Precede in the particular Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick
of <hi>Rome:</hi> Now becauſe the ſame Witneſſes
that tell us of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Preceding, do alſo teſtifie of his
Succeſſors, if one part of their Teſtimony be infirm,
the whole is weakened.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, As the Antients thwart and interfere with
<hi>each other</hi> in this Story of <hi>Peter</hi>'s being at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
one of the moſt induſtrious Modern Advocates for
it, contradicts himſelf, for he ſays<note n="*" place="margin">Baron. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. Tom. 1. ad Ann. 69. S. 9.</note>, <hi>Peter</hi> died <hi>A. C.</hi> 69.

was Biſhop there 7 years, and after that 25 years Biſhop
of <hi>Rome,</hi> which muſt be till the year 71. So that <hi>Peter</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Account given of Peter in Scripture, compared with
the Roman Hiſtory; Whereby the Common Relation of
Peter's being at Rome, or Biſhop firſt of Antioch, and
afterwards of Rome, appears to be highly Improbable,
or rather altogether Falſe.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THat St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s being Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> cannot be
proved by Scripture, we have ſhewn before;
To which we may add, that the ſame is further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd
by Learned Romaniſts; <hi>By the Scripture it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be evinc'd either that he was Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>or ever

                  <note n="()" place="margin">Defens. Pac. part. 2. C. 16.</note> And
then conſidering the Ecleſiaſtical Hiſtories that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm

he believ'd them not. <hi>Occham,</hi> that Eminent School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who flouriſht about the Year 1328. affirms,<note n="()" place="margin">Occh. Dial. par. 1. L. 2. Ca 3.</note>
                  <hi>Theſe are in the number of things that neither are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in Scripture, nor can be manifestly proved by it
alone,</hi> viz. <hi>That</hi> Peter <hi>was Biſhop of</hi> Rome; <hi>That he
remov'd his See from</hi> Antioch <hi>to</hi> Rome; <hi>That the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
of</hi> Rome <hi>ſucceed</hi> Peter; <hi>That the Church of</hi> Rome
<hi>hath the Primacy, whereof there is no mention in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
As likewiſe there is not, that he</hi> [Peter] <hi>govern'd
the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>nor any thing touching the Papacy
thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Conſideration alone, methinks, ſhould be
enough to perſwade any man from Entertaining the
ſame, or any of the Inferences that meerly depend
thereon, as matters of Faith; Eſpecially if we further
remarque, that the Scripture is not only ſilent as to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98580:43"/>
                  <hi>Peter</hi>'s being at <hi>Rome,</hi> and Biſhop there, but yeilds

Which it ſhall be the ſubject of this Chapter

               <p>But becauſe the ſame will not ſo clearly appear as

Tranſactions mentioned in the firſt Eight Chapters

               <p>Now the moſt common Story of our Modern Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts
is, That St. <hi>Peter</hi> went to <hi>Rome</hi> in the ſecond
year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and 10th after the Paſſion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
Biſhop of that See 25 years, ſuffer'd Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in the 14th year of <hi>Nero.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It remains therefore that we weigh ſuch their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions:
And as we have found them too light and
void of Proof on their ſide; ſo by comparing them
with the Account given of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the <hi>Acts of the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98580:45"/>
Apostles</hi> and the <hi>Epistle to the Galatians,</hi> and other
paſſages of infallible Writ, it will perhaps ſatisfactori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear, not only that <hi>Peter</hi> was not at <hi>Rome</hi> in the
ſaid ſecond Year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> Nor Biſhop there 25
Years: But that indeed he was not, nor could be there
at all either before or after.</p>
               <p>I think it is not pretended (nor if it were would
it ſerve their turn) that <hi>Peter</hi> was ever at <hi>Rome</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Christs</hi> Crucifixion, but ſpent his time in or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Judea,</hi> either in his Vocation of a Fiſherman, or
with the reſt of the Diſciples attending the Lord;
Nor are we to look for him at <hi>Rome</hi> after the death of
<hi>Nero,</hi> for they all affirm he was put to death under
that Tyrant, ſo that we have only Thirty Six Years
to account for, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Paſſion to the End of
<hi>Nero,</hi> that is to ſay, from the year of Our Lord 34.
to the Year 70.</p>

Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> beholding our Saviours Aſcenſion, and
then return'd to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> expecting the Promiſed
Comforter; and when the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> deſcended upon
them, made that excellent Sermon, whereby Three
Thouſand Souls were Converted, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. Healed the
Lame man, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. Whereupon he was Impriſoned,
<hi>Act</hi> 4. He dreadfully Puniſhes the Hypocriſie and
Lies of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> and wrought many
other Miracles till he was again Impriſoned, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
by an Angel, &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 5. He was alſo at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>
at the choice of <hi>Deacons, Acts</hi> 6. And if his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
when ſent with <hi>John</hi> by the reſt of the Apoſtles
to <hi>Samaria, Acts</hi> 8. be to be attributed to theſe Two
Years, it is expreſly ſaid, V 25. that he return'd to

For <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. 30. he tells us of <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<hi>That Herod having in vain ſought for him, went down to

Miniſtry,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Peter</hi> therefore was at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the
year, and about the time that King <hi>Herod</hi> died.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Herod</hi> died in the fourth year of the Reign of
<hi>Claudius,</hi> and 12th after the Paſſion; which I thus
prove:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Joſephus</hi>
                  <note n="()" place="margin">Joſeph. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq. L. 18. Ca. 8.</note> teſtifies that this <hi>Herod</hi> (whom
he calls <hi>Agrippa</hi>) obtain'd not leave to go to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Jewry</hi> till the ſecond year of <hi>Caligula:</hi> And the
ſame Author<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 19. Ca. 7.</note> ſaith, that the ſaid <hi>Herod</hi> died in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
year of his Reign. Therefore ſince <hi>Caligula</hi>
Reigned in all not full four years, it follows that <hi>Herod</hi>
could not dye before the fourth year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> who
was <hi>Caligula</hi>'s Succeſſor.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This is further confirm'd by that Paſſage,
<hi>That the Tyrians and Sidonians</hi> (againſt whom this
<hi>Herod</hi> had conceiv'd a diſpleaſure, and to chaſtize
whom he went down to <hi>Caeſaria</hi> preſently after <hi>Peter</hi>'s
deliverance) <hi>made Friends to obtain Peace of him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi>
(ſays the Text, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 20.) <hi>their Countrey was nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd
by the Kings;</hi> ſignifying that during the <hi>Famine</hi>
then raging, they had Proviſions from thence: Which
Dearth or Famine was that which <hi>Agabus</hi> the Prophet
had ſome time before propheſied of at <hi>Antioch,</hi> of
which 'tis generally ſaid, <hi>Acts 11. 28. That it came to
paſs in the days of Claudius;</hi> but as other Authors, (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſpergenſis</hi>) have noted, it was in the fourth
year of <hi>Claudius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus I conceive it very plain and certain, that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
was conſtantly in and about <hi>Judea</hi> till the fourth
year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> (that is, the 12th of the Paſſion, and
45th of our Lords Nativity) which not only leaves
no room for his ſeven years Epiſcopacy at <hi>Antioch,</hi>
which is ſuppoſed to have been before this time, but
alſo utterly overthrows the Conceit of his Arriving at
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98580:47"/>
                  <hi>Rome</hi> in the ſecond year of <hi>Claudius;</hi> and ſo, perfectly
annuls the credit of their principal Evidence, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes
the ſtory at the very Foundation; ſo that we
might well enough ſpare our pains in ſearching any
further. But we will not ſtand with them for a few
years miſtake, but examine quite thorough, and give
them <hi>full meaſure, heaped up, preſsed down and running
over.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at the death of the
Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Peter</hi> not at <hi>Rome</hi> between the 12th and 16th years of the Paſſion.</note> the Fifth year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> that is the
13th after his Paſſion, is atteſted by <hi>Nicephorus</hi> (L. 2.
<hi>Ca.</hi> 21.) but be that as it will, 'tis certain he was there
<hi>in the 16th year of the Paſſion,</hi> at the Aſſembly of the
Apoſtles and Brethren mentioned <hi>Acts</hi> 15. and made
a Speech there, as appears <hi>V.</hi> 7. of that Chapter.
Now to prove that this Synod was held at this time,
viz. the 16th year of the Paſſion, Read <hi>Galatians</hi> 2. 1.
<hi>Then Fourteen years after I went up again to</hi> Jeruſalem
<hi>with</hi> Barnabas, <hi>and took with me</hi> Titus <hi>alſo,</hi> &amp;c. By
which and the ſubſequent Context, it ſeems evident to
me, that <hi>Paul</hi> thereby meaneth his coming to this
Councel, and not any other time of his repairing to
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſo doth St. <hi>Hierom</hi> underſtand it,
which being 14 years after St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Converſion, fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out to be in the year of our Lord 49. and the Eighth
of <hi>Claudius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I forget not that St. <hi>Hierom</hi> and divers others that
follow him, date theſe 14 years not from <hi>Pauls</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
but from his firſt Journey to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> three
years after, and ſo place this Synod <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 51.
or rather as they ſhould ſay 52. in the 10th or 11th of
<hi>Claudius,</hi> which thought it ſeems to favour our Cauſe,
as proving <hi>Peter</hi> to continue ſo much the longer at
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> or the neighbouring parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> yet ſince
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98580:48"/>
my Aim in theſe Reſearches is ſolely the diſcovery of
Truth, I cannot admit thereof: Becauſe in the Ninth
year of <hi>Claudius</hi> it was as <hi>Oroſius</hi>
                  <note n="()" place="margin">Oros. L. 7. C. 6.</note> witneſseth, That
the <hi>Jews</hi> were all baniſht <hi>Rome;</hi> And at that time
<hi>Paul</hi> was at <hi>Athens,</hi> as <hi>

                  <note n="()" place="margin">In Claud. 7. Ca. 24.</note> writeth; and it
appeareth likewiſe by the Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts;</hi> for
<hi>Paul</hi> departing from the Councel after a tedious
Journey to <hi>Antioch, Syria,</hi> through <hi>Cilicia</hi> and many
other Regions, came to <hi>Athens</hi> and thence to <hi>Corinth,</hi>
where he met with <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> who (ſayth
the Text) were <hi>lately</hi> (juſt then, ſome Verſions ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it) <hi>Come from</hi> Italy, <hi>becauſe</hi> Claudius <hi>had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that all Jews ſhould depart from Rome;</hi> Which
ſhews that this Council muſt be held ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
time before this Decree of <hi>Claudius,</hi> that is, before
the 9th of his Reign.</p>
               <p>If it be inquired where <hi>Peter</hi> was from the time of
his delivery out of Priſon in the fourth year of <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi>
until this Synod in the Eighth year of his Reign?
I anſwer, That as the Geſts or Actions of St. <hi>Paul</hi>
(after <hi>Herods</hi> death) amongſt the Gentiles are deſcribed,
in the 13th and 14th Chapters of the <hi>Acts,</hi> ſo during that
time, it ſeems clearly intimated, that <hi>Peter</hi> was La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> either <hi>at Jeruſalem,</hi> or thoſe
diſperſed in the neighbouring Territories of <hi>Aſia,</hi> to
whom he afterwards directed his Epiſtle; for ſo ſaith
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of his entertainment amongſt the
Apoſtles at this Council or coming up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
14 years after his Converſion, <hi>Gal 2. 7. When they ſaw
That the Goſpel over the uncircumciſion was committed
unto me, as the Goſpel over the Circumciſion was to</hi>
Peter, <hi>for he that was mighty by</hi> Peter <hi>in the Apoſtleſhip
of the Circumciſion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And in this interval I humbly conceive it was
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98580:48"/>
(tho not ſpecified in the <hi>Acts</hi>) that <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> reproved him to the Face, mentioned
<hi>Gal.</hi> 2 ſince it could not well be at any time before,
as appears by the precedent diſcourſe; but that it was
before the ſaid Council of the Apoſtles at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
ſeems very probable, becauſe if it had been after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<hi>viz.</hi> when the matter had been ſo ſolemnly
determined that Circumciſion was not neceſſary, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
could not have had any ſcruple of eating with the
Gentile Believers, nor fear of offending them in that
point, that came from <hi>James.</hi> Thus until the 16th
year of the Paſſion, Eighth of <hi>Claudius, Peter</hi> came
not within One Thouſand Miles of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>Ninth of Claudius</hi> all Jews were Baniſht <hi>Rome</hi>
(as is proved before) therefore then <hi>Peter</hi> could not
be there.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Peter</hi> not at <hi>Rome</hi> before the 12th of <hi>Claudius.</hi>
                  </note> Nor was, nor had he been there in the 12th
of <hi>Claudius,</hi> for then <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his Epiſtle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
and undoubtedly if <hi>Peter</hi> had been the Founder
or Biſhop of that Church then, or at any time before,
<hi>Paul</hi> would in ſo large a letter have taken ſome occaſion
to recommend his Pains, and to exhort them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in the Doctrine of the Prince of the Apoſtles;
but on the contrary, tho he concludes with particular
Salutes to 24 Perſons by name (beſides ſeveral Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds)
and divers of them <hi>Women,</hi> yet he does not ſo
much as mention <hi>Peter:</hi> Now if <hi>Peter</hi> had been
Biſhop there, and ſoveraign Head of the Apoſtles,
that omiſſion of paying his reſpects to him, whilſt
he did it to ſo many others of inferiour condition,
would have been not only a <hi>Soloeciſm</hi> in Civility, but a
failure in Duty.</p>
               <p>But how does it appear that this Epiſtle was wrote
at this time?—Thus, <hi>Ch. 15. 28. Paul</hi> uſes this
diſcourſe—<hi>Having now no more place in theſe parts,</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:98580:49"/>
(that is, about <hi>Antioch,</hi> whence this Epiſtle is dated)
<hi>and having a great deſire theſe many years to come unto
you, whenſoever I take my Journey into Spain, I will
come to you; but now I go into</hi> Jeruſalem, &amp;c. ſo that
'tis evident this was wrote upon his Journey ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
going to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> we muſt therefore conſider
at what time eſpecially this was, for we read of <hi>Paul</hi>'s
going thither five ſeveral times, the firſt in the Ninth,
the ſecond in the Twelfth, the third in the 15th, the
fourth in the 18th, and the fifth in the 21th Chapter
of the <hi>Acts;</hi> But it could be in none of the firſt three
Journeys, for he had not then met with <hi>Timothy,</hi>
whom he found not till a good while after his return
from the Synod at <hi>Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> 16. 1. but at the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of this Epiſtle, <hi>Timothy</hi> was with him, for he ſends
Salutations from him, <hi>Ch.</hi> 16. 21. Nor ſeems it to be
the fourth time, mentioned <hi>Acts</hi> 18th, for <hi>V.</hi> 1. ere
<hi>Paul</hi> return'd to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it is ſaid that he departed
from <hi>Corinth,</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla and Aquila</hi> were then at
<hi>Rome,</hi> for thither he ſends ſalutations to them. It
remains therefore that this Epiſtle was written juſt
before <hi>Pauls</hi> laſt comming up to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> which
agrees with what is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 20. compared with
the before-cited Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 23. And ſuch his laſt
Journey thither was in the 12th of <hi>Claudius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For being there taken, <hi>Faelix</hi> was then Governour

made Preſident of <hi>Judea,</hi> till the 11th of <hi>Claudius;</hi> And
by <hi>Tertullus</hi>'s Oration to him, accuſing <hi>Paul,</hi> we may
gather that he had then for ſome time, a year at leaſt,
been in that command; ſo that it muſt be about the
12th of <hi>Claudius:</hi> Which further appears, for that it is
ſaid, <hi>Paul</hi> had been two years a Priſoner when <hi>Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Feſtus</hi> came to be Governour inſtead of <hi>Faelix,</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:98580:49"/>
who was ſent thither by <hi>Nero,</hi> as ſoon as he came
to the Empire; wherefore ſince <hi>Claudius</hi> died in his
14th year, and <hi>Feſtus</hi> came preſently after, and <hi>Paul</hi> had
been then two years a Priſoner, it follows that ſuch his
laſt coming to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the writing of this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
muſt be in or about the 12th year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> the
20th of the Paſſion, and of our Lords Birth 53. And
conſequently at that time for the Reaſons aforeſaid, we
may juſtly believe <hi>Peter</hi> was not at, nor Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
Nay St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> upon the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſaith,
that he had read in certain Antient Books that at the
ſending of this Epiſtle, <hi>Narciſſus</hi> (to whoſe family ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation

                     <hi>Peter</hi> had not been at <hi>Rome</hi> the 24th Year after the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> neither was nor had been Biſhop of
<hi>Rome</hi> in the ſecond year of <hi>Nero</hi> (the 24th of the
Paſſion and 57th of the Incarnation) for then <hi>Paul</hi>
came thither, as is teſtified by <hi>Euſebius, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſpergenſis,</hi>
and others; at whoſe arrival, St. <hi>Luke</hi> who was then
with him, ſaith, <hi>Acts 28. 15. The Brethren hearing of us,
came forth to meet us,</hi> &amp;c. But we hear not a word of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
either coming or ſending to <hi>Paul,</hi> which undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,
if he had been Biſhop there, he would have done;
nor would St. <hi>Luke</hi> have neglected to record it. But
the third day after, <hi>Paul</hi> ſending for the chief of the
Jews, and reaſoning with them about the Faith, they
anſwer'd him thus,—<hi>We will hear what thou doſt
think, for touching this Sect</hi> [the Chriſtians] <hi>it is every
where ſpoken against;</hi> and when at a day appointed,
<hi>Paul</hi> had preached unto them, <hi>the Jews fell at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
about it, for ſome Believed, and ſome Believed not;</hi>
All which ſhews that the Jews at <hi>Rome</hi> had heard
very little of <hi>Christ</hi> before <hi>Pauls</hi> arrival, which could
not have been, if <hi>Peter</hi> (the peculiar Apoſtle of the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98580:50"/>
Circumciſion) had then, or for a matter of fourteen
years ever ſince the ſecond of <hi>Claudius,</hi> or indeed for any
time before, been at <hi>Rome</hi> and Biſhop there.</p>
               <p>In the Third and Fourth years of <hi>Nero (two whole
years,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Peter</hi> not at <hi>Rome</hi> in the third or fourth year of <hi>Nero.</hi>
                  </note> ſays the Text, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 30.) <hi>Paul</hi> continued a
Priſoner at large at <hi>Rome</hi> after his coming thither:
Now that <hi>Peter</hi> was not in any of that ſpace there, we
rationally conclude, not only becauſe <hi>Nicephorus, L</hi> 2.
<hi>Ca.</hi> 3. ſaith, That during all that time St. <hi>Paul</hi> lived
by the labour of his Hands; whereas if <hi>Peter</hi> had been
there in his Pontifical Dignity, he would certainly have
cauſed him to be better provided for; but eſpecially
for that in the ſeveral Epiſtles written by <hi>Paul</hi> from
thence in that time partly, and partly perhaps ſome
time after, (for how much longer he continued at <hi>Rome</hi>
than after the ſaid two years elaps'd, we have no certain
account) he no where makes mention of <hi>Peter;</hi>
which if <hi>Peter</hi> had been look'd upon as Soveraign of
the Church, and his being Biſhop of ſuch a Place, a
matter of ſo great Importance, could never have been;
eſpecially ſince <hi>Paul</hi> had often very juſt occaſion to
have taken notice thereof; As in that to the <hi>Galatians,</hi>
where <hi>Paul</hi> being inforc'd to aſſert the Authority of
his Doctrine and Apoſtleſhip, which ſome ſought
to impair, ſpeaks much of the former acquaintance
between him and <hi>Peter,</hi> but not a word of ſeeing him
at this time; when <hi>Peter</hi>'s Teſtimony, by ſubſcription
or otherwiſe, would readily have ſatisfied thoſe Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers;
or <hi>Paul</hi> inſtead of all the Arguments he makes
uſe of, might have ſaid no more then this, Here is
<hi>Peter</hi> the Prince of the Apoſtles, Biſhop of this City,
(which he has choſen to be the fountain of Ecleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Juriſdiction and infallible Judge of Controverſies
to the Worlds end) who does at this inſtant own
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98580:50"/>
and allow my Apoſtleſhip, and give me the right hand
of Fellowſhip.</p>
               <p>Nay, <hi>Paul</hi> in theſe Epiſtles does not only omit to
mention <hi>Peter,</hi> but uſes Words that in effect deny his
being then at <hi>Rome;</hi> As in that to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> (which
muſt be Written about this time, becauſe therein
mention is made of <hi>Demas,</hi> as being then with <hi>Paul,</hi>
who afterwards forſook him, as appears in the ſecond
of <hi>Timothy</hi>) having told them that <hi>Ariſtarchus</hi> his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Priſoner, and <hi>Marcus,</hi> Siſters Son to <hi>Barnabas,</hi>
and <hi>Jeſus</hi> called <hi>Juſtus</hi> (who are of the Circumciſion)
ſaluted them, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 4. 10. &amp; 11. He adds, <hi>Theſe only
are my fellow-Helpers</hi> (which I underſtand, of thoſe
of the Circumciſion, to whom he had juſt before
reſtrain'd his ſpeech, for preſently he mentions <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phras,
Luke</hi> and <hi>Demas,</hi> who poſſibly might be <hi>Greeks)
unto the Kingdom of God, who have been a Comfort unto
me.</hi> To <hi>Philemon</hi> he ſends Salutations from the ſame
Perſons, and calls them again his fellow-Labourers.
Now was <hi>Peter</hi> (ſuppoſing too that he long before,
and at that time, was Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>) Inferior to
theſe? Was he not worthy to be Named? Were
the Salutations, the Benedictions of the Apoſtles not
to be expected? <hi>At my firſt Defence</hi> (I take it to be
before <hi>Nero</hi> at this time we are Treating of) ſaith the
ſame Apoſtle, <hi>No man ſtood with me, but all men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook
me,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 16. Can we imagine with any
kind of ſobriety that <hi>Peter</hi> was then at <hi>Rome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether St. <hi>Paul</hi> departed from <hi>Rome</hi> immediately
after the ſaid two years of his being a Priſoner at
large,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Peter</hi> not at <hi>Rome</hi> during the reſt of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>'s Reign.</note> is not ſpecified in Scripture; but 'tis reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to believe, that in that ſpace having ſo well Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Goſpel there, he might as ſoon as opportunity
would admit, Travel into other Parts to diſſeminate
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98580:51"/>
the ſame glad Tidings, and eſpecially in <hi>Spain,</hi> which
Countrey, it appears, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 24. he had long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
deſigned to Viſit; ſome Authors ſay that not
only he, but St. <hi>Peter</hi> too, was in our <hi>Britain,</hi> which
I take to be as true as that <hi>Peter</hi> was Biſhop of
<hi>Rome:</hi> But very plain it is, that <hi>Paul</hi> did again return
to <hi>Rome,</hi> and was there not long before his Death;
for in his ſecond Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> he Writes <hi>—I am
now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at
hand,</hi> &amp;c. Ch. 4. 6. Now as it appears both by the
Subſcription and Circumſtances, that this Epiſtle was
Dated from <hi>Rome,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> was brought (that is
in danger, or ready ſhortly after to be brought)
<hi>before Nero the ſecond time;</hi> ſo 'tis agreed that <hi>Paul</hi>
ſuffer'd near the End of <hi>Nero</hi>'s Reign; but at that
time <hi>Peter</hi> was not at <hi>Rome,</hi> for <hi>Paul</hi> very Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

<hi>only</hi> Luke <hi>is with me—Therefore do thy diligence to
corie ſhortly unto me, and bring</hi> Mark <hi>with thee, for he
is profitable unto me for the Ministry.</hi> If only <hi>Luke</hi>
were with him at <hi>Rome,</hi> then <hi>Peter</hi> was not there; nor
do we hear a ſyllable of his two pretended Suffragans,
<hi>Linus</hi> and <hi>Cletus:</hi> If <hi>Peter</hi> had been there at that time,
what need of ſuch earneſt ſending ſo far as <hi>Epheſus</hi>
for <hi>Timothy?</hi> Nor had <hi>Peter</hi> been at <hi>Rome</hi> in any of
the <hi>Intermediate Years</hi> after <hi>Pauls</hi> firſt Arrival, as may
be Collected from that Paſſage in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> where Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
how <hi>Nero</hi> endeavoured <hi>to caſt the Odium of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Rome</hi> (which happen'd near the end of his
Reign) <hi>upon the Christians;</hi> he takes notice that then
or about that time, that Sect had began <hi>to Revive
again,</hi> or encreaſe more than for ſome years before;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98580:51"/>
which may well be underſtood in this ſenſe, That the
Chriſtians, who during <hi>Pauls</hi> abſence, had ſomewhat
declined, did now at his return begin to Re-flouriſh
and Multiply: But if <hi>Peter</hi> in that Ten years ſpace,
or thereabouts of <hi>Pauls</hi> Abſence, had been at <hi>Rome</hi>
exerciſing his <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> there could have been no

                     <hi>Bellarmines</hi> Scheme of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels.</note>
Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi> is forc'd to uſe a great
deal of Pains and Art, and thus at laſt he performs it, at
Five or Six Motions, as follows.</p>
               <p>1. He ſays, That <hi>Peter</hi> after our Lords Paſſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
almoſt, but not full five years in <hi>Judea,</hi> in which
time <hi>Paul</hi> paid him his firſt viſit, Gal. 1.</p>
               <p>2. That then he removed to <hi>Antioch,</hi> and was Biſhop
there for near ſeven years, but during that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> time travelled
into and Preached through the Neighbouring Provinces.</p>
               <p>3. That in the ſeventh year of his Epiſcopacy at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi>
he return'd to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and was there Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned.</p>
               <p>4. That being there miraculouſly releaſed, he the ſame
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98580:52"/>
year (which was the ſecond of <hi>Claudius</hi>) came to <hi>Rome,</hi>
and there fixt his Seat, which he held 25 years, <hi>viz.</hi> till
his Martyrdom.</p>
               <p>5. Yet for all that, within ſeven years <hi>return'd</hi> back to
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> upon a <hi>Decree</hi> that <hi>Claudius</hi> ſet forth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
all Jews to depart from <hi>Rome,</hi> mentioned Acts
18. 2. and ſo came to be preſent at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi>
from <hi>Antioch</hi> went up thither, and the Council of the
Apoſtles, Acts 15. was held there.</p>
               <p>6. But after the death of <hi>Claudius</hi> repaired again to
<hi>Rome,</hi> where in the ſecond year of <hi>Nero, Paul</hi> arriv'd, and
in the 14th year of <hi>Nero</hi> they were both put to Death.</p>
               <p>To all which I Anſwer.</p>
               <p>1. As the old <hi>Aſtronomers</hi> were forc'd to invent va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<hi>Epicycles</hi> and feigned motions of the Planets to
ſolve the <hi>Phoenomina,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> without regard whether they
were <hi>true,</hi> or <hi>falſe,</hi> that is, had any real exiſtence in
Nature or not, provided they would but ſerve a turn
to ſupport their <hi>Hypotheſis;</hi> ſo I muſt crave leave to
ſay, The Learned Cardinal carries the bleſſed Apoſtle
St. <hi>Peter</hi> 15 or 1600 miles back and forwards, to and
fro at his own pleaſure, meerly to render their noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his being at <hi>Rome</hi> poſſible; But by what Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
on what proof does he do this? There is not the
leaſt intimation in Scripture but that <hi>Peter</hi> remain'd
in or near <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as much to the time of the <hi>Council,</hi>
as for the firſt five years; there is not a ſyllable of his
<hi>going</hi> unto, <hi>coming back</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>return thither</hi>
again; and if it were true, what reaſon can be imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
why St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſhould omit it in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the
Apoſtles, falling within the compaſs of his Story; nay
'tis plain that he was at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a conſiderable time
before that Council was held; for <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 1. 'tis ſaid,
Thoſe that troubled the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> went down
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98580:52"/>
from <hi>Judaea,</hi> and <hi>V.</hi> 24. 'tis ſaid by the Apoſtles
(whereof <hi>Peter</hi> was one) in their Joint Letter, Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
men that went out <hi>from <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Touching <hi>Peters</hi> being Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> we
have ſpoken before (<hi>Chap.</hi> 3.) and ſhall here only
add, That <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf in this ſame Chapter
ſays, Peter <hi>ſhould have left a moſt Pernitious Example
of a Christian Pastor, if he had at once Retain'd two
particular and proper Biſhopricks</hi> (which yet it ſeems
<hi>Onuphrius</hi> thought no diſparagement) but would it
not be an Example equally pernitious, if Retaining
but one, he ſhould very ſeldome or <hi>never</hi> Reſide
there? For I conceive <hi>Non-Reſidency</hi> as bad as <hi>Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities;</hi>
and indeed the chief reaſon againſt <hi>Pluralities,</hi>
is becauſe they are thought to Imply <hi>Non-Reſidency:</hi>
But I think it will Unavoidably follow, that <hi>Peter</hi>
muſt be generally <hi>Non-Reſident,</hi> if being ſtated Biſhop
either of <hi>Antioch</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> he Travelled ſo many
other Provinces during the ſame time, and yet every
other while was found at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. That <hi>Peter</hi> upon the Decree of <hi>Claudius,</hi> That the
Jews ſhould depart from <hi>Rome,</hi> did fly thence and ſo
came to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as it were Accidentally, to that
Council, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. is like the reſt, aſſerted <hi>Gratis.</hi> And
as the ſame did neither ſuit with the Zeal and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Fortitude of <hi>Peter,</hi> ſo to Abandon his flock; ſo I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it may manifeſtly be proved to be falſe from the
<hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles; where we Read, That <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Barnabas</hi> immediately after that Council, return'd to
<hi>Antioch,</hi> ſtaid there ſome time; That afterwards <hi>Paul</hi>
took a Journey into <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and thence to
<hi>Derbe</hi> and <hi>Lyſtra,</hi> and having Travelled through
<hi>Phrygia, Galatia, Myſia</hi> and <hi>Troas,</hi> came into <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia</hi>
(where <hi>Phillip</hi> was caſt into Priſon) thence he
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98580:53"/>
paſſed to <hi>Amphipolis</hi> and <hi>Apollonia,</hi> to <hi>Theſſailonica,
Beraea,</hi> and as far as <hi>Athens, Acts</hi> 15, 16, &amp; 17. And
after all theſe tedious Perigrinations (which muſt
require and take up a very conſiderable time) when
he came to <hi>Corinth,</hi> he found there <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcilla,</hi>
who LATELY (or as the <hi>Syriac Verſion</hi> has
it, <hi>eo ipſo tempore, juſt then</hi>) were come out of <hi>Italy,</hi>
upon that Edict of <hi>Claudius,</hi> ſo that the ſaid <hi>Edict</hi>
muſt be after the Council, and conſequently could
be no ground for <hi>Peters</hi> being then at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. If <hi>Peter</hi> were ſupream Governour of the Church,
and had before that Council at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> been ſeven
years Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and for as many years and
at that preſent time, been Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> both Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Gentiles, and yet not without conſiderable
numbers of Jews therein; 'tis ſtrange, he had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
determined that Queſtion, touching <hi>the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
of the Gentiles;</hi> or it might have been a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Argument for <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to have ſaid,
<hi>Peter the Quondam Biſhop of this City, and now of</hi>
Rome, <hi>Christs Vicar and Prince of the Apostles, Taught
and Practiſed otherwiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. 'Tis moſt improbable, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> here
aſſerts, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>in one and the ſame year Peter</hi> ſhould
be Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> Impriſoned at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and
yet alſo <hi>in that very Year</hi> come to <hi>Rome</hi> and make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
Biſhop there; Let any Judicious Perſon but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the great diſtance of thoſe ſeveral places, and
the inconveniencies of <hi>Travelling</hi> in thoſe days, and
that there appears not the leaſt ground for ſuch his
<hi>Posting to and fro,</hi> and he will be apt to ſuſpect it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
<hi>Romantic,</hi> or a ſtory fitter for the <hi>Legend,</hi>
than an <hi>Article of Faith.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Object. 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>To that of <hi>Pauls not ſaluting Peter</hi> in his Epiſtle to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98580:53"/>
the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Cardinal ſays two things; Firſt,
<hi>That the ſame St.</hi> Paul <hi>Writing to the</hi> Epheſians, <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
not St.</hi> John; <hi>nor</hi> James <hi>in the Epiſtle to the</hi>
Hebrews, <hi>yet they were Biſhops of thoſe Churches.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<hi>That when</hi> Paul <hi>Wrote that Epiſtle,</hi> Peter <hi>was</hi>
not yet return'd <hi>to</hi> Rome <hi>from the Apoſtolical Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I Anſwer.</p>
               <p>1. That the Cardinal has not proved,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> that either
<hi>John</hi> or <hi>James</hi> were ever Biſhops of thoſe reſpective
places in a ſtrict and proper ſenſe; St. <hi>John</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
that I know of, reckon'd Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> nor
could be ſo without diſplacing of <hi>Timothy,</hi> who, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Current Teſtimony of Antiquity, was
by <hi>Paul</hi> conſtituted Biſhop there; Nor does it appear
that the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> was wrote to thoſe at
<hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> Nor laſtly was St. <hi>James</hi> then alive; ſo
that there is no Parity.</p>
               <p>2. As for <hi>Peter</hi>'s not being <hi>Return'd</hi> as yet to <hi>Rome,
Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> were got back, for he <hi>ſends gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to them;</hi> Together with whom <hi>Bellarmine</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
<hi>Peter</hi> was expell'd, and why not <hi>Peter,</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of the place, as ſoon as they? We find <hi>Paul</hi> had
a firm or longing Reſolution to go to <hi>Rome</hi> as ſoon as
poſſible, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 13. and <hi>Ch.</hi> 15. 22. and 23. But
ſure <hi>Peter,</hi> if he had been Biſhop there, would much
rather have been Intent on that Journey.</p>
               <p>3. Tho <hi>Peter</hi> had been Abſent, yet if he had been
peculiar Biſhop of that Church, 'tis not Credible,
that <hi>Paul</hi> would not at all have taken notice of him;
for that Epiſcopacy of <hi>Peter</hi> there, would not have
been <hi>a forreign,</hi> nor any of the leaſt Cauſes fit to be
mentioned, of his giving thanks on the Romans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
as <hi>Ch.</hi> 1. 8. or in their Praiſes, as <hi>Ch. 16. 19.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98580:54"/>
Paul</hi> doubtleſs would have pray'd no leſs for <hi>Peters</hi>
proſperous return, then he does for his own happy
Journey; And adviſed them too, as well for to pray
for the <hi>Reſtitution</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> as for his own preſence
amongſt them, <hi>Ch. y</hi> 15. 30. at leaſt in that Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Ch.</hi> 16. 18. where he mentions the <hi>Doctrine they had
Learnt,</hi> how ſeaſonably might he have made the ſame
<hi>Commemoration,</hi> as elſe where he uſes of himſelf on a
like occaſion, 2 <hi>Tim 3. 14. Continue in what you have
Learnt, knowing from whom you have learnt them, to
witt, from</hi> Peter <hi>the only Rock under Christ of the Church.</hi>
'Tis plain it is uſual with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to lay hold on all
occaſions of naming with honour the faithful Miniſters
of thoſe Churches to whom he wrote, whether they
were preſent or abſent: As, 1 <hi>Cor. 16. 15. Epheſ. 6. 21.
Phil. 2. 19. Coloſs.</hi> 4. 9, 12, and 13. for this tended
much to the Edification of the Churches. And why
ſhould he not much more have done the ſame <hi>here,</hi>
where he had ſo Eminent Occaſion for it, to have
given Atteſtation to <hi>Peter</hi>'s Supream and Paſtoral
Office, and the wonderful Happineſs and Priviledge of

                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Object. 5.</note> The Cardinal ſays, that at that time when
<hi>Paul</hi> came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and when he wrote theſe Epiſtles,
<hi>Peter</hi> perhaps was <hi>not at Rome,</hi> for tho he had there
fixt his Seat, he was yet very often abſent.</p>
               <p>If they could once ſolidly prove,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> that ever he was
<hi>Preſent,</hi> we would grant that he might be often <hi>abſent.</hi>
But if his work as an Apoſtle did call him ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into other parts, why would he undertake to be
the proper Biſhop there? If <hi>Peter</hi> were abſent, would
not <hi>Paul</hi> in ſuch diſtreſs have mentioned and bewail'd
it? Or at leaſt how came it to paſs, that he never
mentions <hi>Linus</hi> and <hi>Cletus</hi> the two pretended <hi>Suffragan-Biſhops?</hi>
In fine, <hi>Peter</hi> it ſeems was four or five and
twenty years Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> but never <hi>there</hi> when
the Scripture has occaſion to mention either him, or
the Believers in that City; nor could <hi>Paul</hi> ever meet
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98580:55"/>
him <hi>there,</hi> till juſt they came to be put to death; and
that too is uncertain.</p>
               <p>Thus I have not only prov'd by a <hi>Deduction, ſeriatim,</hi>
that it is not credible, that ever <hi>Peter De facto</hi> was at
<hi>Rome,</hi> but alſo anſwer'd all the <hi>Objections</hi> that I have
met with, made thereunto. I ſhall conclude this
Chapter with this obſervation, That we ought not,
for <hi>that Reverence</hi> we bear to St. <hi>Peters</hi> memory,
imagine that he was ſeven years Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi>
and four or five and Twenty years of <hi>Rome,</hi> both
Cities of the Gentiles;<note place="margin">'Tis a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to fancy him Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </note> Becauſe it appears, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 7.
firſt, that <hi>Peter</hi> was the <hi>Apostle of the Circumciſion,</hi>
that is, that the Jews were more eſpecially committed
to him as his Charge and Cure, <hi>Concredited,</hi> or left to
his Truſt (ſo the word in the Original imports) as
the Gentiles were to <hi>Paul;</hi> and it muſt be our Bleſſed
Saviour who Commiſſioned both, and reſpectively ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
them thoſe Provinces, 2dly, That both of them
till that time had diligently and with great ſucceſs
labour'd in ſuch their ſeveral Provinces, <hi>Peter</hi> amongſt
the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> amongſt the <hi>Gentiles V.</hi> 8. 3dly, That
now by mutual conſent, a <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Agreement</hi>
was entred into, between <hi>James, Peter,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi>
on the one part, and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> on the other,
That the latter <hi>ſhould go unto,</hi> that is, Preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
to <hi>the Gentiles,</hi> and the former (as before, ſo for
the <hi>future</hi>) to thoſe of the <hi>Circumciſion.</hi> And this was
either at the Aſſembly of the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. or at
leaſt (if they were two diſtinct meetings) 14 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Pauls</hi> Converſion, ſo that <hi>Peter</hi> according to <hi>their
Reckoning</hi> muſt then be, and for ſome years had been
<hi>Biſhop of Rome</hi> (beſides his ſeven years Biſhoprick at
<hi>Antioch</hi>) and what reaſon then had there been to
mention only his Pains with the <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> and to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98580:55"/>
put the ſame in Ballance with <hi>Paul</hi>'s towards the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion?</hi>
If <hi>Peter</hi> had Preached ſo long at <hi>Antioch</hi>
and <hi>Rome,</hi> had he not many <hi>Seals of his Miniſtry</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Gentiles? How many Thouſands might
we ſuppoſe Converted by his Victory there over
<hi>Simon Magus,</hi> which if ever Tranſacted, was before
this time? And why then do we hear nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
but rather Intimations to the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi>
That <hi>Peter,</hi> beſides his Preaching to <hi>Cornelius</hi> (upon
an Extraordinary Occaſion) and ſome few others, had
then made no great Progreſs amongſt the Gentiles,
but chiefly had exerted his Talent amongſt the Jews;
ſo that his ſucceſs with the <hi>Latter,</hi> is compared with
<hi>Pauls</hi> amongſt the <hi>Former.</hi> Which to me is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
Argument, That St. <hi>Peter</hi> at that time, had
neither been Biſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi> nor <hi>Rome,</hi> nor ever at
the latter City; which muſt be (reckon how you
can) at leaſt, ſeveral years after the <hi>ſecond of Claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us;</hi>
and conſequently does utterly overthrow the
Roman Account.</p>
               <p>Now the Queſtion will be, Whether <hi>Peter, after</hi>
this Compact, either Continued or Undertook to be
<hi>Biſhop of the Gentiles at Rome</hi> or not? If he did, He not
only contradicted his particular Commiſſion which
our Lord had given him to be the <hi>Apostle of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,</hi>
and neglected the Jews, who were ſo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credited
to his proper Charge; but alſo Violated his
<hi>late ſolemn Agreement.</hi> On the other ſide, If at the
time of this Agreement, he either <hi>were not Biſhop of
Rome,</hi> or then left it; It follows, that he continued
not Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> four or five and twenty years, as
with great <hi>Confidence</hi> and ſmall <hi>Reaſon</hi> is pretended.</p>
               <p>Again, 'Tis nothing likely, if <hi>Peter</hi> had been then
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or deſigned ever to go and fix his
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98580:56"/>
Seat there at any time afterwards, that he would
have entered into ſuch an Agreement.—Ay but,
ſays <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> thoſe words <hi>[that they ſhould go to the
Circumciſion]</hi> are to be qualified, and underſtood not
Abſolutely, but Comparatively; as much as to ſay,
They ſhould <hi>Chiefly</hi> or <hi>Principally</hi> Preach to the Jews,
and in like manner <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to the Gentiles.
Be it ſo! We ask no more, for even then <hi>this</hi> ſhews
either that he was not then Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or muſt
be taken as a Relinquiſhment of his <hi>Roman Dioceſs,</hi>
and transferring the Title and Cure thereof to <hi>Paul;</hi>
for if he were the ſtated Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> the chief Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> how could he promiſe to beſtow
his <hi>Chief Pains</hi> on the Jews? Or having ſo promiſed,
principally to Attend the Jews, how could he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the proper Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and preſently after
Reſort back thither, and ſpend almoſt all the reſt of
his days amongſt the <hi>Gentiles?</hi> Was not this immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to Violate that ſolemn Compact?</p>
               <p>Moreover, If <hi>Peter</hi> were ſeven years Biſhop of
<hi>Antioch,</hi> and afterwards 25 years of <hi>Rome,</hi> He muſt
in all be 32 <hi>years</hi> in <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> undertaking the
Charge and Cure of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in thoſe Provinces.
And if his Martyrdom was, as <hi>Baronius</hi> Computes,
<hi>Anno Chr.</hi> 69. The ſaid two and thirty years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deducted, brings us back to the year of Chriſt 37.
but two or three after Chriſts Crucifixion, ſo that in
all he could ſpend but three <hi>years at moſt</hi> amongſt the
Jews; And why then is he ſo Emphatically ſtiled,
<hi>The Apostle of the Circumciſion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore ſince this Roman Pretence does by its
Unavoidable Conſequences, caſt a <hi>Reproach</hi> on St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
as if he had deſerted <hi>that Charge,</hi> which God had
committed unto him, as if he had Notoriouſly Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98580:56"/>
that <hi>Solemn Agreement</hi> which himſelf had vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
and on juſt conſiderations entred into; ſince
it repreſents him not only as deſerting the ſtation of

alſo as giving a moſt dangerous Preſident of remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

has generally been received, taken for granted for

Writers, whom <hi>Bellarmine</hi> Ennumerates; and Affirms,
It was <hi>never diſputed by any that he knows of, until one
William, John Wickliff</hi>'s <hi>Master</hi> (this muſt be about the

ſuch Maſter) <hi>did first of all raiſe ſome ſcruples about it:</hi>
And how was it poſſible that ſuch a General Conceit

               <p>To which is Anſwer'd:</p>

Write,</hi> That <hi>Paul</hi> was Beheaded and <hi>Peter</hi> Crucified by him at <hi>Rome.</hi> And
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:98580:59"/>
that which maketh for the Credit of the ſtory is, that it is COMMONLY
REPORTED, that there be Church-Yards unto this day bearing the
Name of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi> In like manner <hi>Gaius,</hi> a Roman and an Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
Perſon, and after <hi>Zepherinus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> Writing unto <hi>Proclus</hi>
Chief of the <hi>Cataphrygian Hereticks,</hi> ſays thus,—<hi>I am able to ſhew
the Banners of the Apoſtles, for if thou wilt walk into the Vatican, or the
Oſtienſian-way, thou wilt find there Victorious Banners, of ſuch as have
founded this Church.</hi> And that they were both Crown'd with Martyrdome
at the ſame time, <hi>Dioniſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Corinth</hi> declares in his Epiſtle to the
<hi>Romans,</hi> in theſe Words,—And you Obſerving ſo goodly an Admonition,
have Coupled in one the Building of the Roman and Corinthian Churches,
perform'd by <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> for they both Inſtructed us when they Planted
our Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi>—<hi>Thus</hi> Euſebius.</p>
               <p>From whoſe Words it is Obſervable, That he does not at all aſſert <hi>Peters</hi>
being Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor poſitively that he was ever <hi>there,</hi> but only tells
us that <hi>they Write;</hi> that is, <hi>'tis Written</hi> by ſome body or other, but ſays
not by <hi>whom,</hi> That <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were both put to Death by <hi>Nero</hi> at
<hi>Rome;</hi> which yet it ſeems he lookt up but as an <hi>Hear-ſay</hi> and <hi>Doubtful,</hi> and
therefore to Confirm it, adds, That it <hi>makes for the Credit thereof, that it
was commonly Reported,</hi> that there were to his time Burial-places that wore
the Names of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi> [As if after ſo many <hi>Books</hi> forged in <hi>Peters</hi>
Name, a falſe <hi>Tomb</hi> might not two or three hundred years after his <hi>Death</hi>
be aſſign'd to him]</p>
               <p>As to what he Cites from <hi>Gaius,</hi> who he ſays was a Roman, and ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Zepherinus,</hi> the Words Import nothing of <hi>Peters</hi> being Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
but ſeem intended to prove that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was founded by <hi>ſome
of the Apoſtles,</hi> whoſe Monuments were to be ſeen in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> and <hi>Ostien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian-Way.</hi>
But as in the Catalogue of Popes, there is no ſuch Perſon as <hi>Gaius</hi>
found to ſucceed <hi>Zepherinus;</hi> ſo we heard before from a <hi>Decretal Epiſtle,</hi>
that it was Pope <hi>Cornelius</hi> that removed the Bodies of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> from
the <hi>Catatombae</hi> to the <hi>Vatican</hi> and <hi>Oſtienſian-way.</hi> Now this <hi>Cornelius</hi>
became Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> (as appears by their own Chronologiſts) 51 years
in time, and the ſixth Biſhop in <hi>Order,</hi> after <hi>Zepherinus;</hi> How then could
<hi>Zepherinus</hi> Succeſſor (the words plainly imply his next Succeſſor) talk of
their Monuments being there in his time?</p>
               <p>The other Witneſs Cited by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> is <hi>Dioniſius</hi> of <hi>Corinth</hi> (who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that he is the ſame Man who (as <hi>Euſebius</hi> elſewhere tells us) did in
his own Life-time, complain that his Writings were abuſed and added to)
his words as here Related ſeem to ſignify, that (as there was very early a
kind of Vanity or Emulation in Churches and Perſons, which prompted
them to boaſt of thoſe that Converted them, which is reproved by <hi>Paul</hi> in
that Text—<hi>I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>and I of</hi> Apollos, <hi>and I of</hi> Cephas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo)
this Biſhop of <hi>Corinth,</hi> would have his Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> to be Planted
both by <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul;</hi> and therefore to be the more nearly Related to
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whom he ſuppoſed (and perhaps the Romans might
give it out ſo) to have the ſame Founders, every Countrey almoſt in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of time (ſuch is the Natural Itch of Ambition and Vainglory in Man)
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:98580:59"/>
pretending to have been Converted by ſome <hi>Apoſtle</hi> or <hi>Illuſtrious Name,</hi>
though often times the Preaching of the Goſpel amongſt them was (like
it ſelf) by very mean, and as to Outward Glory or Fame, <hi>Contemptible</hi>
Inſtruments.</p>
               <p>But from this Teſtimony of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> we may Rationally Collect, That
in his time <hi>Peters</hi> being at <hi>Rome,</hi> was but a <hi>dark</hi> kind of buſineſs, provable
only by <hi>Reports,</hi> and ſuch odd Teſtimonies of a few Obſcure Authors, that
have as little Weight as Clearneſs.</p>
               <p>But how then came the ſame afterwards to be ſo generally Entertained and
Believed,<note place="margin">Object.</note> and ſeveral of the Fathers to call <hi>Rome</hi> St. <hi>Peters Chair?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this may be Anſwered,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> That the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> after <hi>Constantine</hi>
had raiſed them to a high degree of Wealth and Reputation, puft up with
Ambition from their preſiding over the <hi>Imperial City,</hi> began to aſpire
above their Brethren; and firſt Claim'd a Primacy and Right of Receiving
<hi>Appeals</hi> from all parts; not <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> or as Succeſſors to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> but as
<hi>Granted</hi> to them by Councils; and to that purpoſe forged <hi>two Canons</hi> on
the Famous <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, as is mentioned before; but finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Cut ſhort and Baulkt therein by the ſagacity of the Council of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi>
they caſt about to derive a Supremacy over all other Churches from
<hi>an higher Title;</hi> and Obſerving <hi>Peter</hi> to have been one of the moſt Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Apoſtles, and ſome Words to have been ſpoken to him by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
that might Colourably be wreſted to Intimate as if he had ſome kind
of Superiority over, or greater Priviledge than the reſt, they would have it
believed, That he was the <hi>Founder</hi> of their Church, and though ſometimes
they joyn'd <hi>Paul</hi> with him, becauſe the Scriptures gave ſuch Illuſtrious
Teſtimonies of his pains there, yet for the moſt part <hi>Peter</hi> (without the
leaſt Countenance from, but rather <hi>againſt</hi> the Tenour of Scripture) had
the greater Vogue and Preference; and knowing the <hi>Mobile</hi> are eaſie to
be deceived with <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Titles,</hi> and apt to frame <hi>Idaeas</hi> of things <hi>paſt,</hi>
from what appeared at preſent, they gave out, That he was Biſhop of
<hi>Rome.</hi> To this purpoſe they preſs'd all the Fragments of Antiquity into
the Service: <hi>Papias</hi>'s <hi>Conjecture</hi> was made an <hi>Authentick proof;</hi> and this
ſaying of <hi>Euſebius</hi> and his hear-ſays, muſt paſs for <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndoubted Evidence.</hi>
Yet not therewith Content, abundance of other Writings were <hi>Counterfeited</hi>
under Antient Venerable Names (as I made appear before) and thus in
ſhort time the ſtory might gain Credit. And Whenever any of the <hi>Fathers</hi>
(though Unwarily deceived by a <hi>Spurious Tradition,</hi> or the Common
Vogue, not thinking it perhaps a matter much worth Enquiring into, as
not dreaming what ſtrange Inferences would thence be made in after times)
ſpoke thereof in a ſtile Accommodated to Vulgar Opinion, and call'd <hi>Rome</hi>
St. <hi>Peters Chair,</hi> or her Biſhop, <hi>Peters Succeſſor,</hi> this was filed as a freſh
Teſtimony of the Truth and Certainty of the matter of Fact.</p>
               <p>Having once gain'd this point, that it was believed, That <hi>Peter</hi> Preach'd
at <hi>Rome,</hi> which they call'd his being Biſhop there: They proceeded further,
to pretend, That not only <hi>Peter</hi> had a Soveraign Power confer'd upon him,
but that the ſame was derived to them as his Succeſſors. And ſo—<hi>Thou
art</hi> Peter—<hi>I will give thee the Keys</hi>—<hi>I have Pray'd for thee—Here
are two Swords,</hi> &amp;c. became ſufficient Arguments, both that <hi>Peter</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:98580:60"/>
was Prince of the Apoſtles, Vicar of Chriſt, and Chief Governour of the
Univerſal Church: And that he being ſo Dignified and Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
all the ſucceeding Biſhops of that See, being his Succeſſors, muſt be Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
with the ſame Authority: And conſequently, That the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> was the <hi>Mother and Miſtreſs of all other Churches,</hi> and is <hi>Infallible,</hi>
and the <hi>only Catholick Church;</hi> That the Pope has a direct Soveraignty over
all the World in Spirituals, and indirect, <hi>in Ordine ad Spiritualia,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>All which being Cloſely and Vigorouſly, though Gradually purſued in
Ignorant tures, and eſpecially after the Roman Biſhops, by the favour of
<hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>cas</hi> the Traytor, had gain'd the Title of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> and an Aſcendent
over a great part of the Chriſtian World; when every thing tending to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Advantage of that <hi>See,</hi> met with Encouragement, and the Roman
Biſhops only were Capable of beſtowing Preferments, and all were <hi>Snibb'd</hi>
and <hi>Cruſht</hi> that durſt offer any thing that diſpleaſed them, 'tis no wonder
if for many Ages ſcarce any (at leaſt whoſe Writings yet remain, for we
know who had <hi>then</hi> the keeping of all <hi>Libraries</hi>) durſt openly controvert
or deny St. <hi>Peters</hi> being at <hi>Rome</hi> and Biſhop there; Since this was a <hi>Blow
at the Root,</hi> and ſtruck effectually at the Popes Supremacy, Infallibility and
other Pompous Claims, which are all founded on that Pretence.</p>
               <p>Touching which, what need I ſay more? But briefly ſum up the ſtate
of the whole matter: If St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s being Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or ſo much as
ever there, be not provable by <hi>Scripture,</hi> nor any other <hi>Convincing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> but whatever can be ſaid for it, is eaſily <hi>Anſwered,</hi> and rendered
not ſo much as <hi>Probable;</hi> If the Witneſſes of the ſtory are at Open Wars
and Contradictions in the Circumſtances, yet all pretending to a moſt
punctual Exactneſs; and the Learned'ſt and moſt Subtle <hi>Advocates</hi> of the
Party Sweat in vain, to Invent even ſo much as Colours to Reconcile
them; If from <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> and a due Compariſon of all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
it is improbable to the higheſt Degree, That <hi>ever Peter was
at Rome,</hi> much more that he was <hi>Biſhop thereof:</hi> If the ſtory depend on
<hi>Counterfeit Authors,</hi> or ſuch as juſtly are of <hi>little Credit,</hi> and abundance of
<hi>ſhameful Forgeries</hi> have been invented and made uſe of to ſupport it; If it
be Derogatory to the <hi>Honour</hi> of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Memory to aſſert it: <hi>In fine,</hi>
If it be no difficult task to apprehend and ſhew by <hi>what Methods</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees</hi>
it might be advanc'd to popular Credit, and for <hi>what Ends:</hi> If I ſay,
all this be made appear (and how far this brief Diſquiſition may be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
that way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is left to the Judicious Unbigotted Peruſer, and Poſterity,
