            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the names of <hi>Charles Lawn,</hi> &amp; three other his <hi>brethren

               <hi>devour the afflicted from of the earth, &amp; the pore
from among men.</hi> Agaynst whom, &amp; whose freinds
durst I vse the same liberty, in publishing to the world their
personall corruptions, which I know, &amp; could soon learn by
the testimony of honester men, then these informers, they who have written of others,
what hath pleased them, should read that which would not please them, of their own,
if not of themselves. But God forbid. My desire is rather to pacify, then further to
alienate affections: remembring Christs instruction vnto his Disciples, to <hi>blesse those</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 44.</note>
               <hi>that curse them: to do good to those that harm them: &amp; to pray for those
that persequute them.</hi> Besides, in following their course, I should for the faults of a
few corrupter persons, wrong the credits of many honest, &amp; innocent men: for whose sakes
I would rayther cover the others faylings, then for them, blemish the credit of the rest.
But herein speciall respect is to be had to the common truthes of the Lord Iesus by them
&amp; vs, acknowledged: vppon the honour whereof had they been but half so bent, as vppon
our disgrace, they would not thus have gratifyed the common adversaryes thereof, even
theirs, &amp; ours: &amp; with them, the Atheists &amp; Epicures in the land; by whom their
book is most affected: blessing themselves in their professed contempt of God, &amp; of all
religion, by the faylings of those (whether truely, or falsely suggested, they regarde not)
who professe his more speciall fear, &amp; service: &amp; concludeing, that all others are as ill
as themselves, though more covertly. It is the spiders disposition, so she may entangle the
silly flyes in her web, to weav out her own bowels.</p>
            <p>This libell it hath pleased divers persons of note for learning, &amp; Zeal, to countenance
with their wryteings of divers kyndes. Amongst the rest, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> W: Ames, fearing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
lest eyther it should want credit, or I discredit by the accusations in it against the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

them to be wholy false, &amp; others impudently published by such as were themselves cheif
agents in them, yet did no more concern me, &amp; the Church with me, then did the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

the rest, which were free from them) hath published to the world, in the body of that

violent opposition by them against vs in the practise of those things, which themselves, as
their wryteings testify, do so far approve; so think I it a Preface very convenions for my
present purpose, to communicate with others such grounds, as vppon which they seem to
rayse the same.</p>
            <p>And first, all oppositions in religion are caryed vsually with violence, as wherein men
have speciall perswasion they please God, in that their speciall work of Conscience and
Zeal for him, and his truth. And as men are in daunger to mistake errour for truth, so
to prosequute the same with wrath, and indignation, instead of true Zeal of God. And I do
much entreat, &amp; warn those men in the fear of the Lord, to beware that in-stead of Zeal
against our supposed errours, they nourish not in their hearts, wrath, and hatred against<note place="margin">

so vnto <hi>God who is love;</hi> &amp; the breaking of <hi>the whole law,</hi> which <hi>love fulfilleth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But besides this generall, they take more speciall occasion of offence at vs, &amp; our sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
by which we cary our differences; as wherein we do not onely in word, but even
really &amp; indeed reprove their state, &amp; standing, as vnlawfull: &amp; such, as we rayther
chuse all calamityes, by losse of country, freinds, riches, credit, liberty, yea &amp; life is
self, then by continuance therein, to <hi>withould the truth of God in vnrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
&amp; vphould the chayr of Apostacy, and so to pull down wrath from heaven vppon
our heades. Which our sequestration is yet the more offensive vnto them, by how much
the nearer we were, &amp; yet are, in many things, vnited: the <hi>contentions of brethren

            <p>I will therefore conclude this poynt with a double exhortation: the
former respecting vs our selves, who have (by the mercy of God) with the<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 12.</note>
fayth of Christ, receaved his order, &amp; ordinances: which is, that we please
not our selves therein too much, as if in them, piety, &amp; religion did chiefly
consist: which was not the least calamity of the Lords people of ould, for
which he also sharply reproved, &amp; severely punished them: of which evill, &amp;
overvaluation of these things (housoever great in themselvs) we are in the<note place="margin">Psal. 40 6. 7. 8.</note>
more daunger, considering our persequutions, &amp; sufferings for them: but
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hatas we believ these things are necessarily to be done, so we consider<note place="margin">Heb. 10. Psal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

that other things are not onely not to be left vndone, but to be done
much more. The grace of fayth in Christ, &amp; the fear of God, the continuall
renueing of our repentance, with love, mercy, humility, &amp; modesty, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with fervent prayer, &amp; hearty thanksgiveing vnto God, for his vnspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
goodnes, are the things wherein especially we must serv God: nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them in our own hearts, &amp; so honoring them in others, wheresoever
they appear to dwell. And if God wilbe known, &amp; honoured in all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
yea even in the sillyest worm that crawleth vppon the earth, how
much more in the holy graces of his spirit vouchsafed to his elect; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
theyr faylings of infirmity, especially in outward ordinances.
Which personall graces whilst too many have vndervalued in other men, &amp;
neglected in themselves, in comparison, God hath been provoked to suffer
so many amongst vs to fall, some into such personall sins, &amp; evilles (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
theyr advantage in the Lords ordinances) as from which
without these helpes) many thousands of them have been preserved: &amp;

               </gap>thers both from the conscience of Gods ordinances, &amp; of the personall

            <p>The other exhortation I direct vnto them about whom I deal: which is,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat they content not themselves with that fayth, &amp; grace in theyr persons,

vnto others: much more, that they continue not theyr submission to the

Now before I come to prove the thing I aym at, I think it fit to satisfy
the principall obiections, which I have taken knowledg of agaynst the

            <p>And it will fust be demaunded of me, <hi>considering my iudgment of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish</hi>

               <hi>assemblyes, as Anti-Christian, &amp; of sundry the practises there as idolatrous, &amp;
withall, what iudgments the Scriptures denounce agaynst such estates, &amp; practises,
how I can deem any the membres of such assemblyes, &amp; so practiseing, as truely Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian?
or how I can without pollution communicate with them, who are by the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of so many vnclean both persons, &amp; things, themselves made vnclean?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For answer. First, it is true, that vppon the true Church the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

do pronunce most excellent blessings; as they do also denounce fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
curses vppon the false: as it is also true, that whatsoever is spoken of
the whole body, the one, or other, ioyntly, belongs to ech member of ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
severally: provided, that in both, things be in theyr right state, &amp; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
which is, that there be none, but faythfull, &amp; holy persons in the
true Church, &amp; none but vnholy, &amp; prophane persons in the false: for none
other should be, in the one, or other. But if now it come to passe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
&amp; that thorough the Churches want of Vigilancy or Zeal, &amp; the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes
hypocrisy (which hath been alwayes, &amp; is too too common) there
be in the true Church vnfaythfull, &amp; prophane persons, shall we say,
that those pretiouse promises made to the true Church in which they
wrongfully are, do apperteyn vnto them, &amp; vnto theyr persons? &amp; that
they are <hi>elect of God, saynts by calling,</hi> &amp; <hi>sanctifyed in Christ, to the hope of life,</hi> &amp;c.?
So if, on the contrary it come to passe, thorough her craft, &amp; cruelty, &amp;
theyr own weaknes (which is too too common also) that godly, &amp; fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
persons be in the false Church where they should not be, shall we now
lay vppon theyr persons all the curses, &amp; condemnation, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
denounce agaynst the estate of the false Church, &amp; the superstitions
thereof? were not this to <hi>iustify the wicked,</hi> because he is in the true Church:
where he should not be? &amp; <hi>to condemn the righteouse</hi> because he is in the
false Church, where he should not be neyther? Or are not all godly wis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

men in these, &amp; the like disordered states of things, to have vse of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
discretion for the putting of difference between person, &amp; person
notwithstanding theyr common Church state, &amp; order, the wicked with
the godly in the true Church, &amp; vnder Christs ordinances, &amp; the godly
with the wicked in the false Church vnder the forgeryes of Anti-Christ?
Otherwise our iudgment wilbe as confused, as is theyr estate. Neyther is it
a more difficult thing for a spirituall, &amp; vnpartiall ey to discern a godly man
in a false Ch: where the falsenes ariseth not from the falsity of fayth, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

And this consideration had, may serv for answer to the cheif part of
the obiection: which is also no more in effect, then hath been answered
by the Authours of † <hi>the Apology,</hi> before me, in theyr defence agaynst<note place="margin">Pag 11</note>
that vniust accusation layd vppon them by theyr adversaryes, that they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<hi>the whole Realm to be drowned in confusion without assurance of salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theyr answer is, that <hi>there is difference to be put between</hi> PERSONS <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
&amp; between theyr</hi> ACTIONS <hi>or</hi> ESTATE <hi>otherwise. The person some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
is blessed, when the action, or standing in an other behalf, may be such as is
subiect to curse:</hi> &amp;c. <hi>As on the contrary also, sometymes the person is subiect to curse,
Qwhenas yet the action, or standing may be blessed in another respect.</hi> And both
those parts of theyr distinction they prove by sundry insta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.
Some whereof I will here note down, adding also some others

               </gap>ake no question. The Prelacy then being to be <hi>rooted out, as a plant, which
God hath not planted,</hi> &amp; the ministery in the order, &amp; office, (of which we
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:5430:20"/>
speak) being a braunch of it, can the braunch survive, if the root be
plucked vp? or shall any of Gods people by their mayntenance of it,
submission vnto it, or communion with it, give therevnto any life, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation?</p>
            <p>But here sundry defences are made by them, who in iudgment, word,
&amp; wryteing, &amp; some practises, dislike the prelacy: as that <hi>they are not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to theyr government: that the Ministers do not stand by the ordination, &amp;
power receaved from, &amp; by them, but by the peoples acceptation: that these things
are but matters of outward order, &amp; government, which though they may so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mething
concern the Ministers themselves, yet are they litle, or nothing to private
persons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We will breifly consider of these defences: &amp; let them who make them,
consider, &amp; beware, they be not of them, who <hi>will not be reformed, but seck
excuses aster theyr own heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, first, they who thus disclaym in word the Byshops government,
confesse themselves therein to be vnder no spirituall externall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at all: &amp; so be lawles persons, &amp; inordinate walkers, &amp; such as
have neyther that conscience, which is meet, of the Commaundements of
Christ,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 17. Hebr. 13. 17.</note> by his Apostles, to give due <hi>honour</hi> to them who <hi>rule well:</hi> &amp; to <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
themselves to these, who are over them in the Lord:</hi> nor of their own frayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
&amp; in what need they stand of the Lords ordinances, &amp; of this in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall,
for their guidance, &amp; conservation in his wayes. 2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, the dayly
practise of these men (every one of them lesse or more) in the sight of
the Sun, is a sufficient conviction of their vnhonest excuse. Their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
vnto the Summons, &amp; Citations (vnto their spirituall Courts) of
the Prelates, &amp; their Deputyes; their sueing, or appearing there by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or their proctours; the submission of the Ministers to their suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
&amp; deprivations, &amp; both of Ministers, &amp; people to their excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications,
do really plead their spirituall subjection to their Iurisdiction.
Yea so far are the people from freing the Ministers by theyr acceptation,
from the Prelates iurisdiction, as on the contrary, they enthrall them
much more vnder the same: not onely by accepting them at the first
vnder their <hi>mark</hi> of Institution, or licence, but even ever after, year, by
year, by chuseing a <hi>Church-warden,</hi> or <hi>Side-man,</hi> (as they call him) to
present both their own, &amp; Ministers defaults in &amp; vnto their Consisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes,
&amp; Visitations: as doth the Minister also chuse another for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
same Purpose: for the performance of which presentations, they are t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

are ashamed of their Lords, &amp; Maysters; both Ministers, &amp; people (n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now for the outward government, &amp; ordering of the house of God, the
Church; &amp; the outward calling of the Ministers thereof, they are not so
sleighty matters, as Politique men, out of theyr fleshly hearts would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
themselves &amp; others. The Apostle vnto Tim: treating at larg of

               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. v. 15. 16.</note>
he <hi>might know how he ought to behave himself, in the house of God, which is the
Ch: of the liveing God, the piller, &amp; ground of truth.</hi> Where he adorneth the
Church with most honourable titles, for this very end, that he, &amp; all other
Gods Ministers, &amp; people might be admonished more carefully to preserv
vnviolated that sacred oeconomy, &amp; Ch: government there prescribed:
<note n="†" place="margin">Ch 5. 21</note>

of it, <hi>then was Moses a servant in his Maysters house:</hi> according to
whose direction notwithstanding, all things were to be ordered. I ad,
that the same Apostle, (whatsoever other men despiseing (it seems) his
simplicity, think or say) testifyeth of the <hi>Colossians,</hi> that they had <hi>receaved
Christ,</hi> as well in their <hi>order,</hi> as <hi>fayth:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 2. 5. 6.</note> &amp; <hi>reioyceth</hi> as well in their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in the one, as other: as on the contrary he sharply reproveth the
Corinthians, for the breach of order, &amp; neglect of Discipline, as well,
as for any other evill. And see how vnequall these men are.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5. &amp; 14.</note> The Popes
arrogateing to himself to be vniversall Byshop, is in it self but a matter of
order, &amp; government: &amp; yet they generally who are soundly mynded,
deem him properly Anti-Christ therein: alledging that of <hi>Gregory</hi> agaynst
<hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Constantionople,</hi> for that purpose. And if the vniversall Byshop make
Anti-Christ in the head, surely the Byshops of Diocesses, &amp; Arch-Byshops
of Provinces, &amp; Metropolitans of Nations, may well chaleng the pars of
arms, &amp; shoulders of that body.</p>

Touching the 2d Argument: I deny the proportion vppon which they
build it. In receaving an admonition from an vnlawfull brother, (as they
speak) I do submit onely to that which is good in it self, &amp; of God: but
in submitting to an vnlawfull Officer, Prelate or Preist, I submit to that
which is evill in it self &amp; not of God, to wit, his very Office, or Order.
The vnlawfull brother, though in sin, yet doth not perform the admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by vertue of his sin, but out of his personall knowledg, &amp; Zeal (at
least in appearance) agaynst the sin he reproves in particular, but the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
Officer doth administer the publique doctrine, (as the Sacraments)
by vertue, or rayther by vice, of his very sin immediately, &amp; properly:
wherein I may not pertake with him. These men have refused to submit
to <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Iohnsons</hi> publique Ministery, &amp; so professe: do they therfore think it
Vnlawfull to receav any information, or admonition, or reproof by the
word of God for their sins, from him, or any the people with him priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely,
&amp; vppon occasion? And by their larg grounds it should be lawfull
to submit to the ministery of any hereticall Minister: for from such a one
it is not vnlawfull to receav a private admonition for sin, vppon occasion.
But how much better were it for these men, &amp; their freinds to advance by
all good means a lawfull Ministery, then thus to supporte that which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull,
by pleading for submission vnto it. But if they needs will, (as
they plead in their book submit their soules to <hi>theeves, &amp; robbers,</hi> &amp; to
such Ministers, as were the <hi>Scribes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Pharisees</hi> in Christes tyme, (in
whom they instance) notorious Heretiques denying both the nature,
Offices, &amp; Person of the Messiah, teaching iustification by the works
of the law, &amp; power in man to keep it, let them <hi>reioyce</hi> in their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
&amp; let their Ministers <hi>also reioyce</hi> in them, as <hi>Iotham</hi> sayd of <hi>the
men of Schechem,</hi> &amp; <hi>Abimelech:</hi> but for vs, we have learnt to give
more honour to Gods ordinance, &amp; to have more care of Christs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
purchase, our souls, then to commit the same to such watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
keeping.</p>
            <p>Thus have I breifly noted down, &amp; confirmed the principall grounds
of our separation from the Communion, &amp; order of the Ch: assemblyes,
notwithstanding the admission of the personall communion before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
And I have of purpose taken in, &amp; answered the cheif Reasons
brought by <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cluses</hi> accusers, agayust our practise, that it may appear,
both how they fayl of that they promise in the <hi>Preface</hi> of their book; as
also that it is a far more easy thing, to reproach mens persons, then iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to evince their profession. And would the king but give toleration, &amp;
with-hould from bodly violence agaynst their persons &amp; estates, I doubt
not, but we should have many thousands in the land concurring with is,

Yet for our Cuntry, we do not forsake it, but are by it forsaken &amp; expelled
by most extream lawes, &amp; violent proscriptions contrived, &amp; exequuted
by the Prelates, &amp; on their behalf. And for private freinds thus we iudg:
that the wife is no way to leav her housband, but to give him, as the head,
the honour of chuseing probabely, the place of they cohabitation: nor
Children, &amp; Servants theyr Parents, &amp; Maysters to their preiudice, without

For flight then, thus much. As we read that Christ our Lord, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
&amp; Apostles, did at some tymes &amp; ordinarily avoyd &amp; flee persequu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
&amp; at other tymes, not: so are we to know, that there are tymes, &amp;
occasions seasonable for both. Neyther are the words of Christ, <hi>when they
persequute you, flee,</hi> an absolute commaundment, as he thinketh, any more
then those of the <hi>Mayster</hi> to <hi>his servant</hi> Luke 17. 8. <hi>when thou hast served me,
eat thou, &amp; drink thou.</hi> They are a graunt of liberty, &amp; a direction, how to
vse it. As we then shall perceav eyther our flying, or abydeing to be most

vnto vs, &amp; for our own furtherance in holines; &amp; as we have strength

            <p>And thus have I answered whatsoever in his book hath any colour of

both vppon our practise, &amp; persons, yea vppon the very secret intents of

when the hower is iust come about: which we therefore call false, when it
doth not so indeed, but deceavs him that looks vnto it, eyther by running
short, or over. Hence common sense teacheth, that if there may be a Ch: or

may there also be, &amp; so rightly be called, a false Ch:. If reply be made, that
this false Ch: is no Ch:, it may as truely be answered, that that false hower-glasse
is no hower-glasse: as in truth, &amp; indeed, it is not an hower-glasse, but
a three, or five-quarters-glasse, or over, or vnder. It is evident by the same

as he applyeth it: &amp; to prove, that <hi>false</hi> may as well, &amp; by the same reason
be applyed to the outward ordinances of the Church, as vnto worldly
things: as also to answer the Scriptures he brings to disprove that part of
our distinction, touching a <hi>false Church.</hi> It now remayns I prove by the

there are too many, which vnder a profession of the name, &amp; sundry

there maybe, &amp; are, <hi>false Churches.</hi> And thus much in effect he graunts els

               <hi>was a straunger,</hi> or <hi>soiourner.</hi> And here appeareth a direct warrant for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning
the outward Baptism, receaved, &amp; vsurped, in the like apostate
estate, &amp; assemblyes, wherein they, &amp; their familyes, &amp; synagogues were.</p>
            <p>I ad, that eyther the outward baptism receaved out of a true Ch: must be
reteyned, or els all other Churches must be able certaynly to discern, what
day, &amp; hour a true Ch: falling by degrees, into notorious heresy, idolatry,
or other impiety, (&amp; still baptizeing notwithstanding) becomes a false
Ch: (as we hould) or (as <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Helw:</hi> will have it) no Church. For except
other Churches can certaynly know, &amp; discern this, they cannot with fayth
receav such members, as vnto whom God may give grace, to leav th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
apostate synagogue, &amp; to come vnto them. Such of them, as were baptized,
whilst it remayned a true Ch: they must not rebaptize: but such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
were baptized after it ceased to be a true Ch: must (say our adversaryes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
be receaved in by baptism. But it being impossible for other Church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> 
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:5430:33"/>
thus to discern of the day, &amp; hour of the removeing of a Churches Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick,
especially for such as are far of, &amp; have had litle, or no medling with
her, it followeth necessarily, that the outward baptism administred in a Ch:
or assembly degenerated from a true Ch: into a false, (which they call no)
Church, must be reteyned vppon the partyes repentance, without reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>For conclusion then of this poynt also, I demaund, whether a man cast
out of the true Ch: for some notorious sin, &amp; for impenitency therein, have
true baptism, or no? They will not, neyther can they, say, he hath, wryte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, as they do: neyther indeed hath he true Bapt: in the ends, &amp; vses
thereof. He must then eyther have a false baptism, or none. Not none, for
then vppon his repentance, &amp; readmission into the Ch: he must be rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized:
he hath therefore vppon him a false baptism. There is then (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their doctrine) <hi>false Baptism,</hi> which is not none, &amp; the same also to
be reteyned, &amp; by the persons repentance becomeing <hi>true Baptism.</hi> Neyther
matters it, that such a man was baptized in a true Ch: at the first, since by
his<note n="†" place="margin">Rom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>transgression</hi> his <hi>Circumcision</hi> is <hi>made vncircumcision.</hi> In his obstinate ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity

with God. He hath onely remayning the outward washing, &amp;
that much more without right, then many thousands in Engl: have, or in

            <p>And thus much for the iustifying of the difference in the Apology, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

that sinfull prophanation of them: although that vttering of

be, &amp; is too commonly, true outward baptism, that is, the very outward

true, &amp; lawfull manner of administering it. And if the <hi>w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

&amp; manner, true baptism vnlawfully, &amp; falsely administered. The
thing done is the same in both: the difference is onely in the manner of
doeing it.</p>
            <p>But between the baptism of a Turk vppon a Turk, &amp; of a midwife, I
put this difference: that whereas that of a Turk is not done as a religious
action, but merely in mockery, (as is that of <hi>a Childe,</hi> in sporte) the latter
by a midwife is performed as a religious action vppon a member of an apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
Church: of which there is therefore another consideration to be had,
then of that which is done in sporte, &amp; mockery, which common sence
teacheth to be as nothing: as we may see in an oath, which being taken in

ieast byndeth not at all, but if taken in earnest, &amp; for a thing lawfull,
(though prophanely) byndeth him that took it.</p>
            <p>For the shutting vp then of this poynt, let the Reader observ, that the
Baptism which we repeat not, is that, which hath been ministered vppon
the members, &amp; accordeing to the order (how corrupt soever) of such a
Church, as wherein the Lord hath his people, &amp; for their sakes, many
his truthes, &amp; ordinances, which he so far blesseth vnto his elect, as by
them (notwithstanding all the confusion there,) he doth communicate,
&amp; confirm his saveing grace vnto them. Of the number of which his elect,
we have also (by his grace) testifyed our selves to be, as otherwise, so in
particular, by <hi>comeing</hi> as <hi>his people out of Babilon,</hi> or confusion, at his call. And
we rayther think it our duety to acknowledg the great goodnes of God
towards vs, in passing by the sins of our ignorance, &amp; in blessing vnto vs,
what was of himself, &amp; his own there: then vnthankfully to disclaym the
least eyther inward work of his grace, or outward means by which he
wrought it.</p>

&amp; in speciall from <hi>Circumcision,</hi> teacheth them, that <hi>in Christs</hi> person

who <hi>by his Circumcision</hi> hath abolished the former, as the shadow by

<hi>hearts circumcised.</hi> But whereas it might be obiected, that faythfull <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
had his heart circumcised, &amp; yet he had withall the outward signe, &amp;
seal annexed; the Apostle answereth v. 12. That they are baptized into
Christ: (the effects of which bapt: he also noteth down in the same place)
&amp; therefore needed not circumcision, as the false Apostles bore them in
hand: therein directly teaching, that our <hi>Bapt:</hi> is instead of their <hi>circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:</hi>
as is also our <hi>L: Supper</hi> instead of their <hi>passover:</hi> which supper no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized

Their circumcision was not to be repeated, nor our baptism now,
though our eating the L: Supper be, as their passover also was Likewise the
Israelites in the wildernes wanting the ordinary Sacraments of Circumcis:
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:5430:36"/>

our baptism now, &amp; that <hi>Manna,</hi> &amp; <hi>water of the rock,</hi> the the Sacrament of <hi>the

their circumcision. Besydes Circumcision was their first, &amp; solemn ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce

succeed one another, as doth the Ch: now the Ch: then?</p>
            <p>Lastly their Circumcision then was a signe or seal of the Covenant of
God; so is our Baptism now of the same Covenant, as shalbe proved here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after:
their circumcis: admonisheing them of that originall corruption of
all that came naturally of Adam, not to be purged but with the shedding
of the blood of the promised seed: as doth also our baptism admonish vs
of our originall spirituall filthines, not to be washed away but by the blood
of Christ powred vppon vs: the same outward circumcis: yet further signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the inward circumcis: of the heart, as doth our bapt: with water the
inward baptism of the spirit; which circumcision was also vnto them a

by many vsurped, as that also then was.</p>

to Israell in her apostacy, were not of <hi>apostate Israell,</hi> because they or their
parents were never of Iudah. And by his ground neyther the nationall
English, nor Catholick Romish Church should be Anti-Christian,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:5430:37"/>
for neyther of both were ever <hi>the temple of God,</hi> in which Antichrist at first
raysed himself. But as they are Apostolick Churches, which have receaved<note place="margin">Thess 2</note>
&amp; do keep the fayth, &amp; order delivered by the Apostles, though the Apostles
did not gather them personally: so are they answerably <hi>Apostaticall Churches,</hi>
which have taken vp, &amp; receaved an Apostaticall state, &amp; condition from
others, though they were never true in themselvs: the rule of nature here
haveing place, which is that <hi>the accessory followeth the nature of the principall.</hi>
We do likewise most properly, &amp; immediately call that a schismaticall
Church, which was once eyther of, or a true Church, &amp; hath causelesly
made a division: but yet if any other assembly (though haveing never been
of, or a true Church) do take vp a schismaticall profession, &amp; walking,
even it is also, though secondarily, a schismaticall Ch: &amp; so to be reputed.
So that, though Engl: never was eyther in the whole Nation, or severall
parrishes, a true visible Church, or Churches, yet haveing taken vp the
Apostate Communion, worship, government, Ministery &amp; order of Rome,
with the doctrines which defend them; &amp; Rome of that particular Church,
which was once planted there, haveing degenerated by degrees from the
primative constitution, it is truely called by vs <hi>Apostate Israell,</hi> for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

            <p>The Scriptures he brings, which are Ezra 10. 3. Nehem. 13. 23. 24. 25.
make much agaynst him in the generall cause, &amp; nothing for him in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
            <p>For to let passe other oversights. 1. They prove, that to be of Abrahams
seed carnally was not enough to make one a member of the Church, &amp;
within the L: Covenant of Circumcision. For these very children thus <hi>put
away</hi> (as haveing no parte therein) were, &amp; so are by <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Helw:</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
<hi>the males of the Israelites.</hi> 2. If any of them thus <hi>put away,</hi> had after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
chosen the L: God of Israell to be theyr God, should they have
been recircumcised? Or is there in the Scriptures any sillabe tending that
way? 3. He is vtterly deceaved in saying those <hi>children were born in Babilon:</hi>
vppon which notwithstanding he layeth all the weight of his Argument.
They were born in Canaan, &amp; of the wives of the peoples nere adioyning,
as in the same places is expressed: &amp; so their Circumcision nothing at all
to the Circumcision ministred in Babilon: &amp; yet is he more peremptory
in this his errour, then a wise man would be in the truth. And thus all may
see how his <hi>rod of iron</hi> is proved a broken reed, whose shivers have peirced
his own hands</p>
            <p>The next thing he comes to, is, that other ground of ours (for with
his by-bablings, &amp; revyleings I will neyther trouble my self, nor the Reader)
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:5430:37"/>
thus by him related, that <hi>Baptism is the vessell of the Lords house; &amp; as when the
house of the Lord was destroyed, &amp; the vessels thereof together with the people caryed
into Babilon, they remayned still the vessels of the Lords house, in nature, &amp; right,
though prophaned by Baltezar, &amp; being brought agayn out of Babilon to the house of
the Lord, were not to be new cast, but (being purifyed) might agayn be vsed to holy

or a new ordinance brought into the Church every tyme that bapt:

Iohn Baptist, Christ &amp; the Apostles, &amp; there at the first rightly applyed, &amp;

vse of it being purifyed by repentance.</p>
            <p>More particularly. If <hi>the true doctrine of Bapt:</hi> be <hi>the vessell of the Lords house,</hi>
then cannot this vessell of the Lords house be brought out of the mother
<hi>Babilon,</hi> which Rome is: because the doctrine of Bapt: there is most false
in it self: as that, <hi>Bapt: doth by the very work done, confer grace, &amp; wholy abolish
originall sin:</hi> that it <hi>imprinteth in the soul of the baptized a character, or mark indeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
by which even the damned in hell, which have been baptized, are differenced from
the vnbaptized:</hi> that it is <hi>of absolute necessity to salvation:</hi> that <hi>such infants are to be
baptized as neyther of whose parents are sanctifyed, or faythfull:</hi> &amp; that it is <hi>onely to
be administred by the popes annoynted ones, save in case of necessity, &amp; that then the
midwife may do it,</hi> with the like. How then can the vessell of the doctrine of
true baptism be brought from Babilon, where it is not? And so far as the
doctrine is true, so far the baptism is true also, being administred accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deing
vnto it.</p>
            <p>The truth then is, that as there were in the materiall temple both the
vessels, &amp; doctrine, teaching their vse, so is there by proportion in the Ch:
now, the vessell of baptism, or thing ordeyned, (which is most properly
called the<note n="†" place="margin">Lev. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17.</note> ordinance) &amp; the doctrine ordeyning, &amp; teaching it: which<note place="margin">Rom. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. 2.</note>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:5430:38"/>
are two severall things in all mens eyes which have sight in them. And
since baptism administred, besydes the doctrine which teacheth it, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
of God, as a means, to signify, &amp; apply the blood, &amp; spirit of
Christ thereby signifyed, it is very absurd to deny it to be a vessell for the
service of the Lords house, &amp; of the holy things therein: rightly vsed in the
temple: vsurped in Babilon, or els where.</p>
            <p>Lastly, <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Smith,</hi> &amp; <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Helw:</hi> with him in their <hi>Character,</hi> confesse,<note place="margin">Pag. 58.</note>
that <hi>if the Anti-Christians had baptized persons, confessing their sins, &amp; theyr fayth
into the name of the sonne of God, &amp; the trinity, it had been true baptism, though
in the hands of the Anti-Christians, as the vessels of the L: house in the hands of
the Chaldeant, &amp; therefore needed not repetition, as the vessels needed no new casting:</hi>
therein acknowledging, not the doctrine, but the outward washing in the
name of the trinity to be the vessell of the L: house in Babilon: as also
that there might be baptism so far true without eyther lawfull commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
minister, or subiect, (for all are Anti-Christian) as that it might be
reteyned without repetition: which is also iustly proved from Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,

were men of years; but in whom their infants were included, &amp; so within
these the L: Covenants, though secondarily, &amp; as was agreable to their
estate.</p>
            <p>These men professe every where, &amp; truely (although not vppon good
grounds) that the Israelitish infants were within the ould Covenant, or
Testament: &amp; yet when <hi>God</hi> eyther proclaymed it vppon <hi>mount Sina,</hi> or
<hi>writ</hi> it in <hi>the tables of stone,</hi> they knew not what it meant, neyther could they
have the same vse of it with their parents, &amp; others of discretion, as may
appear in the particulars conteyned in the Scriptures Exod: 19. 10. 11. 15.
21. 25. &amp; Ch. 20 1. 2. 8. 12. 18. 19. amongst others, where it is set down:
doth it therefore follow that those infants were not within the compasse of
the ould Testament, or law? So neyther followeth it, because the infants
of the faythfull now cannot for the present, observ the conditions of the
Covenant of Grace, or reap all the fruits thereof, &amp; particularly, to have
<hi>the law written in theyr hearts</hi> by the ministery of the gospell, &amp; work of the
H. Ghost, that therefore they are excluded from the Covenant of Grace,
or Testament of Christ, Children may with far better reason be denyed, to
have been within the Covenant of the ould Testament, or <hi>law,</hi> vppon which<note place="margin">Gal. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>
the <hi>curse</hi> followeth, then to be shut out of the new Covenant of grace, &amp;
mercy. And vppon this ground Infants should not be within eyther the
naturall Covenant or bond with their parents, or the civill Covenant with
their Magistrates, because they cannot for the present <hi>Honour Father, &amp;
Mother,</hi> which is the condition of these Covenants on their behalf. His
exception then that <hi>infants cannot by the preaching of the gospell, have Gods law
written in theyr heart,</hi> this being but a condition of the Covenant, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
men of riper years, is of no force.</p>
            <p>When the Lord sayth to <hi>Israell, I am thy God,</hi> his meaning is not to
exclude their infants, though he spake not vnto them, but to exclude
other peoples, &amp; nations: so where he makes this new Covenant with
those in whose hearts he writes his lawes, he doth not debar their children,
but wicked men destitute of the spirit of God, &amp; from vnder his promise.
So for Mark 16. 15. 16. which he also alledgeth, where <hi>Christ sends his
Apostles into the world to preach the gospell,</hi> &amp; ads that <hi>he who beleeveth &amp; is baptized,
shalbe saved,</hi> he no more entends to exclude the infants of the faythfull from
baptism, because they beleev not, then fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> salvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> because they beleev not:
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:5430:41"/>
which is yet more playn in the words following, <hi>but he that beleeves not shalbe
damned.</hi> Shall children now be damned because they believ not? There is
hence more colour for that, then that they shall not be baptized because
they beleev not: for Christ sayth not, <hi>he that beleeves not,</hi> shall not be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
but <hi>shalbe damned.</hi> The thing then is: Christ neyther excludes the
children of beleevers from baptism, nor from salvation, for want of fayth,
but vnbeleevers, &amp; such as refuse the gospell from both. So that the stone
vppon which these men stumble, is the ignorance of the opposition in the
Scriptures they bring; which is not between beleevers, or sanctifyed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
&amp; their children, but between them, &amp; vnbeleeveing &amp; prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
who are shut from the Lords <hi>Covneant, Baptism,</hi> &amp; <hi>Salvation.</hi> But where
in shareing this Covenant <hi>on mans behalfe</hi> into fayth, &amp; baptism, he makes
the one parte thereof, his being baptized, he speaks he knowes not what,
&amp; yet wonders that all men beleiv him not. For as Bapt: is indeed no parte
of the Covenant, but a signe, &amp; seal of further confirmation, so is it prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally,
&amp; in the mayn end performed, not <hi>on mans behalfe towards God,</hi> but
on Gods behalf towards man; (God by the outward washing of the body
with water, signifying, confirming, &amp; applying the inward washing of the
soul, by the blood, &amp; spirit of Christ:) &amp; for the further testification of
the admission of the party baptized into the family of God, the <hi>Father, Son,
&amp; H. Ghost, into</hi> whose <hi>name</hi> he is <hi>baptized:</hi> whereas in a 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, &amp; inferiour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
it is a work of man vnto God, for the profession, &amp; exercise of fayth,
repentance, &amp; thankfulnes in them who receaved the former covenant, &amp;
promise with the confirmation thereof, on Gods parte, towards them, &amp;
theirs: as it is also thirdly a signe of vnion between the members of the
Church: &amp; in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, &amp; last place, a badg of Christianity, &amp; signe of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction
between the true Church, &amp; all false Churches. The same confide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
are to be had of the L: Supper. And they who know not these
things,<note place="margin">Hebr. 6. 1</note> had need have <hi>the foundation of the doctrine of baptism,</hi> &amp; other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Christian religion <hi>layd agayn:</hi> &amp; yet the want of the knowledg of
this &amp; in speciall, that the Sacraments are in their first, &amp; mayn end workes
of God to men, by which he can both declare, &amp; effect his goodnes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
infants, though for the present, they neyther know it, nor can do
any thing agayn to the Lord in answer therevnto, is a mayn ground of that
offence, which these men take at our receaving, &amp; baptizeing of Infants.
And if the new Covenant or Testament consist so much in baptism, as these
men think, then could not Adam, &amp; Abraham, &amp; other the holy Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
&amp; Prophets vnbaptized, have been within the compasse of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
&amp; promise of grace, or have had their partes in the Testament of
Christ, the promised seed. Also if baptism were (especially so great) a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:5430:41"/>
parte of the Covenant, so oft as any eyther person, or Ch: renued their
Covenant, especially after any greater sin, they should so oft renue their
baptism also.</p>
            <p>These things thus layd down by way of answer, it remaynes I prove by
the Scriptures, &amp; further Arguments, that the infants of the faythfull are
within the compasse of the new Covenant here spoken of.</p>
            <p>And since all children comeing naturally of Adam,<note place="margin">Ps. 51. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

that their children so dying shalbe saved by Christ, then must they have a
parte in his Testament, or in this new Covenant, which are all one. There
are not two new Covenants, or Testaments established in the blood of
Christ but one. And since Christ is propounded vnto vs as <hi>the saviour of his

               </note> &amp; yet none of them to be of his body, or Church.</p>

our nature, &amp; so our childehood, that as the head thereof, he might sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
even that estate for his body the Church: with which he did also in the
dayes of his flesh, visibly communicate his grace, consecrateing vnto his
Father, as their true high preist, the infants of the Iewish Church, by <hi>lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his hands on them,</hi>

            <p>I ad, if any, eyther children, or men of years, be to <hi>enter into the kingdom

            <p>Lastly it is evident that the children of the faythfull are within this
Covenant of the Gospell or new Testament by that Covenant which <hi>God
made with</hi> faythfull <hi>Abraham,</hi>

as is Christ for the minister, &amp; mediatour of the new. For <hi>the law was given

see the contrary, as els where, so especially Math: 5. where he both openeth,
&amp; inforceth it agaynst the corrupt glosses of the pharisees) but because the
ministery of <hi>Moses</hi> was cheifly legall, &amp; the ministery of <hi>Christ</hi> cheifly Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall,

            <p>And such is the clearnes of those places to prove the Covenant, &amp;
Church with, &amp; of <hi>Abraham, &amp; his seed,</hi> the same in nature with ours, &amp;
so the Covenant, &amp; Church of the Gospell, as that he who goes about to
darken their light, would cover the sun with a ragged clout. And as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

in it) hath some or other such notorious errour, as that all haveing spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
eyes (not dazled too much some way, or other) may discover it:
so would the Lord mark out this profession of Anabaptistry, as not from
heaven, by this errour, that the Covenant with Abraham, <hi>I wilbe thy God,
&amp; the God of thy seed,</hi> is the Covenant of the law, &amp; not of the gospell. Vppon
which notwithstanding doth depend the reiecting of Infants from the Ch:
&amp; baptism: as also the repeating of the bapt: receaved in false Churches,
as may appear to him, who well observes their pleading for <hi>apostate Israell,</hi>
as a true Ch: because it was <hi>Abrahams carnall seed,</hi> &amp; so had <hi>circumcision</hi> as <hi>a

            </p>
            <p>And here I think it a fit place to lay down such Scriptures, &amp; grounds,
as vppon which we admit the Infants of the faythfull into the Church &amp;
to the baptism thereof: &amp; so after to answer what is obiected, interming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

Ier: 31. &amp; Hebr. 8. the Church is to be gathered, &amp; bapt: to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred:
&amp; that the Infants of the faythfull, (for they hould it of all) are
vnder a Covenant, or promise of salvation, by Christ: whence I conclude,
that, since there is but one new Covenant, or Testament established in the
blood of Christ, therefore these Infants (&amp; of others hereafter) have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest

For what God hath once established. God onely can repeal: &amp; that this
Covenant with Abraham was not the ould canceled Covenant, or Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I have proved before. They bid vs prove that children are of the

by Christs comeing in the flesh, as to cast out of the Ch: the greatest

               <hi>all nations,</hi> &amp; to <hi>baptize them:</hi> opposeing all nations to that one nation
of the Iewes: as if he should have sayd thus. I have formerly declared my
will to that one nation, &amp; circumcised it: <hi>go</hi> you now, &amp; <hi>teach all nations,</hi>
&amp; baptize them. Now if Christs meaning had been, that they should not
with the parents (being made disciples, &amp; baptized) baptize the children,
as before they had with the parents (being made disciples, &amp; circumcised)
circumcised the children, it had been needfull he had given them a caveat
to leav the children of the faythfull out in the world, though they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
been in the Church. If it be obiected, that they who were <hi>taught, &amp;
beleeved, were to be baptized,</hi> therefore not Infants, I deny the consequence:
which should be, if it were true, &amp; therefore not Infidels, &amp; such as refuse

            <p>To elude this place alledged in my former book, <hi>Mr Helw:</hi>
               <note place="margin">M. Helw</note> comments
vppon it in these words. <hi>The Apostle sayth to &amp; of all the vnbeleeving Iewes, &amp; Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
the promise is made to you, &amp; to your children, even as many as the L. shall cal:</hi>
&amp; so takeing his own imagination both for text, &amp; exposition, he bids me
<hi>prove that by children there are meant Infants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. These words,<note place="margin">ANSW:</note> 
               <hi>to them that are afar of,</hi> (which he leavs out in his
accustomed bouldnes with the Scriptures) with the words following, are
not meant of the Gentiles at all, but of the Iewes <hi>far of</hi> in tyme, as the
originall greek beareth it. For neyther was <hi>Peter</hi> himself yet so well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of the calling of the Gentiles, neyther (had he so been) was
it then a fit tyme to speak of it to the weak Iewes. He speaks then inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
<hi>of</hi> the Iewes as the seed of Abraham, &amp; within the Lords Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
or Promise: whom therefore Ch: 3. 25. he calles the Sonnes of
the Covenant: &amp; to the Iewes alone, as is evident, where v. 14. 16. 22. 29.
he quotes the Prophesyes of <hi>Ioell,</hi> &amp; <hi>David:</hi> which to vnbeleeving Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
had been in vayn. Yea that of <hi>the Promise</hi> he directs distinctly to such
Iewes onely, as had the work of grace begun in them: being <hi>pricked in theyr
hearts</hi> for the <hi>crucifying</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> &amp; earnestly set to know, &amp; do the will of
God. v. 37. 39.</p>
            <p>That <hi>by children</hi> here are <hi>meant Infants,</hi> I have by the drift of the place, &amp;
conference of other Scriptures proved; &amp; that the H. Ghost speaks of the
Covenant with Abraham, neyther was there otherwise cause of nameing
their <hi>children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where he further bids me <hi>prove</hi> that <hi>the inheritance of the kingdom of
heaven goes by succession of generation, as the land of Canaan did,</hi> he begets ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stardly
errours of his own, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would have me nourish them. For neyther
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:5430:46"/>
did the land of Canaan come by succession of generation, but by Gods
promise made vppon condition of fayth, &amp; holines, as I have formerly
proved: much lesse doth the kingdom of heaven: but by Gods gratious
promise, &amp; gift, both to young &amp; ould. These men think the kingdom
of heaven comes to all Infants so dying; &amp; doth it therefore come by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
generation? If it come otherwise to all, &amp; by the free grace of God in
Christ, as they suppose, can they see no other way, but it must needs come
to the Infants of the faythfull, by carnall generation? as if their estate were
worse then the estate of all the rest?</p>
            <p>Ad to this Scripture that which we read Act: 16. 14. 15. that <hi>God</hi>
haveing <hi>opened the heart of Lydia, to attend to, &amp; beleev the worde of Paul:
Shee was baptized, &amp; her family.</hi> Shee beleeved, &amp; the fruits, &amp; effect
thereof was, shee, &amp; her family were baptized. With these things doth
agree Christ our Lords his <hi>takeing the litle children</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark 10. 14. 16.</note> (to wit of the Iewish
Church) <hi>in his armes,</hi> his <hi>blessing them,</hi> that is his communicateing his
grace with them, &amp; pronouncing that <hi>of such is the kingdom of heaven:</hi>
as also his <hi>commaunding the bringing of such vnto him.</hi> In blessing them
visibly, he shewes them to be lawfull members of his visible Church or
body; &amp; more playnly in pronounceing the kingdom of heaven (which
is his Church vppon earth) to be of such. In commaunding such to
be brought vnto him, he commaunds them by consequence, to be
baptized; since they cannot be brought vnto him personally, as then,
nor otherwise outwardly, or by men, save by baptism. And if Infants
be to pertake of Christes blood, &amp; spirit, there must be some ordinary
means to apply them, God workeing ordinarily by ordinary means,
&amp; the same none but<note n="†" place="margin">Tit. 3. 5. VI.</note> 
               <hi>baptism, that lavacher of the new birth,</hi> as the Apostle
calleth it.</p>
            <p>Lastly Paul testifyeth 1. Cor. 7. 14. that if one of the parents be a
<hi>beleever,</hi> the <hi>children are holy,</hi> viz: with the holines of the Covenant (se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
things being left to God) who <hi>otherwise, are vnholy.</hi> Neyther is it
truely answered, that they are onely holy to their parents vse, as is the
vnbeleeving wife to the vse of her housband. For 1. they must eyther
be holy in their persons, or they cannot be saved. 2. he sayth <hi>the vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveing
wife is sanctifyed in,</hi> or to her <hi>beleeveing housband:</hi> but he sayth not
that children are sanctifyed to their parents, but simply that they are
sanctifyed, or holy. 3. It is not true that children are sanctifyed to the
parents there spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of: the one of them being<note n="‡" place="margin">Tit. 2. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hing
is sanctifyed.</hi> Lastly, the very drift of the place proves, that the Apostle hath
reference to the Covenant of Abraham, <hi>I wilbe thy God, &amp; the God of thy seed.</hi>
The thing he intends, is, to prove it lawfull for a beleeveing housband,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:5430:47"/>
or wife to abyde with an vnbeleeving wife, or housband. This he proves
by the Covenant made with Abraham, &amp; with every faythfull sonne, &amp;
daughter of Abraham, that he wilbe the God of his, or her seed: &amp; so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
them with the holines of the Covenant: &amp; that therefore they should

lawfull) wives, &amp; hous bands. And in this interpretation is force of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,

the seed of the faythfull being holy with the holynes of the Covenant are
necessarily within the same Covenant which halloweth them.</p>
            <p>Now whereas some marvayl, why the H. Ghost speaks not more playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
&amp; expresly of the admission of infants into the Ch: &amp; bapt: thereof;
they must remember, 1. That none must presume to teach the L: how to
speak, but that all are with reverence to search out his meaning. 2. That
they may with as much reason marvayl, why there is no expresse mention
made of the casting out of the Iewish infants with their vnbeleeveing pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.
In the very same places the H. Ghost speakes of the <hi>takeing the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God from them, for not bringing forth fruit;</hi> &amp; of <hi>giveing it to the Gentiles:
who would bring forth fruit:</hi> of <hi>breaking of the naturall branches for vnbeleef;</hi> &amp; of
<hi>planting in the Gentiles by fayth.</hi> Now here is no mention of the infants of ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

the promise,</hi> &amp; was therefore <hi>cast out of Abrahams house:</hi> &amp; so is propounded
as a <hi>figure</hi> of all them, Iewes, or Gentiles, who in the confidence of workes,
reiect the promise of grace, &amp; persequute them that embrace it: bringing
themselves also therein vnder the bondage of the whole law. And thus all
whether Iewes, or Gentiles, then or now, despiseing the free promise of
grace, &amp; looking to workes for iustification, were &amp; are rank <hi>Ismaelites,</hi> &amp;
of Abrahams seed accordeing to the flesh, as the Apostle expresly taxeth <hi>the
Galatians, desyreing to be vnder the law,</hi> though not discending naturally of
Abraham.</p>
            <p>Now (that I may apply these things to the present purpose) what is
all this of Abrahams seed accordeing to the flesh in the Apostles meaning
to the infants of the faythfull, whether of the Iewes formerly, or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
now? Did, or do they, as <hi>Ismaell, glory in the flesh,</hi> &amp; mock at Gods

of the law, &amp; of works,</hi> or <hi>persequute him that is born after the spirit,</hi> as all they
who are <hi>born after the flesh,</hi> in the Apostles meaning, did, &amp; alwayes do?
Onely they, who thus <hi>Ismael-like, glory in workes,</hi> &amp; <hi>persequute</hi> the true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:5430:48"/>
are by the Apostle called <hi>Abrahams seed, according to the flesh,</hi> &amp;
of Ismaell. So for the ordinances, &amp; workes of the law thus abused, &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
for iustification, they were base, &amp; beggerly, vnprofitable, vnho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

&amp; killing them, who so wrought, or deemed them. And thus conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the Apostle to the Galatians, Phillipians, &amp; Hebrues speaketh of them;
(giveing them as <hi>Luther</hi> vsed to say, ignominious names) haveing to do
with those, who eyther did, or were in speciall daunger, thus to pervert
them.</p>
            <p>And these grounds thus layd, vnto that his obiection, that<note n="†" place="margin">Pag. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
made with Abraham was a carnall Covenant, because it had a worldly sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
&amp; preisthood, &amp; carnall rites purifying the flesh, but not purgeing the spirit,</hi> I
do answer, that those ordinances were no parte of the Covenant made
with Abraham, but accessoryes vnto the law given 430 years after:
though there might be a spirituall vse of them, &amp; was, by fayth, as of any
ordinances now &amp; as of the morall law it self, to them that beleev, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent:
but in, &amp; accordeing vnto this lawfull vse of them the Apostle
speaketh not, but in respect of their abuse, as eyther severed from Christ,
as their end; or ioyned with him for iustification.</p>
            <p>His assertion, so oft repeated, that <hi>God in his Covenant with Abraham,
promised but worldly things, &amp; so requyred onely carnall obedience,</hi> I have formerly
refuted, as a notorious ground of Iudaism &amp; Pharisaism. Neyther was it
the more <hi>a carnall Covenant,</hi> because the signe was set <hi>in the flesh,</hi> then is ours
now, because baptism is administred vppon the flesh, or bodyes of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
baptized.</p>
            <p>But where he ads, that <hi>the iudgment for the breaking of the Covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
was a worldly iudgment,</hi> &amp; that <hi>no iudgement of condemnation vs pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
agaynst any, though presumptuously breaking the ordinances, &amp; law of Moses,
but bodily death,</hi> quoteing for that purpose Gen: 17. 14. Numbr. 15. 30.
Hebr: 10. 28. he proceeds on indeed from Pharisaism which made the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
&amp; Messiah carnall, to playn Sadusaism, which denyed a resurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
especially vnto the Iewes, which (as it is written of them) hath
been the perswasion of divers Anabaptists in former tymes. For if eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
death were not threatned the Iewes for breaking the law, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundments
given by Moses, though <hi>presumptuously,</hi> &amp; <hi>blasphemously,</hi> of
which he speakes Numb: 15. 30. nor for the worshipping of false Gods, of
which sin <hi>Paul</hi> speakes Hebr. 10. 28. compared with Deut. 17. 2. 3. 6.
then for no sin whatsoever, &amp; so there is no iudgment to come, nor needs
be no Christ to save from it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:5430:49"/>
The Scriptures quoted speak indeed of bodily death, but includeing in
it spirituall death, without repentance, as did theyr bodily blessings promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
include spirituall. The Apostle Paul speaking of the last iudgment,

sin then was in it self, &amp; without repentance, damnable.</p>

but that this is the ordinary, &amp; orderly state of things: &amp; where
it falles out otherwise in the family, it is at the least the governours Crosse,

the dispensation of the L: ordinances, accordeing to the orderly state of
things. But to conceav, that Abraham would circumcise any vnbeleeving,
or vnholy person, so appearing, or seed of such, on both sydes, is to accuse
<hi>the father of the faythfull</hi> of vnfaythfull dealing with the seal of the L: Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,

which notwithstanding infants could not possibly propound, or

the baptism of infants: which followeth in the room of the other, as I

those ordinances especially serv, &amp; are by his servants to be vsed.</p>
            <p>He tels vs, that <hi>in the new Testament there is no seal, but the seal of the spirit:</hi>
&amp; quotes Eph: 1. 17. &amp; other Scriptures speaking of that inward seal,
&amp; proveing it indeed: but not disproveing the outward seals, but playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
establishing them. For if Gods teaching of, &amp; testifying vnto vs inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by his spirit, that we are his in Christ, be an inward seal, then is his
teaching of, &amp; testifying vnto vs, the same thing outwardly, by the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
&amp; Sacraments, an outward seal, or seals, &amp; so rightly called. And not
onely<note n="†" place="margin">Ioh. 5. 8</note> 
               <hi>the spirit,</hi> which is inward, but <hi>water, &amp; blood,</hi> which are outward,
do <hi>bear record</hi> of Christ, or confirm, &amp; seal vp his death vnto vs. In respect
of which <hi>water, &amp; blood issueing out of his syde,</hi> our Sacraments are sayd to
have flowen thence. Lastly, <hi>Abraham,</hi> our Father, when he beleeved, was<note place="margin">Ioh. 19. 34.</note>
also <hi>sealed by the Spirit of Promise:</hi> &amp; yet this hindered not, but that both
he, &amp; his seed had the outward seal of circumcision added; even so our
good God, knowing how frayl, &amp; feeble in fayth we are, hath to his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Covenant, &amp; Promise in word, &amp; wryteing, annexed (besydes the
inward seal of the spirit) the outward seales, which we call Sacraments,
for the confirmation thereof, not in it self, but vnto vs: which we are
therefore accordeingly to vse, with reverence, &amp; thankfulnes.</p>
            <p>His assertion, that <hi>Infants are not in the Covenant of the new Testament, &amp;
therefore not vnder the seal,</hi> I have formerly disproved. If they be vnder the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of salvation, they have a parte, or legacy in the will, or Testament of
Christ, or new Covenant, which are both one: &amp; so in this seal of initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

            <p>To his affirmation that <hi>parents cannot set the seal vppon theyr infants now, as
they could the seal of circumcision of ould, vppon theyrs,</hi> I do answer, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
indeed set the inward seal, no more could they then: but the outward
they can now, as then they could: vnto which God also setteth the inward

receav this promise, &amp; so interessed himself &amp; his in it, &amp; the seal thereof:

one errour, as he that enterfeers, strikes down one ill leg, by another.
For 1. since Ismaell, &amp; the children by <hi>Keturah</hi> were circumcised, &amp; yet
had no promise of the land of Canaan, his mayn foundation, which is, that
<hi>God in the Covenant of Circumcision, promised nothing on his parte, but the land of
Canaan</hi> is raised, &amp; so all falles, which he buildes vppon it. 2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, since the
Covenant there spoken of was the Covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Circumcision, &amp; that Ismaell
with the rest were circumcised, how sayth he, that he, &amp; they were not in
the Covenant, to wit outwardly? Besydes the L: tels Abraham v: 20. that
he <hi>had heard</hi> his prayer <hi>touching Ismaell:</hi> though he meant to stablish his
Covenant with Isak, as the root; of which both the Church, &amp; promised
seed should come, &amp; vnto whom Ismaell (with the rest) should have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
&amp; adioyned himself; whom because he despised, &amp; in him, Christ,
he was cut of from the Ch: &amp; Covenant afterwards. Which things till
they were revealed made no difference between Isak, &amp; Ismaell: neyther
can the like difference in Gods secret knowledg, or purpose, till the tyme
of revelation, exclude one of the children of the faythfull now, more then
another.</p>
            <p>Of Act: 2. 39. I have spoken formerly, &amp; therefore come to the latter
parte of the ground, which he putteth down thus. <hi>God takes occasion by the
sins of parents to exequute his iustice to condemnation, vppon the children. Where</hi>
(sayth he) <hi>I double my sin, in that as before I made the parents fayth the cause of
blessing to salvation, so here, their infidelity a cause of Gods iudgment to condemnation,
to their children.</hi> Where the truth is, he both doubleth, &amp; trebleth iniury
vppon me, &amp; iust blame vppon himself. For first, I neyther mention, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

medle with eyther the salvation, or condemnation of infants, though he
falsify my words, as if I did: our question being onely about the outward,
or visible Covenant of the Church, &amp; Priveledges thereof: <hi>secret things being
left to God,</hi> as I there expresly speak, alledging Deutr. 29. 29. for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, as I make not the fayth of parents <hi>a cause meritorious,</hi> as he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineth,
of that good vnto their children, but onely a means of embraceing
Gods gratious offer, &amp; promise: so neyther do I wryte, as he chalengeth
me, that the Fathers infidelity is a cause of the childrens damnation, but
<hi>an occasion, which God vseth for the exequution of his iustice, vppon the children,</hi> being
by nature the <hi>children of wrath.</hi> That then, which I have writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; do avouch,
is, that God ordinarily includeth in the parents, the infants, as branches
in the root, eyther for blessings, or iudgments visibly, or in respect of men,
reserving to himself the secret dispensation of things, accordeing to the
tenour eyther of his mercy, or iustice. That the children of the faythfull
are with their parents in the visible Covenant of Gods love, I have at larg

with whom the Lord doth not deal in the course of his iustice, but of his

appears in the Scriptures, that the L: in giveing him into the hands of the

               <hi>children of wrath: or that some parents confer grace by generation, more then others:
or if not, which he assures himself we will confesse, how I can prove, that God should
exequute his iustice to condemnation vppon some children, for the sins of theyr parents,
&amp; shew mercy vppon others, for the fayth of theyr parents, seing God hath sayd, that
every one shall receav salvation, or condemnation, accordeing to that, which he hath
done in the flesh, &amp; not accordeing to that his parents have done,</hi> I answer sundry
things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:5430:52"/>
And 1. as before, that I do not say, that infants are saved, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for the fayth, or sins of their parents, as he most vntruely accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
me. The infants saved are saved by the grace of God in Christ: Which
their faythfull parents also beleev, accordeing to Gods Promise, <hi>I will be
thy God, &amp; the God of thy seed.</hi> Those that perish, (though I desyre, if such
were the will of God, &amp; so could gladly beleev, if the Scriptures taught
it, that all were saved) do perish for that originall guilt, &amp; corruption,
wherein they are conceaved, &amp; born, being <hi>the children of wrath by nature,</hi>
&amp; therein lyable to Gods curse, every way. But for that parents are in a
sorte in their children, &amp; so punished in their punishments, their sins also
may, &amp; do concur, as concauses, or causes with other, of Gods iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
both the Scriptures, &amp; reason teaching, that many causes may
meet together in one effect. Yet must it be here, &amp; alwayes remembred,
that our question is not about the peremptory salvation, or condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any, but about their admission, or not admission into the visible
Church. And straung it is for this man to make it all one, to be saved,
&amp; to be of the visible Church; &amp; to be condemned, &amp; to be out of it,
specially for children; since he will have them all saved, &amp; yet none of
them at all to be of the Church. 2. if he were <hi>assured,</hi> as he sayth, that
we would <hi>confesse, that no parents do confer grace by generation more then others,</hi>
I am assured he shewed the lesse grace, in accuseing vs in another place
agaynst his conscience, to <hi>hould that Christians beget Christians by genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 172</note>
3. Since <hi>all are by nature alike children of wrath,</hi> I would know of
these <hi>free-willers,</hi> how some become the children of God, &amp; beleevers,
&amp; some abyde vnder the wrath of God? To make the thinges, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
which are altogether alike in themselves, vnalike, there must come
something from els where, &amp; that not alike, vnto them both. For ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
let them alone which are alike, or ad alike vnto them both, &amp; they
will remayn alike still It must not then be any vniversall grace alike com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all, which makes them who are alike, to become vnalike one to
another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Helw:</hi> els where, &amp; rightly, <hi>disclaymes all freewill, or power in a mans self
to work out his salvation,</hi> but teacheth, that <hi>this grace, which is his mercy in
Christ, God hath given to all, though all receav it not:</hi> for which he quotes
Phil: 1. 10. 11 Act: 13. 46. Act: 7. 51. Where first he layes a notoriouse
errour, for his foundation, in makeing all, &amp; every person in the world par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of the grace of God in Christ. For they to whom God gives grace in
Christ, must themselves be in Christ: &amp; so all the vnbeleevers, &amp; wicked in
the world should be <hi>in Christ,</hi> which is expresly contrary to the<note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 8. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

So that wicked, &amp; vnregenerate men have neyther power in themselves,
nor in Christ, (in whom they are not) to work out their salvation. They
indeed, who are in Christ by fayth, &amp; have receaved his spirit, are thereby
enabled to work out their salvation: which Phil: 1. 10. 11. proveth: as
the rest also are able &amp; have power to despise, &amp; reiect the grace of God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to condemnation, &amp; this the other two Scriptures Act: 13. 46. &amp; 7.
51. do prove. Which yet a great parte of the wicked in the world do not:
as not haveing so much, as heard of Christ, at least in any competent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
for salvation by him: but shalbe iudged accordeing to the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
written in the creatures, &amp; in their naturall consciences. Agayn he<note place="margin">

speaks contradictoryes in saying, that <hi>all have this grace, or power in Christ,</hi> &amp;
that <hi>God giveth it to all,</hi> &amp; yet confessing, that <hi>all receav it not.</hi> For though
there may be a purpose, will, &amp; offer to give, yet there can be no giveing,
so as the person have the thing, especially that thing, which none can have
agaynst his will, (as none can have grace) except there be also a receaving.
Since then all men are not in Christ, &amp; so not partakers of the grace of God
in him: nor yet, if they were, could a common, vniversall, &amp; equall grace
make them vnequall, who were formerly equall, it followeth that there is a
speciall, &amp; peculiar grace, which God in Christ giveth vnto some, &amp; not to
others: by which they are enabled to vnderstand, &amp; beleev the Gospell, &amp;
to repent: &amp; so by consequence, a speciall, &amp; particular election of those
persons before the world: since <hi>Gods workes are known vnto him of ould:</hi> ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Act. 15. 8</note>
doth he any thing in tyme, which he did not purpose to do before
tyme.</p>
            <p>Lastly since <hi>all</hi> children are <hi>by nature children of,</hi> or subiect to <hi>wrath,</hi> &amp;
which God might in iustice destroy, why should it seem harsh vnto these
men, that he should exequute his iustice vppon some, &amp; shew mercy vppon
others, &amp; save them? If he might in iustice have condemned all, (which
they must needs graunt, if they beleev that <hi>all</hi> are <hi>by nature children of wrath,</hi>
&amp; that God gave his sonne in his mercy, &amp; that it had been no iniustice, if
he had given him for none, no more then he did for the angels that sinned)
will they sue God at the law because he hath not given him effectually for
all, or saved all by him? Will they have him give them account why he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
some into the arm of his mercy, when he might have left all to the hand
of his iustice? If he condemn any, they have their due: those whom he
saveth, he doth it of free mercy, vnto which he is not bound. And is any
mans ey evill, because his is good? or because men know no reason, why
God should rayther chuse, &amp; save some, then others, all deserving condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
will they yeald him to be no more wise, &amp; no more holy then they?
<hi>The depth of the riches both of the wisdom, &amp; knowledg of God, &amp; the vnsearchable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:5430:53"/>
of his <hi>iudgments</hi> appears in this, if in any other thing: as doth also mans
intollerable presumption, who will yeald him no more, then he sees reason
for.</p>
            <p>Now though I have done it fully before, yet will I further clear by the
Scriptures, that, though all children are by nature alike, yet in respect of
the grace of adoption, they are not alike, especially vnto vs, &amp; in that iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which we are to passe vppon them, leaving vnto the L: his secrets.</p>
            <p>And 1. who will say, that <hi>Isaak,</hi> being separated from the infants of the
heathen into the Covenant of Gods love, &amp; so signed, as one of the L: pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
people; &amp; those infants of the world, from whom he was separated,
(for example, the infants of the Sodomites, about his tyme, who were in
Gods feirce wrath destoyed with fyre, &amp; brimstone from heaven) were alike
in Gods acceptance? We have Isaak set forth as a an <hi>example</hi> of Gods

Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> testifyeth for <hi>the Lord,</hi> that he <hi>loved Iakob, &amp; hated Esau,</hi>
(to wit in the decree of his love, &amp; hatred, by iust means to be applyed)
<hi>before they were born:</hi> &amp; this the Apostle Rom: 9. applyeth to the question of

&amp; their posterity, secondarily, &amp; indefinitely, both for persons, &amp;
things And lest any should say, that God thus decreed, in respect of any
thing, which he forsaw they would do, or prove, the Apostle prevents this
shift, &amp; shewes that this was not in respect of <hi>works, but that the purpose of
God might stand, accordeing to election,</hi> v: 11. Besydes had this been primarily
in respect of fayth, or workes forseen, &amp; for that the one would receav the
grace of God, &amp; not the other, the Apostle needed not to have broken out
as he did, speaking of the reason of this his love, or hatred, <hi>But what art thou

have given, namely that the reason why God purposed to love Iakob was
because he forsaw he would receav of himself the grace to be offered, &amp;
beleev: &amp; so to hate Esau for his sin in not receaving the same grace to be
offered as effectually on Gods parte, as vnto his brother.</p>

               <hi>from his mothers wombe:</hi> which to affirm of all children were a vanity not
worthy the refuteing. Lastly, Christ our Saviour <hi>blessed the infants</hi> of the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
being of the Church, when they were <hi>brought vnto him:</hi> but with <hi>the
litle daughter of the Canaanitish woman</hi> he refused to communicate his grace.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:5430:54"/>
accounting her as a dog, or <hi>whelp,</hi> till her mother by her faythfull, &amp; zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
confession, had obteyned for her, interest in <hi>the childrens bread.</hi> And thus
it appeareth (besydes the things formerly layd down) that though all
children be alike in nature, yet are they not all alike in respect of Gods
adoption, especially outwardly manifested, of which we speak.</p>
            <p>He ads, that <hi>every one shall receav salvation, or condemnation accordeing to that,
which he hath done in the flesh,</hi> &amp;c. And for answer, I would know of him, how
any infants (so dying) who have done neyther good, nor evill, shall eyther
be saved, or damned? He must answer, that the Scriptures he brings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
not infants at all, but men of years; &amp; therefore are by him misap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to them, whom they nothing concern.</p>
            <p>And here note, that as the Ch: in heaven, or of glory, &amp; this in earth,
or of grace, is one in substance; this, the begining of that, &amp; that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation
of this, so they, who come into the Ch: here, must enter by the
profession, which themselves make: &amp; they that come into the Church
there, by the profession, which Christ shall make of, &amp; for them, accordeing
to their workes. Math: 24. But as it were absurd to say, that infants can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
enter into the Ch: &amp; state of glory, because Christ cannot professe of
them, that they have <hi>fed the hungry,</hi> &amp;c: so is it as absurd to exclude them
from the Ch: or state of grace, because they cannot themselves make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of fayth, &amp; repentance. This man by one, &amp; the same errour, which
is the perverting, &amp; misapplying of the Scriptures to infants, which are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to men of years, debars them of both.</p>
            <p>These things considered, I hope it will appear to the godly, &amp; wise rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that the things for which he chalengeth me in this (as in other poynts)
are onely <hi>false,</hi> wherein they are by him falsifyed. Yea &amp; if there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
els, two of the three last Scriptnres, which he brings agaynst me, do
vndenyably prove as much as (yea more then) I speak: which is, that
<hi>wicked parents do enwrap theyr children in the same evilles visibly,</hi> (for so I speak)
with themselves, adding in the same place, that <hi>this is not so, as though the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
were without fault, but as being by Adams transgression, &amp; theyr naturall, &amp;
originall corruption children of wrath, &amp; lyable to all Gods curses, which he also takes
occasion by the sins of the parents to exequute vppon the children, in whose punishments
he also punisheth the parents themselves after a sorte.</hi> The former Scripture is Rom:
5. 14. which proves by his own exposition, that all infants are by the sin
of their common father <hi>Adam,</hi> vnder the reign or tyranny of <hi>death:</hi> the
guilt, &amp; contagion of which sin is by their next parents immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
vnto them, by naturall generation. And that God hath vsually pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
the sins even of the next parents both in the death of their children
&amp; otherwise, is so evident in the Scriptures, as that no modest man will
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:5430:54"/>
gaynsay it. Yea even for them of years, that other Scripture which he
brings Exod: 20. 5. teacheth playnly, that <hi>the Lord visits</hi> not onely their
own <hi>sins, who hate him, vppon them,</hi> but the <hi>sins of theyr fathers</hi> also. That in
Ezech: 18. 14. 17. as before I have answered, is not of an infant, but of
<hi>a childe</hi> of years, <hi>forsakeing his fathers sins,</hi> &amp; doeing the contrary: with whom
therefore the L: deales not in the course of his iustice, but of his mercy: &amp;
so is not pertinent to the question in hand: which is about infants, &amp; those
such, as with whom the L: deales in the course, &amp; tenour of his iustice.</p>

remaynders if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Smithes Company after his death.</head>
            <p>IN honour of the trueth, &amp; love of them who vnfeynedly seeke it, and
more specially of the persons, vnder whose names this Confession pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
out, I have thought my self even called to examine, &amp; censure by
the word of God, such errours, as by the light thereof, I do discerne in it,
as also in the other writing annexed vnto it: purposing herein to passe by
(as approving it) what I fynde agreable to the Scriptures, albeit not set
down in so convenient termes: to explane, &amp; clear what may seem doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
&amp; so to evince by the same Scriptures, what I deem contrarie to the
wholesome doctrine of godlines &amp; forme thereof. In all with I desire my
endevours may so far be blessed of God, &amp; accepted of men, as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn
in them his simple trueth, &amp; proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, who entyrely loveth all
that seeke the same trueth in holines.</p>
            <p>And first the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Conclusion with is. <hi>That to vnderstand &amp; conceive of God
in the mynde is not the saving knowledge of God, but to be like to God in his effectes &amp;
propertyes, to be made conformable to his divine &amp; heavenly attributes: this is the
true saveing knowledge of God.</hi> 2. Cor: 3. 18. Math: 5. 48. 2. Pet: 1. 4. <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
we ought to geve all diligence,</hi> standes need of explanation. For takeing
the former parte of the sentence eyther exclusively, that salvation standes
not in these thinges alone, or comparatively, that it standes not therein
principally, according to that forme of speach Rom: 1. 19. 1. Co: 1. 17.
it is true, &amp; the Scriptures brought do prove it: but not so, if the wordes
be taken negatively, as though it stood not in these thinges at all. For †

not onely foreseen, &amp; determined the issues, &amp; events of his workes, but
hath also decreed &amp; purposed the workes themselves before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

to prove that the calling of the Gentiles, of with worke he speakes, is not
a thing newly come into the thoughtes of God, but that with he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,

               <hi>of his will.</hi> And to conceive that God doth any thing in tyme, with he did

wisdom &amp; power: &amp; indeed to deny him to be God, &amp; to make him
finite: in whom there is a chaung wrought, &amp; a begining, &amp; grouth of
counsayls. And this I note for two purposes. First that we may know that
the condemnation of wicked men by God, for sin by their freewill to be
wrought, was purposed of God before the world: it beinge a good worke
of God, &amp; effected by his infinite power for the holynes, &amp; glory of his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice:
2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, that since <hi>every good geveing, &amp; every perfect gift is from above aescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iam. 1. 1</note>
               <hi>from the father of lightes,</hi> &amp; that, to know God, to beleve in him, to love, &amp;
obay him, to <hi>receive</hi> Christ, &amp; the Gospel of salvation offered, are the good
giftes of God, we may also know, that God not onely foresees, that those
graces will be in men, but also fore purposes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eternity himselfe to worke,
&amp; effect them: that if any should tell vs (as many do) that God hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
predestinated such men vnto salvation, as he foresaw would beleve in
Christ, &amp; receive the grace in him offered, we may answer them, that God
foresees indeed those graces in those men, but it is because he fore purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
to work them. He workes them in tyme, because of his free grace he
purposed to worke them before tyme was: without which his purpose, he
could not have foreseen them. And as the Lord in the begining <hi>saw</hi> that the
things <hi>he had made were all good</hi> when he had made them such: so did he
foresee all other good graces in men, because he forepurposed so to worke
&amp; effect them.</p>
            <p>The begining &amp; end of the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Position: viz: <hi>That God is not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,</hi>

except against, as derogatory to the infinitenes of Gods power, &amp; wisdom:
neyther indeed is it senseible to say, that God determyned, what the will of
others would do.</p>
            <p>But what the forethoughtes &amp; purposes of God have been from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity

appear, if we consider, what the worke of his providence is, in, &amp; about it
in tyme, &amp; when it is wrought by men, or Angels.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly God doth permit, &amp; suffer sin, &amp; that both willingly, &amp; wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
not by geving the creature leave to sin, for that is impossible: but by
not putting the effectuall impediments which might hinder sin, as he both
could and lawfully might, if he would. He could, &amp; might (had he so
pleased) not have created men &amp; Angels, with have sinned: or by irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistable
grace, restreynt, or other disappoyntment have prevented their sin.
He therefore permitteth it willingly, &amp; when he could, hinder it, if he
would, otherwise it were no permission, though he did not hinder it: no
more then a man can be said to permit, or suffer the sun to shyne, or
rayne to fall, that hinders them not. And thus sin (though it be alwayes
agaynst the degrees of the commaunding, approueing, &amp; effecting will
of God) yet is not at all, agaynst his permitting will, or agaynst that degree

               <hi>Wherefore</hi> (sayth the Prophet) <hi>doth the liveing man complayn?</hi> he answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<hi>man</hi> complayneth <hi>for his sins?</hi> So that all the sorrowes of this life,<note place="margin">Lam. 3. 39.</note> all the
grevous pangs &amp; passions of the minde: all the turmoylings of the body,
by hunger, thirst, wearysomnes, sicknes, diseases, &amp; so death vnto which
they lead, &amp; which is the extremitie of them all, are for sin, inflicted by God,
&amp; by man borne: which the Scriptures every where testify, &amp; that in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
so well knowen, as in vayn it were to trouble the Reader with note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them down.</p>
            <p>To conclude: the Apostle Rom: 5. 12. 14. speaking of bodily death,
affirmeth expresly that for <hi>sin it reigned even before the law was given by Moses,
&amp; that over them who had not sinned as Adam,</hi> that is actually: &amp; more playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
1. Cor: 15. where speaking of the bodily resurrection, after bodily death,
he teacheth, that <hi>by man &amp; in Adam, all dy:</hi> and that even this bodily <hi>death</hi>
is one of <hi>Christs enemyes to be destroyed</hi> at the <hi>last:</hi> which these men themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves<note place="margin">vers. 22. v. 25.</note>
do also confesse, (though they observe it not) Conclus: 34. and that
<hi>death &amp; the grave are vanquished by Christ</hi> vppon the crosse. And since Christ
suffered nothing but for our sins, if bodily death had not been a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of sin, why should Christ have suffered it, as he did, &amp; that <hi>for our sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
according to the Scriptures?</hi> But it will here be demaunded, if God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned<note place="margin">1. Cor 3.</note>
bodily death vppon <hi>Adam,</hi> the day, he sinned, why he did not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
exequute it? I answer that the threatning was legall, &amp; according
to the course of iustice, and therefore did not hinder but God in mercy
might fynde a remedy, as he also did: &amp; so the L: meaning was no more, but
that in the day wherein <hi>Adam</hi> ate, he should be subject to, &amp; guilty of
death, &amp; the curse of God. In the verie same forme of speach, <hi>Salomon</hi>
threatneth <hi>Shimei, that the day he went out of Ierusalem any whether, he should su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Kng 37.</note>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:5430:58"/>
dy: that is beguilty of death: for neyther did (neyther almost possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
could) he actually kill him that very day. The truth then is, that God
threatned not onely spirituall, and eternall death (which is the consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the former) but bodily also, &amp; with it, all bodily, &amp; temporary ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamityes
leading vnto it. And of this it is most needfull the servantes of
God should be firmely persuaded, &amp; continually myndefull, that in their
sorrowes both of life, &amp; death, they might be lead to the remembrance of
their sins,<note place="margin">1. Kin. 17 28.</note> &amp; for them be humbled vnder the hand of God, of which fruit

            <p>The 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Conclusion: <hi>that Adam being faln did not loose any naturall power,
or facultie, which God created in his soul, because the work of the Devill, which is sinn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,
cannot abolish Gods workes, &amp; Creatures: and therefore being fallen he still retey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
fredom of will.</hi> Gen: 3. 23. 24. is in parte doubtfully set down, and in
parte, vntrue.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Adam</hi> had as well freedom of will after, as before his fall, is, as true,
as that he was a man after, as before. For take away will from a man, &amp; he
ceaseth to be a man: and take away freedom from the will, in that which it
willeth, &amp; it ceaseth to be will. But here is the difference, that the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
power of freewill, which before, was rightly ordered, &amp; disposed one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to good actually, (though changeably) was afterwards corrupted, disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
&amp; clean co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarily disposed, till by supernaturall grace it was rectifyed,
&amp; renued. It is true then, that sin destroyeth not the naturall powers, or
parts of soul, or body, but onely corrupteth, infecteth, &amp; disordereth them:
whence also ariseth in the mynde, ignorance, errour, doubtinges, &amp; vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef;
&amp; in the will, &amp; affections, perversnes, &amp; disorder, with manifold
lusts, to the fullfilling &amp; execution whereof, the bodily instruments are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed.
But the reason brought, <hi>that sin can not abolish Gods work, or Creatures,</hi>
is frivolous: For God suffering sin to enter, suffereth therein an abolition
of his own work &amp; creature. It is confessed, Propos: 11. <hi>That Adam sinning,
dyed the death, &amp; lost innocency, peace of Conscience, &amp; the comfortable presence of God.</hi>
Now was not this spirituall death which Adam dyed, an abolition, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of his spirituall life, innocency, &amp;c: works of God, &amp; his creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res?
the same may be sayd of the whole Image of God. What were these but
workes of God, creatures, &amp; created graces, &amp; endowments, wrought in
him, &amp; bestowed on him by the hand of the Creatour, which sin abolished
both in him, &amp; in his posterity by naturall propagation? as will appear in
the refutation of the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Conclusions: which is,</p>
            <p>That Originall sin is an idle term, &amp; that there is no such thing as men intend by<note place="margin">

            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:5430:58"/>
That Originall sin is an hereditary evill, I shall prove hereafter, (God
assisting) and do answer to the Scriptures; &amp; frist to that in Ezech: <hi>The soul
that sinneth shall dy, the sonne shall not bear the iniquitie of the father.</hi> The Prophet
speakes of such children as forsake sin, &amp; repent, as the whole context
sheweth, which was to reprove the hypocrisy of the Iewes, who complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of injustice from God in punishing them, who were holy, for their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
sins. Besides, all Adams naturall posterity were souls sinning in him:
whom in that his sin, we must not consider as a private person, but as the
common father of mankinde, communicateing with the nature, the sin
(which was not merely personall, but naturall) with his naturall posteritie:
both which are also their own, as on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, the second <hi>Adam Christ,</hi>
&amp; his righteousnes is so communicated with the members of his body, as
every faithfull person may truely say, that both he, &amp; it are his. And hence
was it, that in the punishment of this sin, the earth was cursed; not to him
alone, but to his ensueing posterity: neyther was <hi>Eve</hi> alone to suffer the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
of conception, &amp; childbirth, but all her daughtes after her: neyther
were the <hi>Cherubims</hi> set to keep them two alone, but all their after posterity
out of the garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Eden: &amp; so is it for death it self, &amp; all the passages which
lead vnto it: according to that of the Apostle, <hi>as by one man sin entered into the
world &amp; death by sin, even so death went over all men, in whom all have sinned.</hi>

earthly things (for which our naturall pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts trayn vs vp, &amp; correct vs) &amp; as
God is our spirituall Mayster, &amp; guide, to the meaning may well be, that if

soul to be created immediately, &amp; infused, do not onely hold <hi>Originall sin,</hi>
but also shew how they conceiv it to be propogated, it is but presumption in
these men (<hi>without answering what others so ordinary bring to the contrary</hi>) thus to
conclude, that because the soul is thus immediately created, therefore there
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s no originall sin. But as I see small reason to persuade me, that the dead
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ody, before the soul be vnited with it, can be the proper subject of sin,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:5430:59"/>
or meanes to traduce it, or indeed any way sinfull, more then after it be
separated from the soul: and lesse reason, that the same body can infect the
soul, being of spirituall nature, with any contagion of sin, though it might
hinder, or fayl it, in some outward exequution; so seemeth it to me much
more agreable vnto truth, that the <hi>blessing of God to encrease, &amp; multiply</hi> did as
well geve vertue, &amp; power vnto mankynde, as vnto other kyndes, to beget,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

&amp; generate their like: &amp; not onely a dead carkas, &amp; livelesse body, inferiour
to the issue of bruit beasts, which do procreate their kynde, both body &amp;
soule, or life. Neyther see I how <hi>Adam</hi> could be sayd to have <hi>begotten a sonne
after his own Image,</hi> Gen: 5. 3. opposed to Gods <hi>Image</hi> v: 1. that is, sinfull,
and corrupt, if he onely had begotten the body, &amp; not the soul also: which
I think he did, even the whole, the whole; after a maner convenyent to ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nature. And if these two Positions can not stand together, that God
createth the soul immediately: &amp; that there is <hi>originall sin:</hi> where these men
conclude, that there is therefore no <hi>originall sin,</hi> I conclude contrary wise,
that therefore the soul is not immediately created, nor the place to the
Heb: so to be expounded; since the proufes for <hi>originall sin</hi> are so certayn, &amp;
evident.</p>
            <p>And that it is no idle term, (as is imagined) but a miserable calamity
possessing all the posterity of <hi>Adam</hi> by naturall generation, &amp; ever by them
to be bewayled, &amp; purged out, I hope playnly to prove, &amp; with all, that by
reason of it they are naturally vnable to chuse, or will any thing spiritually
good, or truely pleasing God.</p>
            <p>And for this, (remembring what I have formerly noted from Rom: 4.

asked why doth God then require it should be, or punish men where it is
not? it is easely answered, that this inability cometh by mans own defalt.
God made all men in Adam able to keep the law: &amp; the obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is due debt vnto God: now the inability of the debtour, &amp; his heyrs
(especially by their own default) is no sufficient discharge of the debt
vnto the Creditour who lent it: so neyther doth mans inability preiudice
the Lords right, but that he may in the course of iustice, require that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to his holy law, vnto which by creation he enabled mankynde.
And for fayth in Christ, &amp; repentance, (which are the summe of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell)
God doth not requyre them, as due from the creature, to a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
by order of iustice, but as conditions convenient vnto man, <hi>dead in
sin</hi> &amp; misery, if he wilbe made partakers of that <hi>Life &amp; light come into the</hi>

their impenitency, &amp; vnbeleif, as doth the death of a wounded
man vppon his wilfull contempt of the sovereign salve offered for his

            <p>To conclude then, they of whom God requires this fayth, repentance,
&amp; obedience, eyther yeald it him answerably, or not? If not; as they can
not, so their own hearts &amp; consciences will witnes agaynst them, that they
will not; but do on the contrary willingly withstand, &amp; with draw from the

though not in respect of the nature, or being, yet of the integrity, &amp; holy

to beleve, &amp; continually to bear in mynde, that they may alwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayle
their sins, &amp; nourish in themselves the hatred of that, which God so
hateth, &amp; for it, the creature; &amp; for which he punisheth it with most horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
curses, &amp; punishments for ever.</p>
            <p>And yet even in the very exequution of his most fearefull vengeance
vppon the reprobate, men, &amp; Angels, he retayneth the generall love of a

hath from eternity decreed the condemnation of some for sin, forepurpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by him to be suffered, &amp; so foreseene to be wrought by man, is evident,
both by the word of God, as <hi>Iude</hi> testifyeth of <hi>of certain worked men</hi> that they
were <hi>ordeyned of ould to condemnation:</hi> &amp; God is sayd to have <hi>hated Esau, before

&amp; forepurposed to be suffered: and also by the worke of God, in

               <hi>all
Gods workes are knowen vnto him from the begining of the world:</hi> and Gods very

thing before tyme, &amp; from eternity.</p>
            <p>And for Gods forsakeing, or leaving a man vnto himself; as he vsually
doth it, for a punishment of former sins, so did he thus leave <hi>Adam</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

out any such respect. He could (if he would) eyther have kept him from
being tempted, or have delivered him out of his temptation, by his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
power, &amp; grace, &amp; the irresistable efficacy of his spirit: but God,
for the tryall of the will of man, &amp; to manifest how weak the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

            <p>So also could God by his alsufficient power (if such his good will were)

            <p>The Scriptures Isa: 5. 4. Ezech: 18. 23. &amp; 33. Luk: 13. 6. 9. speak of
the Lords dealing with his Church in the outward ministery of the word,
&amp; other common motives to repentance: as is also further manifest
Math: 21. 33. 34. &amp;c. &amp; so are neyther to be vnderstood (as here they
are) of the Lords dealing with all men, nor at all of the vttermost effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

Lastly touching the similitude brought from a naturall father, I must
vse two limitations: the former that a naturall <hi>father</hi> would <hi>not suffer his
sonne to come to the gallowes,</hi> or desert thereof, if he could possibly in his vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
power hinder it: he would rather wish not to beget him at all, or
that he might never be born: but so is it notwith God, who both willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
produceth, &amp; preserveth the creature, whom he purposeth to destroy
for sin, which he foreseeth the creature will work, &amp; suffereth him to fall
into, though he could (would he vse the vtmost of his power,) hinder
both the sin, &amp; punishment. And 2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, the hanging of the childe is no way
to the honour of his naturall father, but to his greif, &amp; shame every way:<note place="margin">Prov. 10. 20.</note>
but on the contrary, the destruction of the wicked for their sins is to the
great glorie of the iustice of the Creatour, which then it should not be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifyed,
better all men &amp; Angels perish.</p>
            <p>Touching this Conclusion, <hi>God hath</hi> not onely <hi>determined before the</hi>

               <hi>world, that the way of salvation shalbe by Christ: and foreseen who would follow it,</hi>
(as they teach) but hath also determined in particular, whom he would

               <hi>drew</hi> them, who <hi>come</hi> vnto it. And this he doth first by sending his
<hi>Gospell of Salvation</hi> to such, as are his (in his decre) Act: 13. 47. 48. &amp; Ch:
18. 9. 10. then by <hi>opening the heart</hi> (as of <hi>Ldia</hi>) <hi>to listen vnto it.</hi> Act: 16. 4.
&amp; so workeing in their hearts by his spirit to beleev &amp; obay it, he perfecteth
their happynes in glory. Rom: 8. 30. 31. So that God foreseeth that such,
&amp; such will beleve, &amp; chuse the way of life, because he forepurposeth to give
them this grace, knowledg, will, &amp; power to beleve, &amp; to chuse the good
way: &amp; all this of his <hi>good</hi> &amp; gracious <hi>pleasure</hi> towards them, <hi>on whom he will
shew mercie.</hi> And this the places brought by those men. Eph: 1. 4. 5. 2. Tim:
1. 9. do most directly prove: so also doth Iude, 4. expressely teach, <hi>not that
God foresaw who would follow the way of infidelity &amp; impenitency,</hi> for which they
alleadg it: but whom God hath <hi>foreordeyned to condemnation</hi> for their <hi>wickednes.</hi>
The Scriptures, then do no where prove any such idle foresight in God, as
is imagined by these men, &amp; others: as if God were in truth, but a progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticator,
&amp; reader of mens destinyes: who could onely fortell, what should
be done by, &amp; become of these, &amp; these men.</p>
            <p>Touching 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Conclus: That <hi>as God created all men according to his Image, so
hath he redemed, all that fall by actuall sin, to the same end: &amp; that God in his redemption</hi>
               <note place="margin">Concl. 27, 28,</note>
               <hi>hath not swarved from his mercy, which he manifested in his creation:</hi> &amp; that part of
Concl: 28. where it is sayd, <hi>that God in his love to his enemies gave Christ to dy, &amp;
so bought them that deny him;</hi> sundry things are to be observed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:5430:63"/>
And first, that God did not manifest any mercy, but onely goodnes, in<note place="margin">ANS.</note>
the creation: for mercy presupposeth misery in him towards whom it is
shewed. Secondly it is no swarving at all of Gods goodnes, if he extend
not the grace of redemption to as many as he did the grace of creation:
for then Christ should have redeemed the <hi>Angels,</hi> (who were partakers of
a greater grace of creation:) which he <hi>in no sorte did.</hi> And if God, did in<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 16.</note>
iustice paste by the <hi>Angels</hi> that sinned: might he not in the same iustice
have passed by men also? And if he might in iustice have passed by all,
(where he could not in iustice, nor possibly create one man vnjust) as no
man will deny but our redemption by Christ, was a worke of Gods <hi>mercy,</hi>
&amp; not of his iustice) is it injustice in him to passe by some, who also on
their parte <hi>take pleasure in vntighteousnes,</hi> &amp; to continue in their estate of
impenitency, &amp; vnbeleef, <hi>loveing darkenes more then light, because then workes
are evill?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the Scriptures brought: first, that of Ioh: 1. 3. shewes that by
Christ, to wit, as God, <hi>all things were made,</hi> or created, which is nothing to
the present matter. And where vers: 16. he sayth, <hi>of his fulnes we all have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
&amp; grace, for grace,</hi> he speaks not of all men, but onely of all those, who
<hi>receive</hi> Christ, &amp; <hi>beleve in his name,</hi> as <hi>vers:</hi> 12. &amp; <hi>are borne of God. vers:</hi> 13. So
2. Cor: 5. 19. by the <hi>world</hi> which <hi>God reconciled to himself in Christ,</hi> are not
meant all that actually sin, but such as <hi>by the word of reconciliation preached
vnto them, &amp; beleeved by them, have their sins forgeven them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>all men</hi> 1. Tim: 2. 6. is meant all sortes of men, as well Kings, &amp; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates,
whom, because they were for the present, persequutours of the
Saints, it seems some thought they were not to pray for, as for others, <hi>vers.</hi>
1. he exhorts to pray for all men: &amp; <hi>vers:</hi> 2. he shewes his meaning to be for
all sorts, as <hi>Kings, &amp; them in autority vnder them,</hi> whom <hi>vers:</hi> 4. he sayth <hi>God
would have saved</hi> as well as others: as for whom <hi>Christ dyed,</hi> &amp; so redeemed
them, as well as others. Of Ezech: 33. I have spoken formerly, as also of
Ioh: 16.</p>
            <p>By the enemyes spoken of Rom: 5. 10. are meant onely such, as are in
tyme actually reconciled to God, &amp; saved: as appears plainly, if the place
be well considered; whom God is sayd to love, &amp; that not which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
love of a Creatour towards the creature, but with the love of a Rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
in respect of his decre of love, (&amp; not of the actuall application of it)
as he is sayd to have <hi>loved Iacob, &amp; hated Esau, before they were borne:</hi> Actually
he did not hate, or love the one, or other, neyther doth or can God love
actually wicked men so remayning Psal: 5. 5. 6. Lastly Christ is sayd. 2. Pet:
2. 2. to have <hi>bought those deceaveers,</hi> in respect of the former profession of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes,
which they made: by which in the judgement of Charity, they were
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:5430:63"/>
so esteemed: as appears evidently in <hi>Iude,</hi> who speaking of the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
sayth <hi>vers:</hi> 3. they were <hi>vngodly men crept</hi> into the Church.</p>
            <p>Now for Christs Redemption, it must be knowen, that the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Redemption,</hi> vsed in the Scriptures, is borrowed from the custome
of freeing prisoners, taken in war, from death, or bondage, by paying a
iust price, or ransom for them. And so to affirm that <hi>Christ hath reaeemed all
that fall by actuall sin,</hi> is to affirm, that he hath payed a price to the iustice of
God, for all such, &amp; freed them from the guilt, &amp; bondage of sin, &amp; Sathan:
&amp; so consequently, that all who have sinned actually, have fayth, &amp; repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
without which they cannot have forgivenes of sins, nor freedom
from the bondage, &amp; guilt thereof. It is confessed (&amp; truely) Conclus: 35.
<hi>That the efficacy of Christs death is onely derived to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which mortify their sins,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. Act. 10 43. 2. Cor. 17.</note>
and therein directly graunted that Christs death is not effectuall for all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
and that it is in it self sufficient for all, (being the death of him that was
<hi>God,</hi> Act: 20. 28.) we acknowledg: as also that no particular person (not
haveing sinned agaynst the holy Ghost) can be excluded eyther by himself,
or vs, from the number of them, for whom Christ dyed. It were agaynst
fayth to pray that God would save all the men, that are, &amp; shalbe in the
world to the end thereof: but love teacheth me to pray for any person par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
vppon occasion.</p>
            <p>Now for that these men alledg <hi>Rom:</hi> 5. to prove that <hi>Christ redeemed all
who sin actually:</hi> and <hi>M<hi rend="sub">r</hi> Helw:</hi> &amp; others much insist vppon the same place,
to prove that he redeemed all, who sinne in <hi>Adam:</hi> and so would have <hi>a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will</hi>
though not by nature, which they dislike, but by grace given to all: as
if Turkes, and Pagans, and all the wicked world were in <hi>Christ,</hi> and so free
from <hi>condemnation</hi> Rom: 8. 1. and they who had <hi>crucifyed the flesh and the
lusts thereof:</hi> Gal: 4. 24. which they must be, before they can be partakers
of the grace of God through Christ, or of any frewill through him: <hi>Ioh:</hi> 15.
5. I will playnly, and briefly prove (the Lord assisting me) that the Apostle
intends neyther the one, nor the other, but the contrary.</p>
            <p>The Apostles meaning there is to shew the priviledges of the faythfull:
that notwithstanding all their afflictions, <hi>They have peace with God: accesse</hi>

               <hi>that abundance of grace, &amp; gift of righteouses, should reigne in lyse by Iesus
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:5430:64"/>
Christ:</hi> and in the last place, that, <hi>that Grace should reign through righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
vnto eternall lyfe by Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi> Which grace he also amplyfieth,
and confirmeth by comparing <hi>Christ</hi> as the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
               <hi>Adam,</hi> with the first <hi>Adam:</hi>
teaching that both the one, &amp; the other did, &amp; do propagate to all theirs,
what theirs was: the first <hi>Adam,</hi> sin, &amp; death to all comeing of him natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally:
the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
               <hi>Adam Christ,</hi> righteousnes, &amp; eternall lyfe to all that are in
him spiritually, &amp; for whom he died. The meaning the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Apostle seems
vnto me plainly to be this: that for whomsoever <hi>Christ</hi> did indeed and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
dy, they should certainly be saved: &amp; that whomsoever God did
reconcile by his death, he will much more save by his lyfe, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their afflictions &amp; all other the enemyes of their salvation: &amp; so to be
the same in effect with that which the same Apostle hath Rom: 8. 28.
that <hi>all things shall worke together for the best vnto them that love God even vnto
them who are called of purpose:</hi> &amp; that <hi>those who are predestmate are also called, &amp;
iustifyed, &amp; glorifyed:</hi> &amp; vers: 32. 39. that to them, <hi>for whom God hath not spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to give his sonne, he will give all things with him:</hi> and so victorie over sin, &amp;
Sathan, &amp; their own flesh, with all temptations, so as <hi>nothing shall separate
them from the love of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From Rom: 5 then, may be more truely (&amp; I am persuaded vndeniably.)
concluded, these two things. 1. that <hi>Christ</hi> did not effectually dy for, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
by his death all men in particular: for then all should be saved by
his lyfe: &amp; 2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, that whomsoever he so died for, &amp; effectually reconciled,

            <p>The Apostles meaning also 1. Ioh. 2. 27. is greatly mistaken: which is
not that the <hi>anoynting,</hi> or spirit which they <hi>had received,</hi> set them above the
Scriptures, and all outward teachings: but that he needed not teach them,
as ignorant of these things, which by that <hi>anoynting,</hi> or spirit, were sealed
vp vnto their Consciences: as where Paul tels the Thessal: <hi>that he needs not
wryte vnto them of brotherly love, because they were taught of God one to love another,</hi>

                  </gap>. Thes. 4. 9.</note>
his meaning onely is, that they were not without that grace, but did prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
it: yet doth he in the very same place vers: 10. <hi>exhort</hi> them <hi>to encrease more
&amp; more.</hi> So doth Iohn also write that his Epistle to teach and admonish
those <hi>anoynted ones</hi> to beware of false <hi>Prophets</hi> &amp; Anti-Christs of whom they
were in danger, as of other evilles.</p>
            <p>Two other Scriptures are intended, but so misput, as I can not fynde
which they are, and therefore passe them by; being also assured they can
geve no confirmation to this vayn presumption deceaving vnder a shew of
Angelicall perfection.</p>
            <p>The reason to prove the Scriptures vnnecessarie from the inward witnes
of <hi>the Father, Word, &amp; Spirit,</hi> is verie deceitfull: since the inward grace doth
not abolish but establish the outward meanes, by which it is wrought, &amp;
encreased. David had this witnesse in his heart (being a man <hi>after Gods

which these men would also have vs think <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Smith</hi> had attayned, a litle

of sin, <hi>casting of the ould man,</hi> and <hi>putting on the new man,</hi> and to grow

invisible Church, and the same person makeing holy profession thereof
outwardly, in the order left by Christ, a member of the visible Church:
and the whole man of both, (and not the soul of the one, and bodie of

of God: and of the visible in respect of the outward manifestation before
men, ariseing from the former. The Scriptures brought which are Revel:
1. 10. with Chap. 21. 2. 13. 27. speak of the visible Church onely, &amp; so
are impertinent.</p>
            <p>The particulars which I deem amisse Conclus: 68. I have noted in the<note place="margin">68 Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clus.</note>
56. Proposition: &amp; refer the reader thither.</p>
            <p>That the Sacraments have the same use that the word hath, &amp; teach to the
ey of them that vnderstand, as the word teacheth the eares of them, that have<note place="margin">74 Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clus.</note>

            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:5430:69"/>
For 1. the word serves to convert men Psal: 19. 7. and is to be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
to vnconverted, and prophane persons: which vse the Sacraments
have not, nor must be administred to such. 2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, if this (applyed to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants)
were true, then should not circumcision have been administred to
the Israelitish Infants, who had not eares to hear. Yet is the ground good
being rightly layd (vnto which that also Conclus: 73. is agreable, though
the Scriptures be brought hand over head to confirm it.) For as God by
promising Abraham that he would be his <hi>God, &amp; the God of his seed,</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to his ear, so by giveing him, &amp; his seed circumcision, he preached to
his ey, for the ratification of the same promise. And so is it now with vs,
who have received grace to be of the fayth of Abraham, haveing the same
covenant, promise, or Gospell preached by doctrine to our ear, &amp; confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by baptism to our ey, for ourselves, &amp; our seed.</p>

onely of the Iewish ordinances, which are abolished, and not of the Church
ordinances now. 2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, If it be meant that all succession is from heaven im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
it is a fantasy: if mediately, then must the outward succession
(to wit of Ministerie) be in the outward Church, whereof it is an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
And whereas the Church, and new creature are opposed, it is amisse,
since the Church is to consist onely of such men as are in their measure

Where it is called <hi>an ordinance of God,</hi> it is confessed good, for <hi>every creature of
God is good,</hi> and all his ordinances are his creatures; and so, many things are
ascribed to the office of Magistrates in this, and the other Conclus: about it,
which prove it to be good, and lawfull in it self: but where it is made <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missive,</hi>
it is condemned as evill: since onely evill is permitted, or suffered
of God.</p>
            <p>And where it is objected Prop: 85. <hi>that Christs Disciples must love their
enemyes, &amp; not kill them: pray for them, &amp; not punish them,</hi> &amp;c. I answer, that
the godly Magistrate may do both. Doth not God punish with tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

vppon earth, be mynded as God herein? When the godly Kings, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours

the people for their transgressions, were they commaunded not to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:5430:69"/>
love them, &amp; not to pray for them? When <hi>Mr Smith</hi> in his sicknes, tels his
children (as it is in the end of the booke) <hi>that if he live, he must correct, &amp; be at
them, not because he hates them, but because he loves them, as God did him,</hi> doth he
not answer the objection, &amp; shew the those two may well stand together,
as in the private father, so in the publique father, the Magistrate? Where
agayn it is sayd that <hi>Christs Disciples must with him be persequuted, afflicted, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered</hi>
&amp;c: <hi>&amp; that by the authority of the Magistrate.</hi> I do answer; that those
things are not simply necessary for all persons, but as God calles men
vnto them. And 2. both the Scriptures, &amp; other Stories do testify that
godly Magistrates themselves, have suffered these thinges for the Lord &amp;
his trueth, &amp; for well doeing: sometymes the inferiour Magistrates, by the
Superiour, &amp; sometymes the Governours by the people vnder them. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances<note place="margin">Ex. 3. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the Church for weldoeing? Surely even as lawfully as to be receaved in

               <note place="margin">Ioh. 7. 82 Tit. 1. 5</note>
               <hi>Christ is the King, &amp; lawgiver of the Church &amp; conscience.</hi> Iam: 4. 12. I answer
that this indeed proves that he may alter, devise, or establish nothing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
otherwise then Christ hath appoynted, but proves not, that he may
not vse his lawfull power lawfully for the furtherance of Christs Kingdom
&amp; lawes. The Prophet Isaias speakeing of the Church of Christ, foretels

This <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Helwisse</hi> frivolously interprets <hi>of their spirituall weapons:</hi> which
are no other then the spirituall weapons of all other Christians: besides
that it is contrary to the clear meaning of the H Ghost, which is, that these
kings should first vse their civile power for the <hi>beast,</hi> &amp; <hi>whore,</hi> &amp; after agaynst
them to their destruction.</p>
            <p>To conclude this poynt then: both these men, &amp; <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Helw:</hi> especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in his whole discourse about this matter labours of the common disease
of all ignorant me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in pleading agaynst the vse of the ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce by the abuse:
which standes eyther in prohibiting any thing which God hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
or in commanding any thing which he hath forbidden: as indeed he
hath whatsoever he hath not commanded, eyther expresly, or by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
in his religion, &amp; worship.</p>
            <p>Lastly it is not truely affirmed <hi>that Christians must iudg all their causes of
difference amongst themselves, &amp; may not go to law before Magistrates, nor vse an oath.</hi>
For the first head is alleadged 1. Cor: 6. 1. 7.</p>
            <p>I answer that Paul doth not there simply forbid the Saints goeing to
law, but goeing to law vnder Infidels: &amp; that wronging, &amp; oppressing one
another, when they should rather have suffered wrong: or at least have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
some able men for arbitratours, to have ended things. Which
course when doubtfull differences of weight do arise, the members of the
Church ought to take, &amp; so to rest in their equall determinations. But what
if none of the Chuch can sufficiently iudg of the things: or setle them in
peace for after posteritie? (as it may well come to passe in cases of inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
especially) the matter may &amp; ought quietly, &amp; peaceably to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the Magistrates determination. His office being of God, Gods
people may have the sanctifyed vse of any lawfull worke thereof.</p>
            <p>Touching an oath. It is not the meaning of our Saviour. Math: 5. 34.
37. nor of his Apostle Iam: 5. 12. absolutely to forbid the vse of it: &amp; to
restreyn all speach to <hi>yea &amp; nay:</hi> for then Christ had broken his own rule in
his so vsuall asseverations of <hi>verily, verily:</hi> or <hi>amen,</hi> which are more then
bare, <hi>yea,</hi> &amp; <hi>nay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The meaning of Christ was to free the law from the corrupt glosse of

man eyther more holy, or better to be trusted then he, that an oath should

truth, &amp; to avenge the contrary) is alwayes of vse: which the Apostle direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
teacheth Heb: 6. 10. <hi>An oath for confirmation is vnto men an end of all doubts.</hi>
The lawfulnes whereof the same Apos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that he <hi>lied not</hi> vnto them.</p>
            <p>And thus much for this <hi>Conclusion,</hi> wherewith I will also conclude the
book: entreating of God through Christ, that all who seek his trueth in
sincerity, that in the knowledg, &amp; obedience thereof, they may please him,
may both fynde the same, &amp; with myself, mercy &amp; forgivenes in all our
<hi>errours,</hi> &amp; faylinges of this life, which how many they are <hi>no man knoweth,</hi>
nor can know, whilst he <hi>knoweth but in parte,</hi> as all men but do, whilst they
live in this world, <hi>&amp; are absent from the Lord.</hi>
