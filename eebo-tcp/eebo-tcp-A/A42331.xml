         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

His frequent exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of fasting is witnessed in two mystical Psalms understood of Christ, Psal. 69. v. 9, 10. <hi>The zeal of thy house hath even eaten me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I wept and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened my self with fasting, and that was turned to my reproach.</hi> And Psal. 109. v. 23, 24. <hi>My knees are weak through fasting, my flesh is dryed up for want of fatness; I became also a reproach unto them.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of which verses and the ancient Fathers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries on those Psalms are our warrant that <hi>David</hi> in spirit spake them of Christ.

            <p>3. The time of greater actual assistances from God is not alway the time of greater habitual strength of grace inherent. These Disciples were rendred safe by the presence of the Bridegroom, but were not yet other then in great part old garments and bottles <note n="b" place="margin">

then to be required or expected of them, must not be understood to speak principally and in the first place, much less only, of extraordinary, emergent and occasional fasts; but necessarily of set, solemn, and recurring fasts, to which as then he did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse them for the while of his presence with them; but which, when the Bridegroom should be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them, should be justly expected of them.</p>
            <p>4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> For that our Lord Christ speaking of those, with whom he promised to be unto the end of the world, <hi>viz.</hi> in themselves, and in those who should believe in him through their word, and of fasts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to a publick universal cause, the taking away of the Bridegroom in his Passion; therefore the Lord spake also of a solemn publick fast, upon one cause or subject never to be repeated; but the duty to continue all years to the end of the world, till the Bridegroom should return unto his Spouse and take her into his Fathers house. Now impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible it is, that any such should be publick and to continue, and relate to any such fixed and universal cause, but this of our Lords Passion, through per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ages to be remembred by publick memorial fasts, which cannot be continual, nor accidental; therefore by set, solemn, and recurring fasts; so as we have seen that cause, the memory of our Lords Passion to have given foundation universally to all ages and parts of the Catholick Church, both for her weekly stations (<hi>Stationum semijejunia</hi>) on the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of the week till 3. a clock; and of her annual, Paschal or Lenten Fast about the time of her Lords Crucifixion. And whereas our Lord hath said of his Disciples, which are or shall be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101417:17"/>
such indeed, that in those daies, (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>they shall and will fast:</hi> what the Church doth and hath done ever since, that foretold by the Lord (when he said <hi>they would then fast</hi>) must needs be the best interpretation of what the Lord said they would do. He said it: <hi>in those daies they will fast;</hi> hath the Church done what he said they would? or will any say nay? Learn we the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches daies on which she ever since hath, and doth, and professeth that she will fast, and we must needs have the true meaning of this prediction, in these words of her Lord, who could not be deceived, <hi>In those daies they will fast.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> Be therefore my fifth reason this following, Christians will not fast (none can expect they will) on any publick, set, solemn daies of fasting, (which was the thing here call'd for by the Scribes from their own alledged example, and that of <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Disciples also) except they do agree upon such daies; But if every man was to be left to understand what he please by these words, <hi>The daies when the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom shall be taken from them,</hi> (as <hi>Aerius</hi> had his sense of them, and <hi>Iovinian</hi> his, and <hi>Vigilantius</hi> his, and none bound to the Churches sense of them) we should have no means left us possibly to agree, and so to meet on any daies at all by force of these words, or any other one universal cause; and so should we never meet in any publick solemn fast at all; no, not for so publick fix'd a cause as the taking away of the Bridegroom once for the sins of the whole world.</p>
            <p>The Churches teaching then her sense of her Lords words, by her rules, comments, and practise, must silence these men, as her Lords prediction of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101417:17"/>
her practise did silence the Scribes and Pharisees, yea and some other better meaning Disciples (St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s) also, cunningly drawn in (as is usual) by the enemies of the Lord, and his Church, to joyn in expostulations, cavils, and quarrels against them.</p>

            <p>2. That the Church hath done this, hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd this Paschal-fast, as from the Apostles, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their practise upon instruction Evangelical; &amp; particularly also upon this Text now before us, <hi>The time shall come when,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And then</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>1. For the Churches visible practise from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles times, if our Brethren shall say, Shew us express example written in the following Scriptures, which may interpret this text so; or we are at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for the sense, and practise: they must be told, what they cannot but freshly remember, that so said the Brethren the Anabaptists: one express exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of baptizing Infants after that Sanction, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 5. and Commission, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. <hi>v.</hi> 19. whereby to interpret such Sanction and Commission. An express command (as the Church thinks) to <hi>baptize all Nations,</hi> would not hold them. So said the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> for their no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> necessity of baptizing at all <hi>in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</hi> Shew us one example in all the following Scriptures, Acts, and Letters of the Apostles of that form observed. A direct command (as we would think it) could not bind up their liberty of interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101417:18"/>
it otherwise. The history of all the following ages of the Church after the Apostles is little to them compared with the word of God, in their own sense. All those following were but men, and these (in their giving out the sense of the Scripture) are more!</p>
            <p>For our parts, we finding the Bridegroom, the Lord himself, thus referring us to the practise of his known Disciples, the children of the Bride-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; <hi>In those daies they will fast,</hi> (not only they will teach on what daies men should fast:) and the Bride her self, whose cause is most concern'd in it, declaring to us her practise, and assuring us she had received that her Practise from those friends of her Bridegroom, and children of his marriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, the Apostles; that Bride also being, as we know, the Queen standing at his right hand, the Mother of us all; whose authority is above all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, (and yet each mother's is from God over her children;) we I say joyning in obedience with all those who have this Church for their Mother, are assured that we obey, and have God for our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and his Spirit not to leave her (in her leading us) without certain conduct into all truth of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary faith, or bounden practise, that is, certainly to secure her from every of the gates of Hell, never to prevail against her.</p>
            <p>We have the Church our Mother to hear: and as to the point, we would hear of: <hi>Nos habemus talem consuetudinem, &amp; Ecclesiae Dei:</hi> 
               <q>We have such a custome, and so have, and had the Churches of God.</q> If any man against all this list to be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, we still have learnt not to let fall our appeal to the customes of the Churches of God. As
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101417:19"/>
St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath shewn us by his example, that against contradictors 'tis best to do, 1 <hi>Cor. c.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 15, 16. Let our Brethren therefore either shew some Church or age before their own of yesterday, where this was not the custome of Christian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; or else devise some other sense also of that Text of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> concerning the Churches customes; or let them acknowledge it an Apostolical note of contentious persons, (to whom he elsewhere saith belongs <hi>tribulation and wrath, Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>v<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 8, 9.) to oppose their interpretations and exceptions against such custome of the Churches of God, as this Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Fast, or Fast of Lent, in remembrance of the taking away of the Bridegroom of the Church, can manifest it self to be.</p>
            <p>Now, albeit my premises neither contain, nor need to contain, more then that the Church in all ages observed this Fast of Lent, called <hi>Paschale je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junium,</hi> and that from the Apostles themselves, their own Evangelical Instructions of her, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this Text also which she received from their Evangelizing: yet in as much as I have occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally before mentioned, that the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves also observed this Paschal Fast, I shall not content my self to bring witness that they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it to the following times, or only that it was practised in their own times, (of which I shall speak in my 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> testimony) but also toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that themselves did practise and observe it. For the proof whereof; although it might be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to argue from their delivering it to the Church, that therefore they observed it themselves; (for surely they laid not on the Church any bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of precept which themselves with one of their

fingers would not touch, or not teach perfectly by their example first:) <note n="a" place="margin">For as it was said of the Lord, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>all things which Iesus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan both to do and to teach,</hi> (as he did in the exercise of fasting) so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the Apostle saith of himself and the other Apostles, when he did warn the <hi>Philippians</hi> of some that walked so, as that their God was their belly, he saith, <hi>be ye followers of us, and mark them that walk so, as you have us for an example,</hi> c. 3. 17, 19. &amp; 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>that we might give our selves to you for an example to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us.</hi> Yea these very disciples of the Pharisees, and of <hi>Iohn,</hi> not only alledged first their own example of frequent fastings, but even S. <hi>Mark</hi> saith of them, c. 2. 18. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>they were at this time fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> when they came to the Lord and made this exception to his Disciples, for their not so fasting.</note> Yet my argument for it shall be, not any logical collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but a direct testimonial asseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; premising only first: That it is undeniably certain (from the instance which I have toucht before concerning <hi>Baptizing in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost</hi>) that something the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles themselves did most certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do, and constantly (as well as all ages of the Church after them;) of which yet, besides the first commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion (which is not practise,) no one example of any of the Apostles practise at any time is recorded in all the N. T. and yet was it done (we are most sure) by every Apostle, and constantly. This premised, I think it sufficient to produce other Ecclesiastical unquestioned record to prove the paschal fast was observed by them: and I alledge the witness not of any single Father only (though written by one pen,) but of the Church it self within the <hi>first</hi> century of years, or age, after the departure of the last of these honourable children of the Bride-chamber, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apostle and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist; who died in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> year of <hi>Trajan,</hi> and the Churches Testimony by me to be produced, stands recorded by <hi>TERTULLIAN,</hi> who lived within 100. years of the Apostle S. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s departure: the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches witness by <hi>Tertullian</hi> recorded against Himself and his fellow Montanists, in whose behalf He so

Considera: Quadrage sima totis praeter Sabbatum &amp; Dominicam jejunatur diebus.</hi>

daies, except Saturday, and the Lords day.</q> Now of this Fast of Lent, he saith in his 23. Sermon, <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus Iesus Christus hunc eundem numerum jejunii con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secravit.</hi>—And Sermon the 36. <hi>Hunc quadragina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium numerum non ab hominibus constitutum, sed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitùs consecratum—haec autem non tam sacerdotum praecepta, quam Dei sunt.</hi> And in Sermon the 25. <hi>Dominus enim Diabolum posteaquam</hi> 40. <hi>dies jejunavit, evicit; non quod non &amp; ante jejunia eum vincere po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuisset, sed ut ostenderet nobis tunc nos Diaboli posse esse victores, cum</hi> 40. <hi>dies victores jejunando desideriorum carnalium fuissemus.—Non enim, fratres, leve pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum est sidelibus indictam Quadragesimam &amp; jejunia con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrata ventris voracitate dissolvere; scriptum est, Qui dicit se in Christo manere debet, sicut ille ambulavit, &amp; ipse ambulare—Ille qui peccatum non habebat, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragesimam jejunavit: tu non vis Quadragesimam jeju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare, qui peccas? ille inquam peccatum non habebat, sed pro nostris jejunavit peccatis.</hi> 
               <q>The Lord Jesus Christ hath consecrated this same number of lasting—This Quadragesimal number not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted of men, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

For the Lord after he had fasted 40. daies overcame the Devil, not but that he could have overcome him also before [or without] fastings: but that he might shew unto us, that then we can overcome the devil, when by forty days we have been through fasting victors over our carnal desires—For neither, O brethren, is it a little fault to break by greediness of the belly, the Lent indicted to Believers,—the consecrated fasts.</q> It is written, <hi>He that saith he abides in Christ, ought himself also so to</hi>

Serm. which is on the day of Pentecost, (a Sermon which all agree to be his, or <hi>Maximus Episcopus Taurinensis</hi>'s, and the odds is little which it be, for that either of their authorities is great enough.) <hi>Sic enim disposuit Dominus, ut sicut ejus passione in Quadragesimae jejuniis contristare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, ita ejus resurrectione in Quinquagesimae feriis lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taremur. Non igitur jejunamus in hâc Quinquagesimâ; quia in his diebus nobiscum Dominus commoratur; non inquam jejunamus praesente Domino, quia ipse ait:</hi> Nunquid possunt silii sponsi jejunare, quandiu cum illis est sponsus? <q>For so hath the Lord appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that as for his Passion, we should mourn in the fasts of Lent, so for his Resurrection we should rejoyce in the 50. daies following; therefore we fast not in this 50. daies, because in these the Lord is with us, we fast not, I say, the Lord being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; because he hath said, <hi>Can the children of the Bridegroom fast so long as the Bridegroom is with them?</hi>
               </q> Lastly, this same S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> in his Serm. <hi>de Iejunio &amp; Helia,</hi> thus preacheth toward the end of Lent, <hi>Propitiâ Divinitate ecce jam penè transegimus Quadragesimae indicta jejunia,</hi> &amp; praecepta Domini <hi>abstinentiae devotione complevimus.</hi> 
               <q>Behold, through the mercy of God we have past through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted fasts of Lent, and have fulfill'd by the devotion of abstinence the commands of the Lord.</q>

            <p>A <hi>sixth</hi> testimony of this age, is that of <hi>THEOPHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LUS</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who in his first Paschal

               <q>To that end let all our labour be taken at present to prepare both those which are something negligent, and our selves unto eternal glory—And thereby men are provoked (forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the low things of the earth) to celebrate the solemnities of the Lords Passion with the Church of the primitives [or first-born]—Therefore Hereticks acknowledge not any solemnity—let us celebrating the Pasche of our Lord be purified by the holy words of the Scriptures—Let us cure the divers wounds of vices, &amp;c.—And so may we enter the fasts at hand, beginning Lent from the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of the moneth <hi>Mechir</hi> [and therein] the week of the Salutary Pasche on the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of the moneth <hi>Pharmuth,</hi> and ending <hi>the fasts according to the Evangelical Traditions on the</hi>

               <q>Having to celebrate Easter, let us begin our Lent from the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of the moneth, which with the Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans is called <hi>Pharmenoth;</hi> &amp; God giving us strength let us fast more carefully on the Great week, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit so, that <hi>according to the Evangelical Traditions,</hi> we end the fasts late at night, on the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>Pharmuth</hi>—Rendring our selves worthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the communion of the body and bloud of Christ.</q> And in his 3.

               <q>As many of us as celebrate the holy Pasche, let us as celebrate the holy Pasche, let us make the Author of the Law, a friend unto us by continency and fastings——adorning our selves with the knowledge of the Scriptures as with solemn garments, chasing away all negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and breaking off delay, that we may cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully go with the Disciples to our Saviour, and say vnto him, <hi>Where wilt thou that we prepare unto thee the Passeover?</hi>—Let us make haste to the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, and say, <hi>God forbid that I should glory save in the Cross of Christ,</hi> then he will give, he will give, I say, joy to them that labour, and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them that fast, will say; [the fasts] shall be to the house of <hi>Iuda</hi> for joy and gladness, and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous solemnity, and ye shall rejoyce.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>seventh</hi> witness is <hi>S.

               <q>We fast one Lent within the compass of the whole year, <hi>according to the Tradition of the Apostles,</hi> in a season fit [for our mysteries.] The Montanists keep three Lents in the year, as if three Saviours had suffered.

               <q>We have understood, that in certain Churches on the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of the week before Easter, the day of the Passion of the Lord, the Church-doors are shut up, and no office celebrated, nor the Passion of the Lord preach'd unto the people; although the same our Saviour commanded his Apostles to preach his Passion, Death, and Resurrection unto all people; and therefore the mystery of his Cross, which the Lord would have shewn forth unto all men, ought on that day to be preached: and all the people ought earnestly to ask [of God] the pardon of their sins, that being cleansed through the compunction of repentance they may attain to receive the venerable day of the Lords Resurrection, having their sins remitted; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clean from sin, may receive the Sacrament of his Body and Bloud. Some on the same day of the Passion of the Lord break off their fasts at 3. a clock in the Afternoon, and betake themselves to entertainments, (or banquets) and while the sun it self on that day being hid, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew its light, and the Elements being troubled, shewed forth the sadness of the whole world; they prophane the fasts of so great a day, and serve themselves with feasting. For asmuch then, as the universal Church keeps that whole day in sadness and abstinence for the Passion of the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:101417:50"/>
Lord; whosoever on that day, except little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, old men, and the sick, shall break the fast before the supplications for pardon are finished, let him be debarr'd from the Paschal joy, and not receive therein the Sacrament of the body and bloud of the Lord; who did not honour the day of his Passion with fasting.—On all the foresaid daies of Lent it is behooveful, that we should give our selves unto weeping and fasting, and cover our body with sack. cloth, and ashes, and cast down our soul with sorrow, until the time of Christs Resurrection be come, when first, we must sing Hallelujah with joy, and change our sadness into rejoycing; for that the consent of the Universal Church hath strengthened this observance.</q> [He saith only: strengthened by the consent of the universal Church; which doth not denote the first beginning.]</p>

The testimonies which I have alledg'd are such as are direct and simple; others there are of great force, complicated of several truths asserted in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, from whence would follow our conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Those truths are three: First, that Easter or the night beginning Easter, was ever to the Church a more solemn time of baptizing, then others. The second, that generally the Church taught and directed the <hi>Catechumeni</hi> to prepare themselves by premitted solemn fastings for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of holy Baptism. Thirdly, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, or company of Christian Believers did joyn themselves in the daies of fastings and prayers, as with the Penitents, that sought Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; so also with the <hi>Catechumeni, &amp; Competentes,</hi> which sought Baptism. From which Assertions, if proved, it follows, that a Paschal Fast before Easter was ever observed in the Church (as of duty of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for our selves, so) of duty of Charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others. In all which duty, without all doubt the Apostles had not failed to instruct them.</p>
            <p>As to the first of those Propositions, That Easter
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:101417:56"/>
was ever to the Church a more solemn time of Baptizing, <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith, <hi>lib. de Baptismo, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Faustus</hi> thus objected: what now shall we say to that, which certainly no man can elude or deny, since this is manifest amongst all, and is celebrated in the Catholick Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation throughout the world, every year, with all carefulness? I speak of Lent, [or the <hi>Quadragesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Fast</hi>] which whosoever shall judge, that it is rightly observed amongst you, he must needs ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from giving us any of these words, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What then do you also, O dearly Beloved, live at that time after the manner of Devils, when THESE MYSTERIES OF THE PASSION OF CHRIST are celebrated by you [<hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Quadragesimal Fast</hi>] and are ye also deceiv'd with the fraud of the seducing spirit? and do ye speak lies in hypocrisie? [which S. <hi>Augustine</hi> had obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the <hi>Manichees</hi>] and have ye also your conscience sear'd with a hot iron? But if none of this be to be said of you, then neither is it to be said of us.—If a Lent be by you observed with abstinence from wine and flesh, and yet without superstition, yea BY DIVINE LAW: see ye, see, I pray, &amp;c. To this <hi>S. Augustine</hi> thus Replies <hi>c.</hi> 5. Hear you therefore, with what meaning and intent we alledge against you this chapter [1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1,—6.] not because ye abstain from flesh;
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:101417:67"/>
for this our first Fathers also have done from some sorts of flesh, as you mention.—CHRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STIANS, NOT HERETICKS, BUT THE CATHOLICKS abstain not only from flesh, but also from certain fruits of the earth, for the keeping under their body, for their souls sake, and the humbling thereof from unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable motions, (not because they think those meats unclean.) And this abstinence they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve either all the year, as some few: or on certain daies and times, AS ALMOST ALL IN THE TIME OF LENT. For the measure [of more severe, or remiss Fasting] as every one is either willing or able. But you [O <hi>Manichees</hi>] deny the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it self to be good, and pronounce it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean—wherein without doubt you blaspheme their Creator. This is that which belongs to the doctrine of Devils.—You see then there is much difference 'twixt such as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from meats, for a sacred signification [<hi>viz.</hi> of the Fasters unworthiness of Gods creatures, and of the Humiliation of their souls] or also for the chastisement of their bodies; and those others [the <hi>Manichees</hi>] who abstain from meats, which God hath created, alledging that God hath not created them. THEREFORE THAT DOCTRINE [OF OURS IS THE DOCTRINE OF THE PROPHETS AND APO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STLES; but this of yours is the Doctrine of Devils speaking lies.</q> Thus farre St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine.</hi>

in the oppositions that are made to this Paschal Fast of Lent.

(beside the uniform custome, and solemn practise of the Church of all Ages and places, for some Paschal Fast, close upon the Vernal Equinox, which we therefore call the Fast of Lent or Spring) the positive Testimony of those Fathers hath been shew'd so general and consenting, that perhaps themselves who oppose this, will discern, that they do full ill service to Christianity, if they consider what now I shall propound unto them, for the strength of mine, and weakness of their Allegation.

            <p>Furthermore (if ought further need be said) let us now suppose a while, that no one of the Testimonies above by me collected, made any mention at all, in express terms, that this Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Fast of Lent was a Tradition Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; that no one Author of all those had said in any word, That it was from God, or Christ, or the Apostles; but that only they testifie, that the universal Church had ever practis'd it; what force such practise alone, so well witnessed, hath in it to infer my conclusion, That it was from the Apostles, I will now proceed brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to shew.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Augustine</hi> is the man, who is brought to say, (but nothing against what we say, nor other then what we have said,) <hi>Non invenimus in literis Novi Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stamenti evidenter praeceptum</hi> of this or any other certain daies of necessary fasting; and hereupon, as S. <hi>Basil</hi> of another matter spake, (<hi>l. d.

            <p>Yet will we not lastly refuse to hear the Pleas even of Novelty and Singularity it self, against this Doctrine of the Churches publick times of Fasting. And their first Objection is, that this Paschal Fast (or any like) are set Fasts; and therefore supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious. Were it some Fast only upon incident and extraordinary occasion, a Providential Fast, as they speak, they could allow it; but a set Fast is a fixed publick mark, and constant eye-sore to them. To which, our Answer we will frame first from Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Instruction. When that holy pattern of Widows <hi>Anna</hi> in the Gospel (<hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 36, 38.) her self a Prophetess, and a Widow about 84 years of age, whereof she lived 7 only with one only Husband from her Virginity, departed not from the Temple, but served God with Fastings and Prayers night and day: Were her Fasts only

Where they not a regular, set holy Discipline of Fasting? <hi>i. e.</hi> almost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual, and differing from the Churches set Fastings (for the Community) only in the greater frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? If they shall say, But she prescribed this Fasting to her self: And why may not the Church of God, (a more devout Virgin yet, then she a Widow) prescribe to her self?

               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They object, The memory of Christs Passion (the Bride-grooms taking away) should be perpetual, not annual only, or weekly. True, And so his Resurrection, we trust; yet you have a week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly memorial of it of Gods appointment, the Lords<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, yea and Annual also (whether you less like that or no.) But our Faith, not our Fasting, is the best memory of his Passion. True, but 'tis so far from colour of Truth, that these two should be set<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite one to the other, that our Lord argues some of little faith from their no-fasting, upon just cause for the Bride-grooms Interest, see <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 20, 21. God saw them both conjoyned in <hi>Nineveh,</hi> and the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:101417:83"/>
one flowing from the other. So the people of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neveh</hi> believed God, and proclaimed a Fast, <hi>Ionah</hi> 3. 5.</p>
            <p>The next objection is that of humane nature: The Fast of Lent seems to us a hard task, and a heavy burden laid on mens shoulders. <hi>Resp.</hi> This objection could not be more improperly laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any Master, or any Text, or any Interpreter of this Text, then against this our gracious Master, and especially in this his Constitution here prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and the Churches Interpretation of it. How tender, how considering was he of the infirmity and weakness even of his own chosen Apostles? excuses that in them, which <hi>Iohn</hi> did not in his. He is careful that no bruised reed, no old bottles should be broken by any's zeal, that in the old and attrite garment the rent should not be made worse (nor the Schism in the Church:) Yea there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is our Lord thus indulgent to his Disciples in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity in this matter (saith S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> on <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.) because he would shew them example, who were by him to be sent forth for the Masters, Teachers and Spiritual Governours of the whole world; that they should gently lead those which were with young, and drive as all the Flock could go. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. <q>These things spake he, giving therein law and rule to them his Disciples, that when they should receive the whole world as their Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, they should deal with them with all gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness

new bottles and garments. Hence it is from the Churches tenderness and condescension, and not from the uncertainty or variety of Tradition, that we read in all Ancient Authors that variety allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or indulged; so that though it was required of all, who had strength of body, to fast some daies, or weeks in those daies of the Bride-grooms ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king from us, in the Paschal Fast, yet witness <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and S. <hi>Augustine</hi> for the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Church; <hi>Dionysius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> for the East, there are clear Records, how in this Paschal Fast some fasted more daies or weeks, some fewer: some within the Abstinence of the 40 daies, choosing out 15 daies (in the East:) others (in the West) 21 for more strict Fasting. Yet so as that from all, of both Churches, abstinence from pleasures and Feasts, otherwise lawful, was expected, through all the 40 daies (in honourable memory of the Bride-grooms own 40 daies fast for us;) and some daies proper Fasts. Whilest others also (among them) as stronger vessels, held the stronger li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quour of 40 daies Fast; and generally by all was observed <hi>Continentia quadraginta dierum,</hi> as <hi>Leo</hi> the Great speaks, <hi>Serm,</hi> 3. <hi>de Quadrages. Ut ad Paschale Festum quadraginta dierum continentiâ se praepararet populus Christianus,</hi> 
               <q>That the Christian people might by some sort of abstinence through the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty daies prepare themselves for the Paschal Feast.</q> Which same Author yet in his very next Sermon of Lent, contents himself for his Auditors with three daies fast only in the week, through the weeks of Lent. <q>Our Church also prays to him who for our sakes did fast 40 daies and 40 nights,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:101417:84"/>
that he would give us grace to use such abstinence, that our flesh being subdued to the Spirit, we may ever obey his godly motions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (not such mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Fasting as His.)</q> 
               <hi>In those daies shall they Fast.</hi> Our holy and tender Mother, the Church considers her childrens strength, as Christ the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of his Bride-chamber: she hath her excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, relaxations for the sick, or weak, for children and aged, prisoners and labourers, women with childe and travellers, and in her compassion, seems even to bear about another passion, with that of her own fastings of Lent. There are wont to be reckoned four reasons, which excuse from fasting: 1. <hi>Impotentia corporis.</hi> 2. <hi>Ex paupertate, indigentia ordinaria ciborum.</hi> 3. <hi>Necessitas laboris ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joris.</hi> 4. <hi>Pietas boni melioris,</hi> (to which some add, <hi>Intempestas caloris,</hi> in some regions, for some hotter moneths of the year.)

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:101417:85"/>
               <q>For although thou canst not fast, yet canst thou forbear pampering thy body with delicacies, and fulness. Nor is this of little moment, but oft avails to the weakning of the Devils temptations, to whom nothing is so pleasing, as Epicurean diet, and drunkenness—If thou hast a weak body, so that thou canst not continue such fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, yet happily it is not weak to prayer, nor unable certainly to despise the pleasures of the full belly.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, perhaps thy bodies health requires rather this Fasting, or Abstinence, as well as the Churches Law, and thy souls consideration. <hi>Theodoret</hi> on <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. hath well advertised us from the example of the three children, who eating pulse and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing water (instead of their appointed meat and wine) their countenances appeared fairer and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in flesh then all the children which did eat the portion of the Kings meal, <hi>c.</hi> 1. 12.—x4. <hi>Theodoret</hi> thereupon observes, I say, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <q>We are lesson'd that bodily strength and comeliness may gain by the use of fasting.</q> And so <hi>Chrysolog. de Iejunio Serm.</hi> 8. saith, <hi>Est jejunium pax corporis, membrorum decus, robur men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium, vigor animarum, castitatis murus, pudicitiae pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnaculum, civitas sanctitatis, magisterii magisterium, disciplinarum disciplina, Ecclesiasticae viae viaticum sae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutare.</hi> 
               <q>Fasting is peace to the body, the come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of limbs, the strength of minds, the vigour of souls, a wall of chastity, a sconce of purity, a city of sanctity, the instruction of instructions, the discipline of disciplines, the salutary provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for the Churches way.</q> Likewise <hi>S.

            </p>
            <p>Lastly, to Fast is wont to be call'd in Scripture to afflict the Soul (<hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 29. <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. 5.) This being the end of fasting, that such chastening by affliction of the body may afflict the lower sensitive powers of the Soul, that the inferiour powers of the Soul being afflicted, a troubled spirit, and a humbled heart thence arising in us may be a sacrifice and burnt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offering unto God. Afflict certainly thy Soul thou mayst, which is the end, if thou art not able to afflict thy body which is the means; since, therefore only, thou mayst not perhaps safely afflict thy body, for that it is already afflicted. Nay this it self, that we are not happily able in body to be susceptible of so salutary a medicine, as fasting, ought and is apt to be one consideration, wherethrough to afflict our selves. Therefore said God of the day of Expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that people, among whom yet, no doubt, there were many sick and infirm in body, as thou art: <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 29. Whatsoever Soul it be, that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people. <hi>Certè qui jejunare non potest, non</hi>

            <p>If any yet look on this duty of fasting in Lent, as disagreeing to their pleasures of Spring, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with sowre aversion do receive this meek and gentle law of this Fast, I shall anon evidence the Lawes of it to be an easie yoke, and mean while say, that God seems to complain of such refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory stupidity by his Prophet <hi>Ieremy c.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>Yea, the Stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times, and the Turtle, and the Crane, and the Swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgement of the Lord.</hi>

               </gap>. <q>The Lord hath indulged these two weekly daies (Saturday and the Lords-day) like certain stages, inns, or havens, that the body being for a little while relax'd from its labours of the Fasting, and the mind comforted, they may again, when these two daies are passed over, afresh set upon the remaining part of the Fast to be travell'd through.</q>

               </gap>. <q>For this I think we ought to take care of, that by no immoderate excess of abstinence we dissolve the strength of the body, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it unactive, and languishing as to any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest employment and businesse. For God when he made man, would not, that he should be idle and not stirring, but active, as to things agreable to his nature, commanding <hi>Adam</hi> himself in Paradise, to labour and to keep the garden. It is meet therefore, that nothing be innovated contrary to nature and the bounds set us by the gracious Author of our nature; but abiding within them, to maintain our bodies fit for action. In no wise dissolving its strength by immoderate fulnesse, or fasting. For this I suppose to be the best oeconomy to follow the laws of nature set us, and by no means to consume or enfeeble the body by immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate spendings of it. This also we must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for, that neither upon pretence of the bodies need we thrust our selves forth into the service of pleasure. We ought to use both moderate fastings, and yet supply the body with necessary
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:101417:89"/>
sustentation. Not following the prescriptions of pleasure, but of reason, accurately judging what is needful for us, concerning our viands; consulting right reason, as a knowing Physician, which may take care of the infirmity of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, by things meet for it, disinteressed from our appetites and passions. It is much better and more behooveful, that our bodie should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, in its consistent strength, and vigour for good actions, then by our own counsel to render it as it were dissolv'd and unactive.</q> Thus far S. <hi>Basil,</hi> one of the most strict Asceticks of the Ancients, to whom agrees also <hi>Procopius Gazaeus</hi> upon <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>You see how unanimously and tenderly the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Doctors of the Church agree on this caution of <hi>Observanda,</hi> but <hi>Moderata Quadr age simae jejunia;</hi> 
               <q>The fasts of Lent to be observed, but with just and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable moderation.</q> How by the Ancients it was moderated we will now say in a few words.</p>
            <p>First, Then a <hi>Quadragesima</hi> all call'd it, as in which though they could not hope to imitate the miraculons 40. dayes fast, of <hi>Moses, Elias,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord: yet in all those 40. dayes they could
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:101417:90"/>
abstain, and they abstained from pleasures, and bread of delight, from publick joyances, and private unnecessary indulgences. And as many as whose health could bear it (without experience, or just fear of sicknesse, or weaknesse) from flesh and wine also: but as to the abstaining from all food till the evening, the generality of the pious Christians both of the East and Western Church sought out within that 40 dayes space, for their pattern some example of meer man, as themselves were, and that one unassisted with miraculous power (as <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were) viz. <hi>Daniel</hi> his 3 weeks fast, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 2, 3. Whereupon I assure my self, that both the Western Church, even <hi>Rome</hi> it self singled out to themselves among their 40 dayes of abstinence (as <hi>Leo</hi> fitly cals it) 21 dayes, or 3 weeks for full fasts until the evening: the Eastern Church likewise 3 weeks, in which they reckoned but 15 dayes, (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from <hi>Socrates</hi>) as reckoning the weeks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Sunday, and Saturday, on which the Eastern Church fasted not, except only one Saturday in the year, the Vigil of Easter day. As to the Western Church, where was the fast of Lent more strictly observed, then in Ancient <hi>Rome?</hi> Yet hear <hi>Leo</hi> the great, and first Bishop of that name in that See, thus instructing the Christian people of <hi>Rome,</hi> in his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of Lent. <hi>Ut omni immunditi â à penetralibus cordis exclusâ, sanctificetur jejunium nostrum [Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drage simale]—Secundâ igitur &amp; quartâ, &amp; sexta Feriâ jejunemus, Sabbato autem apud B. Petrum Apostolum vigilias celebremus.</hi> 
               <q>That all uncleanesse being shut out from the inmost of our heart,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:101417:90"/>
our [Lent] fast may be sanctified.—Let us therefore fast on the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of the week, and on saturday keep a watch <hi>apud B. Petrum. Apostolum.</hi>
               </q> These 3 dayes of each week in their 6 weeks fast of Lent from Quadragesima-Sunday made up 18 dayes, which with Ash-wednesday, and the friday following Ash-wednesday, and Easters-eve made up just their 21 daies Fast: which <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partite History (<hi>l.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 38.) relate that the <hi>Romans</hi> fasted (<hi>i. e.</hi> with this full fasting unto the evening) the space of 3 weeks before Easter. The same saith <hi>Socrates</hi> twice of the Eastern Churches 15 daies fast, which they also measured for 3 weeks (exempting the Lords-day, and the Sabbath-day, as hath been said.) Thus great an agreement there was to observe both the Lords 40 daies Fast by their abstinence from pleasures, flesh, and wine, and if able, by stricter fasting, <hi>Daniel</hi>'s 3 weeks. Which they had great reason thus to emulate; 1. For that his only was done, as meer man contenting himself with the measure of a man, after he had seen <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi>'s more glorious, but mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, example. 2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi> Because <hi>Daniel</hi> himself did undertake that 3 weeks Fast upon his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing in Spirit, <hi>the taking away of this our Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom,</hi> the cutting off of Messias the Prince, but not for himself. Compare the end of <hi>Daniel c.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 24, 26. with the beginning of <hi>c.</hi> 10. 2, 3. 3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi> This Fast was kept by him (saith the Text <hi>v.</hi> 4.) in the first moneth of the year, answering to our <hi>March;</hi> the time wherein the <hi>Messias</hi> was to be cut off, wherein the Christian Church would afterward celebrate their Paschal Fast for his

For he that striveth for masteries, is not crowned, except he strive lawfully. Lest therefore we undergoing the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:101417:92"/>
pain of fasting, fall short of the crown and reward thereof, let us learn how, and after what manner we ought to perform the thing. For otherwise we know, the <hi>Pharisee</hi> also fasted, but after his fast, he went away empty and void of the fruits of fasting. Yea the <hi>Publican,</hi> who fasted not, was preferr'd before him that fasted, that you may learn, how there is no benefit of the fast, except all other requisits also do accompany it. The <hi>Ninevites</hi> fasted, and drew down upon themselves the favour of God. The <hi>Iews</hi> also fasted, and were never the neerer, but went away accused. Since therefore there is so great danger of the fast, to those, who know not how they ought to fast, LETUS LEARN THE LAWS OF FASTING, that we run not uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, nor beat the air, nor be as such cuffers who fight as it were with their shadow. Fasting is a medicine; but physick, although it be never so good, that is prescribed, oftimes becomes unprofitable, by reason of the imprudence of him that useth it. For that he ought well to know, both the season of taking it, and the quantity, and the constitution of the body, that receives it, and the air or region, and the season of the year, and what dyet is to be taken with it, and many other rules; of which he that shall oversee any marres the whole course of physick; which he had enter'd upon.</q> Let us then now come to these <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> sayes we are to learn, the rules and laws of this fast, especially of Lent; that it may be such a fast, as God hath chosen. I will name eight. 1. That our
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:101417:93"/>
fasting be as the Church at first design'd it, a great instrument of our great work of repentance from our sins, of judging our selves, that we be not judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Lord; of more instant mortifying all sinful lusts and affections, (as it is a special season of memory of Christs death and passion) foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as Christ hath suffer'd for us, and we, if with him we suffer in the flesh, must cease from sin, as we learn from St. <hi>Peter.</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>.

               </gap>t for other delightful fulness, refecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and pleasures. 3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>. That fasting be not sever'd from its ancient company of watchings, hard-lyings, sorrowings, sequestration of orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and publick joyances. 4<hi rend="sup">thly</hi>. That in our fasting our bowels relent from all hard oppression of others to all works of justice, the fast which God hath chosen to undoe heavy burdens, and to break every yoke. 5<hi rend="sup">thly</hi>. That it abound in works of<note place="margin">Isa. 58.</note> mercy; the fast commanded us by God, to deal our bread, from which we fast, to those who not of choice, but by necessity do hunger. 6<hi rend="sup">thly</hi>. To make our fastings subservient to our more instant prayers, as our bodies to our Souls; for a time, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, giving ourselves to attend on fasting and prayer, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.) as also to more frequent hearing of Gods word; as the Church at this season provides more frequent sermons, that while the outward man fasts, the inward man may be filled dayly. 7<hi rend="sup">thly</hi>. More particularly take we care in this time of the absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of Lent to prepare ourselves for the Lords Holy Table at Easter, to which it is instituted as a preparation. Lastly. That all this your good
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:101417:93"/>
be not leaven'd with the leaven of vain-glory and hypocrisy, when ye fast be not as the hypocrites are. These the Ancient Doctors did joyn together in their injunctions; as may be seen, especially throughout St. <hi>Chrysostoms</hi> Homilies on Lent. Thus <hi>Caesarius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Arles. A.

And these are indeed all link'd together in their own nature; when our fasting helping forward, and witnessing our Humiliation and Repentance, enabling us also the better to watching, and both giving us opportunity to Prayer, and enabling us at least out of what by Fasting we spare from our own bodies, to feed and relieve the poor; and therefore much more doing justice to others, in all things performing sincere obedience to God and his Church without hypocrisie, in love of our brethren and neighbours, and purity of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and meet preparation of our souls, we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach at the end of the fast, to the Holy Table, and heavenly feast of Christs most holy, purifying, and sanctifying Body and Blood. S. <hi>Austin</hi> somewhere compares the Faith of Christians to the lamp, Alms to the oyl in the lamp, Fasting and Watching to the golden snuffers of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, Prayer to the Incense, Justice and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Sacrifice. But of those eight, let us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed distinctly to speak somewhat to each. 1. That Fasting be joyned with Repentance; <hi>Ut corpus &amp; anima simul jejunent; corpus à cibis, Anima ab omni re malâ,</hi> saith S. <hi>Hierom ad Rusticum.</hi> 
               <q>That the soul and body be joyn'd in the Fast, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy commanded to fast from food, and the soul from every evil thing.</q>

               <hi>Origen</hi> had so advised, <hi>Hom.</hi> 10. <hi>in Levit.</hi> 16. <hi>Ieju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nans debes adire Ponti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <q>Will you, that I shew you what manner of Fast you ought to fast? Fast from all sin, feed not any way your malice, feast not your self with any pleasures, nor warm your self with any luxury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet this we speak not to let loose the reins of Christian abstinence; For we have the daies of Lent consecrated to Fastings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> speaking also of Lent, makes the same judgement of Fasting, (<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. <q>A man may undergoe the labour of fasting, and not receive the reward thereof, [of which reward our Lord spake, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.] How? When we abstain from meats, but not from sins: when we eat no flesh, but devour the houses of the poor: when we drink not our fill of wine, but are drunk with evil concupiscence: when thou deniest thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy its ordinary repasts, and feedest thy soul
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:101417:95"/>
with unlawful food: when thou fastest with thy body, and hast eyes full of adultery.</q> The same Father in his 3. <hi>Homil. ad pop. Aatioch.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. <q>* The fast I speak of is not that of the vulgar, but the accurate fasting; not the abstinence from meats only, but from sins. See we what it is, that dissolv'd that indeclinable wrath [gone out against the <hi>Ninevites</hi>] was it fasting ONLY and sack-cloth? That cannot be said. But the change of their whole life—And God saw their works. What works? that they fasted? that they were cloth'd with sack-cloth? neither of these doth he mention; but saith, that every one return'd from his evil wayes, and God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of the evil, that he had said he would do unto them. Seest thou, that not fasting deliver'd them from their danger, but the change of their life rendred God propitious to those <hi>Barbarians?</hi> This I have said, not that we might dishonour fasting, but that we might honour it. For the honour of fasting is not the abstinence from meats, but the separating our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from our sins, so that he who defines fasting, by abstinence from meats ONLY, he it is who especially dishonours Fasting. Dost thou fast? shew it me by thy works. What works wilt thou say? If thou seest the poor, shew him mercy. If thou seest thine enemy, be reconcil'd to him. If thou seest thy friend in honour, envy him not—Let not thy mouth ONLY fast, but also thine eye, thine ear, thy feet, thy hands, and all the members of thy body. Let thy hands fast from rapin and injury, let thy feet fast from running to unlawful spectacles, let thine eyes fast from busy beholding beauties belonging
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:101417:96"/>
to others; for beholding with the eyes is as it were the food of the eyes; which if it be forbidden food, marres our fast—Let the fast of the hearing be, not willingly to take up accusations and slanders. With this <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> agrees S. <hi>Cyril Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in his first Hom. <hi>de Fest. Paschal.</hi>

It is good therefore in season to abstain from needless meats, and to withdraw from an exquisite table, least filling ourselves with superfluous food, we awaken the sin, that dwels and sleeps in us: for the flesh waxing fat, and living in pleasure becomes difficult and hard to be master'd by the motions and desires of the Spirit—Let there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore evil be evacuated in us, and all delicacy of food pass beside us—Let sober fasting enter in unto us, which is the enemy of all sin.

            <p>Hear we now therefore our own Churches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of it, in her Homily of Fasting, that as Fasting (in the outward part of it) is a with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of meat and drink, and all natural food from the body, for the determined time of fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; so also (saith the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> part of the Homily)
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:101417:97"/>
The inward Fast of the mind is a sorrowfulness of heart, detesting and bewailing our sinful doings. A larger description if you require, you may take it thus: Fasting is a denying our selves lawful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshments, for having not deny'd our selves in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful desires; a real judging our selves worthy to be punished, that we be not judged, and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting or punishing our selves, (<hi>Ezra</hi> 8. 21.) judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our selves also worthy (and executing on ourselves, for sometime, that judgment) of the wonted blessings created of God for man to enjoy, for our former inordinate enjoyments of them, and our other offences against God. <hi>Illicitorum veniam postulantem oportet etiam illicitis abstinere,</hi> saith <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidgarius lib. d. Ordin. Poenitent. c.</hi> 5. [<hi>sed multo magis ab illiciis</hi>] <hi>Tertullian</hi> Antiently in his book of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance <hi>c.</hi> 9. <hi>Plerunque vero jejuniis preces alere, ingemiscere &amp;c.</hi> [<hi>oportet.</hi>] <hi>In quantum non peperceris tibi, in tantum tibi Deus (crede) parcet.</hi> 
               <q>We ought frequently to feed our prayers with fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and with groans to utter them &amp;c. By how much thou sparest not thy self, God will spare thee.</q> Which <hi>Caesarius</hi> of <hi>Arles in Hom.</hi> 1. <hi>de Quadrages.</hi> thus dilates upon: <hi>Iejunia ac vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liae &amp; sanctae afflictiones humilitate corpora macerant, maculata corda purificant—ac sic mortificatione prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senti futura mortis sententia praevenitur, &amp; dum cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pae autor humiliatur, culpa consumitur, dumque exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior afflictio voluntariae districtionis infertur, tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di judicii offensa sedatur, &amp; ingentia debita labor solvit exiguus, quae vix consumpturus erat ardor aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> 
               <q>Fastings and watchings, and holy afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons macerate the body in humiliation, and purify the heart from its stains—And so by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:101417:98"/>
mortification the future sentence of death is prevented. And while the author of the sin is humbled, the sin is consumed; and while the outward affliction of voluntary severity is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, the offence of the dreadful judgment is appeased, and a little labour dissolveth great debts, which eternal burning scarce would eat out.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus Fasting avails, much joyn'd with repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; repentance also is best perform'd in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with Fasting. S. <hi>Basil</hi> the great in his 1. Sermon of Fasting, <gap reason="foreign">

No fitter season to be baptiz'd into the death of Christ, and buried with him in Baptism, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in also quicken'd together with him and raised up; no fitter season to be absolved and quitted from our sins, by his Death and Resurrection; no meeter time to be made partakers of his Holy Body, which was broken, and Blood, which was shed for us for the Remission of our sins, then at

And for these holy memories, and holy partakings of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, Baptism, Confirmation, and the holy Eucharist, what 40 daies, what repentances and fastings can be thought more then needful? S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath taught us, <hi>that purging out from our selves the old leaven, that we may be a new lump,</hi> as we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened, is necessary to our keeping the Feast of Christ our Pass-over sacrificed for us (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7, 8.) that judging of our selves [<gap reason="foreign">

               <q>The garrisons of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian warfare (fastings &amp;c) my Beloved, were instituted of God, for the sanctifying of our minds and bodies, which therefore are to be repaired with the course and returns of dayes and seasons, that our remedy itself may put us in mind of our infirmities.—To these conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions (wherethrough they which had been defil'd by unchastity have shin'd in purity) through the providence of Gods grace holy fasts have been added, which on certain dayes should require of the universal Church the devotion of general observance; for although it be lovely and lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the single several members of Christs body adorn themselves by their own [private] offices, yet it is a matter of more excellent performance, and of more sacred force, when the hearts of the community of the Godly people concur in one proposed duty, that the Devil, to whom our sanctification is a torment, be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come not only by a part, but also by the entire body together.—For it behooveth not only the chief Prelates, or the Priests of the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> order, nor only the ministers of the sacraments [or Deacons] but also the whole body of the Church be purged and cleansed.—It appears most manifestly, that among other the gifts of God the grace also of fastings was given [to the Church] among all the institutions of Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal teaching, which have flowed forth from the fountain of divine institution, there is no doubt but that through the Holy Ghost influencing the Princes of the Church, this observance was by

them at first conceived, that the rules of all vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, should be, begun from the observance of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fasting.—Whilst through temperance, the pleasure of the outward man is diminished, the wisdom of the inward man is strengthned; for neither is there the same vigour of heart under a load of meat, which is under the lightness of fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; nor can fulnesse generate the same sense, which abstinence doth. For when the flesh lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against the spirit, is overcome by the spirits lusting against the flesh, the freedom of ghostly, health, and the soundness of freedom is obtained; that both the flesh may be govern'd by the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the mind, and the mind by the help [and grace] of God.—For fasting hath ever been the dyet of virtue; from abstinence do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed chast thoughts, reasonable wills, salutary counsels; and by voluntary afflictions the flesh dyes unto lusts, and the spirit is renew'd unto virtue.—Fastings give victory against concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence, repel temptations, take down pride, mitigate anger, and nourish the affections of every good will unto the maturity of entire vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</q> Thus much from a few of the Latines.

               </gap>. <q>What then did I do to be healed? For as much as I found out affliction and sorrow, that which is wrought by repentance; for I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd (against my self) such afflicting of my self from true repentance, as might bear some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the greatness of my sin: so waxed I bold to call on the Name of the Lord.</q> But I am to remember that our enquiry was of the reasons and cause (and not only of the proof and truth) of Gods acceptance of this poor service. Such I humbly conceive to be these following: 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> For the honour of the divine holiness of God our Father, who is a God of most pure eyes, who without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of persons will judge every man that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not himself. We therefore necessarily so judge our selves by such self-afflictions and reall acknowledgments, that his not judging us may not possibly be by any thought, his accepting our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to the favouring of our sin; It is a stopping of the mouth of Blasphemy in the enemies of God, when they shall see the sins of Gods children so condemned, punished, and persecuted by the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders themselves, and that in order to regain the favour of God, and his sparing of them. And therefore surely those sins much more condemn'd by God (for if our own hearts judge us so worthy to be punished, God is greater and holier then our hearts.) But because also he is most faithful in his promises of mercy (and his waies higher then mans waies) we judging our selves, he will not judge us: we abhorring our selves in dust and ashes, he will not abhor us.</p>

               </gap>, the business of Fasting is no part of Christianity; that reduce the profit of it first to little (mistaking the place <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 8.</note> of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> which speaks not of fasting, but of another matter,) (as shall hereafter be shewn) and then to nothing.)

               </gap>, <hi>they shall, they will fast.</hi> And this Text thus interpreted of the Churches Set Fasts, (and principally of this Set Fast of Lent) by the Church it self in <hi>Tertullian</hi> (<hi>suprà pag.</hi> 28.) by <hi>Petrus</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> and Martyr, by S. <hi>Austin,</hi> by S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> by <hi>Innocentius primus,</hi> by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> by <hi>Isidore Hispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lensis,</hi> by Venerable <hi>Bede,</hi> by <hi>Theophylact,</hi> and others. With what meekness, gentleness, and loving care our Lord doth here provide for the preservation of the vessels, old, and new, and of the wine both old, and new, you may perceive.</p>
            <p>For first it is to be observed, that our gracious Lord who first fasted himself his Quadragesimal fast, and that for his people, the Church, which had sins past to be fasted for, and need of arms and strength against temptations to come, yet he would not command his Church any other times of fasting, then such only as her own regard and affection towards her dear spouse in his absence, and the memory of his dear love in his fasting, Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, death, and passion should command her. An express command, if S. <hi>Austin,</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> say, they read not; it needed not; she will do it; <hi>In those daies they will fast.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi> The duty of fasting our Lord compares it but to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a peice to mend up. If our own garment were not worn and rent, there would have been no need of peicing, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; If men had continued in innocency and original Righteousness, the work of painful fasting had been nothing useful at all; but we are waxen old in our sins, and not forthwith capable perhaps,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:101417:124"/>
even of our remedies, least our rent be made worse. Yea our Lord comparing it to new wine, gives sentence that the old is better, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment which is both new, and old, which you had from the beginning, and which is new in him, <hi>That ye love one another.</hi> But both are to be preserved: our pieced garments also are to be worn in our bride-grooms absence, although not in his presence.</p>
            <p>3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi> Observe that as all the Churches set, solemn, unchangeable fasts, her weekly Stations, and her yearly Paschal fast of Lent (and if any will adde the Rogation-fasts also before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from her at the Ascension) are from the taking away the Bride-groom from her: so from the presence of the Bride-groom with her, or to her, are all the Churches Feasts (as those of Christs Incarnation, Nativity, Resurrection, or his entring into Heaven to appear in the presence of God for her, and to prepare a place for her living in his presence, at his Ascension,) or from the friends of the Bride-groom, their being brought into his presence in the dayes of their several martyrdoms.</p>
            <p>Yea and 4<hi rend="sup">thly</hi> all the times prohibited by her, as to any set, or publick fasts, are only therefore prohibited as times of something of her Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grooms presence; as the Lords-day no fasting-day, for the return of his presence at his Resurrection; yea and wheresoever in the Christian world saturday was a time also exempted from being a fasting day, (except one only in the year) as it was exempted generally in all the Oriental Churches, and in many places, and the first ages of the Western

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S Almighty God in the beginning created Man to glorifie and serve him, both in his body, with the bodily appetites and senses thereof, and in his spirit, with its intellectual knowledge and will, both which are Gods, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>ult.</hi> and <hi>c.</hi> 7. 34. and <hi>Iames</hi> 2. <hi>ult.</hi>) and Man soon departed from God in his first Fall by a Rebellion in both those, br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So in our Recurning unto our heavenly Father, we cannot hope for reconciliation or peace with

him, but by being renewed both in the spirit of our mindes, by a new and contrite heart and spirit, and also by the mortification and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing of our flesh, crucifying it with the sensuality, affections and lusts thereof. Agreeable hereto the holy Church of Christ in her begetting and bearing Children unto God, hath according to the wisdom taught her from God, conjoyned together, both the earnest Preachings of Repentance, (which is <gap reason="foreign">

And because the minde or spirit of man cannot always be in its exaltation, nor continually in its trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled state of contrite sorrowfulness; nor yet the flesh, or body bear either continual feasts of fulness, nor (if we speak of the greater sort of Christian people) perpetual fastings and severities: Therefore the Church, the common Mother of us all, hath (as she hath been taught by the Holy Ghost) in all Ages prescribed to her Children set times of feasts and fastings.

Again, those religious private Fasts are either such as particular Christians indict to themselves for the ends above mentioned, or such as to particular persons are either enjoyned from their Bishop, or advised and directed them by the Priest upon their private Confession. Those Fasts which they indict and choose unto themselves, are either such as by the Bond of a Vow or Promise to God they have bound upon their soul: or
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:101417:128"/>
otherwise such as they purpose and perform in all freedom. Every Vow and every binding Oath to afflict the soul, (if they were in their own power, and the thing in their power, and they have not vowed to God a Sacrifice of Robbery, (<hi>de rapinâ holocaustum</hi>) depriving of strength and health their bodies, which are not their own, but made for Gods service:) shall binde over the soul and body to danger of Gods judgement, if not performed, <hi>Numb.</hi> 30. 2, 13. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5. 4, 6. <q>An Ecclesiastical Fast, or Fast of the Church is such religious fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as above described, wherein the publick Congregation (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as conveniently can) doth joyn.</q> Which, as all other agreeing or gathering together of more Christians, in the name of Christ, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any matter, hath a more special promise of prevailing with Almighty God (<hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 19, 20.) <hi>Leo Serm.</hi> 7. <hi>de Iejunio deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi mensis.

But before such were as yet given to the Church, in the Primitive Ages of the Church, that the Bishop wanted not power to enjoyn such Fasts, is evident from the testimony of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> of the usage and manner of the Church in his time; who then being angry with the Church, that she denied unto <hi>Montanus</hi> the new Prophet or Paraclete, (by him newly acknowledg'd) what yet they granted to their Bishops, he thus bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth witness to the truth of the Churches so ancient practice <hi>lib de Iejuniis cap.</hi> 13. <hi>Quale est autem, ut tuo arbitrio permi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Of such solemn calling on God preparatory to Ordination, we have the example, first of Christ our Lord himself in the Gospel, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 12, 13. where we read, that in the Eve or Vigil before the day, which he design'd for choosing out of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples twelve, which he would name Apostles, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the several Fasts of the Church, (or also other Religious Fasts) as to their measure of Time.</head>
               <p>THe extension of the Fast, as to the persons performing it, was either a Fast of the whole Catholick Church, as it were at one time perform'd by all Christian people, or particular Fasts of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches; or individual Fasts of single persons: But the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension of Fasts as to the time, (forsomuch as the flesh which need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that medicine, is not able to bear it continued perpetually, or for a very long time; if we speak of the ordinary strength of Christians) hath been in divers proportions bounded out. There is first the <hi>semi-jejunium stationum,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls it, <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s Fast till three a clock in the afternoon; such is call'd <hi>in Typico S. Sabae</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Venit enim horae nonae observatio de exitu Domini,</hi> as we heard <hi>Tertullian</hi> grant to the Church but now. There is secondly a proper, entire Fast of one day unto the Evening, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 12. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 6. and <hi>Iudges</hi> 20. 26. <hi>And all the Children of</hi> Israel, <hi>and all the People went up, and came into the house of God, and wept, and abode there before the Lord, and fasted that day until the Evening, and offered Burnt-offerings and Peace-offerings before the Lord.</hi> According to which Pattern the Christian Church, in the Fasts of <hi>Lent,</hi> in those days when they fasted until the Evening, celebrated their commemorative Sacrifice, <hi>viz.</hi> of the holy Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist, in the Evening, next before their <hi>Officium vespertinum,</hi> 'betwixt three a clock and six at night; (as on the other Fasts of their stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which they brake up at three a clock, they offered up their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorative Sacrifice next also before their Evening Service, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the hours of twelve and three) Such was also <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Fast conjoyn'd with supplications, sack-cloth and ashes, and continued until the time of the Evening Oblation, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 3. 21. The Angel of God putting this period of the Evening to his Fast, as an Angel of God did at the ninth hour unto <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s Fast, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. Amongst the set Fasts of the Church, certain, especially in <hi>Lent,</hi> and those also

before the Ordinations, (which as appears by the Sermons of <hi>Leo,</hi> were wont then to be kept but two days, the fourth and sixth of the week) were then extended unto the Evening. A third sort of fasts, as to the extent of time, is that which the <hi>Greeks</hi> call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Superpositio,</hi> when they added to the day the night following also, or at least the time unto the Cock-crowing: So holy <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 16. <hi>He fasted a Fast, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth;</hi> and as the words of the Text may import, <hi>pernoctavit in jejunio.</hi> As the <hi>Syr.</hi> and <hi>Arab.</hi> did read the <hi>Hebrew</hi> in their Copy. <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Iejune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit jejunium in quo &amp; pernoctavit</hi>

                     </gap>
                  </note> Fourthly, there is a fast of two days continued, such as it seems was in the Church by some used at their Paschal fast, saith <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Dionysius,</hi> The two days of the Disciples sorrow, when their Master was taken from them. Of which, as the Prophet <hi>Hosea</hi> seems to have given before some intimation, <hi>chap.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>After two days he will revive us, and the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight. Then shall we know, &amp;c. His going forth is prepared as the morning;</hi> So <hi>Tertullian</hi> also describeth the Churches more instant exercise of fasting on those two days of our Saviours remaining in death, <hi>lib. de Iejun. cap.</hi> 14. <hi>Cur jejuniis Parasceuen? Quanquam vos etiam sabbatum, si quando continuatis, nunquam nisi in Pascha je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junandum, secundum rationem alibi redditam.</hi> But more expresly <hi>Dionysius,</hi>

                  </gap>. <q>Nor do all keep the six days of the fasts [<hi>viz.</hi> those of the great Week] equally or alike; but some indeed pass them all over continuing without food [either wholly, or on each day to the next Cock-crowing] But others, two, [<hi>viz.</hi> Good-Friday, and <hi>Easter</hi>-Eve] again others three [the Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday] and others four [adding Thursday] </q>The two or three days fast we meet with in St. <hi>Hierom</hi> in his fifteenth Epistle (<hi>ad Marcellum</hi>) of <hi>Asella</hi> a very holy Virgin, <hi>Cùm per omnem aetatem jugi jejunio pasceretur, biduo, triduó que sic permanens, tum verò in quadrage simâ navigii sui vela tendebat.</hi>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, a three days fast in Old and New Testament is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned, <hi>Esther</hi> 4. 16, 17. <hi>Go, gather together all the Iews, which</hi>
                  <pb n="447" facs="tcp:101417:134"/>
                  <hi>are found in</hi> Shushan, <hi>and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night nor day. I also and my Maidens will fast like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, &amp;c. So</hi> Mordecai <hi>went his way, and did according to all that</hi> Esther <hi>had commanded him.</hi> Such (as is supposed) was also the <hi>Ninevites</hi> fast; and such was St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s fast at his Conversion, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 9. <hi>And he was three days without sight, and did neither eat nor drink.</hi> The same fast of three days we have in the History of godly <hi>Iudas Maccabaeus,</hi> 2 <hi>Mac.</hi> 13. 10-12. That two days, and this three days fast is by some religiously also emulated, who not able to continue so long fasting joyn together so many several days of fasts; though taking some food each Evening.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, we often meet with the mention of a five days fast, and such each weeks fast in <hi>Lent,</hi> as St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> for <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and St. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil</hi> for <hi>Caesarea</hi> doth witness, (besides that which <hi>Socrates</hi> mentions of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, three five days fasts with interval of many days betwixt.) St. <hi>Basil</hi> in his first Sermon of fasting days, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a fifth fast proclaimed, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <q>Lay not in before hand five days riot, as if you would avenge before hand the days of the fast.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, the next honourable fast is that of seven days, as that of the men of <hi>Iabesh Gilead,</hi> for <hi>Saul</hi> and his sons, they fasted seven days, 1 <hi>Sam. ult. ult.</hi> Like <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s mourning for his father seven days, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 10. Like as <hi>Ezechiel</hi> also sat with them of the Captivity, <hi>and remained astonished amongst them seven days; And it came to pass at the end of the seven days, that the Word of the Lord came unto him, Chap.</hi> 3. 15, 16. So as also <hi>Iob</hi>'s three friends having <hi>rent every one his Mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads, sate down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him, Iob</hi> 2. <hi>ult.</hi> Yea the Lord said unto <hi>Moses</hi> of <hi>Miriam, Num.</hi> 12. 14. <hi>If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from the Camp seven days.</hi> This seven days fast is answer'd by the Christians whole weeks fast, in their great week, except in that the festival day of <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> (yea even every weekly Lords-day) hath a greater priviledge of exemption from fasting, then the Jewish-sabbath then had. Our <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, six days of the Fasts, mention'd by <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> above <hi>in Epistolâ ad Basilidem,</hi> are to the Christians instead of a seven days Fast. So measur'd they their

               <p>Eighthly, <hi>Daniel</hi>'s three weeks fast was, as I said, divers ways emulated by the Christians in <hi>Lent;</hi> some after that example, amongst the forty days of Abstinence more strictly fasting the three weeks next before <hi>Easter,</hi> (excepting the Lords days, or also two of the Saturdays) some selecting to themselves one and twenty days dispersedly throughout the <hi>Lent,</hi> (as <hi>Leo</hi>

               <p>THere are that bear the world in hand, that the Observation of any set, and oft-recurring day, beside the Lords day, is supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and contrary to the Gospel's freedom, and at best but of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Tradition. Who requiring of us an express written precept for any such day or days, and having been lately by many of the Sectaries convicted, as unable to produce any such express written precept of God's in the New Testament for changing the seventh day of the old, into the first day of the week, which we now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, they have given them occasion to cast off the observance of the first day of the week also. The Churches interpretation of some Texts, (which are not evident and express Precepts) and her witness of the Apostolical Tradition concerning the same, and the Churches universal and perpetual practice, all this together they
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:101417:136"/>
have taught the Sectaries to be an unsufficient Warrant for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of any day, or days. But we are not afraid to say, that upon those grounds above said, we hold all obliged, as to the determination of the weekly first day, for the Churches more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Assemblies; so also for an annual (beside the weekly) memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial-day of Christ's Resurrection, called <hi>Pascha,</hi> or <hi>Easter</hi> day.

Thus much for annual, set, recurring dayes; there lying no exception against the Paschal Fast, or Feast, but what is made (still out of the same <hi>Socrates,</hi> or the like) against all annual set Fasts, or Feasts: For no Author ever pretended any annual Fast, or Feast in the Christian Church was to be preferred before this Feast of Easter, and the Fast preceding. But to return to the Fast particularly: It was an age of the Church well neer as ancient, as that age of the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and <hi>Polycarp,</hi> which told <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and the <hi>Montanists: Quod ad jejunia pertineat, certos dies à Deo constitutos;</hi> (as I have above cited, from <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian. l.</hi> 2. <hi>de Iejun. l.</hi> 1, 2, 13, 14.) <hi>certè in Evangelio illos dies je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juniis determinatos, in quibus ablatus est sponsus—sic &amp; Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolos observâsse, nullum aliud imponentes jugum certorum, &amp; in commune omnibus obeundorum jejuniorum.</hi> And <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>Stationum munus ex arbitrio obeundum esse, &amp; non ultra nonam detinendum.</hi> 
                  <q>That there are certain days constituted of God, that those dayes for Fastings were determined in the Gospel, the dayes in which the Bridegroom was taken away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that so the Apostles had observ'd or kept [those dayes] imposing no other yoke of set Fasts to be perform'd by all in Common: that the office of Stations [<hi>viz.</hi> of the fourth, and sixth day of the week] was to be at choice performed, and not to be extended beyond the ninth hour, [<hi>viz.</hi> three a clock afternoon.]</q> That here are set Fasts, and this set Fast about the time of our Saviours Passion before <hi>Easter,</hi> and for this reason, The taking away of the Bridegroom; and that to concern the whole number of Christian people, and that observed first by the Apostles themselves, and by them imposed on the Church, and constituted by God, and in some sort determined in the Gospel, and that in those words [In those days, when the Bridegroom shall be taken from them:] and all this observ'd or
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:101417:138"/>
kept by the Bride her self, and by her witnessed; is here so evident, that I cannot foresee what exception can be made, unless some should pretend that those <hi>Psychici</hi> (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> by contempt calls the Church there) who there speak, should not indeed be the Church, or true Catholiques. But he must be ignorant of all <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian's</hi> writings, who should make this desperate attempt of escape. To put it therefore past all doubt, that not onely <hi>Tertullian,</hi> but the rest of the pretended pure and Spiritual hereticks of that age were wont so by contempt to miscal the true Catholiques, by the name of <hi>Psychici,</hi> or sensual persons; S. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> the holy Father, and Martyr gives us certainly to know in <hi>l.</hi> 1. against Heresies <hi>c.</hi> 1. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <q>These spiritual men—Suppose such like men to be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in mysteries. For as for the <hi>Psychici,</hi> or sensual men, they are instructed in sensual things, who by works and meer faith have their establishment, and have not the perfect knowledge. Now these [<hi>Psychici</hi>] they say, we of the Church are; and therefore that it is indeed necessary for us to do good works; for that otherwise it is impossible we should be saved. But them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves they hold shall be saved wholly and altogether not by deeds, but for that they are by nature Spiritual ones.—They will have it that it is not possible, for that which is spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual [<hi>viz.</hi> themselves] to receive corruption, whatsoever deeds they are conversant in. Tor as Gold laid up in mire doth not lose its beauty, but keeps its own nature, the mire being in nothing able to hurt the gold; so say they of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that in whatsoever gross works of the body they shall be conversant, that they are in nothing hurt thereby, nor lose their spiritual being or subsistence.—And doing many other filthy and Atheistical things, they shew themselves fierce against us, who keep our selves through fear of God from sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning even in word, or thought, as idiots, and such as know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. But they highly exalt themselves, calling themselves the perfect ones, and the seeds or children of Election. They say that we have grace only lent us for use; and therefore that it shall be taken from us; but that themselves hold it as their proper possession from above, by an unspeakable, and not to be named conjunction. Therefore they call us the good sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual people, or <hi>Psychici,</hi> and say that we are of the world, and that continence and wel-doing is necessary for us, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may come unto the place of mediocrity; but in no wise necessary unto them as being spiritual, and called perfect ones.—And anon: They teach that that which is spiritual

night, fasting an hour for a day.</q> This ancient Authour (living nearer unto, and so more knowing of, the Primitive Churches practice (by which often the obscurer sayings of Authours are best interpreted) is much in this inquiry to be regarded; and yet I may easily grant the words of his <hi>Synopsis</hi> to be onely a Gloss, or Metaphrase, wherein he explains <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> And these words [and some by forty hours of day-time and of night commensurate their day] he thus explains [and some fast forty hours onely, of day-time and of night, fasting an hour for a day] so that, as to <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> forty days were appointed, each day for a year: so these had set themselves a fast of forty hours, an hour for a day. Now sure this ancient Gloss (except any one would rather it should be the ancient true reading of <hi>Irenaeus</hi>] finds <hi>Irenaeus</hi> presupposing in the Church, the simple and plain man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of forty daies Fast (before Easter) before such change had been made into forty hours; which change had been made by some mens unaccurate walking, long before <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Victor</hi>'s daies. So that in some (sew perhaps) 40 hours were elder then <hi>Irenaeus</hi>'s days, but 40 days elder then these devised hours: &amp; this change in some was help't on perhaps by the bodily infirmity of a fewer number (amongst those few) who could not perform more in honour to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours forty dayes fast for us, then a fast of forty hours, handsomely accommodated <note n="a" place="margin">There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Irenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>'s word is <gap reason="foreign">

On this accommodation others who had no such bodily infirmity, yet gladly (as is likely) laid hold, till it became at length a noted different way of fasting the Paschal fast: and is now again in our age advanced to give check to the elder, simple &amp; plain manner of forty days abstinence of fasting. But that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> should recite those pittances of one, or two days, or forty hours, as approved by him, or as indifferent and equally good and regular with the former simple and plain custome, no man can imagine, that either considers what Ancient Books have wrote of the <gap reason="foreign">

About the reading whereof or punctation, and about rendring of the former part of it, we shall easily agree. <q>Neither is the controversie only about the day [of <hi>Easter</hi>] but also concerning the form it self of the fast; for some think that they ought to fast one day, some two, others also more, and some by forty houres of day-time, and of night, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensurate their day.</q> And such variety of those that keep (the fast) &amp;c. Hitherto we have little difference with our brethren; but as to that which follows just cause of great complaint of the abuse of the Author, and of the Reader, and of the fast. <q>For those fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words we say our brethren in the 66 Page of their grand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, have translated amiss to their own advantage, for the dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of the Paschal fast in these words [With our Ancestors, who, as is most like, propagated to posterity a custome which they retained, as brought in by a certain simplicity and private will] in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of those words from the Greek</q> [with our Ancestors, who less accurately, as is most like, retaining (the form of the fast, above mentioned) have changed the simple and plain custome, or the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome which was after a simple and plain manner of speaking, into that which followed after. For 4. words our brethren put in which are not in the Greek either formally or virtually, <hi>viz.</hi> [brought in] say they, that their English reader might think that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> had said; that even that which <hi>Irenaeus</hi>'s Ancestors retained (and not then devised) the custome of the fast, was brought in by a certain simplicity and private will. Tell us now I pray what one word is there in your Author, which ye pretend to translate, that signifies [brought in, or brought in by a certain simplicity and private will?] but if there be no word of bringing in by a certain simplicity, &amp;c. but only of changing that simple vulgar manner which was before, then you have not dealt truly in a matter of main concern to the question. As if those long before <hi>Irenaeus</hi>'s time had retained what was before their time, and propagated to posterity a custome at first brought in by a certain simplicity and private will. Whereas there is not one word of all that in the Text, neither of [propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating to posterity] nor of [brought in] nor of [private will] nor of [a certain.] For secondly, tell us you, what word is there for propagating to posterity?

               <p>Now the Reader hath <hi>Irenaeus</hi>'s words, and their true Rendring: His sense I shall lay down briefly. First, That <hi>Irenaeus</hi> as he wrote against the <hi>Asian</hi> custome of keeping Easter, in his own name, and the name of the rest of the Bishops of <hi>France,</hi> and maintained that <hi>Victor</hi>'s judgement was the right concerning the day of Easter, yet exhorted <hi>Victor</hi> to mutual tolerance, peace and love: so here his applauding peaceableness with these various ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers of the Fast, is no approving of the variations and differences which he recites. Yea secondly he recites them, because not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by him: for his scope was at that time to set down only no other definite numbers but such as were so many sundry deviati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the right rule, which yet ought not to break the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, (at least whilest it was evident that all retained, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured the Feast it self, and the Fast it self.) For that he might perswade <hi>Victor,</hi> that the <hi>Asians</hi> error now in continuing a peculiar custome indulged to the former Infancy of the weak new converted Jewes amongst them of <hi>Asia,</hi> against the general custome of the rest of the Christian world, which stood free from those particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances, yet was to be born with: He useth this argument, That the difference which was not now first, but of old, found, about the keeping of the Paschal Fast also, and had been introduced by a less accurate observance, and want of keeping to the first plain and simple Tradition, yet had not heretofore, nor ought now to break the peace 'twixt such less accurate observers of the manner of
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:101417:148"/>
the Fast, and the others more careful and faithful preservers of the Churches Rule (amongst which he seems to account <hi>Victor</hi> and himself deservedly in these words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <q>All they were never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless at peace with the rell, and we with them.</q> So ought it therefore to be about the day of the Feast of Easter. Thirdly, therefore also neither one day of Fasting, nor two daies, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more; nor forty hours are the Accurate insisting on the first simple and plain Tradition of observing that Paschal Fast, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Irenaeus.</hi> Fourthly, from <hi>Irenaeus</hi>'s his words, any one may well collect, that there was even on all hands confessed a Fast kept, and to be kept before the Feast of Easter; and that before <hi>Irenaeus</hi>'s time, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, very long before his daies (for which you may allow fairly at least about sixty years) such differences had been, and variety, about the degree and rigour of keeping that Paschal Fast, less, or longer time. And yet that before such differences and variety there had proceeded an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a plain and simple custome (which should have been still, but was not by some accurately observed; but changed into that which in some mens practise after followed.) To which preceding custome, if you shall allow but about thirty or forty years, the least that can entitle it to so known and famous a custome, you have brought it up to the Apostles own daies (S. <hi>Iohn</hi> living within 98 years of <hi>Irenaeus</hi>'s writing this) and yet still all those alledged following varieties and differences agreed accurately in this, that they had observed, and would and ought all to observe a Paschal Fast, and Feast: that there were certain fasts <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to be ended yearly at Easter. That the celebration of the Pasch was a thing worthy of their great care and faithfulness: and the very less circumstances of it worthy of peaceable enquiry at the least, and perswading one the other, if they could. Which the sacred first General Councel of <hi>Nice</hi> thought worthy the second place in their care: and which they then established by joynt decree; and here whiles yet they could not agree, all sides acknowledged Apostolical Tradition in both Churches of East and West; and an Agreeing Tradition ever in the Church touching certain Fasts to be ended at Easter, whensoever that was to be. Thus the Text of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> by you produced, is not against us, but for us. Though I allow (as I do) their reading and punctation to be
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:101417:148"/>
(as it is) very probable: yet here before we part with that Text, I must tell you, that there is another reading with other punctati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is very probable also, and hath seemed the true read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to many learned men (it being certain that in the old Greek MSS. of the age of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> there were no accents or points usually and distinctly added.) The reading is that which <hi>Ruffinus</hi> of ancient time, and our late Learned Sir <hi>Henry Savil,</hi> with the Reverend and Learned Bishop <hi>Mountague,</hi> (and <hi>Christophorson</hi> also in part) do follow; and it is thus: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <q>for some think they ought to fast one day, and some two, and some also more, and some forty: and [withal] measure their day by the hours of the day, and also of the night.</q> That is, deeming that they ought to measure out each of their number of forty daies, by all the hours of the day, and most also of the night following, at least unto the Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crowing; so that they relaxed their fast, and began to refresh themselves also with sleep, not but then, which was an excess of rigour on the one hand; as those pittances of one or two daies, were in extreme on the other hand of defect, and contracting or shrinking up the Fast. All which varietie came from those who long before <hi>Irenaeus</hi>'s daies, retaining not accurately (as is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) the manner of the fast [at first delivered] had changed the simple and plain manner, into that which followed. <hi>Ruffinus</hi>'s reading of the former part of the words is thus: [<hi>alii uno tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tùm die putant observari debere jejunium, alii duobus, alii verò tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, nonnulli etiam</hi> 40; <hi>etiam ut horas diurnas nocturnasque com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putantes diem statuant:</hi> only here we are to remember, that <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> saith not <gap reason="foreign">

                  <q>Or 40 times 24 hours, for then must they have eat nothing in 40 daies: but 40 daies; computing in to their day, not only all the hours of the day,</q> but the night hours also, <hi>sc.</hi> unto Cock-crowing, <hi>h. e.</hi> 40 <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or superpositions, such as <hi>Dionysius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Basilides</hi> describeth some: and this reading is made the more probable, both in regard that there doth not occur (that ever I could learn of) any other record (beside this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted one) of any 40 hours fast, either in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> time, or
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:101417:149"/>
before, or after: and for that on the other hand, <hi>Dionysius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> living not long after <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> mentions (and that with praise, and no note of excess) in the forecited Epistle, some that passed the whole great week, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, so as fasting every day, taking in the hours of day and of night also, untill the Cock-crowing at the least, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <q>that they were wont to spend more eminently the daies near the solemnity of our Saviour's passion in fastings, in whole-night-watches, and attention to the word of God.</q> This it seems some too forwardly pressed even throughout all the forty daies, and as a duty (for so the words must <gap reason="foreign">

Here I shall esteem it no bar to what hath been said, if any shall observe with me in those new-converted zealous Christians, being <hi>Philo</hi>'s countrey-men, of the Nation of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> (which dwelt in and about <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in the greatest numbers, with <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Iew</hi> himself) some part of zeal left in them towards something of their ancient Judaical rites, which in new-converted <hi>Iewes</hi> the Apostles themselves did bear with: This is no more then <hi>Eusebius</hi> and <hi>Sozomen</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves (who magnifie their Christianity) did observe in the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. It is sufficient that these their observances of fastings, and watchings, and devotions by the space of seven weeks before Easter, were no part of their Judaical rites. Let any shew us any such observance of any Sect of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> or of any other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the world, before Christianity brought in this: so far therefore was this from any thing of Judaical rite, that from this it self <hi>Eusebius</hi> collects (as from one of his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) their indubitable Christianity. Next I may here be allowed to suppose, that I have already shewn in the foregoing chapter, a fair intimation of forty daies abstinence, or fasting, in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his Epistle to <hi>Victor</hi> (<hi>Euseb. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.) as the plain and simple manner of keeping the Paschal Fast; as long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his time, as the Apostles were. They which are so confident, that no mention of forty daies, that no such number of daies was at first observed, or can be shewn so early, as in <hi>Irenaeus</hi>'s daies, should consider, whether what S. <hi>Austin</hi> wrote in his 2d Book <hi>de Doctrinâ Christianâ c.</hi> 16. <hi>Quadraginta diebus jejunare monemur. Hoc lex, cujus persona est in Mose; hoc prophetia, cujus personam gerit Elias: Hoc ipse Dominus monet, qui tanquàm testimonium habens ex lege &amp; prophetis, medius inter illos in monte,</hi> 3 <hi>Discipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis videntibus atque stupentibus claruit:</hi>

                  <q>The Lord fasted forty days in the wilderness, and hath thereby sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Christians fast, and left to us the solemn days of fastings, leaving to us that inheritance of the fast, and preparing our souls to the eating of his body under this number of forty.</q> They should consider, whether, I say, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> himself can no where be found (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side if in that Epistle) to have given some such fair intimation. I shall produce a passage from him at large, because I have not seen it by any observ'd to this purpose: it is in his fifth book against heresies, <hi>c.</hi> 18. <hi>Primò quidem diebus</hi> 40 <hi>jejunus</hi> [<hi>Dominus</hi>] <hi>similiter ut Moyses &amp; Helias posteà esuriit, ut hominem eum verum &amp; firmum intelligamus; proprium enim est hominis jejunantis esurire.

Quoniam enim in principio per escam non esurientem hominem seduxit transgredi praeceptum Dei, in fine esurientem non potuit dissuadere eam, quae à Deo esset, sustinere escam.—Quae ergo suit in Paradiso repletio hominis per duplicem gustationem, dissoluta est per eam, quae fuit in hoc mundo indigentiam</hi> [<hi>seu inediam</hi>]—<hi>Quoniam enim initio homini suasit transgredi prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptum factoris, &amp; ideò eum habuit in suâ potestate; potestas autem est transgressio &amp; Apostasia, &amp; his colligavit hominem</hi> [<hi>lapsum.</hi>] <hi>Per hominem ipsum</hi> [<hi>Christum</hi>] <hi>iterùm oportebat victum eum contrariò colligari iisdem vinculis, quibus alligavit hominem; ut homo</hi> [<hi>qui lapsus fuerat &amp; colligatus</hi>] <hi>solutus revertatur ad suum Dominuns, illa vincula relinquens</hi> [<hi>gulae inter caetera</hi>] <hi>per quae ipse fuerat alligatus, i. e. transgressionis—NOS AUTEM SOLUTOS PER IPSUM PRAECEPTUM DOCUIT ESURIENTES QUIDEM SUSTINERE EAM, QUAE A DEO DATUR, ESCAM.</hi> 
                  <q>First of all (the Lord) fasting forty days, like as <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> had done, was afterwards an hungred, that we might know him
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:101417:153"/>
to be true and undoubted man; for that it properly belongs to man when he fasts to be an hungred. Next also that Satan might have a field to fight in and encounter him: for because in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning the Devil seduced man by food to transgress the precepts of God, while he consented not to abstain; therefore in the end the Devil was not able to disswade [the man Christ Jesus] from waiting for that food, which is given of God—The repletion therefore of man which was in Paradise by the double tasting [<hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi>] was dissolv'd through that abstinence, which [Christ] exercis'd in the world: for in as much as in the beginnning [Satan] perswaded man to transgress the precept of his Maker; and therefore had man deliver'd into his own power. (which his power over man lay in mans transgression and aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, wherewith he held man fast bound) therefore it was needful, that he should by man himself [the Man Christ Jesus] be himself again overcome, and be in contrary manner himself bound fast in the same bonds, wherewith he had bound man: [<hi>viz.</hi> in the trial of eating and abstinence] that man who had been bound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now loosed [by Christ] might return to his own Lord, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving those bonds [<hi>viz.</hi> of being led by the belly to obey Satan] wherewith he had been held fast bound, the bonds of his transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.—FOR HE HATH TAUGHT US (NOW LOOSED BY HIS COMMAND IT SELF) THAT HUNGRING, OR FASTING, WE SHOULD SO WAIT FOR THAT FOOD, WHICH IS GIVEN OF GOD.</q> [<hi>viz.</hi> I understand the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly food of his body and blood then wont most solemnly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by all Christian people at <hi>Easter,</hi> after their fastings; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Allegations in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his time of such fasts ending in the feast of <hi>Easter,</hi> according to traditions and customes much elder then <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and delivered from the Apostles. And he must be much ignorant of Christianity, who can doubt, whether the most solemn Christian festival in the year were, or not, a solemn time of receiving the Holy Sacrament.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <q>to dishonour the fast of forty days.</q> Yet though such abstinence of forty days were not commanded by the Apostles, but by the Church, we have shewn notwithstanding, that it was of Apostolical recommendation. And who is there not almost since the writings of Christian Bishops came to be more frequent, and to be better preserved unto our hands (<hi>viz.</hi> since the days of <hi>Constantine</hi>) which doth not witness so much at least? We have but even now recited St. <hi>Austin</hi> and St. <hi>Hierom.</hi> Briefly, there is not one of the twenty four indubitable Paschal Epistles, or Homilies of <hi>Theophilus,</hi> and St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which doth not witness the abstinence of forty dayes before <hi>Easter,</hi> to have descended from the Apostles, or from instruction Evangelical from the Lord, (which also was not
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:101417:154"/>
taught the world, but by the Apostles.) For the several testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> in <hi>Millan, Leo</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> of <hi>Basil,</hi> and <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> in the East, of <hi>Chrysologus, Caesarius</hi> and others, I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refer you to the preceding discourse from <hi>p.</hi> 46. and forward, then here repeat them. It remains now to shew in what sense the observance of the forty days was of constitution only Ecclesiastical. And such it was first, if we respect the precept of fasting forty days: secondly, if we respect the several sanctions of Ecclesiastical penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which the Governours of the Church did, and might justly, as they saw cause, decree: thirdly, in respect of some particular kinds of meats prohibited with the allowance of others (because such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction generally may be profitable to the ends of fasting) within the compass yet of which law, and of the letter of it, men may (for so may any humane law be abused) chuse to themselves such of the meats allowed, as may be but an exchange of pleasures, and in no wise less contrary to the ends of fasting, then the meats forbidden. Which argues, as the shifting wickedness of sensuality, so also the imperfection of any law, that can by men be set about matters in themselves so various and infinite, unless it meet with such, as obey the laws of their superiours for conscience sake, and in their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence bearing honest and faithful regard to the end of the law; this will be found true, whether we consider the rules of the Ancients, concerning their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or the more modern prohibitions of all flesh, but the flesh of Fish, or in other places also of <hi>lacticinia,</hi> milk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats, or elsewhere also of some fruits. <note n="a" place="margin">St. <hi>Aust.</hi> l. 30. con. Faust. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nich. cap. 3. - 5.</note> And yet may there be chosen such dry meats, or such fish, or such unforbidden fruits, or even such <hi>panis deliciarum,</hi> bread of delight; as no man can pretend that any Apostle ever thought better of, for the mortifying the flesh, or humbling the soul, then of some sort of food by the Church forbidden. And yet the law may to the generality be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; and when it is a law (undispensed with) must be obeyed, and when it is abused by the devices of fleshly mindes, the fault is theirs.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The observation of forty days is a constitution Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical also, as to some purposes of the Church, such as are those above mentioned; which will best appear by the words of such ancient authors, as sometimes have call'd the observance of forty dayes a constitution of the Church.

The Fathers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore knowing well, and aware of the harm which proceeds from such careless coming to the Sacrament, meeting together have prescribed forty daies of Fasting, of prayers, of hearing of the word, of Synods [for correction of evil manners and abuses] that all of us together being in these daies, purified with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent care, both by prayers, and by alms, and by fasting, and by whole-nights-watches, and by tears, and by confession [or the whole <gap reason="foreign">

And that they have wrought great reformation and good, working us to a habit and custome of fasting, is manifest.</q> Where first we are to observe, that even laws also Apostolical in some sort, may by the Churches Governours be reinforc'd, pressed, and envigorated in new Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, Sanctions, and Decrees, where they shall see it needful. Secondly, Much more things which descend from Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Apostolical may upon some appearing emergent need be by them made laws Ecclesiastical, for some times, and places.

                     </gap>t the inordinate congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people should lessen their faith in Christ; therefore certain daies are appointed, that we might all meet together in one. Not that such day wherein we meet is more excellent, but that on whatsoever day we meet, a greater joy may arise un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us from seeing each other. Howbeit, he who endeavours more acutely to satisfie the Objection opposed, affirms that all daies are equal, that neither Christ is only crucify'd on Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friday, nor riseth again only on the Lords-day, but that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Day of his Resurrection is alwaies, and that he alwaies feeds on the flesh of the Lord. But that Fasts and Congregations on certain daies were appointed by wise men, for their sakes, who are more employed in the world, then towards God; who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can, yea nor will assemble themselves in the Church, the whole time of their life, and offer up the sacrifice of their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers unto God before humane actions——Therefore not as it is lawful unto us, either to fast alwaies, or to pray alwaies, and receiving the Lords body with joy incessantly to celebrate a Lords day; not so I say, was it lawful to the Jewes, on every day to offer up the [Paschal] Lamb, &amp;c.</q> Here first we are to observe, that both the Objection and the Answer of <hi>S. Hierom</hi> in express
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:101417:156"/>
terms proceed equally of the Lords-day, as of the Fast of Lent, or of the Stations, or of the Feast of Easter: So as that the Opposers of this Paschal Fast, if they will with us own the Lords-day to have been delivered to us from the Lord, and from the Apostles, are with us concerned, to give a fair and just interpretation unto S. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s words. Secondly, that all daies are in themselves equal. Thirdly, that the Difference betwixt the Jewes observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of daies, and times, and moneths from the Christians, is, that many of their chief services of God, as their offering the Paschal Lamb, or the Sacrifice of Atonement, and the like, might not by them be perform'd, but on such daies only, to which by God they were restrained. But there is no such high service of Christianity, (as the Holy Eucharist, Publick Confessions of sins, and Praises, the service of publick Prayers, and of Preaching, and Hearing Gods Word) which may not upon just occasion be performed unto Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God acceptably on any day. Fourthly, That the great benefits and mercies given us by God, such as are His Son's Birth, and Dying for us, and Resurrection, His Ascension, and sending down the Holy Ghost, are of us alwaies to be remembred. Fifthly, that notwithstanding it is needful to the Ghostly health of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Christian people, and profitable to all, that a weekly Lords-day should be, as there is, prescribed unto all from God, and Christ, and taught us by his Apostles, on the day of his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, the first day of the week, and not any other, weekly day to be the Lords-day; and also annual daies, for the memory of Christs Passion, Resurrection, &amp;c. which we have been taught also from the same Apostles, as the same Catholick Church practises, and witnesses in all ages. Sixthly, That to look on the perfection of some few, who are daily, and as it were, continual in Fastings, in Prayers, in receiving the Holy Eucharist, in Hearing God's Word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not to look on or regard the imperfection and weakness of the generality of Christian people; which neither can, as S. <hi>Hierom</hi> sayes, and much more will not; (such is the imperfect disposition of their minds) assemble themselves daily, is a great want of the perfection of charity and wisdom, which shines in the Church of God. Seventhly, That therefore certain daies for Fasts, and for Congregations for the sake of Gods people have been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by wisdome given from God. Eighthly, That whereas S. <hi>Hierom</hi> saies, such daies have been appointed by wise men, we
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:101417:157"/>
trust that since it was a wisdom needful in all ages, and as well in the Apostles times, (especially in some distance of time after the great measures of the Spirit had been given in the Descent of the Holy Ghost at <hi>Ierusalem</hi>) in some degree, as in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, which appears by the Apostles complaint of his <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> and <hi>Galatians,</hi> and of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> forsaking the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of themselves together, <hi>cap.</hi> 10 We trust, I say, they will allow the Apostles to have been filled with the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of Wisdome for that purpose, that they should be for the Churches present and perpetual good, men wise in their constitutions principally; that as S. <hi>Paul</hi> said of himself, in some of his written Constitutions, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 12. <hi>To the rest speak I, not the Lord,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> not by express word, when he was upon earth, as he had that of <hi>vers.</hi> 10. 11.) and <hi>vers.</hi> 40. <hi>She is happier after my judgement;</hi> and yet in both those he thought, and we think also, that he had the Spirit of God: so some things are said to be constituted by men, and not the Lord, (which yet is more then S. <hi>Hierom</hi> said in this case) when not expresly commanded by the Lords own mouth on earth, though they be constituted by such men, as were constituted by God, to guide his Church infallibly: By those, we mean the Apostles of the Lord. And so constituted was the Lords-day, and the Paschal-Fast of Lent, and the Feast of Easter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly according to S. <hi>Hierom's</hi> meaning; as appears by his own express words: <hi>Nos unam Quadragesimam toto anno tempore nobis congruo secundùm Traditionem Apostolorum jejunamus:</hi> 
                  <q>We fast one Lent within the compass of the whole year, [not three, as the Montainsts] in a fit season, according to the Tradition of the Apostles.</q> And yet thrice he saies, that the Fast of the forty daies was sanctified by the Lord, was left as an inheritance from the Lord, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>Con. Iovin.</hi> and on <hi>Ion.</hi> 3. &amp; <hi>Isa.</hi> 58.</p>
               <p>But it may well be from the Lord, and from the Apostles, (as above declared and proved) and yet from the Church [from wise men and Governours in the Church] as to the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, occasioning thereby and compelling such, as S. <hi>Hierom</hi> there describes, <hi>qui nolunt,</hi> which otherwise would not assemble themselves in the Church, as to the <hi>Congregationes inter dies,</hi> which he mentions.</p>

                  <q>Betwixt those truly, which fast under the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and those again which fall under the Law of Christ, there is this difference beside others, that they indeed had their Fasts predefined by God, [<hi>viz.</hi> by his express written Law for the number, manner, and rigour thereof] which they were by all means obliged to fulfill, although otherwise they would not. But these fast more truly from the love of virtue, and free choice of will, than by any coaction at all of Law. And if we have a <hi>Quadragesimal</hi> Fast, or any other defined, it is for the slothfull and negligent, that they to wit may do their duty, that we have it so predefined. For they which are studious, and virtuous, and devoted to piety do pay that Fast by a certain purpose of of their minde, and ready will, rather than compelled by any force at all of Law or Precept.</q> Here you are first to remember, that I have above laid down this concession, that the Precept or Law of Fasting forty days is of Constitution Ecclesiastical onely. Albeit even forty days abstinence we have shewed to be of Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal recommendation.

                  </gap>; that they are partly a Prediction, <hi>In</hi> those days <hi>they will fast,</hi> by a certain Law of gratitude, which the
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:101417:158"/>
Apostles would practise and teach the Church, more truly, than by any coaction of Law, as <hi>Victor</hi> here says. Such coaction of Law <hi>Victor</hi> declares himself here to mean, as was the coaction of fear, compelling them to fulfil those Fasts, <hi>Quae modis omnibus explore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligabantur, etiamsi aliàs noluissent.</hi> Though otherwise they would not. Not as the Christians from the force of love, and by the Law of gratitude, and of a ready minde: <hi>Quòd hoc medium veluti salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare &amp; opportunum suo posted tempore adhibituri sint.</hi> Secondly, we are to observe, that <hi>Victor</hi> here doth not deny, but rather grant some sort of Law, and constitution for, some time and season of fasting given to Christians; while he saith, <hi>Quòd si verò Quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesimale, vel aliud quodc unque jejunium definitum habemus;</hi> and forthwith adds [<hi>habemus praefinitum</hi>] We have such Fast prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. And a little after, <hi>Iejunium illud persolvunt,</hi> they pay <hi>that</hi> Fast; therefore that Fast was their duty; though that duty they performed <hi>magis propensâ voluntate, quàm ullâ legis vi compulsi; veriùs amore virtutis, liberâque voluntatis electione,</hi> (choosing the things that please God) <hi>quàm ullâ omninò coactione legis.</hi> This being from the law of the spirit of bondage, the other from no less a true law of the Spirit of Love. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> be not expressed, yet it is as well included in the word, as when he saith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 16. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <q>that we have a law (if any saith he) of the <hi>Quadragesimal</hi> Fast prefined or prescribed by reason of the slothfull and negligent.</q> Of which sort there are and ever will be many in the Church amongst the generality of Christians, whose consideration must not be contemned, but ever was ground sufficient for the prefinition of some law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of fasting to be given in general: which being given, all must obey, as well those which yet equally would do it without a law, as others who need such a law. The strong this way also bearing the infirmities of the weak. Of this see more in our Interpretation last given to St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom's</hi> words. Fourthly, the entire occasion and ground of <hi>Victor's</hi> words was his scope to shew, that the <hi>Iudaical</hi> Fasts did not now oblige the Apostles or Christian people, as appears by his preceding words: <hi>Cùm enim Apostoli novi T. praecones &amp; doctores sint insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuti,</hi>
                  <pb n="495" facs="tcp:101417:158"/>
                  <hi>non debent nunc veterem caeremoniarum, &amp; observationum legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus obstringi. Vos itaque</hi> [<hi>O Pharisaei</hi>] <hi>qui priscis illis ritibus &amp; consuetudinibus etiamnum addicti, obstrictique haereticis, Mosaica jejunia meritò observatis. Isti verò qui ut nova antéque inaudita praecepta &amp; leges hominibus tradant designati sunt, ad vestras jejuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones hoc tempore compelli non debent, nec jure quoque valent. At suis nihilominus locis unà cum caeteris virtutibus, jejunii quoque ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servam iam &amp; Religionem ostensuri sunt. Non quod aliquà legis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitate</hi> [<hi>h. e. legis terrore</hi>] <hi>ad haec adigentur, aut quòd vestro more, aut sensu, veteribus ritibus adhuc insistendum arbitrabuntur.</hi> 
                  <q>For since the Apostles are appointed Preachers and Teachers of the New Testament, they ought not now to be bound by the laws of the old Ceremonies and observances. You therefore [O Pharisees, <hi>viz.</hi> those that came to the Lord, <hi>Mar.</hi> 2.] who as yet addict your selves to those old rites &amp; customes, and are bound up by Hereticks, full well do ye observe the <hi>Mosaical Fasts;</hi> But they who were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to deliver unto men new Precepts and Laws, not before heard of, ought not, and in right cannot be compelled to <hi>your Fastings</hi> in this time, [<hi>viz.</hi> of the Gospel.] But nevertheless they shall also together with other virtues show forth their OBSERVANCE AND RELIGION OF FASTING IN ITS PROPER PLACES OR SEASONS. [<hi>viz.</hi> In those days when the Bridegroom shall be taken from them, to which <hi>Victor</hi> was here speaking, on <hi>Mark</hi> 2.] Not that they shall be driven, or compelled thereunto by some legal necessity, [<hi>viz.</hi> as of old by terrour of Law, nor by any express written Precept of God] or that they shall deem, that they ought after your manner and sense insist still on the old Rites, or Rites of the old Law.</q> The sum is: The Christian Law of Liberty (which is not less obliging, because such) is principally a Law of Gratitude, which is not wont to have all its measures, and manner and degrees minutely, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly defined. Yet such obligation it hath to some great Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical mercies, and benefits from God, (as are these of which we speak, of Christ's Agony, Death, and Passion for our sins, and his being raised from the dead for our Justification) that never did any Apostle, or other ancient Christians think the Christian Church less obliged to the solemn memory of the former at the set season, or time thereof, in the publick Religion of Fasting (by them that were well able and knowing thereof) or of the latter on the solemn joy or Festivity of <hi>Easter,</hi> than the <hi>Iews</hi> were, (though not bound by
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:101417:159"/>
any express written precept as they) to their observation of their Paschal feast, or their Humiliation on the day of Atonement. For no Christian heart may deny, that the Evangelical benefits and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which we have received of God beyond what they had, doth as much increase our obligation in that regard beyond theirs, as their precept was, and needed to be more, expresly written than ours. Yet <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they shall fast, so shall their obligation, and their needs require. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they will fast, so will their gratitude and love compel them, according to that of <hi>Psal.</hi> 110 <hi>Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power.</hi> Therefore we said also, that the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence for such measures of time as their forty dayes, (if ye ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract from law Ecclesiastical) was of Tradition, but that of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, Apostolical. For there were as I have shewn you from the ancients, some observances <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by precept, and some <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, some left to the willing choice of devotion, <hi>ab Apostolis tradita &amp; commendata</hi> (as St. <hi>Austin</hi> speaks <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>de Baptismo. con. Donatistas</hi>) Hence it is, that Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> writes in his Epistle 22. <hi>ad Eustochium: Iejunium totius anni aequale est</hi> [perhaps he means in each week ordinarily, and at the four seasons of the year equally distributed] <hi>exceptâ Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragesimâ, in quâ CONCEDITUR districtiùs vivere:</hi> 
                  <q>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the fast of fortie days, in which we have fair leave to live more severely.</q> So also in his seventh Epistle to <hi>Laeta,</hi> about the bringing up of her daughter. <hi>Prohibens in tenellâ aetate onera abstinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae; in Quadragesimâ tamen (inquit) continentiae vela pandenda sunt; &amp; tota aurigae retinacula equis laxanda properantibus.</hi>

choice of our Christian thankfulness; so the nature it self of humane bodies and mindes makes it not reasonable, so much as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to prescribe the same measures. Which St. <hi>Basil</hi> the great, observed to himself <hi>l.</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <q>Neither is it possible to prescribe any the same law for the time of mens refection, nor for the manner, nor for the measure.</q> Yea of this very Paschal fast <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> in his fortieth Oration thus wisely teacheth us, comparing Christs forty days fast, and our Paschal abstinence he saith: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <q>Christ fasted a little before his temptation; we before <hi>Easter;</hi> the matter of fastings is one—Christ indeed fasted forty dayes; for he was God; but we proportionate this to our power: though zeal carry some beyond their strength.</q> Though this be so plain, yet at last I expect to have it objected, that so many of the Fathers, even by me produced, do call the fast of forty days, not only a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but also a precept of the Apostles, or of the Lord. As when St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith <hi>l. de Iejun. &amp; Eliâ,</hi> 
                  <q>Behold through the mercies of God we have passed through the indicted fasts of <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragesima,</hi> or forty dayes; and have fulfilled with the devotion of abstinence the commands of the Lord.</q> But this he might say, though all the forty days were not, if something within it, were commanded of God. But when the abstinence of forty days is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly mentioned, it is more frequently then said, that it is according to tradition, or institution, or instruction Apostolical, or Evangelical, than by precept of the Gospel, or of the Apostles. And if in some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance it be called their precept, when the extent of forty days is mentioned; since such speaches occur much more seldome, we are to interpret them by the more usual. The love of Christ in some sort constraineth, where no precept of his, or his Apostles enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. It is easie to shew, that some seldome times we are to allow authors to use those words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>mandatum, praescriptum,</hi> and <hi>jussio,</hi> or the like, not in their whole rigour. It is St. <hi>Austin</hi> who is wont to be objected, against not only the forty days, but any time of Paschal fast; for those his words: <hi>Praecepto Domini, vel Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolorum non invenio definitum,</hi> in his Epistle 86. <hi>ad Casulanum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
                  <pb n="498" facs="tcp:101417:160"/>
Yet the same St. <hi>Austin</hi> elsewhere on <hi>Psal.</hi> 110. seems to press on the other hand as far: <hi>Quadragenario numero, quo &amp; Moyses, &amp; Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, &amp; ipse Dominus jejunaverunt: Praecipitur enim nobis &amp; ex lege, &amp; ex Prophetis, &amp; ex ipso Evangelio, &amp;c. Candor</hi> must reconcile these his sayings to one another: But if men will not be candid, he himself interposes: <hi>Non invenimus in Evangelicis &amp; Apostolieis literis evidenter praeceptum.</hi> This temper is needful to his words, as to the Paschal fast it self, and as to the extent, and degree of it, betwixt his <hi>praecipitur nobis</hi> [above] <hi>numero quadragenario;</hi> and that other sentence of his, <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>contr. Faustum c.</hi> 5. <hi>vel certis diebus atque temporibus, (sicut per Quadragesimam ferè omnes) quanto magis quisque vel minùs, seu voluerit, seu potuerit.</hi> It is evident, that something he thought of precept, and something of counsel left unto free devotion therein.</p>

As for the testimonies cited by us, they pronounce them to be to little purpose; for that they deny not, that the custome of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving <hi>Lent,</hi> either fewer days, or more, to have been as ancient as those Authors, <hi>viz.</hi> St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> St. <hi>Austin,</hi> and St. <hi>Hierome.</hi> Nor do they deny it so anciently by St. <hi>Hierome</hi> there cited to that purpose, to have been witnessed a tradition Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; and by how many more, they may if they please, see in this Treatise. What exceptions now against <hi>Lent,</hi> are made in their own conceptions and words we (esteeming such of less weight, therefore) shall speak to, but in the second place. We begin first to examine, what they lay pretence to in Antiquity; where first they begin with <hi>Tertullian de Iejun. c.</hi> 14. <hi>Si omnem in totum devotionem temporum &amp; dierum, &amp; mensium, &amp; annorum, erasit Apostolus, cur Pascha celebramus annuo circulo in mense primo?

Now <hi>Lent,</hi> as there you may discern by our prayer to God, and services, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Religious fast, properly so called, an Anniversary fast, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:101417:161"/>
in our Common-Prayer-Book, and in our observance, the feast of <hi>Easter.</hi> Now what word can any man discern in all this of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that can make ought against such anniversary, religious fast before <hi>Easter?</hi> If any thing could have been made, either you or your Printer, we cannot tell which, would have done it, by changing as we see a very material word: [<hi>itaque jejunandum</hi>] into [<hi>neque jejunandum.</hi>] But let that be the Printers mistake, yours are greater, to think any of that, which you do produce from <hi>Tertullian,</hi> helps your cause. For you here granting us what cannot be denied, that the <hi>Psychici</hi> here with <hi>Tertullian</hi> are the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks; then <hi>Tertullian</hi> here mentions first as a practice common to the Catholicks, and the Montanists, that they did both celebrate annually <hi>Easter:</hi> and that forty days after, (<hi>Tertullian</hi> says fifty) the Church spent in a holy joy, or exultation, (<hi>viz</hi> from <hi>Easter</hi> to <hi>Whitsuntide.</hi>) Secondly, That the Church did observe two weekly stations, Wednesday, and Friday (on which the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath her publick Litanies injoyned in all Churches.) Thirdly, that the Catholicks did especially exercise on Good Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day fasting; and sometimes at least, continued on Saturday. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that other fasts were not to be prescribed by new Schismatical teachers, (whereof <hi>Montanus</hi> was then head.) And fifthly, as for the [<hi>nullum aliud, &amp;c.</hi>] ye have wholly left out that, to which it refers: <hi>certos dies â Deo constitutos.</hi> Which you would not let your Reader know, that the Catholicks (as you confess they were, that spake) did plead that they had certain days of fastings appointed by God; that no other yoke (<hi>viz.</hi> by teachers only such as <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi> was) was to be imposed of fasts in common to be observed; (for as to their Governours <hi>Tertullian</hi> doth acknowledge in the Chapt. before what you cite, that it was received in custome with the Catholiks, that they which had the rule over them, did beside those fasts constituted by God, indict occasional fasts. Sixthly, that the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanists, &amp; <hi>Tertull.</hi> society, as to their fasting, took to a singular way themselves different from the Church and Catholicks, for which they were here contested with; and that new way was of two weeks chosen at their own pleasure, and kept in their Montanist congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, observed in dry or hard dyet. Seventhly, that this new way being taught by <hi>Montanus,</hi> as a doctrine from God, different from the certain days appointed the Church by God (as the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks there contend) was justly chargeable with that which St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="501" facs="tcp:101417:161"/>
blames in the <hi>Galatians: Observing daies and times; viz.</hi> besides what was appointed by God, as the Lords-day and those they men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, <hi>Certos dies à Deo constitutos.</hi> These are all the Propositions, which are contained in all you cite from <hi>Tertullian.</hi> Now what one word is here against the Religious Fast of Lent before Easter, as observed in our Common prayer-book? One would think the whole allegation had been gathered by some one of your Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, for the Church of <hi>England</hi> against you. For tell us we pray you, that we may run through all the seven; First, Is it your socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that observes annually the Feast of Easter? and 50 daies after from that Feast unto Whitsunday in exultation and joy, [<hi>viz.</hi> spiritual] for Christs Resurrection and Ascension? Secondly, Are the weekly Wednesda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>es and Fridaies by you, or by the Church of <hi>England</hi> rather regarded? Let her Litanies on both daies, and her customary Fasts on Fridaies wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Thirdly, Fasting specially exercised on Good-fridaies; is this the thing which you alledge for your selves against the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer-Book of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and against the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fast of Lent before Easter? Fourthly, Is the Church of <hi>England's</hi> publique observance of the Fast of Lent, the prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of fasts by private Schismatical Teachers, such as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi> was? whose authority in requiring fasts, is more like <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus's,</hi> the Church of <hi>Englands,</hi> or any private mens within her? Fifthly, As to the <hi>Nullum aliud; viz. praeter certos dies à Deo constitutos, &amp; in Evangelio determinatos, illos in quibus ablatus est sponsus</hi>) whose prescribed fasting-daies, the Church of <hi>England's</hi> religious Fast of Lent, or other mens indicted fasts, are more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be meant by the Catholicks in <hi>Tertullian,</hi> saying <q>that they had certain daies constituted by God, and determined in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, those, <hi>viz.</hi> in which the Bridegroom was taken away?</q> Sixthly, Whether doth the Church of <hi>England</hi> in her observing the Religious Fast of Lent, or others in separating from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance of that Fast, more resemble the Montanists different sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular waies? Seventhly, the certain daies appointed by God, in which the Bridegroom was taken away; beside which, for teachers to press a fixed annual Fast, any other, without the authority of lawful Governours, was charged by the Church as observing of daies, and times, and moneths, and years; are, I say, those daies more likely to be the publick religious fasts before Easter, which the

Church of <hi>England</hi> observes, or some other you can shew us? This is all you have, but much more you might have brought from <hi>Tertullian</hi> to the same sense; as that the Catholicks objected to those new teachers, <hi>Novitatem, de cujus illicito praescribunt, c.</hi> 1. <q>They object to them Novelty against the unlawfulness whereof they prescribe.</q> They the Catholicks, prescribe also against the Montanists, <hi>Constituta esse solennia huic fidei Scripturis, vel Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditione majorum; nihilque observationis amplius adjiciendum ob illicitum innovationis.</hi> The next Author you alledge, is a frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Irenaeus's</hi> Epistle in <hi>Euseb. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 6. which how much it makes against you, and for the religious Paschal-Fast of Lent, I have shewn you through the whole 5. chapter of this Appendix; where I have considered, that passage of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> both in it self, and in relation to you; whither I refer you, and the reader. To <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> (with <hi>Sozomen,</hi> and <hi>Nicephorus,</hi>) we shall speak in the last place, because there is much laid on him. And now consider the rest of your helps to expound S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> who calls the Fast of Lent a Tradition Apostolical. To this you say, citing <hi>Regaltius</hi> a modern Critick, that S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> and others calling it an Apostolical Tradition, did it with respect to Christs forty daies; and what then we pray you? Is that against the religious observation of the Fast of Lent in our Common-Prayer-Book? where our Church thus prays: <hi>O Lord, which for our sakes didst fast forty daies, and forty nights, give us grace to use such abstinence, that our flesh being subdued unto the spirit,</hi> &amp;c. So that what S. <hi>Hierom</hi> and the other Fathers you say did respect, the same doth our Church and our Common-Prayer-Book respect, <hi>viz.</hi> Christs forty daies fast. And how is your objection against the Common-Prayer-Book helpt by that? To what you say, that they did not intend themselves any such thing, as any fast of forty daies, how apparently false that is found to be, you may read, for S. <hi>Hierom</hi> in the 54, and 55. pages of this Discourse; and for the rest in the rest of the discourse. Next you teach us how to expound S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> by that in his Epistle <hi>ad Lucin. Unaquaeque provincia abundet in suo sensu, &amp; praecepta majorum leges Apostolicas arbitretur.</hi> If this were as you mean, whether do the observers of the Religious Fast of Lent, or you who dissent, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer more to <hi>Praecepta majorum,</hi> the Precepts of our Ancestors? Secondly, S. <hi>Hierom</hi> doth not here say, that such precepts in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral provinces were to be held <hi>pro Traditionibus Apostolicis.</hi> To
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:101417:162"/>
the obedience of wholesome customes Ecclesiastical, whiles they are not retracted by those, who rule over us, (and of such only S. <hi>Hierom</hi> speaks) we are by Laws Apostolical obliged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet such customes or Lawes are not, nor yet are called by S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> Traditions Apostolical. It is a Catholick rule given by <hi>Ferrandus Diaconus in Paraenetico ad Reginam, regulâ quintâ. Et omnis, qui se ad Ecclesiam pertinere gloriatur, legibus vivat Ecclesiae; maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mè his, quas Antiquitas roboravit.</hi> Next to what you object out of S. <hi>Austin,</hi> Epistle 86. if you had not withheld from us his own Explication, which he adds in the same place, professed by him as an Explication, [saying, <hi>Ut suprà commemoravi</hi>] it had been in the whole thus: <hi>In Evangelicis &amp; Apostolicis literis, totóque In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumento quòd appellatur Testamentum Novum, animo id revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, video praeceptum esse jejunium.

or commanded them also, by thir Rulers and Governours (as in most Churches and Ages of the World, after the waxing cold of Devotion needed such commands, which may further also interpret <hi>Cassian.</hi>) Within such time moreover, either the devout Christians themselves did choose out for themselves, or those that had the rule and government over them did choose out for them (as we reade that <hi>Leo</hi> did <hi>Serm.</hi> 4. <hi>de Quadragesimâ)</hi> some number of days either continued, or with intervall, more, or fewer, to be fasted untill Even, but especially on the six days of the great week, as <hi>Dionysius Alexandr.</hi> in the place by you alledged expresly wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth, and more especially yet on the day of our Lord's crucifixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as your selves also alledged from <hi>Tertullian, Dicatam jejuniis Parasceuen. &amp; cap.</hi> 14. of his Book of Prayer, <hi>Sic &amp; die Paschae</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Secondly, Whereas you cite <hi>Socrates,</hi> as saying, <hi>Perspicuum esse Apostolos liberam potestatem in eâdem cujusque menti ac arbitrio per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misisse:</hi> 
                  <q>That it is perspicuous, that the Apostles left a free power in the same to every mans mind and arbitrement.</q> These words either you would have your reader believe that <hi>Socrates</hi> spake of the religious fast of <hi>Lent,</hi> which is set forth in our Common-Prayer-Book, or of some other matter, or circumstance: If this latter, to what purpose is it here by you alledged? But if the former be by you pretended, (as evidently it is,) as if <hi>Socrates</hi> had said that to be the Apostles minde concerning the religious fast of <hi>Lent,</hi> (which only our Common-Prayer-Book sets forth) as if it were to be left to every ones minde and will. This is a great untruth, and a great abuse of your Reader; <hi>Socrates</hi> speaking these words of the Apostles permission and judgement (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) not of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious fast of <hi>Lent</hi> it self, NOR OF THE NUMBER OF DAYES, MORE, OR FEWER: But having last mention'd the matter of abstinence from some meats, and shewn it not to be alike in all Countreys; for that some abstained from all creatures that have sensitive life, others but from some, allowing themselves to partake of fish (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) and others together with fish, allowing themselves the flesh of birds, how others also abstained from some fruits and eggs; and some lived on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on dry bread, and others not that, and others fast till three a clock in the afternoon [perhaps on the days of their abstinence, and not of their stricter fasts] and then used a freer refection; of which varietie he shews there have been various causes: he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately subjoyns the words by you cited, which in his own Greek we will let the Reader see. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he says, <hi>de hâc re;</hi> of this thing, not of whatsoever you please to extend it to; therefore not at all necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:101417:166"/>
of the number of dayes, more or less; much less of the Paschal fast it self. But here you produce this saying of <hi>Socrates,</hi> against the Religious fast of <hi>Lent</hi> (as set forth in our Common-Prayer-Book) which was spoken of varietie of abstinence, from flesh, also in some places from fish, from some fruits, from eggs, and of others even at three a clock entertaining themselves more plentifully. Of this <hi>Socrates</hi> says; and of this who doubts to affirm, that we have no written precept? Of this who doubts to say, that as for any thing left from the Apostles (if ye abstract from Laws Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical) a free power thereof is permitted to everie mans choice and will. But here you begin your citation out of <hi>Socrates</hi> with a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive without an Antecedent, either expressed, or intimated by you; on which Antecedent yet lay all the controversie, of what it was that <hi>Socrates</hi> spake. Thus you begin: <hi>Ac quoniam nemo de eâ re praeceptum literarum monumentis, &amp;c.</hi> And again, <hi>Apostolos liberam potestatem in eâdem re, &amp;c.</hi> But <hi>quae ea res,</hi> there, sirs, lay all the strength of your argument, and all the concern of the cause. And in that the Reader is left probably to think, that <hi>Socrates</hi> and the Apostles (according to <hi>Socrates</hi>) in those words had made that judgement of the Religious fast of <hi>Lent,</hi> whereas the speech there is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of some choices of some meats, and the more or less plentiful refection, at three a clock or otherwise. And it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable, that <hi>Socrates</hi> there calls even some forbearing of some meats by choice, for the exercise of fasting (as we read in <hi>Daniel</hi> so also chastening himself, as that he doth record: <hi>I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine into my mouth three full weeks;</hi> &amp; that for the chastening of himself before his God, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 2, 3, 12.) that <hi>Socrates</hi> I say, in the very words by you produced doth call even that, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <q>working that which is good. </q>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now surely needs to be added, but to advertise you, that in many things, (as to any law from the Apostles) permitted by them to everie mans will and choice, we yet may be, and are, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and profitably bound up by godly Ecclesiastical constitutions; and that in the matter of fasting. I have before alledged the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and received Canons of the Councel of <hi>Laodicaea.</hi> Kings and States Christian, and where such are not, Churches and Bishops may make such binding Laws or Canons.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.

<pb n="513" facs="tcp:101417:167"/>
to <hi>Socrates,</hi> in the several Countreys. And in the words of <hi>Socrates</hi> there was no mention of the beginning of <hi>Easter,</hi> much less of its being begun everie where more of custome, then of any Commandment of Christ, or any Apostle; there being nothing in the Greek of [beginning, of custome] nothing of these words [more then by Commandment] nothing of these words [either of Christ or any Apostle.] And this was last year a sufficient confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Paschal fast.</p>
               <p>A third instance shall be here in <hi>Socrates</hi>'s recital of <hi>Constantines</hi> letter; wherein the Pamphleter deeming that <hi>Constantine</hi> spake too great things of that comely Order (which saith he) all the Churches of the West, and South, and North parts of the world observe, and some of the East likewise: [and the rest dissenting only about the time:] the Translatour of his own head introduces <hi>Constantine</hi> thus prefacing of himself. <q>In my simple judgement a notable custome, &amp;c.</q> which for <hi>Constantine</hi> to have said of himself had been but hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie; but when neither <hi>Constantine</hi> there said so, (for he spake of that he was more sure of, then of his own judgement) nor yet <hi>Socrates,</hi> for men to cry <hi>Socrates,</hi> and put into the good Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours mouth, that what he spake was but so [in his simple judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment] and forthwith rendring <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <p>A fourth instance, where <hi>Socrates</hi> had said, that the feast of <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>

The holy Rites of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church concerning the feast of <hi>Easter,</hi> and the fast before, and other solemn feasts of the Church, which is called the citie of our solemnities (<hi>Isa.</hi> 33. 20.) declared so (as throughout this whole book I have made appear) from Antiquitie, Universality of recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and consent of testimonies of the generalitie (the three golden rules of <hi>Vincentius Lirinensis.</hi>) If these shall now suffer any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction from <hi>Socrates</hi> any where, or any other single Author, or twain, we are first to say, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That no single writers authoritie, when it stands alone, no nor any two, or three in contradiction to the testimonie of the generalitie, can warrant our following any new doctrine, or practice, nor be any material exception to any Catholick doctrine or practice. Secondly, that an Historian, though a diligent writer, in what dogmatical cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, or judgements he shall mingle with historie of fact, is therein less to be regarded, then in what he relates as an Historian. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that none ought to think it much, if <hi>Socrates</hi> be contradicted in that wherein he is found to contradict others more, and more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and more renowned Writers of Ecclesiastical Historie, or other such Fathers (to whom himself oft appeals, as <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 22.) For that both parts of a contradiction cannot be true, and there is scarce any thing so strange of this nature, which some one Author (perhaps as great as <hi>Socrates</hi>) hath not been found to say. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to this consent which I have shewn, whosoever shall reply, by alledging one or two Authors, wherein some men think they do some great matter, I shall not think it at all considerable.

Which must needs follow, if the witness of one or two be to be accepted against the Communitie. An excellent way it is for everie man to believe what he list, and that from coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance too of authoritie, because almost what ever he list he may finde said by some one Author.

Fifthly, Albeit, for some even great errors in judgement men may not candidly refuse all faith to a diligent Historian, yet when such Historians shall be found to differ from the Communitie of Catholick Writers in that which any way favours such errour, which he is known to patronize, if especially in that his history he declare such his errour, he then may justly be held suspected in such narration, as is singular &amp; looks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the favouring of that error: for example, if <hi>Philostorgius</hi> an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian historian shall declare ought singular, &amp; contrary to the consent of other Authors in the favour of his fellow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

The <hi>Quartadecimani,</hi> and the <hi>Novatians</hi> in great part being now joyned together, the Renowned Patriarch S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> proceeded to deprive them both together of their Churches, as <hi>Socrates</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self also witnesseth <hi>l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi>

                  <q>They set forth a Canon concerning the Feast of Easter, and call'd it, The <hi>Adi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aphoron,</hi> or Canon of Indifferency: saying, that the difference of the Feast was not a sufficient cause to divide [their] Church—they having devised such things at large, they decree their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of Indifferency concerning Easter: so as that every one might keep Easter according to the custome which he had taken up before, if it pleased him—this decree being confirmed by them, <hi>Sabbatius</hi>—so oft as it happened that their times of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Easter differed, would by himself before hand FAST, and keep THE WATCH, and then keep Easter on [his] wonted Sabbath-day.</q> Here we see the <hi>Novatian</hi> Church, or Sect, own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing openly an Indifference of the time of the Eeast of Easter, and so

of the precurring Fast. For so here <hi>Sabbatius</hi> keeping by himself afore hand the Feast of Easter, kept also by himself aforehand the Fast and the Watch, which was to precede. It was now serviceable to the <hi>Novatians,</hi> that their friends and favourers, according to the tenour of this Councel and Canon, should plead the small im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and indifferency of such matters; such, suppose a while, was <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> who liked rather of the Catholick Order, yet pleaded for mutual tolerance, even after the establishment of that matter throughout the Christian Church, by the sacred Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> as well as had been (with good cause) before.

                  <hi>CHAP. 8.</hi> An Answer to the other Objections of the Presbyterians, and to their pretence from an Act of Parliament.</head>
               <p>THe <hi>5th.</hi> Proposal of our Brethren the! Presbyterians, as they have published it now themselves in their Grand Debate page 44. was this, <q>[That nothing should be in the Liturgy, which so much as seems to countenance the observation of Lent as a Religious Fast.]</q> This by them propunded and desired of the King and Bishops and the Church of <hi>England</hi> is, that nothing may be left even of that which is extant in our publick Liturgy; wherein is no one word of the choyce of meats, but onely <q>1. of Prayers and Services to Almighty God at that time before Easter. and 2. of such abstinence, that our flesh being subdued to the Spirit, we may ever obey the Godly motions of the Lord in righteousness, and true holiness, to his honour and glory; and 3. a gratefull remembrance and mention that the Lord for our sakes did fast 40. dayes, and 40. nights, with a Prayer 4. particularly on the first day of Lent, that God would make in us new and contrite hearts, that we worthily lamenting our sins, and acknowledging our wretchedness, may obtain of him the God of all mercy, perfect remission and forgiveness through Jesus Christ. And 5. on Passion week, and on Good-Friday, a holy and humble memory of our Lords being betrayed, and given up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of wicked men, and to suffer death upon the Cross for his Family [the Church] with a prayer for the whole body of that Church, and for all the enemies thereof, all Jewes, Turks, Infidells, and Hereticks (on that day on which Christ prayed for his enemies on the Cross.) And 6. a narrative that in the Primtive Church there was a godly discipline; (the restoring whereof the Church desires) that at the beginning of Lent, such persons as were noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious sinners, were put to open penance, and punished in this world, that their souls might be saved in the day of the Lord; and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers admonished by their example, might be the more affraid to offend; with the reading 7. of the general sentences of Gods cursing against impenitent sinners (the people being required to give after
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:101417:172"/>
the several sentences, an acknowledgment with their own mouths, that the curse of God is so due to impenitent sinners; and 8. a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing godly earnest exhortation to repentance, and <hi>Davids</hi> 51 Psalm of Repentance, with some h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ly penitential Prayers fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing</q> Beside these eight things, let them shew us if they can, any thing that is of Lent in our Common-prayer Book: In all and every of these 8. things, it is manifest, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise some part of her Religion in the Fast of Lent, wherein she prayes also unto God that she may exercise religious abstinence. Not were their propounded desires (they well know) to meddle with ought else than what is in the Common-prayer Book, as themselves give all the world to understand by their own now printing his Majesties Commission (given to them with others) in the beginning of their Book. Not they, nor others then by that Commission, were to propound, advise, answer, or reply, any thing touching Lent, but what was in the said Common-prayer book, and your proposal being framed accordingly [that nothing be in the Liturgy, which so much as seems to countenance the observation of Lent as a Religious Fast] I having summed up all that is in the said Liturgy touching the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Fast of Lent; It now abides upon your part, because you have brought it in to publick view, to say now before all the world if you can, 1. Whether there be ought in the Liturgy that so much as seems to countenance the observation of Lent as a Religious Fast: beside either all these 8. rehearsals which I have summed up, or something of, or in, some one or more of these branches. And if there be nothing else, as 'tis sure there is not, then it now remains your part which you are chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged to do, to give one instance, if you can, in any thing of all those eight contents of the matters concerning Lent, in our Liturgy, with which any Christian can find just fault; <hi>i. e.</hi> to name any one thing blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or not godly among all those things whereof you propound, and desire that no one thing may be left in the Liturgy. <q>Nothing, say you; that may countenance, or so much as seem to countenance the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of Lent in the Liturgy, as a religious Fast.</q> Surely where things of Religion are desired to be left out, there your Religion will oblige you, if you can, to shew us something of those things, which is evil, at least which is not Religious.</p>
               <p>In the account you have given of your own Proposal first and last, <hi>pag.</hi> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75. wherein is every word you speak of this matter, you have not touched so much as any one thing contained
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:101417:172"/>
in all the Common-Prayer-Book; (except perhaps one, and that mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, as shall be shewn.) But in stead of doing of that which was most reasonable for you to have done, you give us, where you make your Proposal, onely two Reasons of your own, in three names; where you pass from Christ to <hi>Moses,</hi> and from <hi>Moses</hi> forthwith to the Act of Parliament 5 <hi>Elizabethae;</hi> and that's all. First, you say, <q>That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be in the Liturgy, which may seem to countenance the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Lent as a Religious Fast; the Example of Christs Fasting forty days and nights being no more imitable, nor intended for the imitations of Christians, than any other of his miraculous works were, or then <hi>Moses</hi> forty days fast was for the Jews.</q> Here you would seem to remove the ground which we have for this Religious Fast: But, Sirs, tell us, we pray you, may there not be some other sufficient Grounds, if this were none? If you know not, then we shall tell you another, and a more principal Reason, <hi>viz.</hi> The Holy Memory of our Blessed Saviours Death and Passion about that time of the year, as all acknowledge; and the memory of, and compunction for our own sins, which cost the Son of God his own precious Blood: <hi>The looking upon Him whom we have pierced.</hi> Nor shall it suffice you to say, That we ought always to remember that; for so we ought always to remember his Resurrection for our Justification: Yet God hath taught us, That what ought always to be remembred, yet may with great spiritual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit be by certain stationary and recurring days more especially and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be brought to the remembrance of all of us generally and joyntly. And if Christs Resurrection have a weekly Feast of remembrance, how is the Catholick Church of all Ages to be taxed as superstitious for one recurring Religious Fast in the year, the memorial of his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion? This hath been done in all Ages, even the purest; and this Fast for this reason, and for this reason principally, the memory of our Lords Death and Passion, the taking away of the Bridegroom: In those days they have fasted. And this reason they have given; and this the Church her self hath given in her contest with Hereticks, and that in that very Chap of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> which afterwards you cite; where the <hi>Psychici,</hi> i. e. the Catholicks, as you acknowledge, give this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Fast before Easter: <hi>Quod ad jejunia pertineat, certos dies à Deo constitutos opponunt.—Certè in Evangelio illos dies je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>uniis determinatos, in quibus ablatus est sponsus.—Et hos esse jam solos le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimos jejuniorum Christianorum, abolitis le alibus &amp; propheticis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tustatibus.—Sic &amp; Apostolos observâsse, uullum aliud imponentes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <pb n="524" facs="tcp:101417:173"/>
And when the Bishops of the Christian world met together in the First and most sacred General Council, and did therein unite the differences that had been about the proper time of that Feast of Easter, and the Fast preceding; <hi>Constantine</hi> having had perfect knowledge from those Bishops, in his Imperial Letters to the Christian Churches acquaints them with what the Bishops had decreed, and writeth thus: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Here Sirs you see ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reason alledged by the Catholicks, and taught by the Bishops of the Catholick Church, as that which had been the reason of obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, ever from the day of our Saviours Passion unto that present year. And that the Lord had delivered to them the Pasche to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, of which also <hi>Constantine</hi> again in the same Epistle adds: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Thus hath the Church fulfilled the Prophesie of God by his Prophet <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> wherein he promised to pour upon her <hi>the Spirit of Grace and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications. And they shall look upon me,</hi> saith he, <hi>whom they have pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and they shall mourn, &amp;c.</hi> Zech. 12. 10. Thus you see, you have done nothing to overthrow the Religious Fast of Lent, though you had removed that which you mentioned, and any other ground, whilest you forgat the principal. But now return we to examine, whether ye have, as ye endeavour, overthrown all imitation of Christ in this Fast; and so something in the Common-Prayer-Book. Where there is no more then once, but that a just and pious mention of it, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Collect of the first Sunday: <q>O Lord which for our sake didst fast forty days and forty nights: give us Grace to use such abstinence, that our flesh being subdued to the Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> Where we doubt not but all Churches in the world will both consent to this Prayer, and praise the modest humility of Christs handmaid this Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> except onely some of her own Children. For 1. She doth not so much as pray, that the Lord would give her grace to use such Fasts, as he had done; but thankfully acknowledging what he had done for her, (<hi>viz.</hi> fasted forty days and forty nights) she prays, That she may use such abstinence, (calling her own rather abstinence, than Fasts) that our flesh being subdued to the Spirit, we may ever obey his god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly motions: Not that she may be glorious in a miracle of fasting, but humbled in an exercise of mortifying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That she may obey his godly
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:101417:173"/>
motions, not emulate the Divine power of his Miracle. Tell us out, we pray you, whether our Church praying thus, and thus far onely, for Imitation of Christ in some abstinence (according to our poor mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures) doth offend you? And if not this; where in the Common-pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-Book is there ought of that which you accuse? But again, why we pray you, because it is not possible for us to imitate Christs miraculous eating nothing at all through all the time of forty days; therefore Christians may not, what you cannot deny to be possible, use some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial abstinence through forty days, for the mortifying of those sins, for which Christ suffered hunger and thirst, and afterward Crucfixion and death, lest that by any means, when we have known all this done for us, our selves should become Cast-aways? May not some pious charitable Physitian go about, according to his skill which God hath given him, and without taking any thing, use the means of healing the poor sick, and lame, in imitation of Christs great pity, who went about healing all manner of diseases, because he cannot cure miraculously, infallibly, and universally as Christ did? May not some man that hath but ability, after the example of our Saviours compassion, pity a multitude that abide three days, having nothing to eat, and feed them, because he cannot miraculously multiply loaves? May we not be bid to be holy and perfect as our Lord is holy and perfect, though no miracle can lift us up to equal or come near his holiness or perfection? What a lame Exception therefore have you given against the Churches excellent Prayer? But if the Church moreover in this Prayer, and in this Fast, and in some lowly degree of petitioned imitation of her Saviour, hath but imitated the piety, and followed the Doctrine of the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church, and been a follower of them as they were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Christ; then bless we God, who hath given us such a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and God send her more dutifull Children.

                  </gap> untruth, or false Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is this: (which contains three in it) <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>That adoring God not kneeling on the Lords days, and using the white garment, and milk and honey after Baptism, had more pretence of Apostolical Tradition, and were generally used more anciently then Lent.</q> This you being never able to prove, in your insinuation that the Church may as well be called contentious for her not using those things, as you for not using Lent, we do indeed (according to your own words) think ye have wronged the Church, and that greatly. 2. That the Church hath shewn you any such example of changing so the Fast of Lent, as that you may be allowed by that example not to continue it a Religious Fast, is another untruth. Upon which let <hi>Tertullian</hi> ask you the Question, <hi>l. de Coron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And we have seen, as you bid, what follows, and find the direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary from those very Fathers which there follow. Upon so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny untruths, any one may build as many others, as are there collected in your Reply. Other things there are, which you know not, and should know. You know not, you say, of any such things as General Councils, except ye retract afterwards your words by a correction that none but your selves gave you occasion of. For we believe the tradition and practise of the Paschal or Lent-Fast to be elder then all General Councils: And do find it in the first General Council, not institued, or commanded, where it needed not; but in plain words there supposed as a thing long before known throughout the Christian world. And so all your following discourse of the Commands of General Councils, or of a Councel of the Bishops of one Empire, is wholly impertinent. To shew you now the oddes betwixt the Apostolical Tradition of the Paschal Fast of Lent, and those you mention, that the three mentioned by you had not as you say more pretence, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> equal, shall appear, if you can now be entreated to go about to prove any one, or all of those three from the like antiquity, universality of practise, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of Testimony; with which I yet pretend to have proved this of
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:101417:175"/>
the Paschal or Lenten Fast. 2. Since our Controversie is about a binding Apostolical<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tradition, and no other, one certain mark of such binding Apostolical Tradition is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, when the Universal Church which alwayes shall continue Apostolical (because alwayes built upon the rock and foundation which the Apostles have laid) hath never ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally by di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>use in any age laid it aside, This we defend of the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal or Lent-Fast; tell us now, whether you are ready to maintain the like of all those three? But whether you will do that or no; if that be but at all true, what you now say that the Churches changing is an argument of a thing not binding, and therefore not Apostolical and perpetual: Those of the three which you do not prove never to have been by the Church changed, may not by you be pretended to be a binding Apostolical Tradition. Of the very first of them your selves when you needed for an argument below, do prove that it was laid by, without any repeal by following Councels. Now shew us if you can when the Paschal Fast of Lent was laid by at any time, or when it began (if not from the Apostles) or when 'twas not (though you cannot tell us the beginning.) but if you can neither, and yet cann't be silent, consider the Rule of St. <hi>Augustine</hi> so oft by him pressed against the Donatists, that such things which ever have been continued in the Church Universal, nor were at first brought in with any plenary Councel, are to be believed to have come from the Apostles: and tell us whether St. <hi>Austin</hi> did therein insufficiently, blindly and superstitiously oppose the Donatists; to what you say of St. <hi>Hierom's Ep. ad Lucin. Unaquaeque provincia abundet in suo sensu &amp; praecepta majorum leges Apostolicas arbitretur.</hi> I answer, he saith not <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones Apostolorum arbitretur.</hi> The Apostles Law binds us to observe the Customs of the Churches of God (whiles the Governours of the Church continue them to be such) and so by authority Apostolical they are to be obeyed. 2. There may have been truly different Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons also Apostolical in divers Countryes, as in the very first Ages: Primitive Bishops and Martyrs have witnessed, such as <hi>Policarp. Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetus, &amp;c.</hi> You are charged by your Opponents, that according to the Apostles rule, if you shall oppose your selves against the custom of the Churches of God, your are among the number of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious persons according to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 16. And far be from you the portion which abides contentious persons, which yet you may read <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 8, 9. You reply, that you are not contentious, <q>for not following both the purer times of the Church; and the latter

times, in that wherein they are to one another contrary;</q> But it is the greatest height of the spirit of Contention, not onely to follow (neither, the former and purer times, nor the latter) bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> also to set at contention or contrariety the former and latter times of the Church, in that wherein they agree; <hi>viz.</hi> in the substance of some Paschal, or Lent-Fast. So that they were so many superfluous questions which you asked, What Churches, or what ages you must conform to? till you find us some age in the Church, wherein the Church (in its gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality) may not be said to have observed this Religious Fast of Lent. 2. Why ye are not tyed (when no body sayes ye are not tyed) ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to imitate the purer ages, then the more corrupt? Our answer is, that such open opposition of the Catholick Churches Custom in that point, is a corrupt degeneration of this Age. Next when you ask where God hath commanded you to follow the greater number; surely nowhere, if you speak of the greater number of the world; But if you speak of the Church Universal, and of her prescribed Canons, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal rule of her Pastors; how come the Presbyterians to give that priviledg to a Classis of the Presbytery, which they deny to the Church Universal? For either in such Classis you give your presiding Presbyter a power to himself, with the minor part to determine against the Major; which is to be more then a Bishop in your account; or else the Major part may determine against the Minor, or ye can never determine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, if but one or two do dissent. If God hath made the Church Universal a body, as sure he hath, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. tell us whether there is not a power in every body over its ordinary members, and what power can that be, if upon difference the greater part doth not stand for the Community? But we speak of such obligation as binds to acquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence, or silence at least. When God ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e that two or three should speak, and the rest should judg (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.) Whether did the fewer judg the more, or the more judg the fewer? And if that be true even in Prophets, that the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If you say they are fallible, so say I; and if you infer, What obedience then can you owe them? if you please, this implies that you need not obey any Governours at all, but such as are infallible; and so none now upon earth, because all such may erre; and if you judg they erre, there is no sin in disobeying them, least you should erre with them.

               <p>Thus liberally you see we deal with you: But at last you earnestly beseech us, that we would be cautious how we obtrude upon you a forraign Power under the name of Christs Church. I answer, First, We assure you, that we your Brethren having by our Oath (according to what was our Judgement and Duty otherwise) renounced utterly all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Jurisdictions, Powers, Superiorities and Authorities) have kept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably our Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy not turning aside after <hi>Absalon,</hi> nor <hi>Adoni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Secondly, We fear lest you be in much more danger of that, then we; for you professing a Catholick Church in the Creed you were baptized into, and in your Writings, and yet professing now to know none, but either a forraign Church, or the Kings Subjects, which Subjects of our gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign you know to be only a part of the Catholick Church: upon the whole matter you acknowledge a Catholick Church, and yet acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge no other, but some forraign Church. Again you reply, If it be said, That the Church hath Authority to command, <q>We desire to know what Church that is, and where to be found and heard, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
                  </q> And a little after you tell us, (rightly supposing indeed that we do not mean any pretended head of the Church Universal) <q>You can find no Church of Christ, but either the National Church of <hi>England,</hi> which are the Kings Subjects, or some forrain Church, and you not know therefore what we mean;</q> then hear you St. <hi>Austine</hi> speak our meaning, when he neither spake of the National Church whereof he was a part, nor of any foraign Church, yet pronounces, that to dispute against that which the Universal Church practiseth, <hi>Insolentissimae est insaniae,</hi> (Epist. 119.)

nor in the Councels of following times; and yet because they are observed through the Church Universal, are believed to have been by them delivered and commended. If you understand St. <hi>Austines</hi> meaning, you understand ours: If you know the Church he spake of, you know the Church we speak of. But whatsoever we mean, you say, we seem to contradict the forecited Article of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But why? Doth i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>As to your exception against what was said of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Fast till noon, you should before your declamation have well considered that Fast of St. <hi>Peter</hi> mention'd <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 9, 10 Four things are in the Text observable, as at least sufficiently implyed. 1. That it was about the sixth hour, (<hi>i. e.</hi> it may be something after) when others usually, according to our custome are ending their meal; that was the time, I say, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> went up upon the house top to pray, <hi>Verse</hi> 9. Then it follows, <hi>Verse</hi> 10. <hi>And he became exceeding hungry,</hi> viz. <hi>after his Prayer:</hi> Therefore this, yet more after the point of noon; thence continued he fasting while they made ready for him: But yet before he eat, he falls into a trance, in which a vision was presented to him, wherein to him, being hungry, several Creatures were offered, <hi>Arise, Peter, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ay, and eat.</hi> The mystical signification of this Vision we all know. but evidently the Providence of God disposed him to that Vision by something a longer delayed and increased hunger. In all this some time is spent beyond Noon, and a hunger raised beyond ordinary. However popularly speaking, since it was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it might be called St. <hi>Peter's</hi> Fast till Noon. Here you mentioning your selves, and your temperance, and something of Princes, and Students, and some Tradesmen, (not all surely) seem to forget that the Fast of <hi>Lent,</hi> as <hi>St. Bernard</hi> may have taught us, was intended ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily for the generality of all Christians, in ordinary strength of years and body (when not in the accident of extraordinary labour) so that the ordinary labourers are herein included, <note place="margin">

The superaddition of Wednesday to the former Fish-dayes, which part of the Statute stands repealed, 3. <hi>Car.</hi> (<hi>c.</hi> 4.) 2. The increase of the penalty only upon any transgressors of the former Acts concerning Fish-dayes. Both these that Statute declares to be only for political ends, as other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique Laws are, and be, <hi>viz.</hi> both the superaddition of Wednesday, (wherein they gave leave to have flesh also at Table, so that the wonted fish were there served up also) and also the augmented pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty to be only in favour to the political concernment; and who, think you, believes, that any forbearing of flesh, or eating of fish menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in that Statute, is of any necessity for the saving of the soul of man? and yet that mentioned in the preamble of the 2. and 3. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardi</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 19. may be, and is a mean to vertue, and to subdue the flesh unto the Spirit, which is not at all mentioned in this of 5. <hi>Eliz.</hi> 5. as to the constituting and enacting part, but only as to another penalty upon the other, the politick end: Ask the learned in the Law, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that of the 2. and 3. <hi>Edward.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 19. were repealed by this;

but of that you were wise to take no notice at all. 3. No Act did not repeal in any word any part of that 2. and 3. <hi>Edvardi</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 19. But in all Acts touching dayes of Abstinence, as 5 and 6. <hi>Edward.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 3. great regard is had by a special clause that none should mistake, as if the present Act did extend to abrogate, or take away the Absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence in L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>CHAP. 10.</hi> The judgment of the Right R. Fathers in God, <hi>Lancelot Andrews</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and <hi>John Cosin</hi> the present Lord Bishop of <hi>Durham;</hi> also (in some measure) of the most Reverend Father in God Arch-Bishop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> and Bishop <hi>Montague.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BIshop <hi>Andrews</hi> in his fifth Sermon of Repentance, <hi>p.</hi> 216. saith, He [Christ] that in this place [St. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 16.] saith, <hi>Cum jejunatis,</hi> when ye fast; saith in another, <hi>Tum jejunabunt,</hi> then they shall fast; and that amounts to a <hi>Precept</hi> (I trow) And <hi>p.</hi> 217. They that were under Grace, went far beyond them under the Law in their <hi>Cùm,</hi> and in their <hi>jejunatis</hi> both. And in the 223. and 224. <hi>p.</hi> of the same Sermon, speaking of the yearly recurrent fast of <hi>Lent,</hi> he saith, <q>It is a custome of the Church, while it was <hi>à Christo recens,</hi> yet fresh and warm from Christ, the Church which was the mother of the Apostles themselves, at all times kept; everywhere observed <hi>then,</hi> and <hi>ever since.</hi> Some to resist it, frame to themselves a fear of (I wot not what) Superstition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where no fear is. Before any Superstition was stirring, any Popery hatched, it was, this Fast was. <hi>Lex abstinendi in quadragesim semper fuit in Ecclesia</hi> (saith the Oracle of Antiquity, <hi>Theophilus Alexandrinus</hi>) Lent was ever in the Church; <hi>Nos unam quadragesimam secundum traditionem Apostolorum:</hi> We have but one Lent, (the <hi>Montanists</hi> had three) but that one was delivered us by the Apostles (saith St. <hi>Ierome</hi>) why should I weary you with reckoning them up? what one more ancient Writer then other is there, but you shall find it in him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, even up to <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who lived with the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?

                     <hi>Apostolike</hi> then it is; and for such St. <hi>Hierome</hi> avowss it; and when that is said, enough is said for it I think, yet it is good (you know it) the Fast so delivered, and by the Church <hi>ever,</hi> and <hi>every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where</hi> so kept; the Council of <hi>Gangra</hi> hath laid an <hi>Anathema</hi> on them that keep it not, <hi>avoid it how they can that keep it not.</hi>—e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man (so we would have it) to be left to himself, for Prayer, Fasting, Sacrament; nay for Religion too (now) and all? for Gods sake let it not be so—let us have our dayes appointed, and our h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Fast privately in Gods Name; but hear you; let not the Church trust to that; nor she hath not held it wisdom so to do: but, as in both them (Prayer and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament) so in this, hold us to our order of dayes and times esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished. Them if we keep, so it is; otherwise, were it not for the Churches times, I doubt there would be taken scarce any time at all. Now yet somewhat is done; but leave it once at liberty, liberty hath lost us some already, and will loose us the rest, if it be not looked to in time. <hi>Pag.</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. this Fast is called <hi>Iejunium. paschalo;</hi> for Easter and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
