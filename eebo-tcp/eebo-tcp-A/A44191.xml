            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The GENERAL PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THE name of the</hi> Lord Hollis <hi>is so well known, both to the Active, and Contemplative part of Mankind, that no more need be said to recommend any Papers to the World, than to give Assurance that they were his, and by him Designed for the Press.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am perswaded that most who Read the first of these ensuing Treatises, and have been conversant in that</hi> Great Man<hi>'s Writings, cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this, for the Genuine product of his large Soul, and close way of Reasoning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But besides the inward testimony of the thing it self, we have other suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:94716:3"/>
               <hi>proof of its being Authentick, from such as had the Honour of a familiarity with that</hi> Extraordinary Person <hi>in his life time, to whom he communicated his thoughts on this Subject, as he from time to time committed them to Paper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He lived not to finish any more of his Answer to the</hi> Grand Question, &amp;c. <hi>than what is now published; but often affirmed that he had Conquer'd all the difficulties in it: Nature was spent, and all the Oyl of his Vital Lamp was consumed, before he could advance fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his Pen: And when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that he had past the Age of Man, having arrived to his eighty first year, and that he still continued Writing for Eternity, when he was upon quitting this Mortal state, we may well say that his Life went not out in a Snuff, as most very aged men expire; but that he ascended to Heaven in a bright flame, which still continues to enlighten us that remain here below.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:94716:3"/>
               <hi>Surely I cannot be taxt of imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, if I here strew upon his Herse some of</hi> Cicero<hi>'s happy flowers, since one would think they sprung up now for this very purpose,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Est etiam quietae, &amp; purae, atque eleganter actae aeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis placida, ac lenis <note place="margin">Cicero de Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctute. ult. edit. tom. 4. f. 532.</note> senectus, qualem ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepimus <hi>Platonis,</hi> qui uno &amp; octagesimo aetatis anno <hi>Scribens Mortuus</hi> est.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let no Man say that it misbecame him to spend his time thus, when he was posting to Eternity: He had found</hi> Truth <hi>to stand in need of his Defence, and his own Reputation was called in question upon his appearing for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And next to Devotion, (which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt had a due share of his time,) nothing perhaps can give a greater fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taste of the joys of Heaven, than the sense of a Mans having fully vindicated</hi> Truth, <hi>and his own good name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:94716:4"/>
               <hi>The Author of the</hi> Considerations <hi>is likewise a person of great Age, and well known for his great Learning: Nor would his Name, if made publick, give any small Reputation to his Book: But he is so sincere a Lover of Truth, that I dare say, he would not have any Man byast with a previous disposition to believe, that there is more force in his Arguments than he finds, but leaves them to their natural energy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For me to pretend to give the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of such Authors as these two, would he a presumption beyond what I am guilty of, in putting some Papers of mine in the retinue of theirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But though my Character cannot do sufficient Right to either; yet a Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Mr.</hi> Hunt<hi>'s Errors may be a piece of Justice to the</hi> Lord Hollis, <hi>who has been much undervalued by this</hi> warm Author. <hi>And as Mr.</hi> Hunt <hi>is a Man justly in Reputation for his Parts and Literature, unless it be shewn</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:94716:4"/>
               <hi>that his Authority is of no great weight in this sort of Learning, he might wound by his Censure where he doth no great feats with his</hi> Argument.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I doubt not but he will pardon my freedom with him, since he has used as much, or more, with what I have formerly published to the World. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed by his</hi> Preface <hi>one would think, that he had wrote before I had set out any thing relating to Antiquities: But then he must needs have understood by way of Prophecy what I would say about the Curia Regis, great part of which he makes use of, and concerning the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of King Iohn's Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and several other things, which he opposes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am sensible that enough has been said by the</hi> Two learned Authors <hi>(on whose Papers mine attend:) to clear the</hi> Question concerning the Bishops Voting in Capital Cases in Parliament, <hi>from all the dust raised by Mr.</hi> Hunt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:94716:5"/>
               <hi>But he having put things together in another manner than had been done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, some might think it requisite that there should be a particular Answer gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to every thing of his that bears the face of an Argument, both upon the account of the weight his Assertions may carry with many, and the want of Judgement in others, to apply what may be found in these</hi> Treatises <hi>to silence all Objections, in how different a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner soever they may be repeated. And truly this I had done according to my Talent, but considering that those things are wrote for the Learned, whose Judgements are too delicateisoon to rellish the same dish drest over and over again; I thought it convenient to suspend the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of what has occurr'd to me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Subject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nor shall I at present interpose in that Controversie any further, than to free my self from a two-horned Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which I were very dull not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:94716:5"/>
               <hi>my self to be concerned in, if not solely aim'd at by it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Having first taken a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the</hi> Great, <hi>or</hi> General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil <hi>of the Nation, to which</hi> Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors <hi>of Lands, as such, had right to come, till</hi> 49 <hi>H.</hi> 3. <hi>And the Curia Regis compos'd of the Kings immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Tenants, and Officers; I had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to enquire into the nature of the Curia Regis, mentioned in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of</hi> Clarendon, <hi>which obliges the Ecclesiastick Tenants</hi> in Capite, <hi>interesse judiciis Curiae Regis quousque perveniatur ad dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutionem membrorum, vel ad mortem. This I took to relate to Judgements in the Curia Regis, as such: And the ground of coming to the</hi> Great, <hi>or</hi> General Council <hi>being different from that of coming to the Curia; From thence I conceived might be gathered a sufficient Reason, why the Bishops might have been allow'd</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:94716:6"/>
               <hi>to vote in a Legislative Capacity in cases of Blood: And yet that practice might no ways</hi>

            <p>If it was the <hi>Curia Regis</hi> wherein the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Justice of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi>'s Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>p.</hi> 17.</note> was admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred,

and not the Parliament was intended in the Assize of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> in which the priviledge and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence under the <hi>quosque</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to Bishops, then the Assize of <hi>Clarendon</hi> is unduly urg'd against the Bishops judging in Cases of Blood in Parliament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And consequently by the Assize of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendon</hi> the Bishops have no leave to withdraw. If the Court wherein <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> was tryed was the <hi>Curia Regis,</hi> then the Bishops judging in that Court in that cause doth most clearly declare (that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a case in point) that the <hi>quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usque</hi> was an indulgence which they might use or wave.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>his mistake of the Fact in relation to</hi> Becket<hi>'s Tryal, as if he were Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a Capital Offence: In both which I doubt not but he will receive Conviction to the contrary from these two</hi> Learned Authors: <hi>I am bold to say, that there is no manner of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in the first Branch of his</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma, <hi>which is the only thing that can lye upon me to answer: And truly, I conceive, that it by no means follows, that because the Curia Regis in the</hi> Constitution of Clarendon <hi>is not the whole</hi> Parliament, <hi>but only that Court which (either when a</hi> Parliament <hi>was held, or when only a</hi> Council of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants in Capite, <hi>or</hi> Lords, <hi>assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled) had the sole exercise of the</hi> Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Power, <hi>that therefore Iudgements in</hi> Parliament <hi>before the Lords, such as were Members of the Curia, are not affected by that</hi> Constitution, <hi>any more than we can now say, the</hi> House of Lords <hi>cannot be concerned in any</hi>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THE former trouble I gave you upon this Subject, you pulled upon your self by desiring my opinion in it; but for this I now give you, I must beg your pardon, it being singly upon my own account, to do my self <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ht, and justifie what I then wrote to you, against several asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions cast upon me in a Pamphlet entituled, <hi>The Right of Bishops to judge in Capital Cases in Parliament, &amp;c.</hi> made it seems by the same person, who had set out the other Pamphlet intituled, <hi>The Honours of the Spiritual Lords asserted, &amp;c.</hi> Of which I gave you some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in a Postscript to my former Letter, and I think, without any sharp reflection either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Author or his work. The most I said was, When I had instanced in three notorious falsifications of his: The first is, <hi>p.</hi> 112. where he quotes Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> to prove, That the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualty made their Proxies in Capital Causes in more Parliaments than the 21 <hi>R.</hi> 2. for that they did it likewise in the 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. and 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. which I shew was a mistake, and only said he could not find it so in the Record it self, but that he took it upon trust out of the Margin of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94716:10"/>
Mr. <hi>Seldens</hi> book of the Priviledges of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronage <hi>p.</hi> 125. where there is such a quotation of the 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. and the 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. but wholly misapplyed by our Assertor of Honours; for Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> alledges that Precedent to shew, that whereas 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. it was by the then Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> assigned as an error in the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder of his Father, (who was condemned of High-Treason in the 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4.) because it was done <hi>Sans Assent des Prelates,</hi> which are the words of the Record, <hi>Without the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Prelates</hi> (by the way speaks nothing of Proxies) it was then adjudged to be no error, and his Petition rejected, which in truth is a strong Argument to prove that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates had no right to be present at such Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and Judgments, which is the main Question between us. And though he being of another mind, had maintained his opinion by so gross a prevarication, I was so far from retorting it upon him with any bitterness, saying, <hi>It was disingenious, and a suppressing of truth, and not set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting things down faithfully;</hi> which is his ordinary language concerning me: Or with insipid jeers, saying, I wear a sharp Sword, a Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant Toledo, as one of the younger house of great <hi>Alexander;</hi> and that he brings me to the Sun like <hi>Alexanders</hi> Horse; and telling of the Magical combate in <hi>Apuleius;</hi> and a City of Birds in <hi>Aristophanes,</hi> and such other scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralous passages as his Book is full of; which shews the sweetness of the Gentlemans nature, and the goodness of his cause, which he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains only by railing and false assertions: Whereas I rather lessened his fault, saying,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94716:10"/>
only that he was mistaken, <hi>by being misled by the Printers misplacing the quotation,</hi> so excusing him from any wilful error, and purposely vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of untruths.</p>
                  <p>I do the like in another great falshood of his in the page following, upon his citing a Record 21 <hi>R.</hi> 2. In the case of the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> which he makes to be, <hi>That the Lord Steward by the assent of the King, Bishops and Lords, adjudged the said Earl guilty of Treason;</hi> whereas the Record runs, <hi>That the Lord Steward by the commandment of the King and all the Temporal Lords, and Sr.</hi> Thomas Percy, <hi>empowered by the Prelates, and all the Clergy of the Kingdom, judged him guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp;c.</hi> This you see is a foul misrepresenting of his Precedent, and imposing upon the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a falshood instead of a true Record, for it shews that no Bishop was personally present, and I make it out, That the putting of a Lay-man in their steads, is a strong evidence of the incapacity of all Clergy men to be any of them personally present at any of those Tryals. Yet in this I rather excuse our bold Assertor, shewing how he was misled here likewise by Sr. <hi>Robert Cottons</hi> Abridgment; and only add this, <hi>That methinks one should not venture to quote a Record upon any mans allegation without consulting the Record it self, which,</hi> I said, <hi>I am sure he had not done;</hi> which I think was as gentle a reprimand as could be, and shews, That I supposed him such a lover of truth, as that if he had known it a falshood, he would not have made use of it, only he was deceived, relying upon the authority of that learned
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94716:11"/>
Antiquary, Sir <hi>Robert Cotton;</hi> but in truth I am now of another mind, and see my Gentleman hath a large Conscience, and a mercenary Pen to publish any thing right or wrong to please those that set him on work.</p>
                  <p>His third notorious falshood is, The Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, which he cites of <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> who he saith, 3 <hi>H.</hi> 5. <hi>was tryed in Parliament, upon an accusation of Treason, and found guilty; the Lords Spiritual being personally present, and bids us see the Record of it in the</hi> Tower: To which I only say, That he had not done it himself, for he would have found it contrary to what he asserts; and that the Earl of <hi>Cambridge</hi> was tryed, condemned and executed at <hi>Southampton</hi> by a special Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that his Attainder was afterwards brought into Parliament, and there confirmed by Act of Parliament, at which the Bishops might be present.</p>
                  <p>Now I pray you Sir, do you judge if I gave him any occasion for such a reply as he hath made to me throughout, from the beginning to the end of his Pamphlet: and if he should not first have considered the Beam in his own eye, and have purged himself, and given the world satisfaction for these gross mistakes of his, rather than add more to them as he hath done all along his book, with language fitter for <hi>Billingsgate,</hi> than for the eyes or ears of any sober man: But I see it is the nature of the Beast, as the Proverb is, which he cannot help, therefore we must take him as he is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Naturam expellas furca licet, usque recurret.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:94716:11"/>
And now Sir I must beseech you to pardon the trouble I have given you with this long Recapitulation of those his falshoods in his former Pamphlet: In which I have been the longer to set forth the advantage he gave to one that would have fallen soul upon him, and how gently I dealt with him, thereby to justifie, or at least something excuse my sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness with him now (which I confess and am sorry for) for his base return of scoffings and railings against me, not fit for a Gentleman, who deserved better at his hands, and gave him not the least provocation for it: But tread upon a Worm, and it will turn again. And so I shall apply my self to answer what he saith as to his Arguments in the maintenance of his Assertions, which I think will not prove very convincing, and will follow him, as he sayes he would follow me, step by step, and I hope I shall make it appear, that he hath made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a false step, and will begin with his Postula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta's as he calls them, wherein he saith we do agree, but he means I think like Dogs and Cats.</p>
                  <p>His first Postulatum is concerning the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of the Bishops 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. Wherein he saith we both agree that it is a Law, <hi>But that I have not set it down faithfully, leaving out the most considerable things in it, because they make against me;</hi> which if I have done, I am a very bad man, and may pass not as he stiles me for, <hi>One of the younger house of great</hi> Alexander, but rather of the house of this great Asserter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who is the chief of the family of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serters of untruths. His charge against me is,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94716:12"/>
for leaving out a passage in my recital of this Protestation, which is, what they say in the beginning of it, and likewise towards the end of it, claiming themselves to be Peers, and that in right of their Peerage by the Laws and Customes of the Kingdom, they ought to be personally present in all Parliaments. Then he subjoyns another Protestation in the 28 <hi>H</hi> 6. which he saith also I have not cited <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and ingenuously, as I ought to have done.</hi> This is a great charge upon me if it be true, that I have done any thing unfaithfully and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuously, of which I hope I shall be able to purge my self.</p>
                  <p>And first give me leave to make a Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for my self in the general, which I do upon the faith of a Christian and an honest Man, and it is this, That neither in the citing of these Records, or any other throughout my Letter to you, I have purposely and willingly left out or concealed any thing that I thought mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, because it made against my opinion: But what I have written is the naked truth as I am fully perswaded in my Soul and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and all that I have done in it hath been singly and meerly for the discovery of the truth, and the satisfying of my self and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of which I take the searcher of all hearts to witness; and let our Asserter say so much if he dares, though for venting falshoods for truths, I find him a daring man.</p>
                  <p>And now to come to these particulars, I will first lay before you upon what ground and to what end I urged that Protestation of the Bishops, 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. It was for two reasons,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94716:12"/>
One to shew, That it being at their desire en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled in full Parliament by the assent of the King, Lords Temporal and Commons, it came to be the Law of the Land, though it had not been so before: The second thing was to shew that the Salvo of the Prelates in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation extended only to their Right of Sitting in Parliament in other cases, but not in Cases of Blood; and that they did not therein at all pretend to that: which I think I very clearly proved in that Letter, to which I refer my self. But for these omissions which he makes so criminal: As for the first, concerning my not expressing that they made their Peerage a ground of their Protestation: I answer, That since what I conceived and maintained to have been their end in their Protestation, which was, Only to assert and lay claim to their Right of being present in Parliament in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters, but matters of Blood, was not at all controverted by me, but that, to which I fully agreed <hi>in omnibus,</hi> I did not think it at all necessary nor proper to insert what moved them to make such a Protestation, but only so much as was to the purpose for what I alledged that Precedent: The matter of their Peerage is another point, for which in truth there is little ground, notwithstanding all their claim to it; and that it be sometimes attributed unto them by such as desire to please them, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps by many ignorantly and mislead to it, in regard of their sitting in the Upper House of Parliament, and having a Parity of Vote with the Temporal Lords in the Legislative part, and likewise in the judicial part of that House,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94716:13"/>
in all other Cases but of Blood, from which they have been particularly debarred both by their own Canon Law, and afterwards by the Law of the Land, and the custome and usage of Parliament, which may very well make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny persons not considering the true nature of Peerage, nor examining with care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence what in that particular our Law saith, and what hath been the usage of Parliament, give them that Appellation: But I have in my former Letter cleared also this point (I think) very fully, and shall say more to it in this, when I come to answer that Article hereafter in course, as our Assertor brings me to it, for this now is but by the way upon occasion of this his first Postulatum.</p>
                  <p>And now for his other charge upon my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful citing the Protestation in 28 <hi>H.</hi> 6. leaving out how the Lords Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral joyned in challenging their Right of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, and that the Judgment given by the King concerning the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> should not turn to their prejudice, but they and their Successors should enjoy their liberties in case of their Peerage hereafter, as freely and as large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as their Ancestors had before them: I shall give a like answer to this as I did to the other, I concealed nothing that was necessary and proper to be said, which may appear by my letting forth particularly the whole proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that Tryal, step by step, how the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates joyned in the management of it, from the beginning to the end; therefore certainly it had been no more a disadvantage to me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that the Prelates claimed such a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94716:13"/>
Right in a verbal Protestation, than that they did actually exercise it, as I say they did all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in the whole transaction of that business: Therefore if it was designedly done, it was a weak design in me; my end was only to shew the palpable extravagances of that Tryal, and of the Kings taking upon himself to give the Judgment, and so mentioned the Lords Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing against it, in which the Prelates joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Temporal Lords, as well as they had in all the foregoing passages of it: for the matter of their Peerage, I reserved it still to be spoken to in a clause apart by it self, when it comes to be the proper subject matter in question, I did it in my former Letter to you, and I shall do the same in this.</p>
                  <p>His second Postulatum is concerning Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, in which he saith we both agree that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops may and ought to be present, and <hi>yet Attainders,</hi> saith he, <hi>are matters of Blood; and</hi> learnedly he adds, <hi>That it is not material in the Judgment of any considering person, which way a mans life is taken away, whether by way of Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or by Impeachment;</hi> and infers further, That the Canon Law, which by a jeer he saith, I call the Law of Laws, is not so indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly obliging. And our Asserter it seems puts himself into the rank of those consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing persons, that make an Attainder and an Impeachment two distinct species or kinds of proceeding against a Criminal person to take away Life, saying it is not material which of the two wayes life is taken away, whether by Attainder or Impeachment. Oh the Ignora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, that wants a considering Cap to judge
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94716:14"/>
aright and know what an Attainder is, which is what follows upon the Conviction and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the guilty Person, be it upon an Impeachment in Parliament and Tryal there in a judicial way, or by an Act of Parliament in the Legislative way, or by a special Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> under the great Seal; the Attainder is the Result and Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of those three wayes of Tryal and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and not a distinct thing running in a different channel from an Impeachment or from any of the other wayes of Tryal, being the end and consequent as I say of all Tryals, when the person is found Guilty. The Term <hi>Attainder</hi> or <hi>Attainted</hi> implies so much, which our Etymologists derive from the Latin <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingere,</hi> to Touch or Reach to a thing; Now a Criminal person is touched or reached unto, and seized upon by the Law, upon an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment and Tryal in Parliament, or by a Tryal out of Parliament by Commission, as well as by an Act of Parliament, so I think one may give it this Definition, That it is a Notion in Law, whereby the Law reacheth and seiseth upon a Condemned person, taints his Blood and divesteth him of all his Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges both in publick and private concerns, which he enjoyed before as a Free Man of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides, our confident Asserter doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the nature of the Question in controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy, which is not, Whether a Bishop <hi>quatenus</hi> a Bishop, an Ecclesiastical person in holy Orders, may be present as a Judge in any case when mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Blood are agitated? and whether the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94716:14"/>
Canon Law be so obliging, as that in no case he may, but whether by the Law of the Land, and the custome and usage of Parliament, the Bishops be forbidden it, when the House of Peers acts in a judicial capacity to condemn any body, and not when they pass an Act of Parliament for it, and I think it is clearly made out, That they may in the latter case, passing a Law for it, and not in the former, to act as Judges in a judicial way.</p>
                  <p>His third Postulatum is concerning the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Commons 21 <hi>R.</hi> 2. That in regard divers Judgments in Parliament had been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore undone and repealed, for that the Lords Spiritual were not present at them, the King would command them to make some their common Procurator with sufficient authority thereunto; which would put an end to all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies: To this he saith, That for me to demand what in particular those Judgments were at this distance of time, is neither equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table nor rational: And truely I made no such demand, for I do very well know what judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the Commons did then not intend, which were all Judgments in Capital Cases; for it is most clear by all Records of Parliament, and all the <hi>vestigia</hi> that remain with us of the usage and proceedings of antient Parliaments, that there is not the least colour for so much as a doubt or a suspition that the Prelates or Lords Spiritual could have any part in those Judgments. And we know on the other side, what judgments they had their shares in, which were all Judgments in such Civil Causes as came into the Parliament, and in Criminal
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94716:15"/>
Causes that were not Capital, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons then could intend none but these, which was enough to satisfie me, that this Petition of theirs at that time was no wayes contrary or repugnant to what I maintained. And by the way, methinks it is worth observation, the reason they give of their desire that the Bishops would make a Proctor, not so much for that, that their presence there was of so absolute necessity, as that what was done without them was in it self null and void, but <hi>to put an end to all controversies;</hi> which shews the Prelates had expressed some dissatisfaction, and had gotten some things which had been done in their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence to be undone and Repealed, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering their power at that time, and how all the Laity was in awe of them, would have a great effect upon mens minds, and make them do what else they would not have done, and perhaps strain a point a little to satisfie them: And still it shews, that notwithstanding their absence they were good and valid, till the same power that had made them did Repeal them. And to shew what an ascendant the Prelates had over King and Parliament and the whole Kingdom at that time, see what they did but the year before 20 <hi>R.</hi> 2. They declared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King in open Parliament, <hi>That they were sworn to the Pope and See of</hi> Rome, <hi>and if any thing were in Parliament attempted in restraint of the same, they would in no wise assent thereunto, but would utterly withstand the same:</hi> and can we then wonder, if the Commons were not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry loth to displease them, and willing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with them much rather than have a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94716:15"/>
with them, and perhaps be fain at last to undo what they had done?</p>
                  <p>His fourth Postulatum is upon the Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Viscount <hi>Beaumont</hi> in the name of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in the Case of <hi>William de Pole</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> which hath been touched upon before, wherein he now saith I have left out the most material words; but what they are he expresseth not, nor can I imagine what he means; As I have already said, I have been very particular in setting down every circumstance of the whole proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, acknowledged the actings of the Prelates in it thoroughout as far forth as the Temporal Lords, and then I say, how upon the Kings gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Judgment upon the Duke, that Viscount in the name of the Lords Spiritual and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral made that Protestation, <hi>That it should not be nor turn in prejudice nor derogation of them, their heirs, ne of their Successors in time to come.</hi> I think this was sufficient to shew that I did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg all that could be pretended to for the Bishops Judicature in that business, and what this Assertor would have more, and wherein I have failed I can not imagine, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I see he is a quick-sighted Gentleman and can see further into a Milstone, than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, and spy a fault which another can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see.</p>
                  <p>He hath a fifth Postulatum, to whichI can say nothing, for I understand not what he would be at, he speaks of my accurateness in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a distinction between the Matter andForm of a Law, and then saith, He observes three things (though he expresseth but two) which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94716:16"/>
he saith, he shall have occasion to make use of hereafter when he comes to speak of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Cases; and I must refer my Answer to what I shall there find, when I believe I shall make it appear that he makes no great use of them, nor of any other Argument that he brings.</p>
                  <p>And now I come to the particular Cases, the first is 4 <hi>E.</hi> 3. of <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> Earl of <hi>March</hi> being then condemned for Treason. Here our Asserter saith, That by 28 <hi>E</hi> 3. up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Cousin <hi>Roger</hi> of <hi>Wigmore</hi>'s petitioning to have this Judgment and Attainder reversed, I acknowledg it to be an Attainder, <hi>If I say truth, say nothing to the purpose.</hi> This is gentile language, and which discovers my Gentlemans ignorance, as well as his rudeness; his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in conceiving an Attainder to be only by a Law, by an Act of Parliament, in which Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops may be present, and if they were not so, but did withdraw, it was their own voluntary act, and no diminution to their Rights: I have already upon his second Postulatum handled this point so fully, and made I think both his errour and the truth so clear, as I need not say any thing more to it here.</p>
                  <p>Then it is a pretty Argument he brings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst my saying, That the Record being, <hi>Les queur Counts, Barons &amp; Piers les Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles per eur eramine; rebindrent, &amp;c. Which Earls, Barons and Peers having examined the Articles returned,</hi> &amp;c. It must be inferred that the Bishops cannot be comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the word <hi>Peers,</hi> since the Barons are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med first; To this his Answer is, <hi>Well but I find</hi>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:94716:16"/>
                     <hi>the contrary, Peers</hi> many times put before Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, particularly in Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s Baronage, <hi>p.</hi> 12. then he cites a Record of the Judgment against <hi>John Mautravers,</hi> where it is said, <hi>For which the said Peers of the Land and Judges of Parliament adjudge and award,</hi> &amp;c. Doth this at all contradict my quotation of the Record in <hi>Roger</hi> of <hi>Mortimers</hi> Case, but that it is as I say, <hi>That the general word</hi> Peers <hi>is there put after the Barons, and being so cannot comprehend Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> because in some other Records that word is put before.</p>
                  <p>He talks of drawing arguments illogically, I am sure this is so. I would put him a Case, he brings his Action of Slander against one, for that at such a time in such a place he had spoken ill of him, and said he was a lying Knave, and other words that will bear an Action, and proves it by witness; That man proves by other Witnesses, That at another time and in another place he had spoken very well of him, and said, He was a fine Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; I ask now if he would be satisfied with this, and not stand upon it, that he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Plaint, and expects a Verdict and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon it: So may I say, that my Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent stands good, and proves what I alledge it for, and what he saith, is not to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
                  <p>But I will go further, and make it appear that even his Precedents that he alledges, make all for me, and against himself, and though he charges me with not being so good as my word, saying, That I would run through all the Tryals upon Record, in that I have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94716:17"/>
four in that 4 <hi>E.</hi> 3. I shall give you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of those Tryals in that Parliament, and you will see that I could have no sinister end in not mentioning them, and that all of them prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and confirmed my assertion, that the Bishops had no part in any of them. I expressed as much as was necessary to prove they were not present at <hi>Roger de Mortimers</hi> Earl of <hi>March,</hi> who was the chief and the principal of those Delinquents, and whose Tryal was the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Case to all the rest. I give you the words of the Record, how after the exhibiting of the Articles against him, the King bespake the Judges, the Peers who were to judge him, and charged them in these words, <hi>Dont le dit Sr. le Roy vous charge Counts, Barons, les Piers de son Royalme, que de st come cest choses tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chent principalement, a lui a vous &amp; a tout le people, &amp;c. Therefore our said Lord the King char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges you the Earls, Barons, Peers of his Realm, that as these things chiefly concern him and you and all the people, &amp;c. You give righteous Judgment.</hi> I ask now if this be not as clear as the Sun at noon-day, that by the words of this Record, <hi>I charge you the Earls, Barons, Peers of the Realm,</hi> (which is the same as if he had said, <hi>I charge you Earls and Barons who are the Peers of the Realm)</hi> can be no otherwise understood, but that only the Earls and Barons are the Peers that are there charged, and none else, to give this righteous Judgment: The Earls and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons are the two <hi>Species,</hi> particularly enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and <hi>Peers</hi> is the <hi>genus</hi> which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends both: And the same persons whom the King had so charged are they who tryed and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94716:17"/>
gave Judgement upon the Earl of <hi>March,</hi> as the Record shews it, saying, <hi>Les queux Countes, Barons &amp; Piers,</hi> &amp;c. did judge him guilty of those Treasons. And the very same persons did give Judgement immediately in that very Parliament upon the rest, <hi>viz.</hi> Sir <hi>Simon de Bereford, John Mautravers, Boeges de Bayons,</hi> and the rest. Therefore my not mentioning their Tryals, which our Asserter lays to my charge as a Crime, and a not doing what I had engaged my self to do, which was to run through all the Tryals in those Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Rolls, could not be designedly done, with an intention to conceal any thing which made against me, as it is maliciously and very falsely interpreted, for they all made for me, and it was a passing over <hi>sub silentio,</hi> of so many Precedents that confirmed and fortified what I asserted. And should you, Sir, ask me, why I omitted the mentioning of them? I profess I could give you no good account of it, but that it was a meer inadvertency.</p>
                  <p>When the question first arose about the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature of the Bishops, I took some short notes of some Copies of Records that I had; and then seeing that all those particular Tryals in 4 <hi>E.</hi> 3. hung all upon one string, and were managed by the same persons, it seems I thought it then sufficient to set down the proceedings in the first, which was the rule and foundation of the proceedings in the rest, and afterwards when I came upon your request, to take a little more pains in making my enquiry into the usage of ancient Parliaments, I was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards more exact in it; but when I wrote my
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94716:18"/>
Letter to you, I made use of my notes which I had taken of the first Parliament, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of 4 <hi>E.</hi> 3. where these other Tryals as I say, were left out. But I shall now give you an account what they are, and you will see it was not for my advantage to conceal them, nor would it have been for our Assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers advantage if they had been mentioned; but he quarrels at every thing.</p>
                  <p>Only give me leave before I come to that, to set it down as a general Rule, and a very true one, That wherever there is an enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of particulars of several ranks and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, which goes downwards, beginning with the higher and ending with a lower, and in the close, a general expression is of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be added to, and joined with them,</hi> those others must not be of a higher rank and a superiour degree to that particular which is last mentioned, but either of the same degree, or of a lower. This is a judged Case even in the business of Bishops in <hi>Cokes</hi> second Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s Case, p. 46. <hi>Ad este adjuge que Evesques ne sont in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude deins le Statute,</hi> 13 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 10. <hi>It hath been adjudged that Bishops are not included in the Statute</hi> 13 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 10. <hi>which saith, That Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, Deans and Chapters, Parsons Vicars, and then concludes, and Others having Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Promotions, that these last words cannot include Bishops, for reasons before given, which reasons are upon the Statute of</hi> 31 H. 8. <hi>concerning the dissolution of Abbies, which mentioning their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the Kings hand, by Renouncing, Relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quishing, Forfeiture, Giving up,</hi> &amp;c. and concludes
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94716:18"/>
with general words, <hi>Or any other means; this cannot be understood of an Act of Parliament, which is a higher way of conveyance, than any of those specified.</hi> So Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> upon the Statute of <hi>Westminster</hi> the second, <hi>c.</hi> 41. which saith, <hi>Si Abbates, Priores, Custodes Hospitalium &amp; aliarum domorum Religiosarum,</hi> &amp;c. hath this Comment, <hi>Seeing this Act begins with Abbots,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and concludeth with other Religious Houses, Bishops are not comprehended within this Act, for they are superiour to Abbots,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and these words, Other Religious Houses, shall extend to Houses inferiour to them that were men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before.</hi> So I conclude, that the Record saying, <hi>Earls and Barons and Peers,</hi> &amp;c. the general words, <hi>And Peers,</hi> can comprehend none but some other Peers, equal only, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to Barons, and not any above them, as I am sure Bishops will say they are. And I will tell you when those of a higher degree may, and must be comprehended under a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral expression, that is, when the Enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or Climax (for so I may call it) goes upwards, beginning with a lower Rank, and rising higher in those which they particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize: As if it be said, <hi>Barons, Earls, and all other Peers;</hi> here Marquesses and Dukes will be comprehended, and Bishops also would be, if they were Peers, which they are not; but still I say, if the enumeration descend, none higher than the last mentioned, can be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood to be meant by any general clause.</p>
                  <p>I think you are satisfied that the E. of <hi>March</hi> was Tryed and Judged only by the Temporal Lords to whom the K. had committed his Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94716:19"/>
and charged them only with it. Sir <hi>Simon de Bereford</hi> was the next who was Tryed, and by the same Persons; the Record is <hi>Item en mesme le Parlement si chargea nostre Sur le Roy les ditz Countes, Barons &amp; Piers a donner droit &amp; loyal Iugement come affiert a Simon de Bereford, Chebalier,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Item, in the same Parliament our Lord the King charged the said Earls, Barons and Peers to give a right and loyal Iudgement upon Sir</hi> Simon de Bereford, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It follows afterwards, <hi>Si agarderent &amp; avig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent les ditz Countes, Barons &amp; Piers, come Iuges du Parlement per assent du Roy que le dit Simon come treitre fast treisne &amp; pendu. So the said Earls, Barons and Peers, as Iudges of Parliament, did with the Kings as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, award and adjudge Sir</hi> Simon de Bereford <hi>to be Drawn and Hanged.</hi> You see the same persons were his Judges, who had before Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Condemned the Earl of <hi>March;</hi> yet I must observe a little difference in the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: The King in giving the charge to the Peers in the Earls Case, the words of the Record are, The King charges you Earls, Barons, <hi>Les Piers de son Royalme, The Peers of his Realm,</hi> which must be construed, <hi>Who are the Peers,</hi> or <hi>Being the Peers of his Realm:</hi> And then their Judgement comes to be set down, the Record saith, <hi>Les queux Countes, Barons &amp; Piers, &amp;c. The which Earls, Barons, and Peers,</hi> did so and so, with a Conjunction Copulative <hi>[and]</hi> before Peers, as if there were some other Peers after the Earls and Barons; which if there were, we are sure it could not be the Bishops, which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94716:19"/>
is all that we are to enquire into: We know that heretofore the Kings of <hi>England</hi> did sometimes send Writs of Summons to other persons, that were not Peers of the Realm, but persons of Quality, as Bannerets, and some Officers, as the Warden of the Cinque-Ports, whom I find commonly to be the last set down in the List of those who were summon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And those persons so summoned, came and attended the Parliament, and had Voice and Vote with the Peers, as Members of their House, and as Peers <hi>pro tempore,</hi> and might be comprized under the general name of Peers, and being Lay-men, might act as Peers in all Tryals, and in all other Judgements of Parliament, both Civil and Criminal, even in Capital Causes; but these could in no sort be esteemed to be Peers of the Realm, though they might pass in a large acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a vulgar construction of the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, be termed Peers in Parliament. These now might be summoned to a Parliament, or two or three Parliaments one after another, as pleased the King, and then be summoned no more, if the King was otherwise minded; and they could not pretend to have wrong done them, their former Summons having been <hi>Ex mera gratia,</hi> without any right of theirs to them. So then I may conclude that it is all one, whether you will take it as it is expressed in the Kings charge then, <hi>The Earls, Barons, Peers of the</hi> Realm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or as it is when they come to give Judgement, and as it is likewise expressed in the Case of Sir <hi>Simon de Bereford,</hi> The said <hi>Earls, Barons and Peers,</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:94716:20"/>
&amp;c. and whether that Conjunction <hi>[and]</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the word <hi>Peers,</hi> be of any signification or no, to mark out other Peers subsequent to the Barons, is not material to what our As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serter would have to be understood of my leaving out any thing, for it had all made for me, and against him, making it clear enough, that the Bishops had no part in those Judgements.</p>
                  <p>The next Precedent is the Judgement of <hi>Iohn Mautravers,</hi> the Record says, <hi>Trestouz les Piers, Countes &amp; Barons, assemblez a ceste Parlement a</hi> Westminster, <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> est cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>All the Peers, Earls and Barons, assembled in this Parliament at</hi> Westminster, <hi>have strictly examined, and thereupon have agreed and accorded that</hi> John Mautravers <hi>is guilty,</hi> &amp;c. I appeal now to any man that hath but common sense, if it can be imagined, that the Prelates or Bishops can be thought to be meant by that expression of <hi>All the Peers,</hi> and if it be not the same in signification, as when the King charged them to give righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judgement upon the Earl of <hi>March,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Si vous charge Countes, Barons, les Piers de mon Roialme,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And so I charge you Earls, Barons, the Peers of my Realm,</hi> &amp;c. There the several ranks of Peers are first na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and the general word, which denotes their Quality, common to both, which makes them competent Judges of those mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that is, their being Peers is put last: And here in this Record concerning <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94716:20"/>
And it is further observable, that at the time of that Parliament, there were no Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Lords before Earls, neither Dukes nor Marquesses: So if any others were to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood to be comprised under that General Title of Peers, it could be only the Lords Spiritual, which is a thing very ridiculous to believe: Can it be thought, nay can our As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serter himself think, I trow not, that when the other particular ranks and degrees of the Peerage are expressed and set down <hi>nominatim</hi> by name (as one may say) by Tale and by Token, <hi>Earls and Barons,</hi> that (I say) at the same time, and to be joyned with them in the same action, another rank of men, <hi>viz.</hi> Bishops must pass under a General Title, and that put in the first place, as if Peerage were an <hi>Apellativum</hi>

But that they are not at all Peers of the Realm, to speak properly and truly, and as they are in the eye of the Law, though they have sometimes been stiled so, both by
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94716:21"/>
themselves and others, I have in my former Letter I think made it clear, and all that our Asserter saith to the contrary, hath not made me change my opinion, and I shall say more to it, when I come in course to answer what is there said by him.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time I shall only add this, which I lay for a ground, that I do verily believe no instance can be given of an enumeration of some particulars in an Universal Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Proposition, and to leave out that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular which is first in Rank, and ought to be first named, if any at all be named, and to have that to be tacitely implied under the General Term, the <hi>Signum Collectivum,</hi> As in this Proposition, <hi>All the Peers, Earls and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>ons, gave such a Iudgement:</hi> This I say, that if the Bishops did joyn in the Judgement, it would have been so expressed, and they would have been first named, otherwise it is like an <hi>Et caetera</hi> in the beginning of an Enumerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which in the close, and after an enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of some particulars, may intimate a joyning of some others that are not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly specified and named, but is never put in the beginning. And I think, I may with confidence affirm, That there is no example in all the Rolls of Parliament, that any of the Benches of the House of Lords hath been particularly mentioned in any business, and if the Prelates did likewise act in it, that they were not also particularly mentioned, and always in the first place, nay, before any other, even before the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and the Princes of the Blood, as may be seen in

Now is it probable, or can it be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the Decorum concerning the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops being in those times still so punctually observed, and that respect always given to the Prelacy, whenever they were concerned to mention them particularly and in their due place, that they would in that Parliament of <hi>E.</hi> 3. be content to be comprized under a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral notion, and pass as a man may say <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognito,</hi> when others have more respect shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, to have their names recorded? I do not think that the Clerk of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment durst have been guilty of so great a disrespect to them: Therefore we may well conclude, that in this Judgement upon <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travers,</hi> the Prelates were not at all signified under the general word of <hi>Trestouz les Piers, Countes &amp; Barons: All the Peers, Earls and Barons;</hi> nor were they at all present, or had any part in that Tryal, no more than in that of <hi>Roger de Mortimer,</hi> Earl of <hi>March.</hi>

                  <p>But 4 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Stephen,</hi> Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> having been complained of in Parliament for saying, That if <hi>Edward</hi> the Second were still alive (as
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94716:22"/>
he was informed that he was, and in <hi>Corfe-</hi>Castle) he would assist him with all his force, to re-establish him in his Throne; was by the Parliament, referred for his Tryal to the Kings Counsel, and by them to the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> where putting himself <hi>super Patriam,</hi> to be Tryed as all Commoners do, a Jury was empannelled, and the Tryal went on there in the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> till at last he got the Kings Pardon: This is <hi>Term.

Given under our Test at</hi> Windsor, Febr. 15. <hi>in the fifth year of our Reign.</hi> All this shews there was no varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in any of those Tryals, but all went on <hi>pari passu,</hi> in the same Method. And it is not probable there could be any great change in their proceedings, the Parliament continuing together so short a time, but fifteen days in all, as Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> observes by the Writs of wages in his fourth Part, which is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parliamentary Writs. And I think I may now say, that few will believe I concealed these Precedents because they made against me. The Case of Sir <hi>Thomas Berckley</hi> is of another nature, his Tryal is said to be <hi>Inter Placita Coronae tenta coram Domino E. Rege in pleno Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamento suo, &amp;c. Mem.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94716:23"/>
him. I do not look upon this as a Tryal by the House of Peers, acting in their ordinary Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Capacity. There was some other Court in those times in time of Parliament, where the Peers probably were the principal Judges, but then were added to them some great Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Crown, and of the Judges of <hi>Westminster-</hi>Hall, before whom those Pleas of the Crown were held; I confess this is to me <hi>Terra incognita,</hi> a thing of which I can give no very good account. But I think one may affirm with confidence that no Prelates were amongst them, for they would have been menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, if they had been there; as in all Criminal Causes which were Capital, or in any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning such Causes, I observe, they were: And even in this Case of Sir <hi>Thomas Berckley</hi> the next Parliament, <hi>N.</hi> 18. it is said, <hi>

                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:94716:24"/>
And <hi>Semble as Seigneurs du Parlement: It seems to the Lords of Parliament;</hi> and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred such instances more, I know, he may give: And the Trifler could not but know that I could intend it of no other but of the matters in question, which were Judgements in Criminal Causes.</p>
                  <p>And I shall add but this more to shew the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability of the Prelates of those times being at all employed in Tryals of that nature, and least of all, that we should imagine they could be comprized under general expressions, which if it were, would argue an unquestionable right and title in them to such a Judicature. Let us consider the Statute made but two years before, it is 2 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 2. which confirms a Statute formerly made 27 <hi>E.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 3. which Enacts, <hi>That the Justices of Gaol delivery which are sent down into the several Counties, when they enquire of Felonies and Murthers, if one of them be a Clerk, then some discreet Knight of that County shall be associate to him that is the Lay-man, and shall deliver the Gaol.</hi> We see how careful they were then that no Church-man should take Cognizance of Matters of Blood, Canon Law, Common Law, and Statute Law did prohibit it.</p>
                  <p>And now to follow my Gentleman to the Parliament 5 <hi>E.</hi> 3. in which he tells me, I have not been fortunate in the choice of my To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick, because that Parliament being called for the redress of the Peace, and the Bishops saying, <hi>It did not properly belong to them to give the King counsel for the keeping of the Peace of the Kingdome,</hi> signified nothing. But had they
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94716:24"/>
said it did not all belong to them, it had been somewhat to the purpose. But under this Gentlemans favour, I think it is to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, to shew that the Bishops did then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and acknowledge that it did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belong to them to look to the keeping of the Peace, that it was not their proper work, which implies that they conceived their duty and employment to lie another way: And it is a strong argument <hi>à minore,</hi> that if they might not do that, and advise the King in doing what was necessary for the keeping of the Peace, and punishing the breakers of it, much less could they be put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it to judge in Matters of Blood. And for them to say that <hi>It did not properly belong to them,</hi> was a little softer, and more respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the King to excuse themselves from doing what he required of them for giving their advice, than if they had bluntly said, <hi>That it was not at all of their duty to give such advice;</hi> which had grated a little too much, and had been a kind of retorting it upon the King for requiring a thing in it self improper and unreasonable. And yet they did as strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put it off from themselves, saying, <hi>It did not properly belong to them;</hi> for no prudent and sober man will do a thing that is not proper for him, nor can it be required of him, that he should. So I think my Topick was very good; and I may say I am not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unfortunate to have to deal with so weak and impertinent an Adversary.</p>
                  <p>What he saith in the Case of Sir <hi>John Grey,</hi> and Sir <hi>William de la Zouch,</hi> of Bishops, that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94716:25"/>
they are sometimes comprehended under the general word of <hi>Les Grantz,</hi> I never denied it; but in that place where the King did charge, <hi>Toutz les Countes, Barons, &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres Grantz en lour foies &amp; ligeances,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>All the Earls, Barons, and other great men,</hi> &amp;c. I say that Bishops cannot be comprehended there, because in that place it can be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood but of such great persons, whose Rank is after the Barons, where I am sure no Clerk of the Parliament durst ever rank the Prelates. And another Rule which I stand upon is, That if any one Bench of the House of Peers be named and specified, as that of Earls or Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, that of the Bishops (if the Bishops were present) is never left out, but always first placed.</p>
                  <p>The next scratch he gives me, is upon the Case of Sir <hi>William Thorp</hi> 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. upon my inferring, that by the General Term of the <hi>Grantz</hi> in that Parliament, who approved of the Judgement of death given upon <hi>Thorp,</hi> it cannot be supposed that the Bishops are understood, because they tell the King, that if such a Case should happen afterwards, the King might call any of those <hi>Grantz</hi> whom he pleased, and by their advice, give such a Judgement of himself, which I say could not be meant of Bishops, because it was no em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for them to assist in Judgements of death. Upon this, my Gentleman is pleased in good serious earnest (as he scoffingly expresses it) to ask, if this be not <hi>petere Principium,</hi> to beg what I am to prove. And I answer in true serious earnest, that I do not <hi>petere Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipium,</hi>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:94716:25"/>
not beg the Question; for the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is first general, Whether Bishops in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament can be employed in such Judgements, and then particularly whether among the <hi>Grantz</hi> of that Parliament of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that Judgement against <hi>Thorp,</hi> there were any Bishops? And I infer there was none, because they tell the King, that hereafter even out of Parliament, if any body else offend in like manner, he may take any of them, that is, of those <hi>Grantz</hi> that now give him this advice, to joyn in condemning him; and by the Law of the Land, a Bishop could not joyn, therefore there was no Bishop amongst them: And that by the Law, Bishops and all Clergy-men were prohibited, appears by the Act of Parliament of the second of that King which I mentioned before, confirming one to the same purpose made in <hi>Edward</hi> the First's time, that <hi>No Clerk should be a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of Gaol-delivery for Tryal of Felons:</hi> this, I think, is not <hi>petere Principium,</hi> to prove the true meaning of what was done at that time in the House of Lords, by what the Law of the Land had already established, which must regulate what the House of Lords then did, and doth shew there could be no Bishops in the number of those <hi>Grantz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then for what he saith of the <hi>Commons charging</hi> Michael de la Poole <hi>before the King, Prelates and Lords, which was in</hi> 10 R. 2. <hi>and parallelling his crime to that of Sir</hi> William Thorp, <hi>who for it was condemned to dye; upon which he will infer that</hi> Michael de la Poole <hi>was charged with a Capital crime, and accused of</hi>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:94716:26"/>
                     <hi>it by the Commons before the Prelates, as well as before the other Lords, who gave their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon it.</hi> He may examine the Record, and he will find that the Impeachment was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Misdemeanors, cozening the King in an exchange of Land, when he was Chancellour, and some other miscarriages of that nature: And it is the Impeachment, which is in the nature of an Indictment, that governs the Tryal, be the crime what it will: As it is laid in the Impeachment or the Indictment, it must be so found upon the Tryal, at the least it can be found no higher, less haply it may be: A man that is Indicted for a Misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, cannot be found Capitally Guilty. And though by a comparison, by way of aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, it was likened to <hi>Thorp's</hi> Case, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael de la Poole</hi> made it appear there was no resemblance between them: And who will take pains to read the Record of <hi>Thorp,</hi> which I dare say this Trifler never did, nor scarce any Record; will see that the ground of that Judgement, which made it Capital, was that himself had submitted to such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, when he took upon him the Office of Chief Justice; the words are, <hi>Si sembla a eur le Jugement sur ceo rendu resonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puis qil se obligea mesmes per son serement a tiel penance fil feist alencontre: The Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given upon it, seemed to them to be agreeing to reason, since he had bound himself by his Oath unto such a punishment, if he did contrary to his Oath.</hi> And I must say, it would go hard with a great many, if every one should be hanged that cozens the King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:94716:26"/>
And it is a pretty remark of his upon Sir <hi>John Lee's</hi> Case 42 <hi>E.</hi> 3. that the Record saying, <hi>That he was brought before the Prelates, Dukes, Earls, Barons, and some of the Commons,</hi> &amp;c. He observes, that if at this Tryal any thing had been objected which had been Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, the Bishops were present at it: And I say he might have made a truer observation than that, which is, That they might be well assured, that nothing Capital was to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, because then the Bishops would not have been present. And one thing I am sure is observable, which is, that the Bishops, that is, the Prelates are here recorded to be present, and to be ranked before the Dukes, Earls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We are sure, if any be specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they are, and still ranked in the first place.</p>
                  <p>What my Gentleman means, in what he saith upon the Tryals 50 <hi>E.</hi> 3. I understand not; they are the Cases of <hi>Richard Lyons,</hi> the Lord <hi>Latimer, William Ellis,</hi> the Lord <hi>Nevill,</hi> and <hi>John Peach,</hi> all these were only charged with Misdemeanors; he saith their crimes were great and hainous, and reckons the loss of Forts among them, which he saith was a crime Capital in <hi>Gomenitz</hi> and <hi>Weston,</hi> 1 <hi>R.</hi> 2. and that I acknowledge the Bishops to have been present at those Tryals. But still this learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gentleman, who brags here that he will not suffer the World to be longer amused and imposed upon by my Notions, doth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self still mistake the business, not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the nature of the thing he treats of. Otherwise he would consider that the Tryal
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94716:27"/>
of a Criminal person must always be pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to his Charge; which is a point I have already spoken to, therefore I shall say little here, only this, that the Impeachment of the Commons against those persons, was only for Misdemeanors, their Tryal was accordingly, and the Bishops were present. And for what he saith of <hi>Gomenitz</hi> and <hi>Weston</hi> was clean another Case; it was for betraying those Towns which they had undertaken to keep, when the force upon them was not so great: However, it is not material what their Crime would appear to be upon proof, but what their Charge was, and that was Capital. Then for what he adds of the Bishops being comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the general Apellation of <hi>Les Seigneurs du Parlement; The Lords of Parliament;</hi> in several Cases which he there cites, which he beats upon over and over again, in so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny several places of his Pamphlet, and sets up like a Man of Straw of his own making, to make sport with, is what I never denied: my Position is, That I have still observed in all Tryals of Crimes, when Bishops could be present, it is so expressed that they were so, as in all Crimes not Capital; and I do not think one Instance can be given to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And my other Position, which I affirm with more confidence, is, That if any of the other ranks of the Lords be mentioned, the Bishops are so likewise, or else it is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain argument that they were not there.</p>
                  <p>My Gentleman is a little put to his Trumps in the Case of <hi>Gomenitz</hi> and <hi>Weston,</hi> 1 <hi>R.</hi> 2. That is so plain, first, the Commons coming
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94716:27"/>
and desiring, That such as had lost Towns and Castles by their own default, might be punished, <hi>Per agard des Seigneurs &amp; Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronage; By the Judgement of the Lords and Baronage:</hi> whereupon those Lords command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Gomenitz</hi> and <hi>Weston</hi> to be brought before them, and upon a long hearing, condemned them both to death: And the Lords are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly named, the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> first, and ten more Earls and Barons by name, of whom <hi>Roger</hi> Lord <hi>Clifford</hi> was the last; and then a general clause, <hi>Et plusours autres Setgneurs, Barons &amp; Bannerettes; And many other Lords, Barons and Bannerets.</hi> Now this is so plain, and exclusive of all Prelates, as my Gentleman is forced to confess, that it seems doubtful to him who these Lords were, whether the Prelates, or the Lords particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly named; and <hi>plusours autres Seigneurs,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which (he saith) very probably the Lords Spiritual might be comprised. I see a truth cannot come clearly from him, a thing that is most clear, he makes it doubtful: And one thing he saith most falsely, of a Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on commanded to be read, <hi>Numb.</hi> 29. <hi>En cest Parlement per les Prelates, &amp; Seigneurs, Piers du Parlement; By the Prelates, and Lords, Peers of Parliament;</hi> which Petition he will have to be concerning this matter, which is most false. For that which is said <hi>Numb.</hi> 29. is of a Petition, and Writ of Error, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by <hi>William de Montague,</hi> Earl of <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> which was then read, and nothing at all concerning <hi>Gomenitz</hi> and <hi>Weston;</hi> which is a horrible falshood, and imposture of our As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serter
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94716:28"/>
to abuse the world so, and impose upon the Reader. The first request of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons concerning this business, and to have this matter examined is <hi>Numb.</hi> 38. and then <hi>Numb.</hi> 39. there is mention of a Schedule given in by <hi>Weston,</hi> and the Record saith, <hi>Ueue &amp; leue la dite cedule en plein Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; The Schedule being seen and read in full Parliament;</hi> and any thing concerning <hi>Weston</hi> or <hi>Gomenitz</hi> before this, there is not: But some falshood he must still add of his own, for the Jesuites Verse is very applicable to him,

And indeed throughout his whole Pamphlet he doth but <hi>Verba dare,</hi> take <hi>Verba, Words,</hi> as in opposition to reality and truth, for it is full of falshoods; or take Words in opposition to matter and good sense, for his whole Book is a very bundle of words, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any good matter in it. But one thing more I cannot but observe, it is his insisting so much upon a thing, which I am confident himself doth not believe, though I have known a teller of stories tell one of his own invention so often, that at last himself hath begun to believe it to be a truth: It is, that after the naming several Lords, and ending with some Barons, there is a general expression, <hi>

                  <p>Then in the Case of the Murtherers of <hi>John Imperial,</hi> a publick Minister, 3 <hi>R.</hi> 2. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I observe, that it is expressed in the Parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Roll, that the Bishops were not present at the framing of the Act to make it Treason in them, which I grant, in other places of my Letter they might have been, being to pass an Act of Parliament in a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative way, my Gentleman is pleased to say, <hi>That I forget my self:</hi> In truth No, I did suppose it, and do suppose it to be a good Argument <hi>à minore,</hi> to shew that the Prelates were then so modest, as to withdraw upon the passing of a Law for the greater pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of such a Capital Crime, which in strictness perhaps they did not need to have done, much more then would they avoid the sitting as Judges to take away life in a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial way, which they could no ways pretend to: But my Gentleman loves to quarrel, and scribble Paper, though to no purpose.</p>
                  <p>To the Case of Sir <hi>Ralph Ferrers,</hi> 4 <hi>R.</hi> 2. he only sings over his tedious plain Song, That under the general word of <hi>Lords of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> Bishops may be comprehended, and therefore he will have it, That they must be so: And much good may it do him with his <hi>Cram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be bis cocta,</hi> I may say <hi>centies cocta,</hi> for I think he serves up this same dish a hundred times in this his learned Treatise.</p>

But I may not let pass what he saith upon the Case of the Bishop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> 7 <hi>R.</hi> 2. how extream falsly he recites things, taking all upon trust, how this man or t'other man cites a Record, but never seeing the Record it self, which perhaps he cannot so much as read. He desires it may be taken notice of, that for those Misdemeanors he was adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make Fine and Ransome to the King, and that the Judgement was passed upon him <hi>by the Lords by assent of Parliament;</hi> where he saith, he hopes I will not deny but that there were Bishops present, and for this sends me to <hi>Cotton</hi>'s Abridgement, 7 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>n.</hi> 23. but if he would have looked upon the Parliament Roll he would have found this, <hi>Perquoy del a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Then he comes to the Case of <hi>Michael d la Poole,</hi> 10 <hi>R.</hi> 2 where he saith the same things he did before, and which I have already answered, so to that I refer you.</p>
                  <p>The next is the 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. where the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates withdrawing from Parliament, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of matters of blood, which were then to come into agitation, enter a Protestation with a <hi>Salvo</hi> to their right of sitting in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which my Gentleman will have to be meant even of their being present at the agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of those matters, if they were so pleased. This hath been treated of before at large already, to which I refer you; I will only observe this further at present, out of the words of their Protestation, first, they say, <hi>Quia in praesenti Parliamento agitur de nonnullis materiis, in quibus non licet nobis aut alicui eorum juxta Sacrorum Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonum instituta quomodolibet personaliter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teresse, ea propter pro nobis &amp; eorum quolibet protestamur, &amp; eorum quilibet hic presens eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am protestatur, quod non intendimus nec vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumus sicuti de jure non possumus nec debe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, nec intendit, nec vult aliquis eorum dum de hujusmodi materiis agitur vel agetur, quomodolibet interesse, sed nos &amp; eorum quem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet in ea Parte penitus absentaxe:</hi> This they declare, <hi>That it is not lawful for them, nor any of them, by the institutions of the Holy Canons, to be personally present, and that of Right they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, nor ought to be there, and therefore they do not intend in any sort, quomodolibet, to be present, but wholly to absent themselves, while those matters are handling.</hi> Can any man now
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94716:30"/>
have the fore-head to maintain, that they could have a thought of challenging still a right, contrary to such prohibitions, and to say, that it was only the Canon Law that did prohibit them: I say still that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law was to them above all Laws, and the Prelates of those times conceived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be above all other Laws; even not to be subject to them, but what the Canon Law did allow or forbid, was accordingly by them held to be most lawful or unlawful. The Salvo they add, makes it clear, <hi>Iure pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatis nostrae &amp; cuju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And if such things can be thought to be <hi>Statui &amp; Ordini congruentia,</hi> for their Salvo extends on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to such things as are agreeable to their State and Order. Indeed, I think it a solecism to have such a thought. And I know it will be
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94716:30"/>
excepted against, that I do take <hi>Paritas</hi> here in such a sense, and not to be <hi>Nomen Apella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivum,</hi> to signifie <hi>Peerage,</hi> a rank of men; but I consider how it is put, that it is <hi>Paritas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressendi in Parliamento,</hi> which in my opinion is proper to render a <hi>Parity, or an equal right with others,</hi> to be present in Parliament. But let them construe it Peerage, it matters not to me, I have handled that point fully by it self in my former Letter, and shall do it again in this before I make an end, to shew I am not afraid of that expression; and though in those times the Prelates gave themselves sometimes that Character, that it did not at all belong unto them. And he beats upon this again, That this was left out purposely by me in my citing this Protestation, which I have sufficiently cleared already amongst his Postulata's, therefore I shall not trouble you with it again in this place.</p>
                  <p>In the Case of <hi>Thomas Haxey,</hi> 20 <hi>R.</hi> 2. my Gentleman is so ingenious, as to say, He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the Bishops were not present, but then he tells you why; because it was an erroneous Judgment, and an Irregular Condemnation, and so commends their Prudence: And sure, he hath been with some Witch to raise some of those Prelates from the Grave, as the Witch of <hi>Endor</hi> did <hi>Samuel,</hi> to tell him the true cause why they withdrew themselves, and did then forbear to use their Right, as he saith it is lawful for every man to do, else he could never have hit so pat upon the true cause of their withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereas otherwise a man might say it was because they knew they had no right to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94716:31"/>
be there; and if it had been their right, they should the rather have made use of it, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and hinder an unrighteous Judgement, and have caused a righteous one to be given. And more than that, if it was their Right, and that they had a calling to be there, they were bound to attend the Service, and I think it would have been a breach of Duty, and a Sin in them to withdraw themselves from it.</p>
                  <p>And now I come to a <hi>Bundle of Words</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it is what he says concerning their Proxies, 21 <hi>R.</hi> 2. out of which one shall have much ado to pick some sense, and what it is he would be at, I will do my endeavour in it. He first puts us in mind of his fifth Postulatum, and of what he said there of the difference between the Matter of a Law, and the Manner of its enacting, and that a Law may be repealed for the Matter of it, and yet the Manner of making it still hold good. This I suppose he saith, because I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept against the authority which that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at the desire of the Commons, gave the Bishops to make their Common Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, in regard that whole Parliament was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards repealed, and consequently all it did, made null and void. Yes, saith he, the Parliament was repealed by 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. because it condemned those who were his friends, as Traytors to the King and Government; yet the proceedings in that Parliament were just and lawful. To which I answer, That what was done that Parliament, agreeing with the practice and usage of other Parliaments, was
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94716:31"/>
certainly just for the Manner of the doing, though the Matter might be repealed, and made null: But what was never done before in any Parliament, nor any thing like it, could not receive any stamp of Authority for its being done in this Parliament, because the Parliament it self had no authority, a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent Parliament repealing it, and making it as if it had never been: And this of all the Bishops joyning to make a Common Proctor was never done in any Parliament before nor since.</p>
                  <p>If any should object, that <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth was an Usurper, and had no right nor Title to repeal former Parliaments, nor to make any Laws. This were an Objection if it should be allowed, would have a long tail, and carry a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bad consequence, for it would sweep away at once all the good Laws that were made in three Kings raigns, and would make such a <hi>Hiatus</hi> in our Statute Laws, as would put things into a very great disorder. We know that in <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth's time, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed immediately after those three <hi>Henries,</hi> in all the Acts of Parliament which passed, when mention is made of any thing done in those Kings Reigns, still what was done is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of, and confirmed, and to their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Government, the Parliament still gives this Character, that they were Kings indeed, but not of right. Which implies the stamp of Soveraign power and authority to be set upon all their actions, and so upon the Parliaments that were summoned and held by them, and principally there, because
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94716:32"/>
of the concurrence and conjunction of the whole Kingdome in all things there done. Nay, in some Acts of Parliament we find care taken, that nothing should clash with what had been done in Parliament by some of those Kings, as 14 <hi>E.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 4. there is a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute concerning Breakers of Truce, and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viso in it, <hi>That this Act shall not extend to any Act or Ordinance made</hi> 2 H. 5. <hi>late indeed, and not of right, King of</hi> England. But still he is acknowledged King of <hi>England, de facto,</hi> which goes a great way to authorize any thing done under their power. Therefore 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 1. A Law is provided to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnifie all persons that shall do service to the King in being, whether he have right or no.</p>
                  <p>As for what is said of the Bishops making their Common Proxy, at the prayer of the House of Commons, <hi>That their Proceedings might be valid, and not questioned in future Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments by reason of their absence, and that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Judgements had been reversed, because they were not present.</hi> It is true, it is so expressed in the Roll of that void Parliament, which as it hath no authority nor validity in it self, so it is very strange, that if there had been ground for this apprehension, there should remain nothing upon Record in all the Rolls of Parliament, that ever any Judgement, or any other act done in any Parliament had been so repealed. We know it was once at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. by <hi>Thomas Montacute,</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> (as I told you in my former Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) who brought his Writ of Error to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94716:32"/>
the Judgement given against his Father 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. because the Bishops (as he alledges there) being Peers of Parliament, were not parties to that Judgement, but it was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be no Error, and his Petition was reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. And we know that in <hi>Edward</hi> the First's time, there was a Parliament held at <hi>St. Edmonds-bury, Clero excluso,</hi> not a Prelate admitted to it. And in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time all the Judges of <hi>England</hi> declared it for Law, <hi>That the King might hold a Parliament with his Lords Temporal and Commons, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without the Lords Spiritual. Tout sans les Spirituels Seigneurs,</hi> it is in <hi>Keilwayes</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, in Dr. <hi>Standish</hi>'s Case. Therefore there is no reason to think, that any Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were repealed upon the Bishops being absent, seeing their presence is not of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the constituting and sitting of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And especially not for the Judgements which we treat of in Capital Cases, because by what appears upon Record, and by all the Laws, Canon, Common and Statute Law, they never were present, I always except that Unparliamentary Extravagant Proceeding and Judgement of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, in the twenty eighth of his Reign, upon <hi>William de la Pool.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Asserter tells us of some Judgements reversed 15 <hi>E.</hi> 2. particularly in the Case of the <hi>Spencers,</hi> but he doth not tell us where he finds it, nor I believe, doth he know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, having only taken it up some where up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on trust, as he doth other things. But in this 21 <hi>R.</hi> 2. upon the Petition of the Earl of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:94716:33"/>
                     <hi>Gloucester,</hi> it appears by the Record of the proceedings against the two <hi>Spencers,</hi> Father and Son, in that 15 <hi>E.</hi> 2. which are there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated at large, that there was nothing Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital in their Case, neither in the Charge nor in the Judgement, so as this signifies nothing to the matter in question, which is all can be said to it. And as little shall I say to his witty allusion of <hi>bringing me to a sight of my self, as</hi> Alexander <hi>did his Horse to the Sun, that he might not kick;</hi> only this I might say, if I were as foul-mouthed as he, that indeed such a scoffing injurious Scribbler were fitter to be answered with a kick, than with fair reasoning by way of Argument.</p>
                  <p>Next we come to the 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. Sir <hi>William Rickhill</hi>'s Case, where I think, I should do well only to transcribe what he hath written, to shew it needs no answer, but that I should waste too much Ink and Paper: I represented in my Letter to you, that <hi>Rickill</hi> being sent for into Parliament, no formal charge being against him, to give an account only by what order he had taken the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi>'s Confession at <hi>Calais,</hi> which he did, the Bishops present; but when they came to consider what was to be done upon it, then only the Lords Temporal were asked their opinion, which I alledge to shew, that the Bishops there were not advised with, because it might be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory to a further proceeding by way of Tryal: And this our Asserter says, is to serve an Hypothesis, and learnedly gives it us in <hi>Greek,</hi> and bids the Reader judge, and so do I. Then for the Tryal of <hi>Hall,</hi> who was one of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:94716:33"/>
the murtherers of the Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> he hath the condescension to acknowledge it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the Bishops were not there, but then saith, that they left it to the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Lords, without any Impeachment to their right, it being secured before by the security of a confessed Act of Parliament, 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. it is their Protestation he harps at. And if I had as much <hi>Greek</hi> as he, I would say it in <hi>Greek,</hi> that he now doth <hi>serve an Hypothesis,</hi> or in good <hi>English,</hi> beg the Question, for that is his meaning of serving an Hypothesis, for the Right which the Bishops there saved, he will have to be, and hath forty times repeated it, to judge Capitally when they please; but I have clearly shewed it was not of their assisting in those Judgements, as he still will have it to be, but other Judgements and proceedings in Parliament, where in truth they had a right to assist.</p>
                  <p>Then follows the Case of <hi>William Sautre,</hi> 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. where he is pleased to give me a wipe for stiling him the Protomartyr of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi> and out of his great reading informs, that St. <hi>Alban</hi> lived some hundreds of years before him; but he must give me leave to inform him, that the common acceptation of Martyrs amongst us Protestants now, is of such Orthodox persons as have suffered for the truth, whom the Papists have put to death for Hereticks, and this man was the first of them in <hi>England.</hi> He hath some other notable Remarks; one is, that whereas I said that the Bishops and Clergy of those times were the chief Promoters of bringing him to his
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94716:34"/>
end, which I meant of their declaring him an Heretick, and then turning him over to the Secular Power, he observes upon it, <hi>That then they acted in a Capital Case,</hi> which he saith makes against me: And that if it was the Lords Temporal who signed the Warrant for his execution, that the Bishops had no hand in it, and so have escaped my lash, but who were his Judges, <hi>nondum constat,</hi> I am sure it doth not <hi>constare</hi> to me to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he saith all this, which I do not find to make either for him, or against me.</p>
                  <p>No more, than what he saith of the Case of the Earls of <hi>Kent, Huntington,</hi> and <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. who he grants were declared and adjudged Traytors by the Temporal Lords, and no Bishops present, and then saith, he will give a Parallel Case, it is of the Earl of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Scroope,</hi> 3 <hi>H.</hi> 5. where the Bishops were present, and that I confess they might be so, because it was in passing an Act of Parliament to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm their Attainder. But my Gentleman is mistaken, as he commonly is almost in all his Assertions, for the Cases are not parallel, the Earls of <hi>Kent, Huntington</hi> and <hi>Salisbury</hi> had no Tryal, had not been legally condemned and attainted, but being taken in <hi>Circester</hi> by the Townsmen rising upon them, were by them in a tumultuary manner put to death, and the House of Peers afterwards in a judicial way ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged the fact of those Lords Treason, and them Traytors; and this was done only by the Temporal Lords, who are there particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly named. But the Earl of <hi>Cambridge</hi> and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:94716:34"/>
the Lord <hi>Scroope</hi> had been Tryed, Condemned and Executed at <hi>Southampton,</hi> and this Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment afterwards was brought into Parliament, and there confirmed by Act of Parliam. where the Bishops were, and might be present: but our Asserter hath ill luck in all his allegations.</p>
                  <p>And he will have as ill luck in what he saith to the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi>'s Case, 5 <hi>H.</hi> 4. where I am sure he begs the Question, and doth <hi>Disputare ex non concesso,</hi> for whereever <hi>Lords, or Peers of Parliament</hi> are mentioned, he will have the Bishops to be comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whereas those general words, as all other such, are to be understood <hi>Secundum subjectam materiam:</hi> If it be in a Case where the Bishops are particularly by the Law of the Land, and the continual practice in the execution of that Law excluded, and others are comprized un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same general expression, it must be understood of them only, and not of those upon whom there is such a bar. Now they who will have the Bishops to be Peers, do not make them the sole and only Peers, but allow Earls and Barons to be Peers with them. But I do not allow them to be Peers at all, our Asserter will prove them to be Peers by two Records, <hi>Mautravers</hi> Case, 4 <hi>E.</hi> 3. and their Protestation, 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. I have already given an account of what is in <hi>Mautravers</hi> Case, the words are, <hi>All the Peers, the Earls and Barons being met,</hi> &amp;c. Is it not ridiculous to expound this, that by <hi>All the Peers</hi> is meant only the Bishops, as if the dignity of the Peerage did principally belong to them, that they should be Peers <hi>Sans queue,</hi> as the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:94716:35"/>
                     <hi>French</hi> denominate a thing that belongs to some particular person more properly, and in a more eminent degree, than it doth to any body else? Or is it not more rational, and indeed only so, to understand this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression to import that the Earls and Barons were the Peers who then met, and that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>All the Peers, the Earls and Barons,</hi> &amp;c. the Earls and Barons are an <hi>Exegesis,</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the foregoing general denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Peers, so <hi>Mautravers</hi> Case makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for him, but much against him: And as to their own Protestation, 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. indeed they call themselves <hi>Peers</hi> there, but that doth not make them so, I have spoken to this point already very fully, and sorry I am that I am forced to do it again, and to do it so often, but he leads me to it, who doth as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb saith, <hi>Reciprocare serram,</hi> go over and over the same thing, as much as ever any man did, I think, and as often mistake. The force of my Argument to prove that by the general appellation of the Lords who protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against the Kings delivering the Earls Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition to the Judges, to have their opinion, and judged the fact themselves not to be Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but a Trespass, could not be meant Bishops, because the Record saith, <hi>Sur quoy le dit Conte molt humblement remercia le Roy, &amp; les ditz Seigneurs ses Piers de lour droiturel Iugement: Whereupon the said Earl very humbly thanked the King, and the said Lords his Peers, for their right Iudgement.</hi> Now the Bishops could not be Peers to the Earl, who could not try him nor be tryed by

him, they being to be tryed only by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners, and Commoners to try them, if there be occasion, of which more shall be said afterwards in its proper place. I will here only observe one thing, that our Asserter hath it instead of <hi>Humbly thanked, Humbly reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renceth the King;</hi> which he takes out of the Pamphlet that goes under the name of Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi> Baronage, which I have ever looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a spurious Book, not made by Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> who would never have so translated <hi>Remercia,</hi> and being full of faults and false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods, yet this Book, and Sir <hi>Robert Cotton's</hi> Abridgment, which hath likewise faults e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, are the chief Oracles that he consults, and which do many times deceive him, as the ancient Oracles did those who resorted to them. Of as little signification is what he adds of the Lords of Parliament declaring the action of <hi>Henry Percy,</hi> who was killed at the Battel of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> to be Treason; where he doth assure you the Bishops were present, and you shall have his Oath for it, I dare say, if you will: And how doth he prove it? Why, saith he, <hi>the Arch-bishop of</hi> Canterbury <hi>was present at the former Iudgement, for in express words he prayed the King, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as he and other Bishops were suspected to have been of confederacy with</hi> Henry Percy, <hi>that the Earl of</hi> Northumberland <hi>would now publish the truth, whereupon the Earl, by the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand upon his Oath, purged them all.</hi> And then learnedly argues, That here was no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the Arch-bishop and of the other Bishops concerned: And I believe him, for
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94716:36"/>
in truth here is a good proof that they were all present, but to be purged themselves, that they should not be thought Criminal, not to act as Judges, which is what our worthy Asserter doth assert, and what he would have us think that he fully proves, which he doth <hi>more solito,</hi> that is <hi>Cujus contrarium,</hi> &amp;c. Then my Gentleman (for he is an active Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) makes an Alman leap to the very end of the last leaf of Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi>'s Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where he finds a marginal note of Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi>'s to this purpose, <hi>That the three Estates must concur to make a Parliament, or</hi> Richard <hi>the Third's title would still be ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;</hi> and this he thrusts in here by head and shoulders, I understand not how to the present purpose, I think only to have the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to say, that Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> knew better of Records, and what <hi>Plein Parlament</hi> meaneth than I, and another whom he joyns with me, and twenty more such as we are, which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not, though he should add to the number, himself, and forty more who were no wiser than he, who all of them would not make our ballance two grains the heavier.</p>
                  <p>Then he comes to the Case of the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Bardolph,</hi> 7 <hi>H.</hi> 4. which, he saith, I say is like to that of the Earls of <hi>Kent, Huntington</hi> and <hi>Salisbury,</hi> 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. and that is true, for in both those Cases, those Lords after their deaths (having had their lives taken from them in a tumultuary way, without any formal Tryal) the business being brought into Parliament, were by the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Lords, in a Judicial way of proceeding,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94716:36"/>
adjudged to be Traytors, and their fact to be Treason. But then he adds, that I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise make the Case of the Earl of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> 3 <hi>H.</hi> 5. like to these, which is not true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a clean different nature, an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament which had its rise from a request of the House of Commons, who brought it up to the Lords; here, I say, the Bishops were, and might be present.</p>
                  <p>That which he saith to the Case of Sir <hi>John Oldcastle,</hi> 5 <hi>H.</hi> 5. is so threadbare with rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing it over and over again, and hath been so often said, and so often answered, as that it would too much trespass upon your patience, Sir, to trouble you with any one word of it more; I think I have made it exceeding clear, where under the general term of Lords of Parliament, Bishops may be understood to be comprehended, and where not. Those particular Cases which he now brings to prove his Assertion, are point blank against him, that is the Case of <hi>Mautravers,</hi> 4 <hi>E.</hi> 3. and of <hi>Gomenitz</hi> and <hi>Weston,</hi> 1 <hi>R.</hi> 2. in that of <hi>Gomenitz</hi> many particular Lords are named, several Earls and Barons, and then a general clause, <hi>Et plusieurs autres Seigneurs, Barons &amp; Bannerettes.</hi> Is it possible to think that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops come in that fag end? Indeed I do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve one thing in this Case of <hi>Sautre,</hi> which is not in any of the other; I cannot say that I lay any great stress upon it, yet something it is, that the Record expresses that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops had done with him, declaring him a Heretick, and then <hi>Relinquentes eum ex nunc Iudicio seculari: Leaving him from henceforward</hi>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:94716:37"/>
                     <hi>to the Secular Judgement,</hi> as if they should say, They would have no more to do with him.</p>
                  <p>And as convincingly he argues in the Case of Sir <hi>John Mortimer,</hi> 2 <hi>H.</hi> 6. He confesses with me that the Indictment found against him at the <hi>Guild hall</hi> was brought into Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, before the Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and the Lords Temporal, <hi>Fuit liberatum, It was there delivered to them;</hi> and then he cites a Record (as he makes it) <hi>De advisamento dictorum Dominorum auctoritate istius Parliamenti or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinatum est &amp; statutum quod ipse usque ad Turrim ducatur; By the advice of the said Lords, it was ordained and enacted by authority of the said Parliament, and by the advice of the said Lords Temporal, that he should be led to the Tower:</hi> These are his words, and how he hath mangled, and falsely rendred and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the Record, you will judge by the words of the Record it self, which I will here faithfully set down. It is this, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. <hi>Memorand. quod</hi> 26. <hi>die Februarii anno prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senti de advisamento Dominorum Tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium ac ad Supplicationem Communitatis Regni Angliae in praesenti Parliamento exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentiam redditum fuit quoddam Iudicium ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Iohan. de Mortimer, de Bishops.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:94716:37"/>
                     <hi>of</hi> Bishops-Hatfield, <hi>in the County of</hi> Hertford, <hi>Knight; the Record of which Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appears in a Schedule drawn by</hi> John Hals, <hi>one of the Justices of the</hi> Kings-bench, <hi>and fasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this Roll.</hi> Then follows the Schedule it self, where is set down what past at <hi>Guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall</hi> upon the sinding of the Indictment, and how that Indictment was brought into the Parliament, <hi>Coram duce Bedfordiae ac aliis Dominis Temporalibus; Before the Duke of</hi> Bedford, <hi>and the other Lords Temporal;</hi> and how Sir <hi>John Mortimer</hi> was brought before them by the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and how the Commons desired the Indictment might be affirmed, and that Judgement might be given upon him: Then follows, <hi>Super hoc viso &amp; plenius intellecto Indictamento, per dictum Ducem de advisamento dicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Dominorum Temporalium ac ad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitionem totius Communitatis authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate istius Parliamenti ordinatum est &amp; statutum quod Indictamentum affirmetur, &amp; praedictus Iohannes Mortimer de proditioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus praedictis sit convictus, ad Turrim duca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, usque ad furcas de Tyburn trahatur, &amp; super eas suspendatur,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Hereupon the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being viewed and well understood, it was by the foresaid Duke, by the advice of the said Lords Temporal, and at the request of all the Commons, ordained and decreed that the Indictment should be affirmed, and the foresaid</hi> John Mortimer <hi>stand convicted of his foresaid Treasons, should be carried to the</hi> Tower, <hi>then drawn to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows at</hi> Tyburn, <hi>and there hanged,</hi> &amp;c. This was a Judgement of the House of Peers in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:94716:38"/>
their Judicial capacity, upon an Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and at the pursuit of the House of Commons, who prosecuted and pressed the evidence before the Lords; the words of the Record are, <hi>Tota Communitas praefatum Indictamentum illud in omnibus fuxta vim formam &amp; effectum efusoem pro vero &amp; fideli In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictamento affirmat, ac praefatis Duci ac aliis Dominis Temporalibus supplicat eadem Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitas quatenus iidem Dux &amp; Domini In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictamentum praedictum pro vero &amp; fideli In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictamento affirmare vellent, &amp; quod executio dicti Iohannis Mortimer ut de proditionibus &amp; feloniis convicti fiat; The whole House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons do affirm the foresaid Indictment to be in all points for the force, form and effect thereof, a true and legal Indictment, and that execution of the said</hi> John Mortimer, <hi>as of one convicted of the said Treasons and Felonies may follow.</hi> This you see was a formal Tryal in all points, and a Judgement upon it, and so it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon the Roll, such a day, 26 <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arii de advisamento Dominorum Temporalium ad Supplicationem Communitatis redditum fuit quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam Iudicium versus Iohannem de Mortimer,</hi> &amp;c. And our Asserter here tells us a tale of a Tub, that the matter should be decreed after by Authority of Parliament, of which the Bishops are an essential part, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were present, which is an excellent Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>a, as if the <hi>Advisamentum Dominorum Temporalium, &amp; Authoritas Parliamenti,</hi> were two distinct things, and the work of several persons, some actors in the one who were not so in the other, and that the advice of the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:94716:38"/>
Lords Temporal had produced some other things which had a greater authority, and that the Bishops had joyned in that, which shews his ignorance in the course of Parliaments, for the Judgement which is given Judicially in the House of Lords hath upon it the stamp and the authority of the whole Parliament, and that <hi>Advisamentum</hi> of the Lords Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral here, was the Judgement, as is the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and assent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and of the Commons in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the passing of an Act of Parliament, for when a thing is said to be enacted, by the King, with the advice and assent of the two Houses, that advice and assent of the two Houses is their passing and enacting of it, as to their part in it: For any thing that is done in either House, if the King be mentioned in it, is said still to be done by him with the Advice and Consent of that House, so in a Judgement judicially given by the House of Peers (where anciently the King was often present, when they acted judicially) it is said to be given by the King, by the advice of his Lords, and here the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> represented the Kings Person, and held the Parliament by Special Commission; so the Judgement is said to be given by him, by the advice of the Lords Temporal. And so the Lords 28H. 6. when the King of himself gave the Judgement upon the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> the Lords protested against it, <hi>because it proceeded not by their advice and counsel:</hi> For that is it which gives the form and being to the Judgement, and stamps upon it the Authority of the Parliament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:94716:39"/>
Then he comes to a Precedent without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, as he calls it, which is that of 28H. 6. the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi>'s case, and confessed so by me, as he saith, but not truly. For I do not allow it to be a just and legal precedent. I do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the Bishops were present all along the whole transaction of that business, but as I said in my first Letter to you, so I must and do say in this, there was in it from the beginning to the end nothing regular, nor according to the usage and practice of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments: Then it cannot be said to be a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, no more than a Monster, that hath no shape nor limb of a true Child, can be said to be a Child. As for the particular defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of this Monster (for so I may term it) they are already so fully deciphered in my former Letter, as I will not now trouble you with them again: So it shall pass at this time as he will have it, for a <hi>Precedent without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,</hi> for it shall not be any further debated. Only I must say still, it is but a single Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and of what force that is, or can be, when the constant course and practice of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments hath been to the contrary, I leave it to you to judge: One single Precedent against all other Parliaments, is an unequal match one would think. I have heard of a great conquering Prince, that gave it for his, Motto, <hi>Souls contra omnes,</hi> but I have not heard it said so of a Parliament, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum contra omnia.</hi> The authority of any one Parliament I know to be very great, yet it is a known Maxime in the Law, <hi>Parliament poit errer, A Parliament may</hi>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:94716:39"/>
                     <hi>err;</hi> and another Parliament may mend what one doth amiss; Parliament-men are men, and may, and do sometimes mistake as well as other men; it is possible they did so, 28H. 6. and more than probable they did so, because no other Parliament before nor since, did ever do the like. And for his Recapitulation of all the fore-mentioned Records, in all twenty seven, which he makes to prove that this was not a single Precedent, as I affirm it to be, all the rest (as he saith) concurring with it, to admit Bishops to be Judges in Capital Cases, I will only say, <hi>Sit liber Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex,</hi> resort to the Records themselves, and to what is already said in my former Letter and this, and then judge if he saith true.</p>
                  <p>Then he hath a fling at me for what I say upon the Case of <hi>Nicholas de Segrave,</hi> 33 <hi>E.</hi> 1. where he must give me leave to say with truth, what he saith falsly of me upon several occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, which is this, <hi>That he hath not set down things Faithfully and Ingenuously.</hi> He saith <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi> came into full Parliament into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the King, the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and several Bishops, Earls and Barons, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged his offence, and submitted to the Kings pleasure: Upon this he observes, <hi>That here was no Iudicatory of Parliament;</hi> and then adds, that the King pardoned him, <hi>De advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samento Comitum, Baronum, Magnatum, &amp; aliorum: By the advice of the Earls, Barons, Nobles, and others.</hi> You shall see now how faithful and ingenuous a dealer our Asserter is, but certainly he takes all upon trust, and takes not the pains to see any thing himself.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:94716:40"/>
First, I do acknowledge it was no formal Tryal, for there was no impeachment nor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment against him, but I must say it was <hi>Tantamount,</hi> for he comes in upon Summons into the Parliament then sitting, where the Prelates were among the rest of the Members of the House, and how long they continued there, it appears not by the Record, but he being come, <hi>Nicholas de Warwick,</hi> the Kings Councel, charged him, and pressed matters against him. <hi>And then the King,</hi> as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord saith, <hi>willing to have the advice of the Earls, Barons, Nobles, and others of his Counsel, enjoyned them upon the Homage, Fidelity and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance which they owed him, to give him faithful Counsel, what punishment was fit to be inflicted upon such a fact so confessed: Who all of them upon a serious debate, and advising upon the matter, and well weighing all the particulars of it, and what was by the said</hi> Nicholas <hi>plainly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly acknowledged, do say, That such a man deserved to lose his life.</hi> But afterwards the Record saith, <hi>Dominus Rer tamen de gratia sua speciali pietate motus, malens vitam quam mortem eorum, qui se voluntati suae submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunt, remittit eidem Nicholao Iudicium vitae &amp; membrorum. But the King moved by his special grace and piety, desiring rather the life than the death of those that submit to his will, did remit unto the said</hi> Nicholas <hi>the Judgement of loss of Life or Member.</hi> Here you see the King advised not with his Prelates, but with the Earls, Barons, and other Nobles, and what did they advise? Not to pardon him, as our Asserter will have it, but they say he deserved
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:94716:40"/>
death, and then the King of himself would not have it go to that extremity. Now whether this Judgement would have been final, if they had pronounced sentence, and adjudged him to death, as they only said <hi>such a man deserved death,</hi> or whether this was only to be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory to a Tryal, and to proceed afterwards upon a formal Impeachment; I confess it is not clear to me, nor is it greatly material to our purpose, only it shews the Bishops were to give no advice in it one way or other; and it is rather stronger to prove they are not to meddle in such matters, if it was but prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory: For it shews that in those Capital Cases they must have nothing to do with them to determine and judge any thing concerning them, from one end to the other, <hi>ab ovo usque ad mala,</hi> as the saying is, neither in the Judgement it self, nor any thing leading to it.</p>
                  <p>So he comes to the Arch-bishop <hi>Becket</hi>'s Case, where he notably spends his mouth, but like an ill Hound, all upon false Hunting, and indeed runs riot so far, as he is not to be lashed in: He fills several leaves of his Book with <hi>Encomium</hi>'s of the Popish Clergy, because some of them sometimes did what it was their duty to do, which doth not excuse them in the general current of their proceedings, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to stand for the authority of the Pope, and the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> against the Regal power, and the authority of Parliaments, as they did 20 <hi>R.</hi> 2. saying, <hi>They were sworn to the Pope, and to that See, and they would oppose whatever the King, and the Temporal Lords should do.</hi>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:94716:41"/>
                     <hi>En restriaion del Poair Apostoliqué ou deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation de la libertoe de Saina Eglise; In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint of the Power Apostolick, or derogation of the Liberty of Holy Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So he takes much pains <hi>to assert the Kings natural right to command his Subjects to serve him upon any emergency, and so to make Clergy-men Justitiaries, if he see cause for it:</hi> Which then gives them power of Judicature, and I do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it, but it is to be understood of Judicature in such Cases as the Law of the Land allows; we know they have been some of them Lord Chancellours, Lord Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, Lord Privy Seal; but can he shew me, that any of them judged in Cases of Blood? For this Case of <hi>Beckett</hi>'s is certainly misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented in <hi>Fitz-Stephens</hi> manuscript. We know there have been heretofore in many Counties, Justices of Assize, which have been Clergy-men, joyned with others in Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, who were not Clergy-men, to take As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sizes in the County: And the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 27 <hi>E.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 3. coming to give power to those Justices of Assize to deliver the Gaols, and so to be made Justices of Gaol-deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and try Felons and Murtherers; it provides, that if one of them be a Clerk, then one of the most discreet Knights of the Shire shall be associated to him, that is a Lay-man, and be empowered by the Knights Writ to deliver the Gaols of the Shires, and chasten and punish whom they shall find to be guilty. And this Statute is confirmed, 2 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 2. which makes it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest what the intendment of the Law is in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:94716:41"/>
that particular, that Clerks must not meddle to judge in Cases of Blood, and must hold good even for Bishops, who are all of them Clerks.</p>
                  <p>As for this Case of <hi>Beckets,</hi> which only stands upon the credit of a Manuscript, said to be made by <hi>Fitz-Stephens,</hi> a Monk, whom he characterizes for a sober and grave Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, and <hi>more solito,</hi> out of the sweetness of his nature gives me a lash, saying, <hi>It is usual with me to let fall expressions to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie Testimonies and Precedents when they make against me;</hi> and this because I stile it a <hi>Blind Manuscript,</hi> and suspect the Author as partial, having been a creature of <hi>Beckets,</hi> and consequently no friend to the King. And therefore I give rather credit to the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous consent of the Historians of those times, who do not relate the passages of that Tryal to be as he makes them, than I do to him and his Manuscript. I call it a <hi>Blind Manuscript,</hi> because it sees not the light, lyes obscure in some bodies Closet, Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> doth not tell where, and I dare say our Asserter never saw it, though he terms the Author a grave Historian. His tale is, how at that great Council at <hi>Northampton, Archiepiscopus laesae Majestatis Coronae Regiae arguitur, quia est a Rege citatus pro causa Iohannis, neque venerat, neque idonee se excusasset,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Arch-bishop is questioned for Treason against the Crown of the King, because he was summoned by the King in the Cause of</hi> John <hi>(that is one</hi> John <hi>the</hi> Marshal, <hi>who complained that the Arch-bishop had done him injustice in his Court) and he neither came, nor had sifficiently excused himself upon</hi>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:94716:42"/>
                     <hi>sickness, or any other just reason which might necessarily hinder him, whereupon he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to forfeit his personal estate, and the Bishops and Barons not agreeing who should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the sentence, they putting it off from one to another, at last the King commanded the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of</hi> Winchester <hi>to do it.</hi> This is his sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and one may think it a strange piece of Treason, one not to come immediately upon a Summons to attend the King, especially if it be true what all the Historians that write of those times have related of this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness. <hi>Gervasius Dorobernensis</hi> is an Author, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> observes, who lived in that age, and one of whom Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> and all Antiquaries (we are sure) have a good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and though our Asserter is confident enough to affirm they all have so of <hi>Fitz-Stephen,</hi> it is of what I do not find, that much hath been said by them to shew that, nor do I think that any of our Antiquaries, but Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> doth so much as mention him: And from <hi>Gervasius Dorobernensis,</hi> we have this relation, <hi>Rex praecepit praesules &amp; Proceres regni apud Northamptoniam una cum ipso Archiepiscopo convenire,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Prelates and Nobles of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, together with the Arch-bishop himself, to meet at</hi> Northampton, <hi>where the Arch-bishop was accused of many things; first, that he had not fully done justice to one</hi> John <hi>that had a suit before him; then that upon this occasion being called into the Kings presence, he neglected to come. To this the Arch-bishop made answer, That</hi> John <hi>had all the justice done him that was due to him,</hi>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:94716:42"/>
                     <hi>that he had illegally defamed his Court, that he would not swear upon the Evangelists, as the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome is, but upon an old Song-book which he brought with him. But that being upon this sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned, he came not into the Kings presence, was not upon any contempt, but that he was hindred by a great sickness, and that he had excused himself by two competent witnesses whom he had sent for that purpose; yet this served not his turn, but Curiali Iudicio &amp; Episcoporum consensu condemnatus est; He was condemned by the Iudgement of the Court, the Bishops consenting to it, that all his personal estate should be at the Kings disposing.</hi> This now is delivered unto us by an unquestionable known Author, who lived in that time. <hi>Fitz-Stephen</hi> and he agree in the matter of the Accusation, and agree in the Judgement, but <hi>Fitz-Stephen</hi> lays it to be <hi>Crimen laesae Majestatis Coronae Regiae,</hi> High-Treason, which must be for not coming to the King when he was summoned: <hi>Gervasius</hi> saith, that he sent his excuse by two witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, who testified that he was then very sick, and not able to come, which we all know to be a Lawful Essoine, <hi>De malo lecti,</hi> which cannot be disallowed, but must excuse, nay, justifie any bodies absence. Now can any body that is master of common sense, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Fitz-Stephens</hi> relation, who will have this to be a Capital crime, High Treason, and a Capital proceeding upon it? We see the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was far from Capital, and could not have been such as it was, if the Crime had been laid in the Accusation to be High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. <hi>Roger de Hoveden</hi> in his relation of this
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:94716:43"/>
business, makes no mention of Treason, <hi>He saith, That the King calling a great Council at</hi> Northampton, <hi>Taedium magnum fecit Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiepiscopo, did a thing which much vexed the Arch-bishop, which was, that he caused his Horses to be put into the Arch bishops Inn, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Arch-bishop sent the King word, that he would not come to the Council till his Inn was clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of those Horses; yet upon the second day of the meeting, the Arch bishop came into the Chapel where the Council sate, and there desired the Kings leave, that he might go over into</hi> France <hi>to visit Pope</hi> Alexander <hi>who was then there, which the King denied him, and said he should first an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for the injustice he had done to</hi> John <hi>the Marshal, in his Court: This</hi> John <hi>having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to the King, that he had had a long suit in the Arch bishops Court for some Land he held of him, and could have no Iustice, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, Curiam Archiepiscopi Sacramento fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>st ficaverat secundum consuetudinem Regni: He had, according to the custome of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, upon Oath charged the Court with wrong doing</hi> (which I take to be a protesting against the proceeding of that Court, and the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there given, in the nature of a Writ of Error.) <hi>The Arch-bishop answered to this, That</hi> John <hi>had no injustice done him, and that he brought into the Court a certain strange Book, and would swear upon that; how for want of Iustice, he left my Court, which the Officers that kept my Court, looked upon as an injury done to me, because it is the Law of the Kingdome, Quod qui Curiam alterius falsificare voluerit, oportet eum jurare super sacrosancta Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia:</hi>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:94716:43"/>
                     <hi>Whoever will so charge a Court with false dealing, must take his Oath upon the Holy Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists. Notwithstanding this, the King swore he would have Iustice done upon him. Et Barones Curiae; And the Barons of the Court gave Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on him to be at the Kings mercy: Which Iudgement the Arch-bishop going about to reverse, (Iudicium illud falsificare,</hi> is the expression) <hi>He was perswaded by the Barons to submit himself to the Kings mercy for a Fine of five hundred pounds.</hi> Here is nothing in all this that can possibly infer any thing like Treason.</p>
                  <p>And it is something observable, what both these Authors say of the Judgement given; <hi>Gervasius</hi> saith, <hi>Curiali Iudicio &amp; Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coporum consensu condemnatus est;</hi> as if the part of the Bishops in this judgement were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing differing from the Act of the Court, and not comprized in it: <hi>Hoveden</hi> saith, <hi>Barones Curiae Regis judicaverunt eum;</hi> as if the Bishops had no hand in it at all. <hi>Radulphus de Diceto Decanus Londinensis,</hi> I suppose Dean of <hi>Pauls,</hi> who lived in those times, mentions this business, he saith, <hi>That the Arch-bishop was questioned upon</hi> John <hi>the Marshals complaint, and fined</hi> 500 <hi>l. and that he was questioned likewise for moneys received by him, when he was Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, for some Bishopricks and Abbies, of which he had received the profits, during their vacancies, and that</hi> not finding the Bishops to be his friends, he appealed from their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but then the <hi>Proceres, the Nobles,</hi> though he appealed from their Judgement likewise, yet they <hi>In eum nec confessum nec convictum, sententiam intorserunt: They wrested</hi>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:94716:44"/>
                     <hi>a Iudgement against him, though he confessed nothing, nor was at all convicted.</hi> You see here is not a word of Treason laid to his charge, nor nothing Capital, or any thing towards it. <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> tells you the same story, and almost in the very same words. Now let any man judge, whether all those Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians concurring, or single <hi>Fitz-Stephen</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing, deserves more credit: And that which hath greatest weight with me, is the Argument drawn <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> the crime which all agree that the Arch-bishop was charged with, was his not appearing upon the Kings Summons, which without a great and a very false Multiplying-Glass, cannot appear to be any thing like Treason: So I must conclude, that since the Charge against him had nothing of Capital in it, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings upon it was not as against a Capital Offender, not brought to Tryal as a Prisoner, but came in upon a bare Summons, and tarried there, and returned at full liberty, the Judgement neither of loss of Life nor Limb, but meerly Pecuniary, and, as some of the Authors say, compounded with for five hundred pounds: I must I say, conclude, that this whole Case is nothing to our purpose, and neither the Law nor usage of Parliament did bar the Bishops from being personally present at such a Tryal.</p>
                  <p>And now I come to the point of Peerage, which I have so fully handled in my former Letter, as I think I need not say much in this. Our Asserter brings three Arguments to prove them to be Peers: The first is, That it is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:94716:44"/>
the general stile of all Parliaments from the beginning, to be <hi>Generale Concilium Cleri &amp; Populi,</hi> even before the coming in of the <hi>Normans;</hi> which no man denies. The businesses of the Church, as well as of the Civil State are there determined; the Writ of Summons shews it, which saith, That the King intending to call a Parliament, <hi>Pro quibusdam arduis negotiis Nos Statum &amp; defensionem Regni Angliae &amp; Ecclesiae Anglicanae concernentibus.</hi> Bishops and Temporal Lords are summoned, and heretofore several others were summoned as Bannerets, and sometimes other persons of Quality who likewise were not Peers, and yet were called to the Parliaments as pleased the King; and the Judges are so summoned at this day, <hi>Super dictis negotiis tractaturi consilium suum impensuri.</hi> Where the Bishops act as Bishops, and what by the Law of the Land, and the practice and usage of Parliaments they ought to do, that they do, and may do; the Temporal Lords in like manner, and so likewise the Judges every one acts in his Sphere; but this neither gives the Bishops power to judge in Capital Causes, if otherwise it be prohibited them, nor doth it make them Peers, no more than it did formerly the Bannerets, and others, for their being summoned to sit and vote in the House of Peers: We had the experience of this the last Parliament, a Baron pretending to a much ancienter station among the Peers, by proving that his Ancestor had been summoned by one of our former Kings, to sit more than once in the House of Lords, yet not making
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:94716:45"/>
it appear that that favour had been still continued to him; and it being made appear on the other side, that several Families in this Kingdom would have the same pretence upon the like ground, it was the opinion of the House, that he had no Right to it; and consequently that his Ancestor was never acknowledged to be a Peer os the Realm, and his Blood enobled, which otherwise would have descended from him to his Posterity, and to this present Baron, who is since enobled by a later Creation, but takes nothing from that Ancestor. So then it is clear, that sitting in the House of Peers, and having a parity of Vote, and enjoying many of the same priviledges with the Peers, doth not in true and proper speaking, make the Bishops Peers; no more than 21 <hi>R.</hi> 2. Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Percy</hi> sitting with the Peers, and Voting with them, as Procurator for the Bishops, was thereby a Peer.</p>
                  <p>His next Argument is, That in several Rolls of Parliament they are expressly called Peers, which cannot be denied, nor doth that make them Peers, if the essential parts of Peerage, be wanting to them: We know that denominations are many times taken up in a large and improper sense, for some circumstances, some similitudes, something which is extraneous unto them, yet wherein they agree with things of another nature: And so Bishops having place and vote in the House of Peers, and joyning with the Peers of the Realm, sitting in Parliament, in all things, with equal power <hi>uno excepto,</hi> saving
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:94716:45"/>
only in cases of Blood, it is no wonder if they are often stiled Peers of Parliament. But the Precedents he cites, are falsly recited both in the Case of <hi>Mautravers,</hi> and that of <hi>Gomenitz</hi> and <hi>Weston,</hi> as I have shewed before.</p>
                  <p>His third Argument is, That they have judged as Peers, upon Peers of Parliament. But I deny that they judge there as Peers, but as called to the Parliament, to be Members of the House of Lords, as Bannerets were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, and many principal Gentlemen who were still Commoners, and some Officers, as the Warden of the Cinque-Ports, who was no Peer sometimes, and yet summoned up to the House of Lords, and all these judged such Peers as were tryed in those Parliaments in which they sate.</p>
                  <p>However, that Bishops are not Peers of the Realm, and so consequently not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truly Peers of Parliament, though of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten called so, I think will be clearly made out.</p>
                  <p>First, I must, as I have formerly done, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist upon the Great Charter, which Sir <hi>Edward Cooke</hi> saith, is declaratory of the Principal grounds of the Fundamental Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and which the Statute made 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matio Chartarum,</hi> will have to be observed as the Common Law, and all Judgements given against it, to be undone and holden for nought, this Law is certainly to be obeyed, and what is done in observance of this Law, is most legal: And it enjoyning every man to be tryed by his Peers, and Bishops being try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:94716:46"/>
by a Jury of Commoners, Commoners are their Peers, and they are Peers to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners, and not Peers of the Realm: Peers <hi>per eminentiam,</hi> as I may call them, or else <hi>Magna Charta</hi> is broken, and made a Law of no authority.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To be a Peer of the Realm, their Blood must be enobled, and their Persons dignified; nor can they otherwise be put into the same rank with those who are so, which would make but an ill accouplement, and they would never draw well together. Now Bishops do not sit in Parliament <hi>ratione Nobilitatis,</hi> but <hi>ratione Officii,</hi> as <hi>Stamford</hi> saith in his Pleas of the Crown, <hi>p.</hi> 153. <hi>En respect de lour possession se launcient Baronies anneres a lour dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitées: In respect of their possessions,</hi> viz. <hi>the ancient Baronies annexed to their dignities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. If they were Peers, and their Persons enobled, their Wives would be noble, and have the priviledges of Peeresses, being Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried or Widows, for Husband and Wife are one person in Law; but we know they have no such priviledge, which shews their Husbands to be no Peers.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If Bishops were Peers of the Realm, and any of them questioned for a Capital Crime in Parliament time, they could be tryed and judged only by the House of Peers, and by no other Court of Judicature. The Lords could not avoid the trying of them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, indeed any but Peers they may refuse, except it be upon an Impeachment by the House of Commons, for then they must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, and proceed in it, but not otherwise,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:94716:46"/>
except they see some great cause for it, <hi>Pro bono Publico,</hi> as it is 1 <hi>R.</hi> 2. when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons desired that no suit between Party and Party should be undertaken, and determined by the Lords, or the Officers of the Council, but that the Common Law might have its course, except it be in such a business, and against so great a person as one cannot else hope to have right done in it: The same is confirmed 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. which I alledge to justifie the Judicature of the House of Lords, upon those who are not their Peers, upon special occasion: But for trying of their Peers is a duty incumbent upon them, which they must perform; and any Peer who is questioned, may challenge it as his right, and it cannot be denied him. And therefore 4 <hi>E.</hi> 3. when they had, upon the Kings earnest pressing them, Tryed and Condemned Sir <hi>Simon de Bereford,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Mautravers,</hi> and other Commoners, they make a Protestation, that they nor their Successors, <hi>Ne seroient mes tenus ne charges a rendre Iugements sur autres, que sur lur Piers: Should not be bound nor charged to give Iudgement upon any but their Peers.</hi> But we know that they have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times turned off Bishops to Inferiour Courts, as appears by the Record of it in the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, the same 4 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Stephen Gravesend,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>London,</hi> was complained of in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by one <hi>Iohn de Wymburne,</hi> for saying, That if <hi>Edward</hi> the Second was yet living, as he was informed he was in <hi>Corf-</hi>Castle, he would assist him with all his power, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establish him in his Throne. Sir <hi>Edward</hi>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:94716:47"/>
                     <hi>Cooke</hi> saith, that by order of Parliament the matter was referred to be tryed in the <hi>Kings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bench,</hi> but the Record saith, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment referred it to the Kings Council, and appointed him to appear before them at <hi>Woodstock</hi> upon <hi>Sunday</hi> fortnight after <hi>Easter,</hi> and that they turned him over to the <hi>Kings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bench</hi> to be Tryed by the Chief Justice <hi>Scroope,</hi> and his fellow Judges. Whereas had this Bishop been then accounted a Peer of the Realm, he must have been Tryed in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the Parliament being once possessed of his Cause, and they could not have referred him to any other Judicature.</p>
                  <p>So here you have four Essential parts of Peerage all of them wanting in Bishops, and the want but of one Essential part is enough to destroy the whole. He can be no Peer of the Realm who is at the Kings sute Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally Tryed by a Jury of Commoners, if <hi>Magna Charta</hi> be good Law, which is our All as we are Free-men. Secondly, He who is not himself enobled, cannot be a Peer in equal rank to one that is: For all Peers are equally Peers, as we may say, Peerage doth not <hi>recipere magis &amp; minus.</hi> The meanest Baron is as much a Peer as the greatest Duke, else they were not Peers, it would be <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictio in adjecto,</hi> an Imparity in a Parity. Thirdly, If the Husband be enobled, the Wife must be so; but the Wife of a Bishop is not enobled, therefore the Person of her Husband is not, for the Wife and the Husband are one. Fourthly, If a Bishop were a Peer, he could in Parliament time be Tryed no where
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:94716:47"/>
but in the House of Peers, but Matter of Fact we find to be otherwise. Therefore, I think, I may safely conclude that Bishops are no Peers.</p>
                  <p>But before I leave this point, I must answer one thing which is said, They say, they hold by Baronage, and therefore they are Barons, as <hi>Fitz Stephen</hi> makes the Bishops in their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercation with the Temporal Lords about the pronunciation of the Sentence against the Arch-bishop, saying, <hi>Non sedemus hic Episcopi, sed Barones: Nos Barones, &amp; vos Barones, Pares hic sumus: We sit not here in Parliament as Bishops, but as Barons; we are Barons, and you are Barons: Here we are Peers. Fitz-Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi>'s authority signifies nothing to me; but this I know is said, and believed by many, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must be answered, to disabuse many, who may think, that holding by Barony creates a Baron, which it doth no more, than holding by Knights service, makes a man a Knight, or holding by Villanage makes a man a Villain, which many do to this day, even but here at <hi>East-Barnet,</hi> and yet are good Free-men and no Villains, for it works not upon the Person, as <hi>Fleta</hi> saith, <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 13. the service they do, is <hi>ratione tenementi non personae.</hi> So the Bishops holding <hi>per Baronagium,</hi> are thereby made subject to do the service of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, and to obey the Kings, Writ of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to attend the Parliament, which makes them Lords of Parliament; but affects not their person. The Bishop of the <hi>Isle of Man</hi> is a Bishop as well as any of the rest, first instituted by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Fourth, as Sir <hi>Edward Cooke</hi> saith; but not holding
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:94716:48"/>
by Baronage, hath no place nor vote in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. We must know that this Tenure by Baronage was first created by <hi>William</hi> the First, of all the Lands which held of the Crown <hi>in Capite,</hi> consisting of so many Knights Fees, these Lands were divided, some to Lay-men, some to Ecclesiastical persons: And these were all bound to certain services, though not all to the same, and among others, all to attend in Parliament, whenever the King pleased to Summon them, and so became Lords of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. This continued so till King <hi>Iohn</hi>'s time, when the number of the Temporal Lords growing so great and numerous, that King made some alteration, which certainly was setled and confirmed by Parliament, but justly the time when this was done is not known, the Record of it being lost. The alteration was, that none of the Temporal Lords should come to Parliament but such as received the Kings Writ, a particular Summons for it. These were called <hi>Barones Majores;</hi> those who were not so summoned, and so did not come to Parliament were stiled <hi>Barones Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nores,</hi> and were still Feodal Barons as before, and held their Lands <hi>per Baronagium,</hi> but were not Lords of Parliament. Therefore it was not barely holding by Barony, which made the person a Baron even in those times, there was an act of the Kings requisite even in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning of him to Parliament, to make that Honour to affect and enoble the Person, and so to fix it, and make it hereditary in the Family; which way of dignifying a Person continued till the eleventh year of <hi>Richard</hi> the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:94716:48"/>
Second, when <hi>Iohn de Beauchamp,</hi> Steward of the Houshold, was first created by Patent, Baron of <hi>Kiderminster,</hi> since which time it hath still been practised to make them all Barons by Patent. But the Bishops have still continued upon the first Institution of being by their Tenures obliged, and accordingly Summoned to attend in Parliament, which made them Lords of Parliament, but not Peers of the Realm.</p>
                  <p>And now I come to his last point making them a Third Estate, for which he cites the Bill presented to <hi>Richard</hi> the Third in his first Parliament where they are made so, and to this I can oppose other passages in Parliament clean contrary, as that 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. where the Temporal Lords and they together, are made to be one of the three Estates, and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances may be given of the same nature: But let us a little consider how that Bill was fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, 1 <hi>R.</hi> 3. it was first devised by certain Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and other Nobles, and notable Personages of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, a Party picked out and chosen for that purpose, who presented it in the behalf, and in the name of the Three Estates of this Realm of <hi>England;</hi> and what was this to do, to declare <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth to have lived in adultery with Dame <hi>Elizabeth Gray,</hi> whom he had married, being precontracted to Dame <hi>Ellianor Bottiler,</hi> daughter to the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and consequently all his Children, Bastards, <hi>Edward</hi> the Fifth a Bastard, and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> his Sister, a Bastard, afterwards mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, which entituled
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:94716:49"/>
him and his Posterity to the Crown, set an end to all the foregoing competitions, and setled it as it is at this day, this Bill, as the Record saith, was first presented and delivered to their Soveraign Lord the King, that was to <hi>R.</hi> 3. whom they made so in the name and on the behalf of the said Three Estates, out of Parliament, and now by the said Three Estates assembled in Parliament, ratified and confirmed. And truly, I must say, this is not an authority to be bragged of, for making the Bishops a Third Estate.</p>
                  <p>But then let us see if the Bishops sitting in the House of Lords, have the necessary and essential qualifications of being a Third Estate in Parliament, without which they cannot be a Third Estate there: That the Clergy is one of the three Estates of the Realm, and they the Principal and Chief of them, no body denies: And that they are Summoned to Parliament as a Third Estate of the Realm, the dignified Clergy personally, others of the Inferiour sort by their Procurators and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives, is likewise confessed; but not to have any part in making of Laws for the good Government of the Kingdom, no not so much as in matters meerly concerning the Church; but they may offer and propose and be consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, but whatever they agree upon must come to the two Houses of Parliament, and receive the stamp of their Authority, before it can be presented to the King to become a Law, and be binding to the People: This is the work of the Convocation which meets at the same time with the Parliament, and there
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:94716:49"/>
is convened the Third Estate of the Realm; Where the Bishops make the Upper House. and there sit as Bishops according to their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality. But their Summons gives them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther capacity, which is to meet in the House of Lords, and there <hi>Cum caeteris Praelatis, Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natibus &amp; Proceribus regni de arduis negotiis Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum regni &amp; Ecclesiae specialiter tangentibus tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctare &amp; consilium impendere;</hi> and thither they are obliged to come and attend by their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure of their Baronies, where they sit in their Personal Capacity, to do the service which they owe for the Lands they hold of the King.</p>
                  <p>Now we will consider, if being there upon such an account, it can any ways stand with reason, and the nature of a Third Estate, to esteem them to be so. 1. To represent the body of the lesser Clergy, as our Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will have them to do, who else, he saith, would be in a worse condition than the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Clown, having no body to represent them in giving Aids and Subsidies; first, I say, that as Subsidies were heretofore given in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was the ancient Parliamentary way of supplying the necessities of the Crown and Government, where the Convocation gave the Supply of the Clergy, the Bishops as Members of the House of Lords, had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do in it, but as Members of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation they had, and the Representatives of the lesser Clergy, who were chosen by them, and made up the Lower House of the Convocation; they gave their consents, and joyned in that Gift for the whole body of the Clergy; the two Houses of Parliament did
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:94716:50"/>
only ratifie and confirm what the Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had done, and therefore only the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and the end of that Act of Subsidy given by the Clergy, not the body of it, was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read in the several Houses of the Lords and Commons. So 4 <hi>R.</hi> 2. the Commons having offered to give an aid, so as the Clergy, who enjoyed a third part of the Realm, would pay one third part of the Summ; the Clergy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <hi>That they were not to grant any Aid by Parliament, but of their own free wills, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore willed the Commons to do their duties, and they would do theirs.</hi> This was the ancient way of granting supplies in Parliament, where you see the lesser Clergy had their Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, which it seems our Asserter did not understand, and so no wonder if he did mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, as he commonly doth. And this I must say further, the lesser Clergy, as he calls them, are little beholding to him, to have them to be represented by Bishops, having no hand in the choice of them: This I am sure, puts them into a meaner condition than the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Clown, who if he have but 40 <hi>s.</hi> Free-hold, gives his voice to whom he will to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present him in Parliament, to give his assent to part with his Money, and to make any Law to bind him. Of later times they have taken up another way of granting publick supplies, which is of so much in the Pound, which they call a Pound-rate, and this brings in the Clergy to pay their proportion, who are now as busie as any in electing of Members to Parliament. In a word, none can represent another in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that is not chosen by him; every
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:94716:50"/>
particular person that hath right of vote, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing included in the majority of Vote: So the whole Clergy, being the third Estate of the Realm, and the Bishops not being chosen by them, they cannot represent that third Estate.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Bishops sit not in the House of Lords <hi>Ratione Spiritualitatis,</hi> as was the opinion of all the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> 7 <hi>H.</hi> 8. in <hi>Keil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>'s Reports, in Dr. <hi>Standish</hi>'s Case. <hi>Les Spiritual Seignieurs nont ascun place en <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p n="3">3. If they be a Third Estate, they must have a Negative voice to whatever is proposed in the House, if the majority of their opinions be against it. And for our Asserter to say, that the Custome, and so the Law of the Parliament is otherwise, and that the two Estates of the Lords Temporal and Spiritual make but one House, where they vote inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixedly. Why, this shews they are not two Estates, because they do vote intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, for if they were so, they must vote severally, and not be twisted so together as they are, as I said before in my former Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, like a nest of Boxes one within another. And think what a disparagement it would be to the House of Lords, that two Estates must be clapped together, to make them equal
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:94716:51"/>
to the one Estate of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If the Bishops were a Third Estate, the Parliament could not act as a Parliament without them, for a Parliament is composed, and must consist of Three Estates, and nothing is binding but what is so passed. But we know that in <hi>Edward</hi> the First's time, there was a Parliament called and held <hi>Clero excluso,</hi> and Laws were there made, when none of them were present, and many Acts have passed in several Parliaments, when the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops have all voted against them. The Judges in that of 7 <hi>H.</hi> 8. deliver their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for Law: <hi>Due nostre Sur le Roy poit as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setz bien tener son Parlement per luy, &amp; ses Temporal Seigniors &amp; per ses Commons, tout sans les Spirituals Seigniors: Our Lord the King can hold his Parliament himself with his Temporal Lords, and his Commons, wholly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Lords Spiritual.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These, and many other Reasons, confirm me in my opinion, that Bishops are neither Peers of the Realm, nor a Third Estate in Parliament, yet they might be both, and not invalidate my Position, which I at first under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to prove, which was only this, that by the Practice and Custome of Parliament, and by the Law of the Land, Bishops are prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited from meddling in Parliament as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the House of Lords in any Tryal of a Criminal Person, where the Charge, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and the Sentence upon it is Capital, and goes to the Loss of Life or Members, only one Precedent excepted, that extravagant one

of 28 <hi>H.</hi> 6. And my good friend the Asserter who hath almost as many <hi>Errata</hi>'s as Lines in his Book, must give me leave to summ up all my Corrections of them in one Distich, as <hi>Martiall</hi> did those of his Friend <hi>Fidentinus;</hi> such another <hi>Fidentinus,</hi> it seems, as our As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serter; and it was this,

And I must say the Verse doth not better <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drare</hi> with the product of his Brains, which hath so many faults as can only be covered and put out of sight with one rasure from the beginning to the end, than this one and the same Name of <hi>Fidentinus</hi> deciphers the Confidence of them both, <hi>Nullâ pallescere culpâ.</hi> And so I shall leave my Friend <hi>Fidentinus</hi> to learn better manners, if he be not altogether incorrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and apply my self to peruse and answer (if I can) a Treatise of a worthy Gentleman, who is, I see, of a differing opinion from me, and hath much more of reason, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, though not much more of civility and fairness in the maintaining of it, so as whether or no his reasons will convince me, I know not; but if they do, I will certainly grant it, for my Maxime is still, <hi>Amicus Plato, amicus Socrates, sed magis amica Veritas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Writer of this Treatise, intituled, <hi>The Grand Question concerning the Bishops right to vote in Parliament in Cases Capital, Stated and Argued;</hi> doth state the Question right, that is, <hi>Whether the Bishops may be present and</hi>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:94716:52"/>
                     <hi>vote Judicially in Capital Cases which come to be judged in Parliament, either in giving the Judgement it self, or in resolving and determining any circumstance preparatory, and leading to that Judgement.</hi> Then he sets down some things granted on both sides, as 1. <hi>That Bishops do sit in Parliament by vertue of their Baronies, and are bound to serve the King there.</hi> From this he infers they have a Right of Judicature, which is not denied; but the question is, as he saith himself, what this Judicature is. 2 <hi>That they sit by the same kind of Writ, that other Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons do.</hi> Upon which he would infer, that they are impowered and required to confer and treat of all the weighty affairs that shall be brought before them, the King having not limited nor restrained the one more than the other. But it follows not, because all are called together by the same authority, that therefore the same duty is incumbent upon all, if there be a higher power that directs what every ones duty is to do, when they are come together. Now the King acts in a higher Sphere by the Law of the Land, and the law and practice of Parliament which prohibits Bishops from meddling with judging of Capital Causes in Parliament, nor did they ever do it, but in one extravagant proceeding in 28 <hi>H.</hi> 6. where nothing was regular nor Parliamentary from the beginning to the end, which I look upon as altogether insignificant to alter what is so setled by Law and constant Custome, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Kings Writ of Summons cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with that, to make that lawful, which in it self is unlawful; as I have sufficiently
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:94716:52"/>
proved it. And I will now go a little further in it, than I did before, for hitherto I have only insisted upon the Law of Parliaments, as a thing setled in Parliament by the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Clarendon</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the Second's time, and the Protestation of the Bishops enrolled in Parliament by the King, Lords and Commons, 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. but now I will deliver my opinion (which I submit to better Judgements) that they lye still under a Restraint by the Canon Law, which by the Statute 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 12. which (was repealed 1 and 2 <hi>Phil.</hi> and <hi>Mar.</hi> but revived 1 <hi>Eliz.)</hi> is still of force, where it is not repugnant to the Laws of the Realm, which we are sure this branch of it, restraining Bishops from judging Capitally is not; so far from it, that it is confirmed and strengthened by the Law of the Land. 3. The third Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in which he saith all agree, is, <hi>That they have their Votes in Bills of Attainder, acting in their Legislative capacity, which is as much a Case of Blood as the other, and perhaps as much forbidden by the Canon.</hi> But I desire this worthy Person to consider, that the Practice of Parliament is the Law of Parliament, and is the commanding Law for regulating the Proceedings of Parliament, and that hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled this Point, that in the making of a Law, every Free-man of the Kingdom doth give his consent, either explicitly if he be a Member of either House, or implicitly by his Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, for every Free-man of the Kingdome is there present, or represented. And it is the Fundamental Constitution of our <hi>English</hi> Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that no man can be bound by any
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:94716:53"/>
Law, but what himself hath consented to; now a Bill of Attainder is as much a Law as any Statute Law of the Kingdom. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Bishops have acted in a Legislative capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to judge and condemn Capitally, as seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Precedents we have of it in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight's time, but not in a judicial capacity. And to say the Canon Law prohibits one as much as the other, the Statute of 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. clears that point, which takes away the force of the Canon in the one, not to abridge Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Parliament from voting in the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slative way, and strengthens it in the other, forbidding Bishops to vote Judicially in Cases of Blood. Yet if you will have me deliver you freely my opinion in it, I think it is an abuse crept in since <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight's time, for before none were judged by Bill, but such as had been slain in open War, or Tryed, Condemned and Executed by Commission, and then the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings brought into Parliament, and there appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of, and the Attainder confirmed, but under <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth several persons were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by Bill, and the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our memories, which seems now to be authorized by the Practice of Parliament. Sir <hi>Edw. Cooke</hi> tells a story which he had from Sir <hi>Thomas Gaudy,</hi> one of the Judges of the <hi>Kings-bench,</hi> how the King had commanded <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> to attend the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices, and know of them, if a man who was forth coming should be condemned by Act of Parliament, without being heard; who after some fencing, answered if it were so, it could not be afterwards called into question; and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:94716:53"/>
                     <hi>Cromwel</hi> himself was not long after so served; but this is by the way. <hi>Multa quae fieri non de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent, facta valent.</hi> I have been a little the longer in these particulars, because it will much smooth our way in the following discourse.</p>
                  <p>And this worthy Gentleman must give me leave to say, That he needed not have put himself to all that trouble of his first Chapter, in telling us of the mighty power the Clergy had in the Primitive times in the ordering of Secular affairs, which certainly was more by way of Counsel, than any thing of Authority by way of Judgement, and in a Judicial way. And he will avow to me, I doubt not, that the ministery of the word was a full employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Apostles, and so for Bishops, who call themselves their Successors, as well as serving of Tables, and other ministerial duties was a full employment for those whom he calls the Treasurers of the Church; and therefore they said it for themselves, and left it as a Rule for their Successors, even to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and all other dispencers of the Word and Sacraments, that it was not reason they should leave the Word of God, and serve Tables. Which it seems was a <hi>Non est Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> by the Law of God, just as by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law of the Kingdom, a Writ was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, declaring it to be likewise a <hi>Non est Consonum,</hi> and to be <hi>Contra morem &amp; Consuetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem Regni,</hi> that Clergy-men should be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in Secular affairs. This indeed I hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at then, as I gave also some little touch at the Government of the Church by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Law, but not that I put any stress upon
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:94716:54"/>
it, but meerly to circumscribe the Question, and keeping it within limits, by a Negative, declaring what it was not, and an Affirmative, expressing what it was, how Bishops in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament could not Judicially act in Capital Cases.</p>
                  <p>Therefore were it all so as this learned Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman seems to infer, that in <hi>France, Spain, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and those Northern Kingdoms which he mentions, that Bishops were joyned with the Civil Magistrates in ordering the Publick Affairs of those Nations, and that they had a share not only in the Legislative, but in the Judiciary part, as he alledgeth two Authors to prove it to have been in <hi>France,</hi> it would not be of any signification to decide our Controversie, for what is this to us to regulate our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to operate on our Laws? But first for matter of Fact, as to <hi>France,</hi> to which I can speak a little, having spent many years in that Kingdom, and I have, by way of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, informed my self from the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour who is here from that Crown, who doth assure me, that the Judges (whom they call Counsellors, and not Judges, as we do) who are Clergy-men, as many there are joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the others of the Laity, never sit in that Chamber of Parliament, which trys Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Causes, which they call the <hi>Tournelle.</hi> I believe the same may be observed in those other Countries which our Author mentions, and I do not see how it could be otherwise, the severity of the Canon Law being so strict in the prohibition of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:94716:54"/>
But as I said before, the Primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had that veneration for the Clergy, and especially for the Bishops, that they were still joyned with the Civil Magistrate, in order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the affairs both in Church and State. The matters of the Church, they determined Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, in Secular affairs, whether Criminal or other, only by way of Counsel, if the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magistrate to whose Province they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, did not do his part. I am sure it was so in <hi>England. Brompton</hi> in his Chronicle, recites the Laws of King <hi>Athelstane</hi> in this particular: I cited his very words in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal in my former Letter, I shall now repeat them very faithfully in <hi>English.</hi> He saith, <hi>It appertains of right to a Bishop to promote that which is right, both concerning God and the World.</hi> A little after he addeth, <hi>He ought likewise diligently, together with the Secular Judges, to promote Peace and Concord.</hi> And soon upon it, he hath this passage, <hi>The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop ought to be present in Judgement with the Secular Judges, not to suffer any buds of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to sprout, if he can hinder it.</hi> His Presence and his Counsel was rather a check upon the Judge, than to determine any thing in Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar affairs. Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> is a little more particular in delivering unto us the nature of that mixt Court, it is in his Glossary upon the word <hi>Comes. The Earl,</hi> he saith, <hi>did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side in that County Court, not alone, but joyned with the Bishop; he to deliver what was Gods Law, the other what was Mans Law, and that the one should help and counsel the other: Especially the Bishop to do it to the Earl, for it was lawful</hi>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:94716:55"/>
                     <hi>for him sometimes to reprove the other, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him, bring him into order if he went astray.</hi> Then he tells us what the work of that Court was, that it had cognizance but of petty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>That the Earl had not cognizance of great mens businesses, for such matters are to be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kings Courts, he only judges poor mens Causes. Hence it is, that by our Law, Actions for Debts and Trespasscs are not to be commenced in the County Court, if it be for above the value of</hi> 40s. It seems that in ancient times it was but one Court, but each Judge had his proper work, the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Judge to distribute and deliver to them what was Gods Law, the Secular Judge, Mans Law. And so it continued till <hi>William</hi> the First's time, who first separated the two Courts, as appears by his Charter to Bishop <hi>Remigius,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> relates in his Comment upon <hi>Eadmerus,</hi> p. 167. which he saith the King did <hi>Communi Concilio Archiepiscoporum suorum &amp; raeterorum Episcoporum, &amp; Abba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, &amp; omnium Principum regni sui: In a Common Council, by the advice of his Arch bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and the rest of the Bishops and Abbots, and all the great men of the Kingdom:</hi> The words are, <hi>Wherefore I command you, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn you by my Royal authority, that no Bishop nor Arch deacon presume to hold Plea in the Hundred Court any more upon the Episcopal Laws, nor bring any Cause that pertains to the rule of Souls before the Judgement of Secular persons, but that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is questioned according to the Episcopal Laws for any misdemeanour or fault, shall come to that place which the Bishop shall chuse and nominate for that purpose, and there shall make answer for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:94716:55"/>
                     <hi>and not in the Hundred Court, but shall, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Canons, and the Episcopal Laws, do that which is just and right both to God and to his Bishop.</hi> This was again confirmed 2 <hi>R.</hi> 2. and so the Courts came to be divided, as they continue to this day. But nothing can be concluded out of that large Enumeration, of the Bishops being admitted in those ancient times to Publick Councils, which was more for their Advice, and Counsel and Direction, than to act any thing at all Authoritatively and Juridically, and least of all to have any vote to determine any thing in Cases of Blood, which the Canon Law made a <hi>Noli me tangere</hi> to them: I deny not, but before there were Christian Magistrates, even in the Apostles times, the Ministers of the Gospel did many times interpose and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile differences and sutes, which many times happened amongst believers; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Is there not a wise man among you, no not one that shall be able to judge between his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren?</hi> Nor doth he exclude the Bishops, that they may not come in as one of those wise men: Yet 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 4. he seems to exclude them: For he saith, <hi>If then ye have judgement of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the Church.</hi> Which doth seem to intimate, as if he meant not the Bishops, for sure they are not least esteemed. But doth any man think, that they were by this authorized to compel men to submit to their Judgement, to punish or imprison, or lay any corporal punishment upon them, if they would not? Indeed I cannot think so.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:94716:56"/>
Nor do I find that St. <hi>Augustine</hi> was of that opinion, the term he gives to those whom the Author of that Treatise will have to be Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Judges, doth not imply so much, rather the contrary methinks: He calls them <hi>Cognitores,</hi> which denotes rather one that took notice of such differences, and would endeavour to compose them, than a Judge to determine them, which hath made me exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that passage more particularly. In his Comment upon the 118 Psalm he saith, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of those who interrupted them in their enquiry into the duty which they owed to the Commandments of God, <hi>Non solum cum perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quuntur, aut litigare nobiscum volunt, verum eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am cum obsequuntur &amp; honorant, &amp; tamen cum suis vitiosis &amp; negotiosis cupiditatibùs adiuvandis ut occupemur, &amp; eis nostra tempore impendamus, efflagitant, aut certè infirmos premunt, ut causas suas ad nos deferre compellant, quibus dicere non audemus, dic homo, quis me constituit Iudicem aut divisorem inter vos? Constituit enim talibus causis Ecclesiasticos Apostolus Cognitores, in foro prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bens jurgare Christianos.</hi> Here is nothing of coercion in all this, they acted not as Judges, nay, he complains that the Clergy-men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were persecuted, and compelled to go to Law; or if they seemed to shew them some respect, and would be ruled by them, and drew them from their occupations to compose things between them, they would not drive them away, and say, who made me a Judge between you? For the Apostle who forbids Christians going to Law, makes the Clergy to be <hi>Cognitores,</hi> Referees or Umpires between
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:94716:56"/>
which is the greatest act of Charity that can be, and most befitting the calling of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Gods Word. But what saith St. <hi>Austin</hi> a little after, <hi>Good men he saith will hearken to us, and seldome trouble us with their Secular affairs, but others, qui inter se pertinaciter agunt, &amp; quando bonos premunt, nostra Iudicata contemnunt, faciunt que nobis perire tempora rebus eroganda di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinis:</hi> Good men will hearken to him, he saith, but those who are perverse do <hi>Iudicata contemnere,</hi> despise his award of it; which shews he took not upon him any authority of determining any thing. And so in his 147th Epistle to <hi>Proculianus</hi> the <hi>Donatist,</hi> he hath this passage, <hi>Et homines quidem causas suas Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culares apud nos finire cupientes, quando eis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarii fuerimus sic nos Sanctos &amp; Dei servos appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant ut negotia terrae suae peragant, aliquando aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus &amp; negotium salutis nostrae, &amp; salutis ipsorum: Non de auro, non de argento, non de fundis &amp; pecoribus, pro quibus rebus quotidie submisso capite salutamur, ut dissentiones hominum terminemus,</hi> &amp;c. Nothing plainer than that all this is pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of good will a work of Charity to those who desire him to determine their Secular dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, in which the Clergy then had meerly an eye upon Gods Glory, the good of their own Souls, and of the Souls of those for whom they took that pains. But all this is <hi>Nihil ad rem,</hi> let the Clergy have right or no right to judge of Secular Causes, it will not decide our Controversie, Whether Bishops in Parliament can meddle in cases of Blood: <hi>Hic Rodus, Hic Saltus,</hi> if we do all extravagate, I must come back to this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:94716:57"/>
His next Chapter will be more to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, it is concerning the Constitutions of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> and the Protestation of the Bishops 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. These two particulars well cleared, and no disguise put upon them, will go a great way: He begins with the Constitutions of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> which he conceives to be that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops are thereby required to be present in the Kings Courts, as other Barons are, till they come to give Sentence as to dismembring, or loss of life, and his Method is to judge of them by these three ways: 1. The occasion. 2. The plain sense of the words, according to their true reading. 3. By the subsequent Practice upon this constitution in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Northampton</hi> soon after.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the occasion, this Author is pleased to say, he can hardly believe I should betray so much unskilfulness in the affairs of those times, as to say, that the Bishops did then affect such a power of Judicature in Secular Causes, and I think I have good warrant to be of that opinion. <hi>Petrus Blesensis,</hi> whom this Author cites, as living in <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond's time, and knowing the whole proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of those Constitutions, complains of it sufficiently. In the first and genuine Edition of them, Printed at <hi>Mentz</hi> in Quarto, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by <hi>Busaeus</hi> the Jesuite in 1600, in his Treatise <hi>De institutione Episcopi,</hi> p. 542. he hath this passage, <hi>Illud coelestem exasperat iram &amp; plerisque discrimen damnationis accumulat, quod quidam principes Sacerdotum &amp; seniores populi licet non dictent Iudicia Sanguinis, eadem tamen tractent disputando &amp; disceptando de illis, seque</hi>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:94716:57"/>
                     <hi>ideo immunes à culpa reputant, quod mortis aut truncationis membrorum Iudicium discernentes, à prounciatione duntaxat &amp; executione poenalis sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiae se absentant. Sed quid hac simulatione perniciosius est? Nunquid discutere &amp; definire licitum est, quod pronunciare non licet? This provokes Gods wrath, and heaps up upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a danger of damnation, that some of the prime of Church-men, and Elders of the People, though they do not dictate Iudgements of Blood, yet they debate them, and dispute of them, and therefore repute themselves free from fault, in regard they have withdrawn themselves from being present, at the pronouncing and giving order for the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the penal Iudgement, though they had before agreed to the punishment of Death, or loss of Limbs. But what can be more pernicious than such dissembling? Can it be lawful to debate and to determine a thing, which it is unlawful to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce? Then he compares them to King</hi> Saul, <hi>that had resolved upon the destruction of</hi> David, <hi>but would not that his hand should be upon him, but that he should fall by the hands of the</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines; <hi>or to the Scribes and Pharisees, that cryed out against our Saviour, Crucifie him, Crucifie him, but said it was not lawful for them to put any man to death.</hi> Is not this as good as <hi>Chaucer</hi>'s Fryer that this Author quips me with, <hi>p.</hi> 4.? I do not say that <hi>Blesensis</hi> blamed all the Bishops for evading the Law in that manner, he saith they were <hi>quidam Principes Sacerdotum,</hi> some of the great Bishops. But the Author would have it to be the Universal Practice and Opinion of all the Bishops and Clergy to understand the Constitution of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendon,</hi>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:94716:58"/>
that they might continue to sit in Judgement till the Sentence was to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced; and in the Edition of <hi>Blesensis,</hi> Printed at <hi>Paris</hi> in 1667. instead of <hi>quidam</hi> it is Printed <hi>quidem,</hi> but by a manifest error which carries no sense with it, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Notes in both Editions shew it, which is, <hi>Abusus Clericorum qui causas sanguinis discu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiunt;</hi> marking out the abuse of them that did so. This was obvious enough to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in his quotation of <hi>Blesensis,</hi> therefore he might have spared the censure of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfulness in the affairs of these times, since I had such a Leader to follow as <hi>Blesensis;</hi> and more have I cause to complain of his want of Charity to me, <hi>p.</hi> 31. taxing me with representing those constitutions very unfairly, which is an expression of one engaged in a party, and not of one that only seeks for truth, but to shew his Reading and Learning, as I am afraid that Author doth, who raiseth a great deal of dust meerly to blind mens eyes, and mis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lead them into errours; and thus he commends himself for speaking mildly, and much good may his mildness do him.</p>
                  <p>It is apparent that the Clergy were then very high, having gotten a great head by the favour they had found from the Usurper King <hi>Stephen,</hi> where on both sides they served one anothers turns, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, to bring things again into order, call'd that great Counsel at <hi>Clarendon,</hi> where, by the Advice of the Prelates and the Nobility of the Realm, a recapitulation was made of part of the ancient customs and priviledges under
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:94716:58"/>
the former King, and particularly under his Grand-father <hi>Henry</hi> the First, which for the future he would have to be observed in the Kingdom, and thus <hi>Propter dissentiones &amp; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordias saepe immergentes inter Clerum &amp; Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciarios Domini Regis &amp; Magnatum Regni.</hi> There were sixteen of those Articles, the eleventh was, that they should hold their possessions of the King in <hi>Capite, sicut Barc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam;</hi> and should be answerable to the King for their Services; and should as Barons, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teresse Judiciis Curiae Regis, quousque perveniatur ad diminutionem Membrorum, vel ad Mortem.</hi> Here we see the occasion of that meeting at <hi>Clarendon,</hi> it was to remove all causes of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Great Bishops and the Civil Magistrates; let us now see what was most likely to displease them, it's not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable it should be for being reduced to stand upon even ground with the rest of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and great men of the Realm; but if in any thing they are made less, and abridg'd of the powers which the others have, it stands most with reason they should be troubled at that; and to be forc'd to walk out of the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-hall after they had cryed <hi>Crucifige,</hi> is a great lessening of their figure, I think more than if they had not at all meddled in it. But this Worthy Author saith, I have made use of the most Imperfect Copy of <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> and saith in the <hi>Vatican</hi> Copy, and several MSS. it runs thus, <hi>Debent interesse Judiciis Curiae Regis cum Baronibus, donec perveniatur in Iudicio ad diminutionem Membrorum vel ad Mortem.</hi> Now in my opinion, this makes more against
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:94716:59"/>
the sense he would put upon these words, which is, that they may stay and have a hand in managing the debate upon the Evidence, and agreeing upon the Sentence, but must be gone when it is pronounced, (which as I said before, I look upon as a greater scorn put upon them, as <hi>Blesensis</hi> saith, <hi>Quid hac simula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione perniciosius est, nunquid discutere &amp; definire licitum, quod non licet pronunciare.)</hi> For I should think that mentioning <hi>in Iudicio</hi> in the second part should not have a different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structionthan <hi>Iudiciis Curiae</hi> in the first part. For there the <hi>Judicia Curiae</hi> which they may be present at, is to be understood of the whole proceeding, from the bringing in of the Charge against a Criminal person, to the pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the Sentence: And can it be rationally thought that <hi>Iudicium</hi> in the second place should be meant only of the sentence which is the principal part, and which the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mans nature doth chiefly lead him unto. The Poet saith,
<q>
                        <l>——Qui nolunt occidere quenquam,</l>
                        <l>Posse volunt—</l>
                     </q>
This power of killing and slaying, <hi>Potestas Iuvandi &amp; Nocendi,</hi> is a pleasing thing, and we are naturally angry with what abridgeth us of it. So I must conclude this point, that it's most probable the Bishops were most scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized at this eleventh Article.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Let us consider how to arrive at the true meaning of that constitution, which must be by comparing the passages of these
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:94716:59"/>
times together, whereby we shall see how they understood it: Yoyu have already heard what <hi>Petrus Blesensis</hi> judged of those who would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Image of Judicature, how much he blamed them, and what menaces of Gods Judgements he denounced against them, for the words of that Constitution were not so clear and positive that it gave not <hi>Ansam dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putandi</hi> to those whose Inclinations led them to turn it into another sense, and content themselves to play at small Games rather than sit out altogether. So the Wisdome of that time to make it yet more plain, and take away all ambiguity, moved the King to call another Great Council at <hi>Westminster</hi> in the year 1175. eleven years after, <hi>Ad Emenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem Anglicanae Ecclesiae ex assensu Domini Regis &amp; Primorum omnium Regni;</hi> where the third Article is, <hi>His qui in Sacris ordinibus constituti sunt Iudicium Sanguinis agitare non licet unde prohibemus ne aut per se membrorum truncationes faciant, aut inferendas judicent. Quod siquis tale fecerit concessi ordinis privetur officio &amp; loco, Inhibemus etiam sub interminatione anathematis, ne quis Sacerdos habeat vicecomitum aut praeposit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> secularis officium.</hi> It is not lawful for those who are in Holy Orders to act at all in Judgements of Blood, wherefore we forbid them to have any thing to do with taking off mens Limbs, or to judge of any such thing. And if any do such a thing, he shall be deprived of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and dignity of his Orders: And we also forbid, under the pain of being Anathematized, that no Priest shall take upon him the Office of a Sheriff, or of a Secular Judge. This
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:94716:60"/>
makes it out plain, what the sense of those times was; that it was not lawful for them to act at all in cases of Blood; and this is as much the Law of the Land, as the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> or as any other Statute Law. But our Author, <hi>p.</hi> 42. quarrels at this, as only standing upon <hi>Roger Hoveden</hi>'s authority, and wishes he had produced the whole Canon entire for it: Here you have two of our Ancient Historians that liv'd in these times, and agree <hi>in Terminis</hi> upon the relation of what there passed: But our Author is not satisfied, tells us the Council of <hi>Toledo</hi> makes an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and leaves out the prohibition, which declares the meaning and extent of their Canon: He will have this Prohibition, and Sanction of deprivation to attend only upon the latter part, that is, if they do joyn in pronouncing the Sentence: But where doth he find that distinction allowed, it is what the Clergy have framed and imagined to themselves to give them some Power: Admit we should allow them that, it makes it not the more lawful for them; there is still a <hi>Non licet,</hi> which is subject to punishment, and though the Ecclesiastical Law doth not go to that height to cut off a Member, deprive him <hi>ab Officio &amp; Beneficio,</hi> yet it may go less in a lower Sentence, however the Civil Sanction may impose what punishment such a misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour may deserve.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>THis Tractate which is now made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, was written soon after the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of that Book intituled,</hi> The Grand Question concerning the Bishops Right to vote in Parliament in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses Capital, stated and argued, <hi>&amp;c. It hath lain by the Author many Months, and should still have continued in the Dark had not the unseasonable thrusting into the World of a Book, called,</hi> An Argument for the Bishops Right in judging in Capital Cases in Parliament. <hi>For their Right</hi> unalterable <hi>to that place in the Government they now enjoy (by one</hi> Thomas Hunt <hi>
                        <abbr>Esq</abbr>) stirred up the Pens of others, and the desire of Friends, me among them, to assert, as I believe, the contrary Truth. I assure the Reader; I did not at all guess the Author of the</hi> Grand Question, <hi>when I took into my thoughts the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of his Book. Fame hath since put it upon a Person of so great Worth and Learning in all sorts of Literature, and for whom I have not only a particular Honour my self, but the present and future Times will look upon as one of the greatest Champions of the</hi> English <hi>Church against Popish Superstition and Idolatry. I should difficultly have been engaged in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, did I not know the Modesty and Ingenuity of this Learned Person is so great, that he will not</hi>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:94716:63"/>
                     <hi>take it ill to have his Reasons examined by a far less knowing Pen, which shall be always ready to submit to better Judgments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I have examined this Author, Chapter by Chapter, have given Answers to his Reasons, and shewed the Infirmity of those Records he hath thought proper to urge for his Opinion, and have given some other of my own, not taken notice of by him, I hope material to that end for which they are alleged: I was not willing to trust too much to Abridgments; nor had either the Time or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience to search the Originals, and therefore had recourse for some to a very near Relation of my own, who is well stored with that sort of Treasure, and who never denied me the use of any thing in his well-furnish'd Library I desired from him. Truth is but one; but Men may va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in their Apprehensions concerning it. As to others which I could not be supplied with from him, I must acknowledg my self deeply obliged to my much honoured, and very learned Friend, Mr.</hi> William Petyt, <hi>of the Inner Temple, who was not only pleased to read over the ensuing Treatise, but to give me the sight of a rich Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine of the Transcripts of Records which he hath fairly written by him, as also to give me the Copies of some, necessary to my purpose, which I either had not, or not so fully as from him. The Wrold hath already seen something of his, and may in due time expect more, in Reply to the learned Dr.</hi> Brady, <hi>in whom I find various and useful Learning, but (if I may have leave to say so) one misled in some measure by different Notions of Words, and Interpretations of them, contrary to</hi>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:94716:63"/>
                     <hi>their known and common Acceptation. Some part of his Book hath been already considered by the Author of</hi> Jani Anglorum facies altera: <hi>But the intire Answer to it we must expect from Mr.</hi> Petyt, <hi>who hath favoured me with the sight of a short Specimen of a greater Work to follow. I must not here forget my very deserving, and worthy Friend Mr.</hi> Atwood <hi>of</hi> Grays-Inn, <hi>whose Assistance I received in transcribing some Records for me. He is a Person whom God hath endowed with a good Estate, and a large measure of Knowledg, for the few Years he hath hitherto spent in the World, and who (I speak it to the shame of most of our young Men) spends his time in Studies useful to himself and to the Kingdom in which he lives. Having already seen from his youthful Labours so good Effects, we may well expect from his more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Judgment things of greater Advantage to the learned part of this Nation.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>But let us now return to Mr.</hi> Hunt, <hi>a good Protestant he appears to be in his Postscript, which in these unconstant times deserves Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation; and in his Book, he shews himself a Man of various reading and learning, with a competent Knowledg in the Tongues, but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, if I much mistake not, a Man of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and undigested Notions, by which he forces things to serve his turn, contrary to their true meaning, from meer Conjectures and Surmises of his own, without any colour of Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. His whole Book consists of three Parts, Argumentative, Invective, or Reproachful and Extravagant, or Conjectural. I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare</hi>
                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:94716:64"/>
                     <hi>his Argumentative Part better than to a gleaning after a full Vintage. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it which had not been soreseen by the Author of the</hi> Grand Question, <hi>and pressed by him with much more Learning, Subtilty, and Closeness of arguing, or else wholly left out as unconclusive to the matter he had in hand; of whom it may be said, what was once of</hi> Hector <hi>in another Case,</hi> Si Pergama dextra defendi possent, etiam &amp; hâc defensa fuissent. <hi>What is by me said in answer to his Arguments in this Treatise, must be left to the Judgment of such as shall read it. The second Part is invective, reproachful, and unsavoury, in which I would advise no Writer to follow his Steps. Soft Words, and strong Arguments, may convince a Reader, whom railing Language will but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperate. I shall name some few of that sort, that he may not think I accuse him falsly.</hi>

The Reader will pardon this Warmth in me; when I hear a Person, now at rest, so slighted, who, had he been alive, this little Gown-man durst not have approached without marks of Reverence, and Submission.

I am confident, no Parliament will endeavour to take from them their just Right; but to say they cannot, and that the Government cannot then subsist, is as absurd, as the other is unlikely. I must further observe, that this Author doth upon all Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons blame those Persons, who deny the Prelates that judicial Power in Capital Cases he would place in them as Enemies to the Government; whereas he ought to know, that</hi> Exceptio pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat regulam, in non exceptis. <hi>He that gives them Authority in all things that are clear, and denies it them in dubious, doth more asserttheir Right, then he that by giving it them in all things, doth rather perplex it.

DId the Author of this Treatise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Lord Bishops vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting as Judges in Parliament, in Cases of Life and Member, could any way conduce either to their Honour or Greatness, or the Good of the Church and Nation, he would never have entred the List in this Quarrel, being himself wholly conformable; and in his Judgment fully approving the Polity of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as the best reformed of any other he knows, having cleared herself from the Superstitious Formalities of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> on the one hand, and on the other, not requiring from her Children, under Terms of Communion, any thing, in which she may not lawfully as he thinks be obeyed. But being fully convinced, that their asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Right in themselves, will bring forth no other Fruit, except Envy to their Persons, and perhaps sometime or other, through the unequal Affections of a head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strong People, Prejudice to their Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I have been the more easily indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to make known my Thoughts herein.</p>
                  <p>I observe there have already been made publick six elaborate Treatises upon this Subject; four asserting a Right in them to vote in Parliament in matters of Blood, and two against it. But because the last and most learned Tractate, which goes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:94716:67"/>
the name of the <hi>Grand Question,</hi> &amp;c. is look'd upon, and indeed is the most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, I shall apply my self chiefly to the Examination of his Arguments, and I hope discover the Errors, Fallacies, or Inconse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of them.</p>
                  <p>He tells us at first, that 'tis granted on both sides, that the Bishops sit in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Gr. Qu. <hi>p.</hi> 1.</note> by virtue of their Baronies. This I must take Liberty to question as doubtful, still premising that Truth doth not lye in what Men may say of themselves, or passeth under common Estimation of Men, but what upon serious Examinition of the Question shall be found to be true, I shall endeavour to make it appear, that many who held Lands in <hi>Cap per Baroniam,</hi> or, <hi>per servitium Baroniae,</hi> were not enobled in Blood, nor had Right to demand their Writ of Summons as the Noble Barons had, but were to expect the King's Will and Pleasure, and were often left out: These were <hi>secundae Dignitatis Barones,</hi> or Barons by Tenure only, of which some might probably be adopted into the <hi>Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litas Major,</hi> afterwards as <hi>Barones adscriptij,</hi> yet at first were not so; and this was to them an Honour, but to the Bishops a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, who held their Lands free before, and had no Honour conferred upon them as the rest had. For tho it be true that all the great Noble-Men held <hi>per Baroniam;</hi> yet was it not their Tenure which gave them that Right, as I shall shew by and by.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:94716:67"/>
These second sort of Barons were called Barons Peers, because they held of the King <hi>in Capite,</hi> as his immediate Free-hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and were stiled <hi>Barones Regis,</hi> for the Word imported then no more but Men holding of the King's Person <hi>in Capite.</hi> These subdivided their Lands to others, under the like Military Service; these were likewise called Barons from their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing at their Lord's Court, called the Court Baron; and <hi>Baronagium</hi> became a Word of general Signification, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending those <hi>liberè Tenentes,</hi> or Sutors to the Court <hi>Baron,</hi> who together with the King's immediate Tenants, who were the <hi>Barones Regis,</hi> that is, the Kings immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Free-holders, made up the <hi>Communitas Angliae,</hi> and comprehended all Persons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept such as held in Villenage. Besides these, thus made by the King, there were others, some found here, some brought out of <hi>Normandy,</hi> of great Nobility and Extraction, who had of their own, great Possessions, as Earldoms and Counties in this Country, and others brought over with the Conquerour out of <hi>Normandy,</hi> of an Inferiour Rank, to whom he gave the like Honour, out of the Lands of those ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to <hi>Harold,</hi> which all held of him <hi>per Baroniam,</hi> but by Creation were many of them afterwards made of a higher Rank, and were called <hi>Comites Regis,</hi> and <hi>Majores Barones Regni;</hi> they being possessed of the like Honours in their several Countries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:94716:68"/>
The Bishops, I conceive, were not under any of these Ranks, but were called to Parliaments <hi>ratione Episcopalis Dignita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, not ratione Tenurae,</hi> only, of which they complained as a Burthen. Creation they had none to any higher Honour than Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal; their Tenure could not give them a greater Honour than to be <hi>Barones mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> or Barons, Peers. Neither can I find in any Act of Parliament or Record, that they were called Lords before the time of <hi>Rich.</hi> II. and then first called Lords Spiritual, to shew their Honour arose from their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Function, and not from any Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Possessions; nor the name of Barons applied to them except by themselves, who perhaps finding the Burthen of their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which before was free, were willing that others should give them the Title, tho there was no more reason that their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure by <hi>Baron</hi> Service should make them <hi>Barons,</hi> than that Knight Service should make the Tenant a Knight. Having thus cleared my way, I shall in the next place, shew that these <hi>Barones Minores,</hi> or Barons Peers, were sometimes summoned by Writs to Parliament, and sometimes left out. The Abbot of <hi>Feversham</hi> (one under the <note place="margin">Seld. Tit. hon. <hi>p.</hi> 730. <hi>I</hi> edit <hi>fol.</hi>

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:94716:68"/>
an Amerciment in the Exchequer, pleads he was no Baron: now except he had held <hi>in Cap. per Baroniam,</hi> or part of a Barony, he could not have been summoned at all as a Member of Parliament. Whether his Plea were allowed doth not appear upon the Record, but by this and some other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords in my hand to the same purpose, it seems to me that many that held <hi>per Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam,</hi> were not Barons, but at the best Bannerets, or Barons Peers.</p>
                  <p>I cannot find by my utmost search, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing <hi>hitherto</hi> hath madeit apparent, that Baronies were ever annexed to the Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Bishops; but Men have general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken it for granted, that they were so. They say that <hi>William</hi> the first, soon after his Reception to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> did introduce new Tenures, and establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Counties and Baronies, and did then order that Bishops, and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Clergy should hold <hi>per Baroniam,</hi> or <hi>sicut Baroniam,</hi> which the Learned Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> saith in the language of those Times signified the same thing: For he saith, that <hi>tenere de Rege in capite,</hi> and <hi>habere possessio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes sicut Baroniam;</hi> and to be a Baron ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws of those Times, are synonimous: <hi>Seld.

                     <hi>Cook, Hakewell,</hi> and others say they hold <hi>per Baroniam.</hi> But the Proofs, any that I have met with, offer to make good this Division by <hi>William,</hi> or that Tenure <hi>per Baroniam,</hi> did infer more when a <hi>minor</hi>

Baron in my Judgment, are not cogent. What they urge is taken out of <hi>Wendover,</hi> and from him transcribed by <hi>Matth. Paris.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mat Par. <hi>p</hi> 7. ult. ed.</note> He first greatly blaming the Act of <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> hath these Words; <hi>Episcopatus, &amp; Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batias, omnes quae Baronias tenebant, &amp; cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus ab omni servitute saeculari libertatem habu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erant sub servitute statuit militars irrotulans singulos Episcopatus, &amp; Abbatias pro volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate suâ quot Milites sibi, &amp; successoribus suis Hostilitatis tempore voluit a singulis exhiberi.</hi> That is;</p>
                  <p>He established under Military Service all Bishopricks, and Abbeys which held Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronies, and at that time had freedom from all Secular Service, inrolling them all, and appointing according to his Pleasure what Souldiers in time of War they should seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally find unto him, and his Successors.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> finding the contradiction in these Words, that their Baronies which should have kept them, as he thought, free from Secular Service, as the words import, were the only thing that bound them to it, thinks there ought to be a Parenthesis af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Baronias (in purâ &amp; perpetuâ eleemosina) &amp; eatenus ab omni servitio saeculari,</hi> &amp;c. and makes the words run thus: All Bishops and Abbeys that held Baronies in <hi>Frankalmoign,</hi> and in that respect freed from all Secular Service, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And backs this Conjecture by the Authority of Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> who he conceives might have seen some Copy where those words were. But he need not
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:94716:69"/>
have put himself to the trouble of that Conjecture, had he translated <hi>(eatenus) at</hi>

                     <hi>that time,</hi> as the word signifies, and never that I know <hi>in that respect.</hi> However, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing further, that this would not take away all doubt, because the words refer not to all Bishopricks and Abbeys, but to such only as then possessed Baronies, for ought ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears of elder time, which he denies any did before the time of <hi>William</hi> the first, (of which perhaps more anon) doth believe <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> thinks that the Tenure made them Barons, and that Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronies were coincident. <hi>Seld Tit. Hon.</hi> p. 699. and 700.</note> that this Tenure was enacted by some Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in <hi>William</hi>'s time preceding to this, whose Journals, or Records are now lost; yet adds for a further Proof, the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of an ancient Manuscript in his hand (belonging it seems to the Abbey of <hi>Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey)</hi> of <hi>Matth. Paris,</hi> where over the Year 1070, are inserted these Words: In this Year the <hi>Servitium Baroniae,</hi> was imposed upon <hi>Ramsey.</hi> This perhaps might equally concern other Abbies; yet seems but a weak Proof of the matter in question as to the Bishops, did not somewhat in <hi>Ingul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi> and the subsequent Practice, give some Light to the Business. But neither Laws nor Practice ought to be forced or stretched to a greater Latitude than the natural Construction of the Words will bear.</p>
                  <p>It cannot reasonably be denied, but that in the Times of our Ancestors, when Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in Lay-men was very rare; that the Clergy bare a great sway in the Councils of Princes and Great Men, who busied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:94716:70"/>
in little more then Feats of Arms, and Hospitality. But the Clergy, a wary and vigilant sort of People, guided by the subtile Heads of <hi>Rome,</hi> under whose Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they always fought; what under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Piety, Satisfaction for Sins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, Redemption of Souls out of Purgatory, and what not, captivated the Consciences, and drained the Purses of most of the ignorant Multitude. Nay, so holy was their Function, and so sacred their Persons, that no Secular Tribunal was by them thought sanctified enough to question their Actions, but they still pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be remitted to their own, or by their Appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> frustrated the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of the Civil Magistrate. <hi>William</hi> the first being desirous to put a stop to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant Pride, and growing Power of these Men, and yet not disgrace their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, did (as before is mentioned out of <hi>Mat. Paris)</hi> ordain that the Clergy should not be wholly exempted from all Secular Service, and probably might before that, have altered their Tenure, which most<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what before was in <hi>Frankalmoign,</hi> unto the Tenure <hi>in capite sicut Baroniam,</hi> or in the nature of a Barony, by which they were made subject to such Services as Tenants <hi>in cap. per Baroniam</hi> were tyed unto, and were called to Parliaments, and sate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the other Noble-Men, and the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons Peers, being first summoned thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the King's Writ. Most Men have
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:94716:70"/>
considered the <hi>Nobilitas Major,</hi> or those who constituted the House of Peers under a threefold Relation. First, as made Earls, or Barons by Creation, and an actual Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony of <note n="a" place="margin">This I take to be the only true of eno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling any body as to the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitas Major.</hi>

The Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter comprehended some Limitation how the Honour should go; or else some Pensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Barons to support their Dignity and Title, of which you may see more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples <note place="margin">Seld.

                  <p>Such I conceive was that Charter made by King <hi>Stephen</hi> to <hi>Mandevile</hi> Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> and renewed again by <hi>Maud</hi> the Empress: the like was that of <hi>Miles</hi> Earl of <hi>Hertford,</hi> granted by <hi>Maud,</hi> and renewed by <hi>Hen.</hi> II. which Charter only served to convey the <note place="margin">

Now these Charters being usual as to Earls, which was the highest Degree at that time, and an actual Ceremony being also used in the making <note n="b" place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Seld.</hi> Jans Angl. facies altera ult. e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. <hi>p.</hi> 51.</note> 
                     <hi>of Knights,</hi> which was the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est degree of Honour; I see no reason but to believe that the same Ceremony of Invetisture was used to Barons which was the middle Degree.</p>
                  <p>Some Light is given to this by conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Charter granted to the Lord <hi>Iohn Beauchamp</hi> of <hi>Holt.</hi> where the words are;
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:94716:71"/>
                     <hi>Ipsum Iohannem in unum Parium, &amp; Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Regni nostri</hi> Angliae <hi>praefecimus volentes quod idem</hi> Johannes, <hi>&amp; haeredes masculi de Corpore suo exeuntes statum Baronis obtineant, ac Domini de</hi> Beauchamp, <hi>&amp; Barones de</hi> Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermister <hi>nuncupenter. In cujus rei Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi> &amp;c. Here being in this Charter no words of Creation, but all in the Praeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Tense (we have promoted) must refer to some Act done before; and this Charter served only to limit how the Estate should go: Mr. <hi>Seld. Tit. Hon.</hi> Part 2. Cap. 5. <hi>p.</hi> 747. I <hi>edit. in fol.</hi> I know reckons this <note place="margin">Seld. Tit. Hon. <hi>pag.</hi> 747.</note> as the first Creation of a Baron by Patent, but doth not observe the words, nor his own Subsequent. Patents made to others where the words are in the Present Tense, and constituent of the Honour granted, <hi>(viz.) Praficimus, constituimus, creamus,</hi> we do cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, promote, and appoint. Neither can I imagine what Right those Ancient Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, of which we have yet some left who were so before <hi>Rich.</hi> II. have to come this day in Robes, had not their Ancestors been invested with them in their Creation, and different from those of Earls. Now this as it was the most ancient, so was it the most honourable way of conferring Honours; so was it also the most noble, by which their Blood was not only enobled, but also all other Rights and Priviledges competible to that Degree were given unto them; and certainly we must make some difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:94716:71"/>
one made a Peer of the Kingdom by Charter, and one so called in ordinary Speech, of which Name, no Man in the Kingdom, but is in some sense, capable; we being all Peers to those of our own Degree. Now of these Peers thus enobled by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetisture of Robes; some were called to Parliament by Writ after the Ceremony of Invetisture had been performed, and had never any Patent to limit the descent of the Honour. Such had their Honour in fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simple, and it went to the Heirs general, of which we have many Examples, where the Sole Daughter and Heir of such a Baron, hath not only conveyed the Honour to her Descendents, but enjoyed the Title herself during Life. Amongst many, I will only instance in one; <hi>Charles Longuevile,</hi> Son and Heir to <hi>Susanna,</hi> Heir general to the Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>de Grey</hi> of <hi>Ruthin,</hi> left only one Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter named <hi>Susanna, Charles</hi> her Father, was received in Parliament in his Robes in the latter end of King <hi>Charles</hi> the first, his Reign; he dying, left the foresaid only Daughter, who after his Death, married Sir <hi>Henry Yelverton</hi> of <hi>Easton. Manduit</hi> in <hi>Northamptonshire</hi> Baronet; Sir <hi>Henry</hi> died, leaving Sir <hi>Charles Yelverton</hi> Baronet, his Son and Heir then a <hi>Minor, Susanna</hi> enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Honour during her Life; and at her Death, left <hi>Charles,</hi> still under Age, who immediately possessed the Honour; and at his full Age, was called by Writ,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:94716:72"/>
sate in his Robes in Parliament till he died, which happened soon after his Age of twenty one, without any issue, leaving the Honour to <hi>Henry</hi> his Brother, and Heir, yet alive, and under Age. See Sir <hi>William Dugdale</hi>'s History of the Baronage, Title <hi>Lord Grey,</hi> first Part, <hi>pag.</hi> 718, 719. <note place="margin">Dugd. Baron.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second way by which some have conceived Barons were made, hath been by Writ only, without any other Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or Ceremony whatsoever; and of this Opinion have been some Heraulds, and have contended, that by the Writ of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, the Person was enobled, and if his Descendents were so called for three De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scents, the Blood was enobled, I conceive this Opinion to be erroneous: For it is against a Maxime in Law, that the King should pass any thing by Implication, and as unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to believe he might not have Liberty to require the Counsel of his Subjects with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conferring an Honour upon them, he did not intend. Besides it will hence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, That during divers Parliaments of <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. almost all in <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. and many in <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. all the Judges, King's Serjeants, and many other were enobled, for they had the same Writ the Barons had, yet were never accounted such; nay, were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten after such Summons omitted. The known Case of <hi>Mounthermer</hi> is very perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to our purpose, who having married
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:94716:72"/>
the Relict of the Earl of <hi>Gloster,</hi> who had a great part of the Earldom in Jointure, her Husband was summoned as an Earl during the Minority of her Son; but after he came of Age <hi>Mounthermer</hi> was summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as a <note n="c" place="margin">Query, Whether this Summons gave him other Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle than a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Baron.</hi>

If it be said that his Summons eno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him, but in regard his Descendents were not called, the Blood was not enobled; what will they then say to the Case of <hi>Radulphus de Camois,</hi> who was summoned, and his Son after him in 7 <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. yet in <note place="margin">7 Edw. 2. 7 Rich. 2.</note> 7 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. <hi>Claus.

Now that there was this difference, is made plain by those Authorities shall be produced under
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:94716:73"/>
the next Head, which is, that there were a sort of Persons called Barons, who were so by Tenure only, that is to say, who held of the King <hi>in Cap.</hi> and had such a number of Knights-fees, and upon that account were summoned as Barons, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Barons Peers; Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> seems to <note place="margin">Seld. Tit. Hon. <hi>pag.</hi> 690.</note> say in his <hi>Tit. Hon.</hi> Part 2. Sect. 17. <hi>pag.</hi> 690. That all Honorary Barons of that time whereof he speaks, were for ought appears, Barons only by Tenure: The words are cautelous, and his Expressions, as became a Learned Man, warily set down. First, Honorary Barons, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Such as had the Honorary Name of Barons, but not the Blood; for such I take his meaning to be, because he gives us no Definition of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norary Barons, nor why, if it be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that Barons had their beginning from the number of Knight's fees, which they held, why Earls had not the like begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, who held of the King <hi>in Cap.</hi> as well as the others. Now that there was a clear distinction between Barons enobled in Blood, and those that held only <hi>in Cap.</hi> the one we find called <hi>Barones Majores,</hi> the greater Barons; the other <hi>Barones Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> lesser Barons.

of Land made a Baron, Why were not the Purchasers of those Lands by the King's Licence of Alienation, ever after the Stat. of <hi>quia emptores Terrarum,</hi> called to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as Barons? The Case of the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. will not mend the matter, for his Ancestor was created by Writ, and the Castle entailed upon him; so that he was called to Parliament not by having the Land only, but by virtue of the Creation of his Ancestor, and the Entail upon it. In so much, that I still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the ancient Nobility (from whatsoever beginning it arose) was made inheritable by Creation, and Investiture of Robes; upon which sometimes followed Cnarters which directed how it should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend; and the Confusion in Historians hath proceeded from their not distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Barons from Barons Peers, so called, not from their Parity in Honour, but in Estate and Tenure, but wanting Investi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, were called, or left out, at the Pleasure of the King.

Many admit that it was sent into <hi>Ireland</hi> as a <hi>Modus</hi> for that Country, but was not so for <hi>England,</hi> which seems to me unreasonable, it not being likely we should give them a Patern different from our own, who now observe most of the Rules there given. <hi>Daniel,</hi> Anno 1133, in the Life of <hi>Henry</hi> the first, will tell you that in his time, the word <hi>Parliament</hi> began to be in use, after the Convocation of his Parliament at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> in the <hi>15th</hi> Year of his Reign. Nay, much ancienter, even
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:94716:75"/>
as old as <hi>Canutus,</hi> (if we believe the old Book of Sir <hi>Edmundsbury)</hi> who in the fifth Year of his Reign, summoned all his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, Nobles and Great Men to his Parliament, as you may see more <note place="margin">Rights of the Crown, <hi>p.</hi> 100. <hi>Cook</hi>'s Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to his <hi>9th</hi> Report sets it out at large.</note> fully, <hi>Rights of the Crown,</hi> p. 100. By all which of much more that might be added, we may see how dangerous it is to judg of Books by the promiscuous use of words: I have made this short Digression, to the end that what I shall say hereafter, may be made clearer.</p>
                  <p>I shall now apply my self to the Case of the Clergy, and consider their Right to sit in Parliament. This Right of theirs must grow since the Conquest, from the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure of their Land <hi>in Capite, sicut Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> and consequently, they cannot be reckoned but amongst the Barons by Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure, and are not properly Barons, but Peers, no way enobled in Blood, nor of longer continuance than the Foundation upon which the Tenure is built, continues. Thus we see in the Dissolution of Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the Tenure was extinguished. The same in Bishopricks, as that of <hi>Westminster,</hi> and others, where the Corporation being dissolved, the Tenure, as to them, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished. I know very well they would not now be thought to sit <hi>Ratione Episcop. Dignitatis,</hi> as Bishops, but as Barons. In
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:94716:75"/>
that famous Wrangle at <hi>Northampton,</hi> touching <hi>Becket,</hi> who should pronounce Sentence against him, The Bishops tell the Lords, <hi>Non sedemus hic Episcopi, sed Barones; nos Barones, &amp; vos Barones, pares hic sumus.</hi> Fitst. <note place="margin">Fitst. cap. 10, col. 2.

                     </note> We Barons, and you Barons are here Peers, or Equals. Not meaning by these words, that they were otherwise Peers than such as their Tenure made them, which was only to hold <hi>in Cap. sicut Baroniam,</hi> or in the nature of a Barony; for although that <hi>tenere per Baroniam, &amp; sicut Baroniam,</hi> perhaps are all one, neither of them imply a Barony, but only the Services of a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rony, which the Bishops, by their Tenure, were bound to perform, as also the Abbots. And I am the more confirmed in this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, because I do not find that any Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination was made what their Possessions were, nor of how many Knights Fees they consisted; but were they more or less, the Tenure was the same; whereas 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable the Possessions of some were above twenty Knights Fees, the rate of an Earl, others less than thirteen, yet still the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure and Peerage was the same.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:94716:76"/>
Neither is any Record, or Patent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, nor I think can be, where any Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rony was annexed to their Possessions. 'Tis evident that out of one Bishoprick, others have been taken, as <hi>Peterborough</hi> out of <hi>Lincoln, Oxford</hi> out of <hi>Gloster;</hi> yet these Bishops came to Parliament, and still un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same Tenure and Service. In <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth's time, <hi>Cranmer</hi> had his Episcopal Dignity during Pleasure, Was he then a Baron at will?</p>
                  <p>We may safely conclude from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of all Historians of those Times, that Tenure <hi>in Capite,</hi> and their Services, which arose by it, was put upon them <note n="e" place="margin">Vid.

                  <p>Some Bishops abusively call the Bounties of Princes, and the Alms of their Ancestors, Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and Royalties; and taking occasion from that base Slavery (he means certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Slavery in performing those Services put upon them by their Tenure) call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Barons. This he much, and largely inveighs against, from all which, it may reasonably be collected that they gave themselves that Title, rather than that it was given them by the King; who yet sate in Parliament together with the other Barons, not as a distinct Estate from them, but involved with them as part of a third Estate, which was intirely represented in Convocation. For it seems to me very clearly, that they never were a distinct Estate in Parliament; if <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Kelway,</hi> fol. 184. saith, That the Convocation is not a part of the higher House, neither the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops any part of it, but sit there as they have Temporal Baronies. But he doth not say the Convocation is not one Estate, or part of the Parliament, which however, is but the Opinion of a Serjeant at Law.</note> by Parliament you understand that part of it which consisted of Counts and Barons; yet were
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:94716:77"/>
they the chief and principal part of a third Estate in Parliament in respect of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, which began, continued, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with it; and where their Debates, Gifts to the King, and other Transactions bind only their own Body. Neither is it reasonable to believe them a third Estate here, otherwise than they are so accounted in other parts of the World, to wit, a part of that Body the Clergy, who being a Select Portion, or Lot of the Lords, and Embassadours of Christ, look'd upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as not accountable to any Secular Tribunal. Neither is it material whether they sate mixt with the Laity, as perhaps they have sometimes done, for this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not alter their being a third Estate, as Clergy-men, let their Votes be gathered together, or apart. Indeed I cannot see how it is possible they should be a third Estate in that House where they sit among the Lords; for besides their Unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness to own that they sit as Bishops, but as Barons; I would fain have any Man tell me, how it comes to be so. Dr. <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> will tell you that <hi>Clerus</hi> was never taken <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>'s Stumbling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>block.</note> for the Bishops, distinct from the other Clergy: By what Title do they then claim it? by any Grant from the King that should be produced by Usage or Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? that's denied. Nay, the Impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is manifest: For I conceive by Law, the King cannot make an Estate, for if he
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:94716:77"/>
could, he might make a fourth, a fifth, or a sixth Estate, and require consent from them all to the making any Law which would alter the Frame of the Government. Mr. <hi>Prin</hi> hath very well proved them to be only a third Estate in Convocation, from the manner of penning their Grants there, (to wit) By the name of <hi>Prelates, and Clergy of the Province of</hi> Canterbury <hi>and</hi> York—<hi>orderly assembled in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Synod, or Convocation—may be ratified, and confirmed in your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness's Courn of Parliament—with the Assent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal,</hi> not Prelates, and Clergy, as in their Grant: <hi>Prin.</hi> fourth part of his <hi>Kalender,</hi> p. 594, 595. to these I might <note place="margin">

But should I admit them a third Estate in the Lords House, as this Author, and others contend they are, and so a distinct Estate from the Lay-Lords, What colour can they then have to judg a Peer upon an Impeachment for Life, when them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:94716:78"/>
tho they sit among them, are a distinct Estate from them, and so no way their Peers, which I take to be a very strong Argument <hi>ad Hominem.</hi> I have thus past his first Assertion; and given An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to his Conceit of their being a third Estate in the Lords House; if by it he mean an intire third Estate, and not a part of it, as I said before. For when they act in Convocation, they act with the rest of the Clergy, as an intire third Estate, can they, that is, the Bishops in the Lords House, be more than part of a third Estate; where they vote not as Bishops, but as Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, as themselves would have it? Certainly, we must not shut out the Convocation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the Clergy: if then the Bishops in Convocation represent but a part of the Clergy, how they should be an intire Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative of them in another place, whilst both are in being, is to me a Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.</p>

Let us now come to his argumentative part. After he hath climbed a Ladder of five Steps, he comes at last to this Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: <hi>That to sit in Iudgment with the Lords is not against</hi> Magna Charta. What if this <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> shall be granted him? Doth it thence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that they are such <hi>Peers</hi> as are enabled to try those in Capital Cases who are eno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in Blood, and have inheritable Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in themselves by Creation? <hi>Magna Charta</hi> is a general Charter, which directs the Proceedings in the Tryal of all men by their Peers. Who are Peers to one another, is not there the Question; neither doth the Author of the discourse of Peer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age make any other use of it.</p>
                  <p>The ancient Canons forbid them to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle at all in secular Affairs: if therefore the Indulgence of Kings have admitted their Presence in Parliaments in some Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, doth it thence follow, that they have Right to be there in all Cases, or to try Peers for their Lives, to whom they are no way equal? The Author proceeds, and, <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 3.</note> in the next place, insists upon the Forms of their Writs, which are of the same kind with those of the other Barons, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not limited nor restrained, neither ought their Power so to be.</p>
                  <p>The Weakness of this Argument is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apparent; for, by this he may infer, that the Judges and some others had the same Right: for, Mr. <hi>Elsing</hi> in his <hi>Modus, pag.</hi> 11. hath observed, that the Writs <note place="margin">Els. p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:94716:79"/>
were alike to the Lords, to the Judges, and some others, in diverse years of <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. in most of <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. and many of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. But the Words of these Writs, though general, were to be interpreted by the Practise of the Court, and not contrarily. Again, there is a great deal of difference between giving Counsel in difficult matters, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Writ, and trying Men for their Lives; an Employment no way proper for Messengers of Peace, and Preachers of glad Tidings. Lastly, the Earls and Barons are <hi>Consiliarii nati,</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors by their Birth, and so have a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Right to give Counsel in all Affairs being once assembled in Parliament; and for that Reason, upon the Death of the King, the <hi>Nobilitas Major</hi> have all equal Right to meet in Council, in order to a Successor, so have not the Bishops; nay, though Privy Counsellors, their Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion ceasing, they have then no Right to come into Council with the other Lords.</p>
                  <p>In the next place he saith, Men as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly dye by Bills of Attainder, where <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 4.</note> the Bishops have an undoubted Right to vote in their Legislative Capacity, and therefore to vote in Cases of Blood is not incompatible with their Function.</p>
                  <p>To this I answer, the Cases are very different, as well to the matter of the Law as the Reason of it. For first, Custom or whoever gave them Right to sit in the Lords House, in the Nature, or amongst
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:94716:79"/>
the temporal Barons, though Ecclesiastical Persons, did not restrain them as to their Concurrence in the making new Laws, yet very well might as to their judging in some Laws already made: so that the one is agreeable to the Laws of the Kingdom, and the Laws of Parliament, and the other not so: And if any thing in that Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar had been contrary to the Holiness of their Calling or their Rules of Living, it had been fit for them to have informed the King and Lords, and not for them to take notice of it otherwise. Nay, in that very Case, when that Bill shall come to be pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into a Law, by the King, the Lords Spiritual ought to absent themselves, as it was held by Mr. <hi>Bagshaw,</hi> a Reader of the <hi>Middle-Temple,</hi> in the time of Arch-bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> by whose Power, he was then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited from farther Proceedings in his said Lectures. <hi>Rush. Hist. Collect.</hi> part 2. pag. 990. <note place="margin">Hist. Coll. part. 2. pag. 990.</note> Secondly, the passing a new Law, be it what it will, doth not immediately, but by Consequence may concern Blood. Now the Bishops, who are always supposed to incline to Mercy rather than Severity, may perpetually, with a good Conscience, hinder the passing such a Bill as shall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish a Delinquent with Death who had not capitally offended before. But, when once a Man is capitally impeached for transgressing a known Law, and Issue joyned thereupon, 'tis not now in their Power, with a good Conscience, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:94716:80"/>
the Guilty, because they must there opine according to the Proofs before them, which is a very strong Argument why they might be permitted to be present in the one Case, and not in the other. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if this way of arguing were good, it would follow, that the Commons ought to have equal Power with the Lords in all other Cases, because they have with them an equal Power in passing Bills.</p>
                  <p>The néxt Section consists in blaming <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 6.</note> the Insinuation of his Adversary, who saith, their medling with secular Affairs was against the Apostles Practise, though in a matter concerning the Church; men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Rescript of <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius,</hi> and so passeth that point. In which, it appears he insinuates no more than <hi>William</hi> the First ordained, who <note place="margin">Vid. Dan. p. 35. 46. Baker p. 26. &amp; 30.</note> appointed that they should meddle with nothing but what concerned the rule of Souls, and govern themselves according to the Rules of the Church, so that you see the Canons of the Church were consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in their Admission to sit.</p>
                  <p>What he saith in Opposition to this, is, that it is a part of God's Service to do Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and Mercy, and to attend the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affairs of the Kingdom, when they <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 6.</note> shall be thereunto called: that the Bishops now are not under the same Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Apostles were when the Christian Church was to be planted, and now when

And although the Apostles, who were Messengers, did go about their Errands to several Places whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were sent, it doth not appear that St. <hi>James,</hi> who was a Bishop, and not an Apostle, except we shall call him the Thirteenth, ever parted from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> but attended the business of the Church there. But, since this Author hath thought fit to put us upon this Question, let us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine it a little higher.</p>
                  <p>'Twill be undoubtedly agreed on all hands, that our Saviour did not delegate to others a greater Power than God had given him the Exercise of to himself. But it is clear in the Case of the Young Man, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 14. who would have had him command his Brother to divide the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance with him; <hi>Man, who made me a</hi>

                     <hi>Judge, and a Divider?</hi> That is, none hath made me so, because his Kingdom was not of this World; that is, consisted not in secular things. The next place I shall remember, is 2 <hi>Ep. Tim.</hi> chap. 2. vers. 4. <hi>No man that warreth intangleth himself with the Affairs of this Life, that he may please him that hath chosen him to be a Souldier. Hugo Grotius</hi> upon this place will tell you, that this is a Similitude taken from the <hi>Roman</hi> Law, which would not suffer any Souldier to be employed in any Affairs, but Military, quotes the Law and the Practise; tells you out of <hi>Florus,</hi> that <hi>Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humius,</hi> a man of consular Dignity, was punished for appointing his Souldiers to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist him in his Field. 'Tis true, the Words are general, but being applyed to <hi>Timothy,</hi> who was then employed in a Spiritual course of Life, they cannot think to please him who set them on Work, if they be engaged in secular Matters, which have not some immediate Reference to the Church: And, I believe no temporal Prince would take it well that his Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador should engage himself in the Affairs of any other Prince, without his particular Commission. This Sense is generally em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, though in our Question we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude not all secular Matters, but Blood only.</p>

                  <p>I suppose here are some Testimonies more than a thousand years ancienter than any Council of <hi>Toledo,</hi> against their med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in Blood: for, <hi>Qui includit omne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludit nihil.</hi> If all secular Employments be forbidden, then the medling in Blood is not excluded. It cannot seem to me rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, that we should use those Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as Bishop <hi>Davenant</hi> and others do against the Usurpation of the Pope, in things of this Nature, which may with as much force be retorted upon our selves. I am not ignorant what is usually replyed by men of a contrary Judgment, and hath been learnedly and candidly put together by the Author of the <hi>Honour of the Lords Spiritual asserted,</hi> who hath written with more Clearness and equal Reason, I think, to those of that side who have come after him.</p>
                  <p>Far be it from me to envy the Honour of the Clergy in their several Degrees and Orders, or to think the Ambassadors of God should live basely or sordidly and not be used with all due Respect among men. Neither is it any way reasonable, that they who in an afflicted Church li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon the general Contribution of the Saints, should be put to such Streights in a
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:94716:82"/>
flourishing one: but all this is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood with that necessary Limitation, that no Employment should take them off from their main Business, the Care of the Churches committed to their Charge.</p>
                  <p>If they can satisfie themselves that their Spiritual Work is not enough to take up their whole time, let them in God's name be engaged in secular Offices: but I think if the greatest part of their Power were not transferred to their Chancellors and Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>officers, there would be time little enough left them for secular things. I remember to have read in a Book called <hi>Il Nipotismo,</hi>

                  <p>Certainly this Kingdom hath given them a great share in the Government, which hath not only allowed them the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:94716:82"/>
first Rank in the Estates of the Nation, but hath by Law made them appear to be so in the Convocation, where they have both an upper and lower House; where they give Subsidies, make Laws for the Church, and where a part of them sit among the Lords, not only to press the Allowance of those Laws by the Civil Power, but also to have their share in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king new ones.</p>
                  <p>This, one would think were enough to content them without desiring to have a Judicial Power in Cases of Blood, which I doubt not to prove is by Law forbidden them.</p>
                  <p>But, I fear the charging this Desire up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops Rights. <hi>pag.</hi> 61.</note> them is rather an Artifice of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who by assixing this Calumny up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, which indeed is not their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, labour to lessen them in the Estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, and by that means bring into Contempt both their Persons and Callings.</p>
                  <p>Many Examples I confess are given, where Christian Emperours and Princes have made use of the Service of Bishops as Counsellors, Chancellors, and Chief Justices, and the like; but upon Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it will appear, that as to our own Kingdom, the Offices of these Persons were much mistaken. The Office of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitalis Justiciarius Angliae,</hi> was not to sit and judge Causes among Associates, as at this day, but was the Chief Officer of the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:94716:83"/>
Nation, had the Appellation of <hi>Prorex;</hi> and had Power, in the Absence of the King, to displace any Officer of the Cinque-Ports, and to do any thing as Vice-Roy and Protector of the Kingdom; of which, see at large Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi>'s Glossary, in the Word <hi>Capitalis Justiciarius.</hi> Upon <note place="margin">Spel.

How far the Edicts of Princes were binding, is not my Task to enquire, but only how far that of their not medling in Blood was a part of the Law and Custom of this Kingdom, and observed here. But, what I have said in this Chapter, especially as to the Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Bishops, I have delivered by way of Proposal, not Determination, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a clear Answer of my Reasons, shall be ready to retract any thing I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>

                     <p>I Come now to the Examination of his second Chapter, in which, the Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions made at the Parliament held at <hi>Clarendon,</hi> come under Examination, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Protestation made 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. I call it a Parliament, because I find it ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally so esteemed by our best Lawyers, and I think denyed to be so by very few. Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> calls it that great Parliament <note place="margin">Seld. tit. hon. <hi>part</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 703.</note> at <hi>Clarendon, Tit.

                     <p>But before I enter into a more narrow Examination of this Statute, I think it not amiss to give a short Account of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of those times, from <hi>William</hi> the First, to the tenth year of <hi>Hen.</hi> the Second, when this Meeting was, with Relation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">What Dr. <hi>Bradies</hi> Fancy is in that Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, let him make good, if he can.</note> to the King and the Church. It will not be denyed, that <hi>William</hi> the First dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed all Title to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> by Conquest, and swore to observe the Laws of <hi>Edw. the Confessor,</hi> which were our Laws before: yet notwithstanding, it
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:94716:84"/>
is generally agreed, that he erected Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures in <hi>Capite,</hi> and Baronies, and that amongst others he obliged the Bishops who before held their Lands in <hi>Frankalmoign,</hi> to do Service to his Courts, and to hold their Lands in <hi>Cap. sicut Baroniam,</hi> and not to make their so frequent Appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> and Journeys thither, without his License, being a thing contrary to the known Laws of his Kingdom; which is made evident by Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> in <hi>Caw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dryes</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Coo.

These were the <hi>Servitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes ecclesiasticae,</hi> and the <hi>Pessimae consuetudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> so much complained of by <hi>Mat. Paris</hi> and other Monks of that Age. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, so it stood during the Times of <hi>Will.</hi> the First, <hi>Will.</hi> the Second, and <hi>Hen.</hi> the First; after whose Death, <hi>Stephen,</hi> without any Right, (and contrary to their Oaths made to <hi>Maud,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Henry</hi> the First then alive) by the Aid of the Bishops gets into the Throne, and by their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, was kept there till a Composition was made with <hi>Maud.</hi> In Recompence of this their breach of Oath, <hi>Stephen</hi> frees them and the rest of the Clergy, from answering in any other Courts but Ecclesiastical: by which, <note place="margin">In a Parliament held at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Anno</hi> 1136. he grants by his Charter, under his Hand, That all Persons and Causes Ecclesiastical, should appertain only to Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Judges.</note> they now look'd upon themselves as free from the secular Power, because they were answerable for no Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:94716:84"/>
but in their Courts. In this State of things <hi>Stephen</hi> dies, and <hi>Hen.</hi> the Second, Son to <hi>Maud,</hi> according to Capitulation, is received to the Crown; who, after he had setled his Affairs in <hi>Normandy,</hi> resolves to do the like in <hi>England:</hi> but, fearing some Opposition to his Designs might arise from the Clergy, he first calls toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Assembly or Council at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> in the ninth year of his Reign; where he propounds, That all such of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy as should be taken, and convicted for any heinous Crime, should lose the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Church, and be delivered to the civil Magistrate, to be punished for their Offences, as other the Kings Subjects were. To this, the Arch-bishop <hi>Becket,</hi> with the rest of his Brethren, refused to give their Consent, as being against the Liberties of the Church, which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to them by King <hi>Stephens</hi> Charter. This Answer put the King to a second Question; Whether the Arch-bishops and Bishops would submit themselves to the Laws and Customs observed by them in the time of his Grand-father, <hi>Henry</hi> the First? They answered equivocally, They would; their Order, the Honour of God, and the Holy Church in all things saved: with which Answer, the King was more enraged. But, the News of this Breach coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> the Pope writes, and sends a Messenger from <hi>Rome,</hi> charges the Arch-bishop to make Peace with his Lord
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:94716:85"/>
the King, and to promise to observe his Laws without Exception. The Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop thus humbled, repairs to the King at <hi>Woodstock,</hi> and there promises to observe the King's Laws so far forth as was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Upon this Submission, the King, having before broken up his Council at <hi>Westminster,</hi> summons this Parliament to meet at <hi>Clarendon,</hi> in the tenth Year of his Reign, where he gives in Charge, that they should call to Mind, and put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and Writing the Laws of his Grand-father, <hi>Henry</hi> the First. Of which, these following were the chief. First, that there should be no Appeals to <hi>Rome</hi> without the Kings leave. That Lay-men might han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle cases of Tithes. That no Arch-bishop or Bishop should excommunicate any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son who held of the King in <hi>Cap.</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict any official of his without his leave, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The eleventh of them was at large what we have now under Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which I shall repeat and translate as it ought to be, by and by. But, by this short Relation I have made of the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of those Times, it may appear plainly, that their yielding Obedience to the known Laws of the Kingdom in matters of Appeal, appearing and answering in the King's Courts, (though it were the ancient Usage and Custom of the Realm) was the thing that most vexed them, and not how far their Presence was required in cases of Blood, brought into
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:94716:85"/>
Parliament, in which they were content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be limited by the Usage of that Court, and to afford or forbear their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, according to that Obligation which was incumbent upon them from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Church, invigorated by the constant Usage of the Nation. If therefore, I can make it good, that the Bishops had no Right to be present in the Debate, and handling matters of Blood, and that that was the known Law, and the Sense of this Act now before us, and of the subsequent Protestation in 11. of <hi>R.</hi> 2. I shall think my self competently safe, though some seeming Precedents and Records should be brought against me: for, it is the Law must be the Measure and Standard of our Actions, and not always Records; the Reasons whereof, are sometimes obscure, and the matter it self many times shortly rehearsed, and not always legal. I must confess, this Author hath much laboured to fix a Sense upon this Article subservient to his Purpose; but the more he struggles the more he is intangled. 'Tis worth Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, that four or five, I suppose, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Persons, have written in the Defence of the Bishops Right to vote in Capital Causes in Parliament; and having all of them a necessity to say something to this Law of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> do all of them give different Interpretations of the meaning of it: a great Argument of a weak Cause. The first, whose Title is, <hi>The Honour of</hi>
                        <pb n="144" facs="tcp:94716:86"/>
                        <hi>the Lords Spiritual,</hi> &amp;c. I presume being satisfied with the general Sense which was put upon these Constitutions from all times, from which it is always unsafe to vary, and perceiving that those illegal Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges granted to them by King <hi>Stephen,</hi> were, by the reviving the Laws of <hi>Henry</hi> the First, abolished, doth ingeniously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess in three places, <hi>pag.</hi> 26. at the end of the sixth Chapter, and in the same page at the beginning of the seventh <hi>Chap.</hi> 
                        <q>That at <hi>Clarendon</hi> their Wings were indeed much clip'd, yet the Priviledge of sitting <note place="margin">Hon. of the Lords. <hi>p.</hi> 26.</note> and voting in Parliament, is left intire to them; and tho' they never of late voted in Capital Cases, yet they have ever made their <hi>Proxies,</hi> as he hopes to make appear.</q> In Chapter the seventh he hath these words, <q>We confess as before, for that they were Spiritual Persons, they were not to sit in Capital Causes and loss of Limb; but adds, that long before they had exercised this Power.</q> By which Words, it appears, that in the Judgment of that Author, whatever their Power and Practice was before, yet that now by the Laws of <hi>Henry</hi> the First recognized, at this Parliament at <hi>Clarendon,</hi> that Power was taken away, and not since practised. That they had such Power before, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to prove out of <hi>Compton</hi> and <hi>Spel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> neither of which Authors, make good any more, than that the Bishop was Assessor with the Earl in the County-court;
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:94716:86"/>
which was only to advise him in point of Conscience; not much unlike the Offices of our Surrogates, who sit in consistory with the Bishops Chancellor, in whom we know resides all the Power. That this is so, appears by the Laws of <hi>Edgar,</hi> put out by Mr. <hi>Lambert,</hi> who in his fifth <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> hath these Words. <hi>Centuri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

third Author, intituled, <hi>The Rights of the Bishops,</hi> fairly passeth over this Law, only <note place="margin">Bishops Rights. <hi>p.</hi> 139. 141.</note> tells you, that a Bishop pronounced Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence against <hi>Becket</hi> in case of Treason, as <hi>Fitztephen,</hi> a grave Author, saith; and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tells you, That though the Prince may indulge many Priviledges to his Clergy, as this of not compelling them to vote in Parliament in cases of Blood, where by the Canon Law they are prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, yet that Law, must yield to the Law of the Land, (but how if the Canon Law be part of the Law of the Land, what's then to be done?) which cannot devest the King of his Right of using his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, Clerks, or not, in any Places or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments he shall think fit to employ them in; or in which he may think them capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of doing Him or the Publick any Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. This I confess is plain dealing, and I wish it were not too much the Sense of some of our greatest Clerks, that let the Law be what it will, it cannot bind the King's Hands from making use of any of his Subjects in what he pleases, though the Employment be forbidden by Law. This is the Meaning our third Author gives of this Constitution; and much good may it do him.</p>
                     <p>Our last Author, in his <hi>Grand Question,</hi> comes next to be examined, in which I shall be more large, because in him is concentred what the rest have said, and his Cause defended with much Learning, and variety of Reading.</p>

He names the Constitutions of <hi>Claren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and the Protestation in 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. as <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 19.</note> the two main Laws against him. The Constitutions of <hi>Clarendon</hi> (which were no more than a Recognition of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Laws and Customs of <hi>England,</hi> not made, but revived by <hi>Hen.</hi> the First, and now confirmed by his Grand-son <hi>Hen.</hi> the Second) he considers as the most materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and is content this Cause should stand or fall by them. He tells you, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution in Debate is the eleventh in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; of which, the Words are,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Archiepiscopi Episcopi, &amp; universae Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae regni qui de Rege tenent in Capite, habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Possessiones suas de Rege, sicut Baroniam, &amp; inde respondeant Justiciariis &amp; Ministris Regis, &amp; faciant omnes consuetudines Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as: Et ficut ceteri Barones debeant inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esse Iudiciis curie Regis quousque perveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atur ad diminutionem Membrorum vel ad Mortem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After the Words, he gives us the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of them, made by the Author of the Letter, in the following manner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The Arch-bishops and Bishops, and all the dignified Clergy of the Land, that hold of the King in <hi>Capite,</hi> shall hold their Possessions of the King, as a Barony, and answer for their Estates un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King's Justices and Ministers, and shall observe and obey all the King's Laws: and, together with the other Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, they are to be present at all Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:94716:88"/>
in the King's Courts, till it comes to require either loss of Life or Member.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, pray Sir, why did you not rather give us a Translation of these Words of your own? If the Author of the Letter have made an imperfect Translation, why did not you mend it? I believe, if this Author had found it would have advantaged his Cause, some Exceptions would have been taken to the Translation. I shall by and by give the Reader a full account of the true Sense of the whole Period; but will first make appear the Unreasonableness of the Exposition he makes of the last Clause of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Et sicut caeteri Barones debent interesse ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciis Curiae Regis quousque perveniatur ad diminutionem Membrorum, vel ad Mortem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Meaning he conceives to be, That the Bishops are required to be present in the King's Courts as other Barons are, till <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 20.</note> they come to give Sentence, as to dismem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring or loss of Life.</p>
                     <p>Why he translates <hi>Curiae Regis</hi> in the plural Number, the Kings Courts, which is in the singular the King's Court, and in this place, hath always been understood of the High Court of Parliament, in which, the other Barons had an Interest to be present as Judges, and in which Sense, it is very often taken, as is made clear by Mr. <hi>Petit,</hi> in his learned Discourse <note place="margin">Petit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pr. p. 45.

                        <hi>fuit in Cur. nostra &amp; toto Parliamento nostro,</hi> &amp;c. Wherein, <hi>Cur. Regis, &amp; totum Parl.</hi> are but expressive of the same thing, and not two Courts, as I think: I very well know, that <hi>Curia Regis</hi> had various accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; sometime it signified that Court of Justice that at those times followed the King's Person; sometime it was taken for <hi>Aula Regis,</hi> where Entertainments and Feasts were made, as we read often in our Historians; but, I take it here to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the High Court of Parliament, for the Reasons before touched, and many others, if any shall seem to doubt of it.</p>
                     <p>Next, why doth he leave out <hi>Judiciis,</hi> whereas the Words are, The Bishops, as the other Barons, ought to be present <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciis curiae Regis,</hi> in Trials in the King's Court, <hi>(viz.</hi> the Parliament) he renders they are to be present in the King's
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:94716:89"/>
Courts. To help himself under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert of an ill Translation, savours not of that candour justly to be expected from so learned a Person, and one that seeketh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Truth, rather than Victory? but, since this Author is a subtile and no loose Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, give me leave to guess at the Reason of it. He saw plainly, that had he fairly rendred the Words [The Bishops as other Barons, have Right to be present in all Causes, Sentences, or Judgments in the King's Court, or Parliament, till the Cause, Sentence, or Judgment come to concern Life or Member; the Word <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciis,</hi> in the plural Number, must have referred to other Judgments in other cases, and then the latter clause [till Judgment, or Sentence came to concern Life or Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber] would have been clearly restrictive as to cases of Blood; for, to be present at the Judgments of the Court till Judgment, is Non-sense, except the Words be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to different cases. Now, this Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation would have quite destroyed his main Undertaking, who at last gives a Sense of the Words, not only coincident with that given by the Author of <hi>the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops Rights,</hi> to which I have before spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but contrary to the Votes of the Lords in Parliament; who, though they seem to admit their Presence in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such a case, yet will not admit them to have any part or voice in the judging of it. Beside, I must needs take notice,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:94716:90"/>
that 'tis a strange Translation of the words, <hi>Quousque perveniatur,</hi> or, <hi>in judicio perve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niatur ad diminutionem Membrorum vel ad mortem.</hi> Till they come to give Sentence; when the Words more naturally import, till Judgment may be fulfilled in the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off of Member, or Life; which is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. But, I shall anon give him a more proper Translation of the Words: in the mean time, will consider all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuges and cunning Evasions, by which he would give colour to his Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                     <p>First, from the occasion the Author of <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 20.</note> the Letter, <hi>pag.</hi> 73. had said. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates affected a kind of Omnipotency. (he conceives the Author means in Judicature) and I conceive he made that Supposition, because he judged it for his Advantage to suppose so: not that the thing was true, or that the Author of the Letter gave him any cause to take up that Fancy. Their Affectation of Omnipotency was not to be freed from that part of the Law of the Land which was agreeable with the Laws of the Church, which they were content to submit to; but their Desire was, to be freed from those they thought were against them, to wit, to do Service to the King, for their Lands, to answer to his Justices and Ministers, to be subject to the secular Power for any crimes they should commit. These were the things they stormed at, and were the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:94716:90"/>
Bondage and the wicked Constitutions <hi>Matt. Paris,</hi> and other Historians of his Time so much exclaimed against, because they would have had all their Affairs trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in their own Courts; so that our Author need not have spent ten Pages, to prove what no body affirms. Much of the Contests between the King and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy arose from the Charter granted by K. <hi>Stephen, Anno</hi> 1136. That all Persons and Causes ecclesiastical should appertain only to ecclesiastical Judges; which Charter, whatever stir they made about it, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Author's Logick, was void: (for <hi>Maud</hi> the Empress, Daughter to <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the First, third Son to <hi>William</hi> the First, and so right Heir to the Crown, was then alive, to whom the Bishops and People had sworn Obedience; and therefore King <hi>Stephen</hi> was as much an Usurper as <hi>Hen.</hi> the Fourth.) This Charter was the <hi>Latis offendiculi,</hi> the stumbling Stone they could not escape, and the meer restoring now at <hi>Clarendon</hi> the ancient Laws and Customs confirmed to the People by <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. was what gave them the greatest Disturbance; not that they affected any Omnipotency of Judicature, at least in cases of Blood: insomuch, that our Author had no reason to pin a Sense upon the Words of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Letter, to which, he had no Inducement from any Words of that Author.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="154" facs="tcp:94716:91"/>
Having done with the Occasion, we <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 30.</note> come now to his second Enforcement of his Opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> the plain meaning of the Words. First, he quarrels with the copy, the Author of the Letter follows, taken out of <hi>Matt. Paris</hi> and <hi>Wendover,</hi> who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, in Mr. <hi>Selden's</hi> Opinion, have best preserved the meaning of this Constitution. <hi>Seld. tit. hon. part</hi> 2. <hi>pa.</hi> 703. <note place="margin">Seld. tit. hon. <hi>p.</hi> 703.</note> 704.</p>
                     <p>Though I do not grant his Vatican co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, following, as he saith, <hi>Gerv. Doroberni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ensis</hi> is better, yet for once I am content to follow his copy, and admit the Words <hi>in Judicio</hi> to be inserted, which are left out by <hi>Matt. Paris,</hi> yet I think necessarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed; but shall never yield to his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable construction of them, which in conclusion amounts to this.</p>
                     <p>That the Bishops were bound to be in the Kings Courts in all Judgments, till it came to Sentence of loss of Life and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and then they might go out, in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Canons of the Church, if <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 32.</note> they pleased, to which they pretended themselves bound in Conscience to give Obedience; and that for this Reason, the Pope marked this Constitution with a <hi>hoc tolerandum,</hi> the others with <hi>hoc improban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</hi> I confess, I think the Interpretation of these Words contrary to their natural Sense, and contrary to the Opinion and Practise of former times, who have always understood them to import, that the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:94716:91"/>
ought to be present in all Tryals in Parliament, except in Tryals of Blood.</p>
                     <p>But, before I proceed to make good the true Sense and Translation of these words, it will be necessary to explain the Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of some of them. First, <hi>Quousque usque quo, dummodo, praeterquam,</hi> are often times indifferently taken, as signifying the same thing, and are limiting, restraining Particles, and used as Exceptions to some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which went before, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> till what time, till when, so far forth, except when, or the like.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Iudicium</hi> signifies properly a Tryal at Law, a Case, a Suit, or Process, and is not taken for a definitive Sentence, except when it is delivered as the Opinion of the Court, resulting upon a precedent Tryal had before others; in which, he that pronounces Sentence hath not, or very rarely, more than a directive Power, and do's not give his own single Opinion but the Sense of others, in matters debated. <hi>Actiones quarum causa in jus quisque vocatur quandoque dicuntur judicia.</hi> Ut in L. in bon. fid. 13. de Usuris L. 4.

                        <hi>finem.</hi> to the same purpose. By these Authorities and many more, 'tis plain, that <hi>Judicium,</hi> Judgment, comprehends the whole Proceedings in any Cause, and not the Sentence only.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pervenio</hi> signifies to arrive at, or the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment, or Bounds of any thing; as <hi>pervenire ad metam</hi> is to arrive at, or come to the Goal. <hi>Ovid</hi> speaking of the Return made by the Eccho, hath these Words, <hi>Verba refert aures non pervenientia nostras,</hi> Words that arrived not at our Ears, they came not to the Terms or Bounds designed. So <hi>pervenior,</hi> in the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Voice, must signifie to be arrived at, or accomplished in.</p>
                     <p>That <hi>Judicium</hi> in our Case must be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the Sense I have given, I shall evince from the general Opinion of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers. I shall begin with <hi>Magna Charta:</hi> The Words there are <hi>judicium Parium,</hi> and understood of a Tryal by his Equals. The Question which is asked the Prisoners after their Plea, is, not who shall give Sentence upon thee? but how wilt thou be tryed? and they that give Sentence are not those that try them in criminal Cases: nay, their appealing to a Tryal by them, is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a standing Mute. The next Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty shall be from the Council at <hi>Westminster,</hi> in the 22. year of <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. no more than twelve years after the Assize of <hi>Clarendon,</hi>

                        <hi>per se Membrorum truncatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes faciant, aut inferendas judicent.</hi> That such as were in holy Orders should not agitate or meddle in Tryals of Blood as a thing unlawful: for which Reason, they are prohibited from cutting off any Member themselves, or from giving their Opinions or Judgments that such Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments ought to be inflicted. This Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod we see was not only a Meeting of the Clergy, but with them of the <hi>Primores Regni,</hi> and the Determinations promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their Assent and the Assent of the King: for the Lay-men did usually meet with the Clergy in their Councils, in those days. To which purpose, see a Tractate of a late learned Writer, in his <hi>Iani Angl. fac. nov. pag.</hi> 213. which came not to my hand till very lately. Now, whether this Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Clergy, in matters of Blood, had reference to the ordinary Courts of Justice, in which they might not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, or to all in general, is not material, since it is only produced to shew the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:94716:93"/>
of the Word; and certainly, if it be inclusive as to those Courts, it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive to any other. And Agitation in Tryals being naturally before Sentence, Agitation in Tryals must extend to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminaries.</p>
                     <p>Let us now come to the Constitutions of Arch-bishop <hi>Langton</hi> in <hi>Linwood.</hi> 'Tis first <note place="margin">Linw. lib. 3. tit. 29. Ne qui Cler.</note> found, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>tit.</hi> 29.</p>

                        </q> The Sum of all which is, that no Clergy-man should exercise Jurisdiction in any cause to which Sentence of Blood was annexed. That no causes concerning Blood should be held in Churches or Church-yards: Lastly, that they should not be interessed where causes of Blood were handled, nor should presume to write, or dictate such Sentences to be inflicted. <q>To the same purpose are the Constit. of <hi>Othobon.</hi> Ne cler. advocat. tit. 7. p. 91.

                        <q>Let the Arch-bishops and Bishops, and all Persons whatsoever of the Kingdom, who hold of the King in <hi>Capite,</hi> have their Possessions from the King in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Barony; and by reason thereof, let them answer the King's Justices and Ministers, and perform all Royal Customs. And in like manner, as the rest of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons 'tis their Duty to be present at all Debates, Process, or Proceedings in the King's Court <hi>(viz.</hi> the Parliament) till what time, so far forth, or except when in the Tryal, Debate, or Process, the loss of Life or Member may fall out to be the Upshot or Conclusion of the Case, or the matter put in Issue.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>In plain English, in all cases where the Issue or Conclusion may fall out to be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in loss of Life, or Member, they are by this Law to be absent. Now I hope upon Issue joyn'd, if the Impeachment be of a capital Crime, the conclusion or upshot may happen to be found to concern Life or Member. And that this is the true Sense and Construction of the Words, I dare appeal to any Man, who is so far Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Language, as not to think fit to consound Moods, Tenses, and Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, at Pleasure, as this Author seems to do, when he reads <hi>Curiae Regis</hi> the King's Courts, which being in the singular Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, resers only to the King's great Court, the Parliament, <hi>the King's Courts in the</hi>
                        <pb n="161" facs="tcp:94716:94"/>
                        <hi>plural. Perveniatur</hi> in the Potential Mood, when such a thing may be brought to pass, with <hi>pervenitur</hi> in the Indicative Mood, when such a thing is brought to pass, that is, as he erroneously translates, till Sentence comes to be given. And the Authorities before-cited evidently shew, that the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of those Ages understood the Law in that sense. To which Authorities, I shall now add the Opinions of Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Cook,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hakewell,</hi> and <hi>Fitz-Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens,</hi> a Writer of good esteem with our Author. Mr. <hi>Selden, Tit. Hon.</hi> part. 2. ch. 5. <note place="margin">

Now, I hope, every man will admit 'tis a case of Blood before Sentence, and that the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons sit in Judgment when the Matter comes to be treated of before them. Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Coke, cap. de Asportatis Relig.</hi> cites the Parliament of 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. where, by their own <note place="margin">Cook 2 Inst. pag. 587.</note> acknowledgment, they went out before any Debate; their presence being prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by the Canon-Law. Mr. <hi>Hakewel,</hi> in his <hi>Mod. ten. pag.</hi> 84. hath these words; <note place="margin">Hakewell mod pa. 84.</note> 
                        <q>Therefore we see the Presence of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in Parliament, in respect of their Baronies, is, <hi>Duousque perveniatur ad diminutionem,</hi> &amp;c. for so, even unto our times, when Question is had of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder of any Peer, or other, in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:94716:95"/>
the Arch-Bishops and Bishops de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the House, and make their Proctors.</q> Here you see they are to depart when Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is had, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As to their making Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors I shall speak more fully hereafter, as also shall shew, that the Canon Law both by these Constitutions and before them, was part of the <hi>Consuetudines Regni:</hi> yet this, by the way, appears plainly, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of the Cominons in 21 <hi>R.</hi> 2. that they might make Proctors, must have reference to the beginning, not the end of the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, when the naming them was useless. But let me not do him wrong; for, <hi>pag.</hi> 33. he touches the Sense I have given, but dislikes it; <hi>viz.</hi> That the last Clause is not to be understood of the Sentence, but of the kind and quality of the Cause: that is, they are to be present in the King's Courts, till they come to a Cause where Life and Member are concerned. This Sense certainly is near the Truth, but that he confounds the Potential with the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative Mood. The Words are, where Life or Member may be concerned, which he reads, are concerned, and so seems to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to the Sentence which ought to be referred to the whole Proceedings. In the last place, let us hear the Sense his grave Author <hi>Fitz-Stephens</hi> puts upon this last Clause. After the Appeal of the Arch-bishop <hi>Becket</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> the King expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the matter with him; asketh him why he would break his Oath, so lately

                     <p>Our Author proceeds, and tells you, there is a great deal of difference between <hi>Duousque perveniatur ad judicium muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lationis Membrorum vel Mortis,</hi> and <hi>quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usque perveniatur in judicio,</hi> &amp;c. I confess, I understand not this Criticism, which however is not warranted by the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of any Copy; neither can it be made capable of any good Sense, except one not different to what I have given; for if it were <hi>quousque perveniatur ad judicium,</hi> &amp;c. I ask to what doth <hi>perveniatur</hi> refer? I think most properly to <hi>Curia Regis.</hi> That is to say, 'tis their Duty to be present at all Proceedings in Parliament, until such a Case may fall out where Life or Member may be concerned. For, we must not be permitted to fancy a Sense of Words, and then, contrary to all Rule, wrest them to our own Biass, and against the Opinion of such as writ before us: neither are we
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:94716:96"/>
to expect from these old <hi>Monkish</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, such polite Latin as <hi>Tully</hi> writ, but take their meaning as others who liv'd nearer the time have done before us. So that I have done with this Clause, when I have first told the Reader, that I have trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated <hi>debent interesse.</hi> 'Tis their Duty to be present, because they would often take Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to go away, or protest, or be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesom upon several Pretences: sometime the Canons allowed them not when the Law did; sometime the Liberty of the Church was concerned, as appears by the Statute <hi>de asportatis religiosorum,</hi> where they absented themselves. <hi>Co.</hi> 2. <hi>Inst. pag.</hi> 585. All these Subterfuges were obviated by this <note place="margin">Co. Ma. Ch. <hi>p.</hi> 585.</note> Statute, (although perhaps not by them well observed) which required their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance in Parliament in all Causes where they were not prohibited by the received Laws of the Nation. Now our Author acknowledgeth, that the Council of <hi>Toledo</hi> was brought into <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frank,</hi> in <hi>William</hi> the First his time; which Council, is put out in the second Tome of the <hi>English</hi> Councils, by Sir <hi>Will. Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> and Mr. <hi>Spelman,</hi> as the Work of Sir <hi>Henry</hi> his Father. That Council forbids their Presence in <hi>Cases of Blood,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as he admits, received here as low as the Conquest, made it a Custom in <hi>Henry</hi> the First his Time, and an ancient Custom in <hi>Hen.</hi> the Second, and now being allowed
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:94716:96"/>
at the Parliament at <hi>Clarendon,</hi> to which they all swore, makes that Custom or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non as much a part of the Law of <hi>England,</hi> as any affirmative Statute can, and so not to be repealed, except by as equal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as that by which it first became a Law, and was now affirmed as such.</p>
                     <p>By what hath been hitherto said, I think it will appear competently plain to any unbiassed Reader, that the word <hi>[in judicio]</hi> doth not refer, as he supposes, to that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Tryal then in Court, as if it had respect to one Period in the Tryal, and <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 33.</note> left them at liberty to be present at all other parts of it; but was restrictive to all Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als whatsoever which might have their Conclusion in Blood: and his Allusion in the same Page is as little solid. As sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, saith he, <q>
                           <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the Protestant Princes to attend him to Mass, as other Princes did, only when the Mass-Bell tinckled they might withdraw; would not any reasonable man believe by this that they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to their Attendance till then: So here the King commands their Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance till it comes to such a Point; therefore before it comes to such a point, their Presence is plainly required by this Constitution.</q> This Allusion or Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth no way answer our Case; except he had shewed us that there were different sorts of Masses, in some whereof, the tinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-Bell sounded, in others not: and then
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:94716:97"/>
                        <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth had required their Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance at all Masses, until such a Mass might sall out in which the tinckling-Bell was to sound; here their Absence would have been allowed during every part of such a Mass. Our Case is the same; some Tryals there are in Parliament which may concern Life or Member, others which cannot. Now the Statute saith, 'tis their Duty to be present in all Tryals, until such a Tryal happen in which Life or Member may be concerned. I hope here this Restriction will have Reference to the whole Tryal, and not any particular Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of it. I had not said this, the matter being sufficienttly cleared before, but out of Apprehension, that some unwary Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der might be misled by this Author's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, and believe there was weight where indeed there was none.</p>

But what is more pernicious than this Simulation? Is it lawful to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuss and determine what is unlawful to pronounce? And in the whole Treatise inveighs against the general neglect of the

                     </p>
                     <p>But if it were referred to the practise of some of the Bishops and Clergy of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> probably it may be meant of such as were made Secular Judges, or sate with the Earls in the County Court, where they perhaps were present at the discussion, though not at the Sentence, which was left to be pronounced by the Secular Judge, till after the time of <hi>Edw.</hi> 1.

                     <p>To let pass what is materially reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Author of the Letter, to this Authority, I shall make some Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of my own, not yet taken Notice of. First, That this Assembly held at <hi>Northampon</hi> was not a Parliament, but a great Counsel summoned by the King soon after <hi>Becket</hi>'s stubborn carriage to his Prince at <hi>Clarendon,</hi> to be advised by them how to humble that proud Man; where it was
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:94716:100"/>
lawful for him to use the Counfel of any of his Subjects, of <hi>Normandy</hi> or others, as he thought good; who certainly, in an <hi>English</hi> Parliament could not be admitted amongst the natural <hi>English.</hi> Secondly we hear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the rest of the Clergy nor the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons but of the Bishops, Earls and Barons; but that the Commons had allways right to appear in Parliament, is learnedly made good by Mr. <hi>Petit</hi> in his Tractate of the ancient Rights of the Commons. In the next place, the relation of <hi>Fitz-Stephens</hi> is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different from the relation of other Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians, but in it self is subject to many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions: For first it is plain he was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused of High Treason in the case of <hi>John</hi> the Marshal, as he saith, which appears, by the Judgment of that Council, which upon the whole matter reac'hd only a Confiscation of his personal Estate, which shews clearly the Accusation was not in that Case for Treason, because they here punished him with a lesser Punishment than was due to Treason: now 'twas not in their Power to change the nature of the Crime, but must have either found him guilty of Treason, or <note place="margin">

Vid. <hi>Jani Anglor. facies nova, p.</hi> 199.</note> have acquitted him. But the Truth is, there was a second Accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the King, about the same time, and in the same Place, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Accounts to the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:94716:100"/>
King of Receits, during the Vacancy of the Sees of some Bishopricks, when he was Chancellor, to which he refused to give other Answer, saying, He was not cited in that Cause, and over and above, that he was fully discharged of all Accounts whatsoever when he was made Arch-bishop: but the Heats and Animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties occasioned hereupon, made him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to <hi>Rome;</hi> which being so immediately after, and contrary to his Oath at <hi>Claren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> might be called by the Name of Treason in those Days: yet it appears plainly, that an Appeal to <hi>Rome</hi> was not in those times look'd upon as a Capital Crime.

But admit this Appeal, or rather Perjury, in that time had been a Capital Crime, his Appeal here hindred the pronouncing any Judgment: So that <hi>Fitz-Stephen</hi> is mistaken in the first Point; for he was neither accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed nor condemned of Treason in the cause of <hi>John</hi> the Marshal. Secondly, he tells you he was accused of Treason, because being cited, he did neither appear, nor competently excuse himself, which must be understood to be meant by some other Proctor or Advocate; for, if he did not appear, 'tis impossible he should excuse himself any other way: for it is clear he was at <hi>Northampton, Ipsa die venimus Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thamptoniam,</hi> saith <hi>Fitz-Stephen, cap.</hi> 10. <hi>co.</hi> 1. <note place="margin">Fitz. cap. 10. co. 1.</note> That the Court sate not till the second day after their coming, and he made an Appearance on the third, is confessed by the same Author, who a little before tells you, he sent <hi>quatuor Milites</hi> to give his Answer, and the King's <note place="margin">These <hi>Milites</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive might be such as held <hi>in Capite,</hi> and were sometime called Baronets or <hi>Barones minores.</hi>
                        </note> Exception was, that he did not answer in his proper Person, which certainly by Law he was not obliged to do, so that here was but a Contempt of one day; however, they were resolved to proceed for the Arch-bishops <hi>Depulsio,</hi> or answer for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, took not place; for so I take the

meaning of <hi>depulsio</hi> to be. <hi>Archiepiscopi ratio nulla est habita.</hi> Whether you take <hi>ratio</hi> for an Account, which probably he might give as to 300 <hi>l.</hi> prerended to be due to <hi>John</hi> the Marshal, or in any other Sense, 'twas not allowed. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you have these words, <hi>Archiepisco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus autem quia sententiae, vel recordationi Curia Regis non licet contradicere sustinuit,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Curia Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis</hi> was here the Kings Council then sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned.</note>

Can any thing now be clearer than this, that he both ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, submitted to the Judgment, and put in Sureties to perform it, and that here could not be any formal accusation of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, whatsoever the Counsellors might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute among themselvs. So that <hi>Fitz-Stephen</hi>'s Relation, as to this matter, is not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Judgment of the Court, which condemned him not for Treason, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to himself, who making the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as an Historian of what was done in that case where himself was present, must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to write what in truth was the matter of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:94716:102"/>
Fact, and not what was the Opinion or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of others; except he had told us so. But this proud Prelate being, as the King thought, not sufficiently humbled by the Judgment aforesaid, nor by many other Affronts put upon him by the King's Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, a new Crime, as I touched before, is found out against him, for Accounts, to the value of 3000 Marks, to which he is required to answer, and to which, saith our Questionist, he gave a dilatory An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 39.</note> so that the King requires him to stand to the Judgment of the Court: But the Answer he gave was this, That the King knew well enough, that before his Election to the See of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> he was discharged; and how the Prince, the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons of the Exchequer, and Sir <hi>Robert Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> Chief Justice, gave him a Discharge for all Accounts and secular Receipts from the King, and so free and clear, was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen to the See, and would plead the same no more. Was this now a dilatory An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, and not a clear Discharge? What doth any Accountant in the Exchequer do more? Neither could the Court expect, being cited upon another Business, he should bring his Discharge in his Pocket. But what if this Accusation had been true? Was this Treason? If every Cheater had been a Traytor, the King would have had enow to hang? But this Storm went higher, for <hi>Becket</hi> finding himself over-power'd by the King's Party, and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:94716:102"/>
menacing Words from them, comes in his Archiepiscopal Robes, with a Cross in his hand, and appeals to <hi>Rome;</hi> for which, he was blamed and sharply rebuked by his old Enemy the Arch-bishop of <hi>York;</hi> and as <hi>Hoveden</hi> saith, by <hi>London</hi> and others. But, by his Appeal he avoided all Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces could be pronounced against him, yet left his Enemies and the King much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed against him. <hi>Gervase</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> tells you, <hi>col.</hi> 1392. that the King sitting upon his Throne, it seems in a hurry, for the Words are <hi>euntes discernite,</hi> said, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth, Consider what this perjured and contumacious Traytor ought to suffer <hi>Itur, judicatur.</hi> They went out and gave their Opinion, for this could be no legal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because first it was out of the place where the Council sate, and his Appeal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented all farther Proceedings, as it was then held. This is the Sum of the Story, taken out of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s History upon the Year 1164. as he saith, particularly delivered according to the Writers of those Times: who those were he tells you in his Preface; <hi>Hoveden, Giraldus Cambrensis, Mat. Paris, Mat. Westm. Rishanger,</hi> and others. By this Relation you may see the Credit of this grave MSS. Author, who hath knit together so many Mistakes, and different from the Relation of others, of, or near the same time. But the Bishop is now gone, though before his going the King expostulates the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with him; to whom he answered,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:94716:103"/>
That he was summoned in the Cause of <hi>John,</hi> the Marshal, and would answer to no other, having then made his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal. Neither, to speak my Mind free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, can I see how he could be accused of Treason; for, Who was the Accuser? The King could not, because by reason of the dignity of his Person no Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could be made against him; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could any man be tryed but by his Peers. Now we hear of no Articles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, no Jury summoned, nor no le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Proceedings in case it had been a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: for, though <hi>Mag. Charta</hi> was not so perfect as in <hi>Henry</hi> the Third's Time, yet all Historians agree 'twas grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Henry</hi> the First's Time; of the chief Points whereof, <hi>Stephen Langton,</hi> Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> brought a Copy into <note place="margin">Mat.

But we have not yet done with <hi>Fitz-Stephens;</hi> for, our Author tells you, that the King, upon the proud <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 40.</note>
                        <pb n="179" facs="tcp:94716:103"/>
Answer of <hi>Becket,</hi> charges the <hi>Bishops,</hi> that together with the Barons, by virtue of their Allegiance, they would give Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Arch-bishop. They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse themselves. The King presseth them. <hi>Fitz-Steph.</hi> Words are, <hi>Rex responso Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiep. accepto instat Episcopis praecipiens, &amp; obtestans per homagium, &amp; fidelitatem sibi debitam &amp; juratam ut simul cum Baronibus de Archiepiscopo sibi dictent sententiam,</hi> &amp;c. This he translates, That the Bishops, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Barons, would give Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Arch-bishop. This appears to be after his Appeal, when the giving of Judgment, or medling farther in the Business, was refused: beside the undue Translation of the Words, which signifie no more but the desire of the King that they would tell him their Opinion touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Arch-bishop, I wish he would give me any good Authority where <hi>dictare Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi sententiam</hi> (for <hi>sibi</hi> here is the same) can signifie giving Judgment upon a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, as he translates them. I know ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, that <hi>dictare judicium</hi> may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to deliver any Sentence leisurely. <hi>Linw. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Ne Cler. vel Mon.</hi> where it is all one with <hi>dicere</hi> or <hi>suggerere sententiam.</hi> Beside, no such Sense can be affixed to these Words; for, the King's Question refers to them all in general, but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the King did not mean they should all pronounce Sentence, but only privately tell him their Thoughts: yet from hence
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:94716:104"/>
would our Author infer, that this was a Parliament, and that the Bishops had Power to give Judgment in Criminal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, when he hath proved neither; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in Truth, this was only an Attempt of the King's to draw them to his Party, having then Intentions to send to <hi>Rome</hi> about this matter. The Words of the Bishop of <hi>Chichester,</hi> which he spake to <hi>Becket</hi> after his Appeal to <hi>Rome,</hi> will do him as little Service; for they import no more, than that the Interdict laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him and the rest from doing any thing against him during his Absence, hindred them from being present at such Proceedings against him as the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired from them. 'Tis not to be doubted, but the King would have pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them to deliver their Opinions, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Appeal were Treason or not: what their Judgment would have been, no man knows. If it had been a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then summons must have been sent out for his Appearance, and Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by Bill of Attainder, in a Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive way, not arbitrary in Cases Capital. <hi>Seld. pri. Bar. cap.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 10. as before noted. He closes this Head of Discourse with a pretended Confutation of the Author of the Tractate of Peerage, a Book by some snarl'd at, but by none answered: but let us examine what they both say. The Author of the Discourse of Peerage, tells you, <hi>pag.</hi> 14. and backs
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:94716:104"/>
what he saith, by the Authority of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice <hi>Doddridge,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Cook,</hi> and <note place="margin">Cook 2 Inst. 631. Seld. ubi supra.</note> Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> that these were only certain Recapitulations of the King's Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and the Peoples Right, then sought to be infringed by the Pope and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. That these Recapitulations were <hi>avite consuetudines,</hi> is confessed, and that that Canon concerning Blood is as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in <hi>England,</hi> as the Conquest, our Author acknowledgeth, that <hi>Gervasius Dorobernensis</hi> reckons this Article among the Laws then established, from all which the Discourser of Peerage might very well argue. That which was a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom in <hi>Henry</hi> the First's Time, taken notice and allowed in <hi>Henry</hi> the Second's Time, and of the beginning whereof there is no Memorial extant, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to be given, ought reasonably to be esteemed as part of the ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, which is the common Law of the Kingdom. All that the grand Question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 42</note> thinks fit to reply to this, is, that it is little to his Purpose, because this Clause in Question is not a Limitation of their Power, but a Priviledge and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence for their Absence. That this Fancy is erroneous, I have before shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the natural Sense of that Clause, as also, that long before these Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they were both by their own Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law, and Custom of the Nation, prohibited from being present in Cases
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:94716:105"/>
and Consultations of Blood, and that themselves admitted not only the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but the Obligation, by their constant Obedience given to that Law, and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom in absenting themselves in those Cases, as the Author of the Letter hath asserted, and shall by me be farther cleared in my Answer to his Precedents. Now, I do not think that this Author believeth that these Constitutions gave them a greater Liberty than they had before; but if it found them bound, that Statute left them so, and was as all affirmative Statutes are, though not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductory of a new Law, yet are they corroborative of the old, and, in their Oath, they swear Obedience to this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle as well as to the rest; to wit, that they would, according to their Duty, be present in all Proceedings in Parliament, with the rest of the Barons, except in Cases of Blood, in which they tell us afterwards, that it was not lawful for them to be present at any hand; so that upon their Allowance, there was more than a Liberty, for there was a Law against them. Beside, could this Sense be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, it would no way serve to make good his main Hypothesis, that they might be present till the definitive Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence came to be given: for, if the Law were obligatory as to any part, why not to every part of it?</p>
                     <p>

Our Aurhor is as little fortunate in his <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 42.</note> attempt to evade the Authority of <hi>Roger Hoveden</hi> pag. 40. who saith, That 'twas agreed in the Synod at <hi>Westminster,</hi> that no Clergy-man should <hi>agitare Iudicium san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guints.</hi> He tels you this was part of a Canon agreed at <hi>Toledo,</hi> which <hi>Ricard,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> thought fit to have received here, and, I think would inferr, that here was no more done then a Proposal of this to be received, not that itw as so. But if we will believe <hi>Gervas. Dorbernensis,</hi> in 22 H. 2 fo. 1429. An. 1175. <note place="margin">Ger. Dor. An. 1175.</note> he will tel you, they went much farther. His Words are, <hi>Hoc concilio ad emendationem ecclesiae Angli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canae</hi>

And, the true Sense of that Canon, which being so confirm'd, had the force of a Law, is, That Clergy-men should not <hi>agitare,</hi> or medle in any Tryal of Blood; which certainly extends to Preliminaries, but are prohibited to make Amputations themselves, or give their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,

                     <p>So at last I have done with this clause; and have shewd that it is not indulgent but restrictive; that it was a custom in H. 1. time, sworn to at Clarendon, published at <hi>Westminster</hi> 12 <hi>years after, and,</hi> by all this, made part of the Law of the Nation; have answered all his Subterfuges, and Evasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, have shewed the Interpretation I have given was always received.

                     <p>First a declaration of their undoubted Right as Peers of the Realm, by virtue of their Baronies, to sit, and Vote, in all Debates in Parliament. Where by the way the words are <hi>de Regni negotiis</hi> not <hi>omnibus,</hi> of the affairs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, not all of them, and <hi>aliquibus</hi> may as well be understood as <hi>omnibus:</hi> and this appears soon after upon their own shewing; for they tell you they intend to be present in this and all other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, and presently after tell you it is not lawful for them to be present in this Parliament while such matters were hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to intend to be present, and then tell you that 'tis not lawful to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in this Parliament shews that their Power was limited, and not universal: however upon this Protestation they went out at the Begining, and made no Proct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or; for, they tell you, they ought not to be personally present at any hand
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:94716:108"/>
where such Affairs are or would be treated of, which certainly was before the definitive sentence; so that the Canon required their absence at Preliminaries, according to the sense of all times till these new expounders came in place.</p>
                     <p>I will not here dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute whether this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mr. Hunt</hi> tells you, p. 87. that if this be a Law it is a Law only for that case. 'Tis true, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation, as such, was personal to them but the Canons I hope that put them upon a <hi>Non licet</hi> and <hi>de jure non possumus</hi> were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal also; for here is a Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both by the Canon, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Statute Law.</note> be an act of Parliament: with Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to better Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I think it hard that what was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Protestation should by Constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be advanced to an Act, no more than his present Majesties Concessions, upon the desire of the Lords and Commons, in the case of some of the late Traitors, should have the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; and the entring into the Roll by the Clerk, was no more then entring into the Lords Journal now.</p>
                     <p>But, since our Author hath made his Observations, let him give me leave also to make mine. First, This protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is cunningly worded by their own Direction, therefore their calling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Peers of the Realm doth not make them such in any new sense; neither doth entring in their Journal Book do more than make it a Record, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them liable to Punishment, if any thing unfit in it shall be taken notice of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:94716:108"/>
An example of this we have in the Bishops Protestation, 1641. <hi>That all Laws to be made in their forced Absence should be void:</hi> which could not any way weaken them, or ours here, <hi>that they should be good,</hi> any ways strengthen those Laws then made. The next thing obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable is, that he saith, 'Tis their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Right, as Peers of the Realm, by virtue of their Baronies, to sit and vote in all Debates in Parliament. In which Assertion, he begs two things: first, That they sit there by Vertue of their Baronies, whereas he hath not proved they ever had any, except <hi>tenere sicut,</hi> or <hi>quasi per Baroniam,</hi> or <hi>per serviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Baroniae,</hi> be equivalent with <hi>esse Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> which I cannot so easily admit, though they call themselves so, and in ordinary Speech may be so called by others, that Question having never been determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned though admitted in Pleading by Counsel.) The Reasons of my Doubts I have given in my first Chapter, and shall submit them to more learned Judgments. They say, here they sit as Barons, but allow that they have no Right to judge in those Cases then in Agitation: and notwithstanding, it should be true, that <hi>William</hi> the First divided the Kingdom into Counties and Baronies, to hold of him in <hi>Capite;</hi> a County to contain twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Knights Fees, a Barony thirteen, or thereabout: it doth not appear that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:94716:109"/>
Bishop had thirteen Knights Fees, or that some of them had not above twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet all of them held equally in <hi>Capite, sicut Baroniam,</hi> and sate there among the Nobility, as Associates to them. I shall farther observe, that their Right to sit and vote there was <hi>more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lito,</hi> as they had usually done, and this with a <hi>Salvo,</hi> or Saving to their State and Order: so that except our Author had first proved that 'twas their usual manner to vote and judge in matters of Blood; and that this was agreeable to their State and Order which themselves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, he hath done nothing: for, they pretend not to any other Right but what they usually enjoyed, and what was agreeable to their State and Order. Let now our Author take what Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage he can from the Preface to the Protestation; for the Omission of which, he so much blames the Pen-man of the Letter.</p>
                     <p>The second matter he affirms and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 49.</note> to prove, is, that their absenting themselves was merely in obedience to the Canons of the Church, and not out of Respect to any other Law. Yet Sir <hi>William Baker's</hi> Continuer, <hi>pag.</hi> 478. <hi>ult. Edit.</hi> saith, their Absence was not from their Obedience to the Canon-Law only, but according to the Practise of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to this day: by which it seems, he look'd upon it as the common Practise
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:94716:109"/>
for them to do so. For, he tells you, 'twas impossible they should claim such a Right by virtue of their Baronies, or that the Lords should allow such a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station if there were any other Law against them then in force: And that if this Protestation were a Law, the Case was more strong on their side: for, then it declares they had that Right they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, by Law. Should I admit this for once? Doth it not also as solemnly declare, that in Cases of Blood they are barred by the Canon-Law, and so make that Bar a part of the matter enacted. But for a fuller Answer and Discharge of what he urgeth, without repeating what I have said before, as to the Protestation it self, let me put him in mind, what I doubt not he knows, that all Arguments <hi>ab impossibili,</hi> or Deductions <hi>ad impossibile,</hi> are the weakest ways of Demonstration, and never used where any other can be brought, which at best, in this Case, can only argue a Neglect in the Lords.</p>
                     <p>But secondly, he may be advertised, that all protestations are entered accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the desire of the Protestors, and not made an Act of the House. Lastly all this is but what they usually did, and hath not relation to any other Matter than what was their Custom, and was agreeable to their State and order, which was to absent themselves in cases of Blood.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="192" facs="tcp:94716:110"/>
His Digression afterward for for two or three Leaves, about the Power of <note place="margin">Gr. q. <hi>p.</hi> 51, 52, &amp;c.</note> of the Pope, or his Legate to dispense with Irregularity, which here he calls a Penalty; <note place="margin">Gr. q. <hi>p.</hi> 68.</note> in another place, the Sanction it self, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the mystery of the Canon-Law, serves in my Judgment to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, but to shew, the Bishops were generally Time-servers, and forced Polity and Religion to bend to their turns; forgetting that nothing is profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able which is not first Just. However, we do not hear of any Dispensation grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here either by the Pope or his Legate: and I would be glad this Author did let us know that his Opinion is, that the Pope or Legate, have a legal Power to to dispence with those Canons established in Councils, and received by a Nation. I always did believe, that those that attributed to the Pope a greater Power then I do, did not look upon him under any other Notion than as one trusted to keep, and not to break the Canons.</p>
                     <p>Having thus cleared the Protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from his Objections, let us examine the clear meaning of it. This Author saith that the very reading it is sufficient to <note place="margin">Gr. q. <hi>p.</hi> 41.</note> convince any man that the Canons were the only cause of their absence. I will not deny but that it might him; but do not believe it hath Reason to force others to be of this mind: For, if two Laws were against them, to wit, the Canon-Law and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:94716:110"/>
the Common-Law, confirmed in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 'twas not unusual for those sort of men to express which of them they had most mind to. But beside this, I find no Absurdity to affirm they took notice of both, though more obscurely of the last: by a <hi>Non licet</hi> to the one, by a <hi>de jure non possumns.</hi> to the other. 'Tis not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for us at any hand, by the first, <hi>viz.</hi> the Canons, which are to us a greater Law than any other. Next, by the Law of the Land, <hi>de jure non possunius.</hi> Not that in it self our Presence in all Cases were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, if the Canons were not in the way. But there is also another Law which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits us from being present in those Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in which otherwise we might have thought it reasonable to have given our Assistance, who are no such strict Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Canons, when 'tis for our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to break them.</p>
                     <p>I might now proceed to the Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Iast Head; How far the Canon Law is at this day binding. But, because I would not leave any thing untaken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, he thinks fit to make use of for the strengthening his Cause, I shall speak something to what he farther urgeth.</p>
                     <p>He tells you out of <hi>Knighton,</hi> That this <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 53.</note> Parliament was called <hi>Parliamentum sine Misericordiâ,</hi> and that many Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces concurred, which might make the Lords willing to admit of their Protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because their business might proceed
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:94716:111"/>
better against the King's Ministers. He need not have urged Inducements to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the Lords to admit of their Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station, except he had first shewed they had Power to have refused it. But by this Inducement he insinuates, that the Bishops would probably have obstructed Justice against those wicked Ministers about the King. What the Accusation was, for which some of them were executed, I shall let you seek in the Historians of those times, being unwilling to rake into that Puddle any deeper. I shall therefore leave this Parliament and the mysterious Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, as our Author well calls them, and come to the Anti-Parliament to this, held <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 53.</note> in 21 <hi>R.</hi> 2. where, as he saith, the King had a Mind to undoe what was done in <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 54.</note> the Parliament in 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. which Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this Author saith, he had kept in his Mind ten Years, by being willing to let the Bishops be absent in 11. that he might have that pretence to Question in this Anti-Parliament, the things then done. An undecent Charge he lays upon the King, if it be well considered.</p>
                     <p>The Declaration, by help of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, that the King's Pardon granted in Parliament, in 11. was revocable by the King, was the Labour of his Ministers in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:94716:111"/>
Jealousie and Distrust between the King and his People, that I may call it the first Stone which left not rolling till it end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Ruine of that poor Prince, who continued not King much more than a Year after, and was soon after the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of his Crown deprived of his Life also.</p>
                     <p>What Art was used to make that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament subservient to their ends, I need not tell you. One of the first Attempts was (what I touched before) to make Pardons granted by the King in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, revocable at his Pleasure; in this the Clergy were very instrumental. After this, the Commons come to do their Parts, and they represent, that divers Judgments had been undone heretofore, for that the Clergy were not there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; and therefore pray they might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point some common <hi>Proctor,</hi> with suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Authority to that Purpose. From hence he infers two things:</p>
                     <p>First, That the Commons thought their Presence necessary, because Judgments had been undone for want of it: Therefore their Concurrence in Judgment was thought necessary to make a Judgment valid.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That they should therefore make a common <hi>Proctor.</hi> This is strange Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick: Their Presence was thought necessary, and Judgments undone for want of it; therefore, they ought to be present, I think, ought to have been the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent:
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:94716:112"/>
but the Commons pray that in that respect they should make a <hi>Proctor.</hi> I should think now, the true Inference ought to have been, The Bishops and Clergy ought not to be personally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in <hi>Cases of Blood,</hi> yet because it is fit they should be represented, at least in some Cases, let them nominate a common <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi> to be in their stead; where their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence is necessary. This is Sense, the other is contradictory.</p>
                     <p>'Tis evident by this Petition of the Commons, that <hi>matter of Blood</hi> was to be treated of; for there needed no <hi>Proctor</hi> for any other use, since themselves might have been present. And I think it very clear by the Year-book, in 10 <hi>E.</hi> 4. that when Issue was once joyned, 'twas their <note place="margin">

                           </gap>.</note> Duty to absent themselves. For, that Book is, that the Peer questioned may plead not guilty, and then the Bishops to depart; so that it is plain they were not to vote after Issue joyned, in matters of Blood. So <hi>Hakewell,</hi> in his <hi>Modus Tenend. pag.</hi> 84. before cited, saith, That to our days, when Question is had of the Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of any Peer, the Bishops are to depart. Now I take the Law to be all one, what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ue is joyned in a Capital Accusation, so as there be any upon which the Court may proceed to Famination of the Cause, and to Judgment accordingly.</p>
                     <p>As to our purpose in the case of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The matter then in Issue upon the Demurrer, is, whether the Pardon is good in Law; upon which, the Bishops, according to 10 <hi>E.</hi> 4. are to go out; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, if the Pardon be found invalid, then must Sentence of Death be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced against the Criminal: for, I take the Law to be, That the pleading a Pardon in Bar upon an Endictment or Impeachment, is a Confession that all the matters contain'd in the Endictment or Impeachment are true, and he shall never be admitted to plead Not Guilty after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. But this by the way.

his 2 <hi>Instit. cap. de Asportatis religiosor. pag.</hi> 586. he doth well excuse the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons <note place="margin">Co. 2 Inst. <hi>pag.</hi> 286.</note> in shewing that the Bishops were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at the Charge against the <hi>Spencers</hi> in 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. so that the Commons might not know how far the Bishops were conusant of the thing, and looking only on the out-side, were ignorant of the Act in 1 <hi>E.</hi> 3. for the Discourser saith, there were no more.</p>
                     <p>No, replyes the <hi>Grand Questionist,</hi> not in his Study, but the Commons might know of more, for we have not all the Rolls. What then? This at best is but a Surmise, and the two Judgments against the two <hi>Spencers</hi> were enough to make their Allegation true, that divers Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had been reversed for that cause; though it be not to excuse their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in not knowing that the first Judgment against them was revived by the Statute of 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. And it seems strange to me, that he that had so much Reverence for the then House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, should have so little Respect to the Opinion of both Houses now: for, the Commons unanimously voted, That <hi>the Bishops ought not to be present at any Debate concerning the Earl of</hi> Danby, <hi>or the Lords in the Tower, by them impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Treason. Journ. of Parl. pag.</hi> 258. and 267. The Lords, about the same time, <note place="margin">Iourn. of Parl. <hi>pag.</hi> 258. <hi>and</hi> 267.</note> voted, That the Bishops were to go out <hi>when their Lordships proceeded to examine</hi>

                     <p>But, let me now admit that it was reasonable in the House of Commons to move that they might make a <hi>Proctor,</hi> and that the Bishops had also Right to nominate one in Capital Cases, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, when they all absented themselves together, 'twas in their Choice whether they would make any or no; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, their omitting it, as in 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. could be no cause to reverse a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the Commons alledged. The Reason is, as I touched before, because they take notice of the matter in Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by hearing the Accusation read, which is always done before they go away, which is enough to make any Act good, and to be said to pass by their Consent, because they voluntarily absent themselves, though with Allowance of the Lords, where their Presence is not lawful. <hi>Vid. Co.</hi> 2. <hi>Inst. de Asport. Relig.</hi> pag. 586. So that the Reason of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons <note place="margin">Co. 2. Inst. <hi>pag.</hi> 586.</note> was every way weak and unsound.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, let me examine what the Office of a <hi>Proctor</hi> is, being made.</p>
                     <p>It is plain by the Imperial Law, that a <hi>Proctor</hi> is in the Nature of an Attorney, to appear, and make Answer in the name of his Client, to such things as the Court shall think fit to demand; but never,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:94716:114"/>
by that, or any other, had he Power to over-rule or contradict what was the sense of the Court.</p>
                     <p>I have seen some ancient Precedents of Persons under the degree of Noble men, made <hi>Proctors</hi> by the Bishops; for which, consult Mr. <hi>Selden's Privil. of the</hi>

                     <p>Neither is it reasonable to believe; the Lords would suffer any Commoner to sit, and vote among them as Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; neither do we read of any place where such a <hi>Proctor</hi> was to sit, having no right of his own to be there. If you will say he was to sit upon the Bishops Bench, and there to give his
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:94716:114"/>
Vote, you give the Bishops Power, by their simple deed, to give place and vote in Parliament; which is as much as the King can do by his Letters Patents, and by which, the Patentee is enobled. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it just to think they could any way transfer a Right for others to judge for them, where themselves were prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to be present or judge.</p>
                     <p>It appears, that in the Parliament in <note place="margin">Petit's <hi>anc. Rights. p.</hi> 62. Prin's Calender. <hi>p.</hi> 56. <hi>and</hi> 160.</note>

Can any one now think the Lords would suffer <hi>Thomas Percy</hi> to dispose of a hundred and twenty Votes? It had been much safer to have let the Clergy to have been personally present, than to unite in one man a power to over-ballance them all. I think it probable, for the Reasons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given, that their <hi>Proctor</hi> either sate among the mean Officers, or that in those times the Lords and Commons sate together, and that this <hi>Percy</hi> was one of those that served for his Country.

The Case is in 50 <hi>Edward</hi> 3. where the cause of Summons being shew'd, the Commons were willed to withdraw to their ancient place, and consult among themselves, proves no more than that they had a place to go to when 'twas fit they should consult apart, not that they
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:94716:116"/>
always did so; no more than it doth that the Prelates sate not among the Lords, because they sometimes went apart, and had a place to go to as well as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. We know, that 7 <hi>Iacobi,</hi> when Prince <hi>Henry</hi> was created Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> they all sate together in the Court of Requests, and may do again when the King pleaseth.</p>
                     <p>I have now done with this rather curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than necessary Question, which I had not touched upon, had not <hi>Percy</hi>'s place in Parliament given me occasion a little to search into it.

                     <p>It is observable in this Prayer, the Commons recite Ordinances as well as Judgments, to have been made null by reason of the Bishops Absence, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended not Judgments alone.

                     <p>Secondly, they desire such a Proctor as might have Power to confent to such things as should be done.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, they naming a Lay-man who had no Right of his own to sit there, and giving the King a Schedule of their Procuration, was enough to make their Right be preserved to them without any explicite Consent by their <hi>Proctor,</hi> or perhaps his being so much as present at any Debate.</p>

The Author of the Discourse, <hi>pag.</hi> 20. tells you, that that Manuscript Author blames the Prelates much for the Opinion they gave generally about the Revocation of Pardons: but in this, as in many other Authorities that make against him, our Author curtails the Words, and cites no more than makes for his turn. The
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:94716:117"/>
Words at large are these: <hi>Dederunt ergo locum judicio sanguinis in hoc facto. Ita quod dubitabatur à pluribus si non incurrerent in poenam irregularitatis pro negotio memorato; unde contigit quod propter istud minus pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum inciderent in aliud majus peccatum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequentur, ut laicam personam constituerent procuratorem pro iisdem qui illorum vice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentirent ad judicium sanguinis dandum in isto Parliamento si necesse foret &amp; occasio emersisset.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The Prelates by this act of theirs gave Allowance or Countenance to Tryals of Blood; insomuch, that it was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by many, whether they did not fall under the Penalty of Irregularity, by reason of the foresaid business: from whence it happened, that instead of that lesser Offence they fell into a greater by Consequence, in that they made a Lay-man their <hi>Proctor,</hi> who in their Room might consent to a Judgment of Blood, to be given in that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if it were needful, or occasion had happened.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have translated <hi>dare locum fudicio san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinis,</hi> to give way or Allowance to a Judgment of Blood; because it appears by the subsequent Words, he meant them so, The use the Author of the Discourse of Peerage makes of these Words, is to shew, that the Canons were not the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cause that hindred their presence in II <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. For then, when they had no
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:94716:118"/>
Encouragement from the King or Lords, then they ought not at any hand to be present in such Cases: but here in 21. when they had any Allowance or Connivence as to the Laws against them, then the Canons were neglected altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>His Inference seems to me rational and good. Oh! but saith the Grand Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onist, <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 57.</note> they were present in voting the Pardon to the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> revocable. Under his Favour, I think he is mistaken, for the Book warrants no such matter, only tells you, that they gave a general Vote, that Pardons granted in Parliament were revocable by the King; by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence whereof, some of those who were pardoned in 11. were executed in 21. which Votes, I hope might pass, though the Parties concerned were not present, and this meaning the book seems to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force: For, first that Author saith, it was a doubt amongst many, whether that act did not make them incur the Penalty of Irregularity, which would have been none, had they personally by their Votes, revoked the Pardon granted to the Earl of <hi>Arundel.</hi> Secondly, he saith by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a <hi>Proctor</hi> in that Case of Blood, they committed a greater Fault than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; but certainly, the making a Lay <hi>Proctor</hi> was not a greater Fault than actual Allowance, and personal voting in Blood, which that Author charges them with.
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:94716:118"/>
Lastly, they made a Proctor at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Tryal, as is manifest, and agreed by all; therefore the Crime charged upon the Clergy, could not but be before any Proceedings against any of the Criminals, except that prelimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Vote which made them guilty of Blood in that Chronicler's Sense. In Conclusion, there was no Act to revoke these Pardons, but the King, it seems, caused Execution to be done upon his own Authority, and those general Votes in which the Clergy were present: so that after all this Attempt, the Authority of this MSS is against him.</p>
                     <p>But after all this, we have one help left, saith the Author of the Letter, for if this Action in this Parliament would do him any Service, the whole Parliament was repealed in I <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, and so no Authority to be laid upon it. I, but replyes the <hi>Grand Questionist,</hi> the Author <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 58.</note> of the Letter admits that the three <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth, were U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpers, and therefore the Repeal of that Parliament void: I acknowledge the Author of the Letter saith so, but he is so to be understood as the Law is now ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, not as it was then; for, we see <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourh in Parliament claimed the Crown as his Right, as being Heir to <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> fourth Son to <hi>Edward</hi> the Third; whereas the Title of <hi>Mortimer</hi> who was by another Parliament declared
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:94716:119"/>
next Heir, arose by his Marriage with <hi>Philippa,</hi> Daughter and Heir to <hi>Lionel</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> who was the third Son to <hi>Edward</hi> the Third: but it was never before determined, that the Daughter of a third Brother should be preferred in Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession to the Crown, to the Son of a Fourth. We see <hi>Maud</hi> the Empress, Daughter to <hi>Henry</hi> the First, could not be received Queen, though she attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and sought for it, neither ever had we a Queen since the Conquest till that time. Nor can I divine how long it might have remained a Question, had not that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie been determined by the happy Union of both Titles in <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, who married the Daughter and Heir of the house of <hi>York.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next Question will be, how far Laws made by an Usurper generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and accepted by the People upon the resignation of the immediate prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Possessor shall be esteemed valid.</p>
                     <p>I fear, if we make such Laws void, we must find some new way to make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of ours good till <hi>Henry</hi> the Second. Was not <hi>Robert</hi> eldest Son to <hi>William</hi> the First, alive till toward the latter end of the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the First, who about the eighth Year after he was King, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived him of his Eyes; after which, he lived a Prisoner twenty six Years? <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Rufus</hi> had no better Title than the Acceptance of the People, and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:94716:119"/>
with his Brother <hi>Robert,</hi> who resigned his Title for 3000 Marks <hi>per an. Henry</hi> the First succeeds by Title no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, till <hi>Robert</hi>'s miserable Death, which happened in the thirty fifth year of his Reign, and about a year before his death. After him, <hi>Stephen</hi> steps into the Throne, help'd by two powerful Friends, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Winchester</hi> the Popes Legate, his own Brother, and the Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> his great Friend, and this in the Life of <hi>Maud,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Henry</hi> the First, and his own Brother <hi>Theobald,</hi> whose Title, though bad, was better than <hi>Stephen</hi>'s, they being both Grand-children to <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> the first, by <hi>Adela</hi> his Daughter, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to the Earl of <hi>Blois.</hi> But for this great favour, and their breach of Oath to <hi>Maud,</hi> he promised great Immunities to the Church, and amongst other, that Clergy-men should not be bound to answer to secular Courts. But by our Author's Logick, this Concession was void, and the Clergy had no reason to complain, because the old Law was revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at <hi>Clarendon.</hi> At last, to sodder all, a Composition was made, that <hi>Henry, Maud</hi>'s Son, should have the Crown after <hi>Stephen</hi>'s death; which was performed by her Consent, <hi>Maud</hi> being then alive, who having strugled for the Crown as much as she could, was at last contented with this Composition, which was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly legal Title King <hi>Stephen</hi> had, and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:94716:120"/>
no more voluntary in <hi>Maud</hi> than was that of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second. But at length <hi>Maud</hi> dyes, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Second and his Son <hi>Richard</hi> the first, enjoyed the Crown in their just Rights.</p>
                     <p>After their Death, <hi>Iohn</hi> comes upon the Stage, in the Life of <hi>Arthur</hi> his elder Brother's Son, so that here we have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Usurper; after whose death, and the death of <hi>Arthur, Henry</hi> the Third had a good Title, whose Descendents enjoy it to our Time; for the Quarrels between <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster</hi> were not about the Line, but the Persons; insomuch, that till <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, the best Title to the Crown was the Acceptance of the People, and particular Compositions with those who had the greater Right. Come we nearer home, to the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, who after the Death of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and his Marriage with the Daughter and Heir of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, was rightful King. His Eldest Daughter was marryed into <hi>Scotland,</hi> from whom, our present King enjoys his Crowns, upon an unquestionable Title. We will now come to his Son, <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth: he had two Daughters, <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the first by <hi>Katharine,</hi> his elder Brother <hi>Arthur</hi> his Relict; the second by <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Bullein,</hi> born in the Life of his first repudiated Wife Queen <hi>Katharine. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> was by Act of Parliament declared a Bastard, as born within unlawful Espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals:
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:94716:120"/>
                        <hi>Elizabeth</hi> after the Disgrace of her Mother, was served in the same kind, yet we see both of them successively enjoyed the Crown by virtue of another Act which entailed it upon them, with the approbation of the people; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, otherwise the true Right would have been in <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Sovereigns great Grand-mother. I might pursue this Theme through <hi>France,</hi> in the case of <hi>Hugh Capet;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">See Sir <hi>Hen. Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of the Princes of <hi>Christend.</hi> this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion touched upon.</note> through <hi>Spain,</hi> in the family of the D. of <hi>Medina Celi;</hi> and at present in <hi>Portugal,</hi> but I will not go out of our own Kingdoms; and have said enough to make it manifest, that Laws may be made or repealed by such Kings as are in Possession, by Composition or Resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, with the acceptance of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, else our unwary Author hath laid a foundation to overthrow or weaken, not only most of our Laws, but most of the Laws of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Over and above all this, if the Laws of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, fifth, and sixth, were not good, why did not the Nobility made in that time, get new Charters of Creation in <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth's time? Nay, what became of the whole Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy? Many of the Prelates and inferiour Clergy, must of necessity be consecrated by those that were no Bishops, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, their Consecration and Orders by them conferred, were void, and all
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:94716:121"/>
our subsequent Clergy, who derive their Authority from those who had no le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Right, extinguished; a thing, in my Judgment, worth consideration to such as would avoid Laws made by actual Kings, though their just Title might be disputed.</p>
                     <p>His mentioning <hi>Oliver</hi> rather deserves pity for his Inadvertence, than any other Answer: for, he cannot but know, out late King chose rather to loose his Life than resign his Power; that he never had quiet Possession, but a Prince always strugling against him; nor had he the acceptance of the People, or any thing but force to buoy him up, which after his Death fail'd in his next Descendent. By what I have said, it may appear to any equal Judge, that the Laws made 1 <hi>Henry</hi> 4. were good, notwithstanding his pretended Usurpation. And as to the thing it self, that the Bishops Absence in cases of Blood doth not make a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given, void, appears plainly by the Case of the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> in 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. who petitions that a Judgment given against the Father, might be reversed, and assigns for Error, that the Bishops who were Peers of the Realm, were not present; and upon full hearing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, it was adjudged no Error. Now I appeal to this Author, whither he can think that my Lord and his Counsel were so stupid, as not to urge what they
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:94716:121"/>
could think of for the advantage of the Earl, and the Clergy; for whatsoever other faults might be laid to the charge of his Parent, the cause appears to be turn'd upon that hinge: by all this we may well conclude, that the Lords in that Parliament did not hold the Bishops such Peers as ought to be allowed Judges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Life and Death of Noble-men. This Judgment our Author hath not thought fit to take notice of, which might be equivalent to <hi>error temporis,</hi> for it was either <hi>ignorantia</hi> or <hi>neglectus rei.</hi> But he tells you, <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed all again, in which he is mistaken; for, <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth repealed nothing but what concerned the Title between <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> with some Charters to others.</p>
                     <p>I come now to his third head or point, <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 64.</note> Whether supposing that the Bishops ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, as he contends, only upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Canon-Law in the times of Popery, whether those Laws do continue in force now since the Reformation: he thinks they do not. In this I shall be very short, and against his Reasons, which are rather Surmises than other, I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn direct Authorities of Judges, and Lawyers in point.</p>
                     <p>First, he saith the Canon-Law was grounded upon a superstitious fancy, that to be present in Cases of Blood brought upon them Irregularity, and hath there
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:94716:122"/>
a large Digression upon the Unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of the Canon-Law, in many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. I shall easily yield, that many of the Rules brought upon the Church by the Papacy, are full of Hypocrisie and self-ends, but do not think that our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops did first forbear from bloody Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als about <hi>Lanfranks</hi> time, as if this Canon had been unknown in <hi>England</hi> till then, almost 700 years after the first Council of <hi>Toledo,</hi> for Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> reckons that Canon to be <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 400. and <hi>William</hi> the first came in <hi>Anno</hi> 1066. And <note place="margin">Spel. Coun. tom. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 8.</note> in this first Council, this Canon is cited: but it is more reasonably referred to the eleventh Council of <hi>Toledo,</hi> and the sixth Canon, which expresly forbids their <note place="margin">Con. Tol. 11 Can. 6.</note> medling in Blood; 'twill yet be about 500 years before <hi>Williams</hi> Time. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more probable, that their forbearance in those Cases proceeded not from any thing brought in by <hi>Laufrank,</hi> but was received here long before, from their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Apostolick Canons, which did not only forbid their medling in Blood, but in all secular Employments; and were carefully observed till <hi>Constantine</hi>'s time, who flourished in the year of Christ 323. 'Tis likely enough, that the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then taken by the Clergy was restrained in <hi>Spain</hi> by that Council. And if our Author please to observe it, till they came to be corrupted by Covetousness and Ambition, their chiefest Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:94716:122"/>
was to make Peace between their Neighbours, as Chancellors and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators, rather than as Lawyers and Judges. In earnest, whoever shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the intricacy of the Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as they are called the Common-Law, will rather believe, when they sate as Chief Justices, if ever they did so, their Seats were among others better versed in the Common Laws than themselves, and they sate rather to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect what was equal according to the rules of Mercy than according to the rigorous balance of Justice. This cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly was their Office when they sate with the Earl in the County-Court. Mr. <hi>Lambert</hi> in his Laws of <hi>Edgar, cap.</hi> 5. hath these words:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Celeberrimus autem ex omni satrapiâ</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Lamb. <hi>Laws</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. cap. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>conventus bis quotannis agitor cui quidem illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us diocesis Episcopus, &amp; Aldermannus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunto quorum alter jura divina, alter jura humana populum edoceto.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here you see the Bishops Office was only to teach the People the Divine Law, as the Earl or Alderman did those of the Land.</p>
                     <p>His next Suggestion is, rather a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture than a Proof; to wit, that this <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 67.</note> Canon was never received, (contrary to himself before) or that if it were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it was in diminution of the King's Prerogative, and so repealed by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 19. He might as <note place="margin">See the Provisos in the Acts.</note>
                        <pb n="218" facs="tcp:94716:123"/>
well have said, That all the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Laws, as of Tithes, Marriages, probate of Wills, and other Faculties now exercised in the Ecclesiastical Courts, are against the King's Prerogative, and therefore void. What Success an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of that Nature lately had, he may easily call to mind.</p>
                     <p>But let me bring into his Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, what the Statute made in the same Parliament, 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. hath in the Preamble of it. <note place="margin">25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. cap. 21.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Whereas his Majesties Realm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizeth no Superiour under God, but only his Majesty, hath been, and is free from Subjection to any mans Laws, but only such as have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised, made, and ordained within this Realm for the Weal of the same, or to such others as by the Sufferance of the King and his Progenitors the People of this Realm have taken at their free Liberty by their own Consent, to be used among them, and have bound themselves by long Custom to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance of the same; not as to the observance of the Laws of any foreign Prince, Potentate, or Prelate, but as the ancient and accustomed Laws of the same by the said Sufference, Consents, and Customs, and none otherwise.</q> 
                     </p>
                     <p>We see here, the Sense of the whole Parliament, That such Laws as had been used and accustomed, should be
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:94716:123"/>
look'd upon as the Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and not of any foreign Prince or Prelate. Now let him tell me, what Laws were common to us with any fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Prelate, except the Ecclesiastical and Canon-Law, which having been here used, are acknowledged a part of the Laws of the Land by Usage and Sufferance of the People. So that we have now a whole Parliament, that they did not look upon these as against the Kings Prerogative, and so null as this Author would have it; but fully confirmed as part of the <hi>English</hi> Law. Agreeable with this is my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in <hi>Cawdrey</hi>'s Case, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. 32. <hi>b.</hi> It is, says he, <hi>Resolved and enacted by authority of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Co. lib. 2. 32 b.</note> 
                        <hi>that all Canons, Constitutions, Ordinances and Synodals provincial, that have been</hi> by common Use allowed, shall be of force, and not to be taken away, but by Act of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>Now himself confesses that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons are against him; then may I well conclude, that the Law is against him, since all Canons then in use, are part of the Law at present.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Page</hi> 68. He tells you, the Sanction <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 68.</note> of this Law, which was Irregularity, is now ceased, and that some of our most learned Judges have declared, that is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by the Reformation.</p>
                     <p>First, I am to learn, that Irregularity was the Sanction of the Law: I always
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:94716:124"/>
understood, that the Sanction of a Law was the matter established by it, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to which, was required under the Penalty of Irregularity; but I will not stand upon that, which if true, would open a door to disanul all Laws made under a Penalty, by pardoning that. But the fore-going Statute of 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. clearly shews, that all Canons accustomably used, are still in force; Who hath then taken off the Penalty? If no body, then their forbearance in Cases of Blood ought still to be observed in obedience to them. Of this opinion were the Parliament, both Lords and Commons, in the Case of the Earl of <hi>Strafford;</hi> whom this Author is pleased <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 57.</note> to honour with the name of a Cabal; as also, the Proclamation to call in my Lord Keeper <hi>Finch,</hi> who was then fled; both which, were done in the Absence and after the Bishops were withdrawn, and after <hi>William,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> had given his opinion they ought so to do, and are taken notice of by the Author of the Letter, <hi>pag.</hi> 51, 52, 53. and by him very materially observed, that that Proclamation against my Lord <hi>Finch,</hi> was drawn by the Judges, by order of the Lords Temporal, after the old Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amentary way: from whence it is easie to infer, that it was the old Parliament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary way, for the Judges to draw up such Proclamations, by Command of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:94716:124"/>
the Lords Temporal, and that the Clergy medled not in those matters. To all that hath been said to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, he hath either given no answer, or what makes against him. He tells you, that my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was first named in Commission for the Tryal of the Queen of <hi>Scots.</hi> This signifies little; for here he was only a Commissioner, but no Judge in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Secondly, That though the Queen could not dispense with the Law in general as to all Individuals, yet to any one she might, and the express na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming him a Commissioner, might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to a Dispensation. Thirdly, though the Arch-bishop was named, yet he was not present at the Tryal; <note place="margin">Whitgift <hi>was then Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop.</hi> Cambd. An. Anno 1586. <hi>and</hi> Baker, 391.</note> whose Names you may see in <hi>Cambden</hi>'s Annals, <hi>anno</hi> 1586. and therefore the Canon was observed: for, what other reason could be given for his refraining that Service, but because by it he might have become irregular. I shall add one or two Authorities more, and so conclude the point. Arch-bishop <hi>Abbot</hi> in King <hi>Iames</hi> his time hunting in one of his own Parks, shooting at a Deer, by an unfortunate Glance of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, kill'd his Keeper: much Debate there was, whether this Act had made him irregular; and that it did so, was strongly argued by <hi>Williams,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> then Lord Keeper, who said,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:94716:125"/>
that by the Canon-Law then in force, he was <hi>ipso facto</hi> irregular. Here you see the Canon-Law was then deemed in <note place="margin">Rush. hist. Col. part <hi>p.</hi> 61.</note> force, and Irregularity to be by it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted. At last, Commissioners were appointed to examine the business, whose Names you may see in <hi>Rushworth,</hi> both Divines, Civilians, and Common Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers. After a full Debate, they agreed he was not irregular; for this was no Crime, and therefore by Law could not contract Irregularity; for, by Law the Arch-bishop was allowed to hunt: this accident being only Chance Medley, could not bring any Guilt upon him. But there was not the least Doubt made of the Canons being in force, and that Punishment might be inflicted upon the Breakers of them. <hi>Baker's Chron. pag.</hi> 446. who being then a man <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Baker.</hi> pag. 446.</note> of good Age, made this Relation upon his own knowledge.</p>
                     <p>This may serve in Answer to his Reflection upon Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> that he hath <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 69.</note> incurred Irregularity by his Discovery of the Horrid Plot, not yet fully exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, for this Discovery was but his Duty; so far was it from being a Crime, that it deserved, and hath already found some Reward from his Majesty.</p>
                     <p>Of the same Opinion was Arch-bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> with the rest in the Star-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, in the Censure of Dr. <hi>Leighton;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rush. hist. Coll. part 2. pag. 56.</note> where Arch-bishop <hi>Laud</hi> would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:94716:125"/>
any corporal Punishment to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon him until he was first degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, nor his Ears to be cropt in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church-yard, because the Ground was consecrated; now Degradation and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration of Places, are the Fruits of the Canon-Law. Lastly, one <hi>Madie</hi> was in the High Commission Court Pas. 4 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <note place="margin">Rush. com. 2. App. p. 15.</note> declared irregular, and deprived for the same, having first, as was alledged, preached after Suspension. By all which it plainly appears, that Irregularity may be incurred at this day; and therefore those Canons not against the King's Prerogative, nor consequently, taken away by the Act of 25 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. but that Irregularity may still be contracted by the breach of them.</p>
                     <p>I have now done with his two first Chapters, which contain the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his whole Book, and have shewed;</p>
                     <p>First, that it is not clear that Bishops were Barons, otherwise than by Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; that they were never enobled in Blood; that no Instrument can be produced what Baronies were annexed to their several Possessions, whose Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks have the Title common to other Noblemen; as <hi>Lincoln, Carlisle, Bath, Worcester, York,</hi> and others, which is not usual, that one should be Duke or Earl, and another Baron of the same place, beside the superfetation of Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:94716:126"/>
by dividing one Bishoprick into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Baronies. But, that it is much more reasonable to believe that their Tenure in <hi>Cap.</hi> by Baronage Service, which was imposed upon them as a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, not an honour, might cause them to be called to Parliament as <hi>Barones mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nores,</hi> lesser Barons, but not left out at the King's Pleasure, as the lesser Barons were, because they were to summon the Clergy to Convocation.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I have made it apparent, that the Convocation is properly the third Estate in Parliament, of which they constitute the upper House, and not other than a part of a third Estate among the Lords.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Admitting they were a third Estate in the Lords House, entire as some think, there could be no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for their Tryal of a Noble-man, who is a Member of another Estate.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the Canons of the Council of <hi>Toledo,</hi> were not the first cause of their absenting themselves in cases of Blood.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, I have vindicated the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Clarendon</hi> from all his Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and made it very plain by the natural construction of the Words, as well as by the Interpretation of his own Author <hi>Fitz-Stephens,</hi> they are not to be present at any Consultations or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, where the end may be Blood;
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:94716:126"/>
and that the Proceedings in the Council at <hi>Northampton</hi> make fully against him; as also, his Fancy that the Bishops had Right to be present till the definitive Sentence concerning Blood was to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is against the Opinion of both Houses, in the last Parliament.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, I have shewed that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation made 11 <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, if it were not a Law, was a solemn Confession by themselves, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-Law was against them, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther given great Probability that there was in it respect had to the established Law of the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, I prove that the Canons are still in force, that they are a part of the Law of <hi>England,</hi> and not to be annulled but by act of Parliament, and that Irregularity is not taken away by the Reformation.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, I have given clear Answers to all his pretended Authorities and Reasons urged in his second Chapter, and shewed, that they are either not to the Purpose, or misapplyed, or against him.</p>
                     <p>I should now come to examine his Precedents in his third Chapter, and assert the manner of Tryal of Bishops by common Juries, but that is fully done by the learned Author of the Discourse of Peerage; and for Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, if there were any, as I think
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:94716:127"/>
there are not yet, the Law being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, they would signifie little. Yet, least he should think himself ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, I shall in the next Chapter take them into Consideration.</p>

                     <p>I Will not be long in the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Precedents; because, in my Opinion, the Lords in the last Parliament have determined the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie. For, our Author contends, that the Bishops have Right to be present till the definitive Sentence comes to be given, and longer if they please, for he sets them at Liberty. Now the Lords in their explanatory Votes, <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 32.</note> made <hi>May</hi> 15. 1679. have declared, That the Bishops have Right to sit in <note place="margin">Journ. of Parl. <hi>pag.</hi> 258.</note> Court till the Court proceed to the Vote of Guilty or Not Guilty. Tho' this their Lordships have now admitted be a Liberty greater than, I think, their Predecessors ever enjoyed, who in Cases of Blood went out at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, yet this Vote takes from them <note place="margin">

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:94716:127"/>
sit as Spectators, but reserves the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to themselves.</p>
                     <p>I perceive this Author is not willing <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 70.</note> to give much credit to the Relation of <hi>Brompton,</hi> touching what he report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the King's appealing Earl <hi>God-win</hi> of the Death of his Brother. I will not concern my self in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it being before the <hi>Conquest,</hi> and a Story in which the Relaters much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; some say 'twas at the Table, others in Council (why not in both?) next his Appeal is to the Earls and Barons. I wonder our Author doth not say that the Bishops were here meant by Barons. For if there were then no Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, some others must be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under that name; and not long after, our Author tells you, the Bishops were comprehended under that Name in the case of <hi>Hamel. Vid. Leg.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Quaere</hi> What that Word then meant.</note>

He tells you, after the Conversion of <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> they were never absent in any Councils of the Nation that were Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and that there was then no Canon to be afraid of; for the Council of <hi>Toledo</hi> was brought in by <hi>Lanfrank</hi> some time after. First he assumes a Negative, they were never absent; which cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, except by one who had lived all those times. Next he tells you, they had no Canon to be afraid of: it seems they lived then without Rule; I do not believe this Author would have them do so still. Thirdly, he saith that Council of <hi>Toledo</hi> (take the first or the <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 74.</note> eleventh, the last of them about five hundred years before) was first brought in by <hi>Lanfrank.</hi> I think the substance of that Council was observed before, but not established as a Canon till the Synod at <hi>Westminster,</hi> of which I have spoke before.</p>
                     <p>The Story of the Arch-bishops con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning Queen <hi>Emma,</hi> might be as true as that other of <hi>Godwin,</hi> and both Romantick: but however, he tells you, the Bishops did certainly sit in the County-Courts at all Judgments. What their Office was in those Courts, I have told you before out of the Laws of <hi>Alfred:</hi> as also you may find the same in Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi>'s <hi>Gloss. verb. Comes. pag.</hi> 140, 141. where he at large dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses <note place="margin">Spel.

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:94716:128"/>
those Courts, and tells you they were only for the ease of the Poor, and things of small value; and that the great and powerful men had their Tryals in the Kings Courts; and more to the same purpose, which the Reader may peruse if he see good: and in part are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by the Author of the Letter. <hi>pag.</hi> 108, 109, 110. Now let any man judge whether the Opinion of Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Spelman,</hi> or his Conjecture of <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia placita,</hi> and the Legend of Saint <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> be of most Credit. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Letter tells you, that no Capital Crimes were triable in the County-Court.</p>
                     <p>But our Author tells us out of the Laws of <hi>Edw.</hi> the Confes. set out by <hi>Henry</hi> the first, mention is made of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitalia placita, cap.</hi> 31. The Title of the Chapter is, <hi>De Capitalibus Placitis.</hi> The words follow:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In summis &amp; capitalibus placitis unus Hundredus, aut comitatus judicetur à duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, non unus duos judicet. Sic inter judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces studia diversa sunt, ut alii sic alii ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </p>
                     <p>In this obscure Law there is nothing at all that sounds like a Tryal in Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Matters, except our Author will say, that in such Cases no man shall be convicted by Witnesses, when there is no other way to try matter of Fact, except his own Confession: for, the Words are, that no man may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed by Testimony. Next, it is plain, <hi>Summa,</hi> and <hi>Capitalia placita</hi> are joyned together, one explaining the other; so that I conceive nothing more is meant than considerable Cases, where the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Law was dubious to the Judges, who were not one Bishop, and one Earl, but Bishops, Earls, and other great men, and the Judgment was not to be given according to the major, but of the better Opinion of such as were the Judges. The Records of the Court were not to be denyed to any man, (others it seems might) by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing men concerned in the Cause. The meaning of the Law I take to be, that Cases of Right might be tryed here of any Value, but criminal Cases were not medled withall.</p>
                     <p>I remember not to have read any where, that <hi>Capitalia placita</hi> had that Signification our Author suggests; <hi>Placita Coronae, Placita Parliamentaria,</hi> and <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cita Communia</hi> I have met with; but
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:94716:129"/>
                        <hi>Capitalia Placita,</hi> for <hi>Placita Capitalium criminum,</hi> is new to me. However the meaning of that be, yet the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script Life of Saint <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> as to the thing it self, will help us out. He tells you (it may be with as much Truth as <hi>Brompton)</hi> that one <hi>Hamel</hi> the Son of Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> being imprisoned by the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> his Friends earnestly interceded with the Earl, that he might not loose his Head. Here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we find a man imprisoned by an Earl, Application made to the Earl in his behalf; no mention of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Bishop, any Tryal, or any farther Proceeding in the business: but the Tryal, and the Bishops Presence at it, are both supplyed by our Author, who hath proved neither, or produced greater Proof than the Authority of a loose Legend, and that lame too: and yet upon this he triumphs, as if <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 74.</note> the Point were clearly gained, when there is nothing of what he would have made good by him. Is it not now a thousand Pities, that so well <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 77.</note> sounding Words, so well put together, should signifie nothing?</p>
                     <p>The next Precedent our Author takes into Consideration, is that of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas Segrave,</hi> cited by the Author of the Letter, <hi>pag.</hi> 55. by this Author, <note place="margin">Lett.. p. 55. Gr. q. p. 76.</note> 
                        <hi>pag.</hi> 76. which he would evade, by
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:94716:130"/>
supposing the Bishops might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under the Name of <hi>Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> or Counsellors, and shews, that some of the Bishops were probably then of his Counsel. For a clear Answer to these Surmises, I shall give you shortly the whole Case, as you shall find it at large, <hi>inter placita Parlam.</hi> 33 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> pag. 266. <note place="margin">Pla.

                        <hi>Nicholas Segrave</hi> had Summons by the Sheriff, and the Command of the King, to answer to such things as should be objected against him, and to hear, and stand to what the <hi>Curia Domini Regis,</hi> to wit, the Parliament, <hi>considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret in praemissis.</hi>

Now to suppose them comprehended under a general Name, and out of Order, who were particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expressed when their Presence was lawful, is both unusual and unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: unusual, because it is against the <note place="margin">See <hi>Coo.</hi> 2. <hi>Rep.</hi> Arch. <hi>Cant.</hi> Case.

Secondly, 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable to make a different Constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the same Words in different Cases or Laws: now we know that in the Statute <hi>de Asportatis Religiosorum,</hi> the Words are <hi>Comites, Barones, Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates,</hi>
                        <pb n="254" facs="tcp:94716:131"/>
where we know the Bishops were not comprehended under the Name <hi>Magnates,</hi> nor ought to be here; and to suppose the contrary is against the Current of all Acts of Parliament and Records. By the <hi>Magnates,</hi> and <hi>alii de Consilio</hi> were meant the Judges and other Counsellors at Law, whose Advice the King required, as was very just and usual in those times. 'Tis likewise ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable, that the Word <hi>Consilio</hi> is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with an <hi>(s)</hi> which shews, those Counsellors he advised with were not necessarily Members of Parliament, for then the Word would have been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with a <hi>(c) Concilio.</hi>

                     <p>His remarkable Precedent of the <hi>D'Spencers,</hi> will stand him in as little <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 79.</note> stead; in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond they were both condemned, and the <hi>Exilium Hugonis D'Spencer</hi> is to be seen in the old <hi>Natura brevium.</hi> Those Judgments were afterward reversed at <hi>York,</hi> in 15 <hi>Edward</hi> the Second; but in 1 <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, the first Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were affirmed, and so they were look'd upon as condemned Persons, which continued (though themselves were dead) for above seventy years; til by the prevailing Party, in 21 <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> the Second, that Act was again called in question, as void, in regard the Bishops were absent: and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:94716:131"/>
desired to make a <hi>Proctor</hi> by the Commons, which they accordingly did; but at last, through their exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Proceedings, that whole Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was repealed in 1 <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth. To this I have largely spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before, to which I shall refer the Reader, with this farther Advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that in troublesome times things are not always carryed as they ought to be; wherefore, we are not always to look at what was, but what ought to have been done: neither are we to be governed by seeming Precedents, such as sometimes, as in the Case of Ship-money, may be produced against Law.</p>
                     <p>I have before made it manifest, that the Canons of the Church long before <hi>Lanfrank</hi>'s time forbad Clergy-men to meddle either in Blood or secular Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; neither is it reasonable to believe the Laws of this Land were different from the general Rule incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon all Clergy-men to observe, especially when we see the Immunities granted them by King <hi>Stephen</hi> were so early recalled by <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, and the Constitutions then made at <hi>Claren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> look'd upon as the ancient Customs of the Nation; insomuch, that the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courser had very good reason to say 'twas the common Usage, which is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law of <hi>England.</hi>

                     <p>First, That they are Negative, the Bishops were not present at Tryals of Blood, therefore they had no Right to be present.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, They were sometimes ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent when they were not prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, therefore their Absence was volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, they are sometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under the Name of Peers, or Grands, and therefore may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under those Names when the Name Prelate is not expressed.</p>

                        <hi>Mortimer,</hi> in 4 <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, but we must fetch our Judgment from what was done in 28 <hi>Edward</hi> the Third; where, upon the desire of <hi>Roger Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> Cousin, and Heir of <hi>Mortimer,</hi> that Attainder was examined, and all the Proceedings repeated; and upon the whole matter, the King charges the Earls and Barons, the Peers of the Realm, that for as much as these things principally concerned him, and them,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:94716:132"/>
and all the People of his Realm, that they would do such Right and loyal Judgment as was fit for such a Person to have. The Words upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord  are, <q>
                           <hi>Le Roy vous charge Counts, Barons, les Pieres de son Royaum que de si come cestes choses touchent principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a luy, a vous, &amp; a tout le peuple de son Royaum que vous facies, au dit Roger droit, &amp; loial Iugement come at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient a un tel d'avoir.</hi>
                        </q> Which said Counts, Barons, and Peers of the Realm, returned and gave their Judgment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Words are, the King charges you Counts, Barons, the Peers of his Realm, not as our Author renders the Words, Earls, Barons, and Peers of the Realm, as if Peers were there distinct from Earls and Barons, when the Words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port no more than who were those Peers, to wit, the Earls and Barons: therefore the Author of the Letter had reason to say the Bishops were not there who were left out in the refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence made by the King, whose Words are, To the Earls and Barons, the Peers of the Realm. Now if the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion be asked who are those, must not the Answer be, the Earls and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons? So that the Bishops must be comprehended under the Names of Earls and Barons, or not at all. From whence it will follow, that this Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:94716:133"/>
is something more than a bare Negative, we may at least call it <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivum praegnans,</hi> a Negative big with an Affirmative: for it is first told, who were those Peers. Secondly, to whom those Judgments belonged. Chiefly to the King and them, and consequentially, to all the Kingdom: and whatever the Practise is now, I think it not hard, to prove, that anciently no Judgment, or very rarely any by the Lords in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was complete in criminal Cases, or Execution done till it was ratified by the King; yet, that I may render all possible Right to the Bishops the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will bear, I would easily grant that (if they were at all summoned to that Parliament) they might be present whilst the Proceedings against <hi>Mortimer</hi> were in reading, but went away when the Lords proceeded to the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what Judgment was to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven against him, which was enough to give them knowledge of the matter in Agitation, and as much as was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to make them Parties, according to the Opinion of my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cited.</p>
                     <p>I said (if they were summoned) because in many ancient Parliaments I cannot find they had any Summons at all, as in 49 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. 23 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. 28 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. 16 <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. and 6 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. but after that were
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:94716:133"/>
never omitted: so that 'tis probable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that they were not summoned in 4 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. who were left out in the sixth year of the same King. But, in this I will not be positive, because it may be the Rolls have been lost.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 94. He takes a more exact view of <note place="margin">Gr. q. p. 94.</note> the Case of <hi>Mortimer</hi> in 4 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. and pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth strongly to have it allowed, that the Judgment against <hi>Mortimer,</hi> and some others, was by Act of Parliament, because the Reversal of it in 28 E. 3. was by Act: and therefore, saith he, we may justly suppose, that the Judgment against them was ratified in Parliament: beside, some Historians say, he was condemned <hi>Iudicio Parliamenti,</hi> and his own Petition is, that the Statute and Judgment may be rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and annulled; and from this infers, that if the first Judgment was by Act of Parliament, and the Bishops not there, then they might not be present in their Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative Right; and if they were there, then this Negative way of Argument proves nothing, that is, they <hi>de facto</hi> were not there, therefore <hi>de jure</hi> they ought not to be there. This I confess is subtle, but not solid; 'tis all grounded upon no greater Authority than Supposition. First, the Reversal was by Act, therefore the Judgment was so too; this doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, for many Judgments in Parliament may be reversed by Act of Parliament
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:94716:134"/>
which were not so pronounced. His second Conjecture hath as little weight, because some Historians say it was by Judgment in Parliament, therefore by Act, because it is not a Parliament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the King, and Lords, and Commons; for, except this be his Argument, it is of no force at all; for it might be, and doubtless was, by Judgment in the Lords House, which in ordinary Speech was called Judgment in Parliament; nay, how often doth himself infer the Presence of the Bishops from the Words, Full Parliament, when the Commons were not concerned, and indeed, meant no more than a full House. Lastly, <hi>Wigmore</hi> desiring the Statute and Judgment might be reversed, proves as little: for, every thing ordained that is <hi>Statutum</hi> is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently an Act of Parliament though eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Act be <hi>Statutum.</hi> Beside, I do not find <hi>Statutum</hi> in the Record, but only the Word Judgment used; so that for ought appears from our Author, the Bishops might well be absent at the first Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against <hi>Mortimer,</hi> and not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under the Name of Peers. They have less reason to think themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded under the Name of Barons, if we well consider the words of <hi>Petrus Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensis,</hi> who living in the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. well knew both what Honour they had, and what they pretended then to: whose Words are;</p>

                     <p>This Case I conceive, is not truly stated by the Author of the Letter, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applied by the <hi>Grand Questionist.</hi> The Point in question in the Record was, what Offence the Murther of this publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster was? which matter was referred to the Judges for their Advice, who agreed that it was Treason within the Statute of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. This their Judgment was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in Parliament, whilst the Doubt was in Agitation among the Judges, 'twas not material who was there. But after they had given their Sense, what was meant by this Confirmation in Parliament, is the next Question: Whether more were meant than an approving of the Opinion given by the Judges, by them drawn up in form?
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:94716:136"/>
and this may well be the meaning of that whole Proceeding, which Practice is usual in our days, but cannot be called a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Parliament, tho it might be their Opinion. But if you will rather believe it to be by Act of Parliament, then must the Commons be Parties, of whom we hear no mention, nor any Statute to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose extant that I can find; and in that Case the Bishops might have been present if they would, and whether they were or not, is not material. <hi>Vid.

The Author of the Letter <hi>pag.</hi> 7, 8. tells us, that that Parliament was summoned for redress of the Breach of the Law, and the Peace of the Kingdom; and the Record saith further, that 'twas to consult touching Lands in <hi>Guienne,</hi> and the Marriage of the King; in which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops went away, and returned no more. I confess, I know no reason but they might have staid, it seems they thought other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:94716:137"/>
being in all likelihood privy to some Actions to be treated there, wherein Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Blood might be pronounced. But be their reason what you will, their words are these. <hi>Et pour ceo que avisefust a les dits Prelates qu'il nattient proprement a eux de Counseiller de la gard de la paix, &amp; de chastiment de tels malvois s'allerent mesmes les Prelates.</hi> Which words do not only import that they voluntarily went away, but that it did properly behove them not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in such matters, or to give Counsel for the Punishment of such Crimes. The same word is used in 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. <hi>Cot.</hi> p. 392. where the King by the mouth of the Arch-bishop <note place="margin">Cot. <hi>p.</hi> 392.</note> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> declares that the Commons in that Case were only Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and that all Judgments belonged to him and the Lords; belonged, that is, the Commons had no Right thereto; so here <hi>nattient proprement</hi> is that properly they had no Right thereto. That all Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments belonged to the King and Lords, is only an Affirmation of the Arch-bishop, but binds not the Commons: See <hi>Posthu. Cottoni,</hi> p. 350.

This was clearly a Judgment in Parliament, in which the Commons were certainly present: and that it was not an Act, appears plainly, for the Record was certified, and Errors assigned; and 'tis worth observation, that he did not assign for Error, that he was before convicted by a common Jury, but admitted it legal. Next, I think the Prelates were not Parties to the Reversal of the Judgment given in 17 <hi>E.</hi> 2. for it is <hi>coram Praefatis comitibus Proceribus,</hi> &amp;c. though they were at the recital of the Errors; neither is it much material, for they might very well be Parties to the Examination of a Judgment in a Capital Case; for whether they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred either in affirming, or reversing the Record, that made them no Parties to the first Judgment, but is only a Concurrence in Opinion, that what before had been done by others, was well or ill done by them.

                     <p>Secondly, It doth not appear that this was an Advice taken up by themselves; for the words are not <hi>(fust avise par eux)</hi> or <hi>ils furent d'avis,</hi> it was thought fit by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but are <hi>(et pour ceo que avis feust a eux)</hi> that is, because Advice was given them by others to go away, they absented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves probably in Obedience to those Laws which forbad their Presence: And they returned no more, saith the Author of the Letter, <hi>p.</hi> 8. and the Advice was given by the Lords Temporal only: No, saith the <hi>Grand Questionist,</hi> p. 102. The Bishops <note place="margin">Gr. Qu. <hi>p.</hi> 102.</note> and Proctors of the Clergy went only into another Room to consult therein, which was usual in those times. I do not at all doubt but the Members of Parliament have several Rooms to retire to upon occasion: but that in this Case, they did go apart to consult, and give Advice in this Business, seems very unreasonable for any one to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, because <note n="*" place="margin">

For the Record saith, It was enacted by the King, Bishops, Lords, and Commons, which then became a Law, to which the Prelates might justly give their Consent in their Legislative Capacity, whatever it concerned.

Qu. <hi>p.</hi> 90.</note> of those the Author of the Letter calls Negative Precedents, if they prove any thing, prove too much: for some of them admit they were not present when they might have been; others, that they were present, when by his own Rules, they should have been excluded, either therefore the general words where they are not mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, do not enforce their Absence, or that they oughtto have been excluded at some other Trials, where the Author of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter admits they were, or might have been present. The chief Case he instanceth in, is that of <hi>Michael de la Pool</hi> Chancellour of <hi>England,</hi> who was accused of many Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:94716:140"/>
by the House of Commons, and as (I think he would infer) such as <hi>Thorp</hi> Chief Justice, was found guilty of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Capital: where the Author of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter saith, the Bishops were not present, yet allows them to have been present in the Case of this Chancellour, a parallel Case, as he saith, with that of <hi>Thorp:</hi> either therefore, saith our Author, they might have been present in the Case of <hi>Thorp,</hi> or they should have been absent in Trial of <hi>Pool.</hi> This is his Argument, as near as I can ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of his Words, put together some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">
                           <hi>N. B.</hi> Though there were no particular Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Weston</hi> and <hi>Gomenes</hi> by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, yet the general one being the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering Forts and Castles, was Treason; at the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of which, the Prelates ought to be absent. <hi>Vid.</hi> Gr. Qu. <hi>p.</hi> 92.</note> obscurely.</p>
                     <p>I need give no other Answer to this, than to lay before you the words of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
                     <p>This Accusation was exhibited by the Commons in 10 <hi>R.</hi> 2. against <hi>Michael de la Pool,</hi> Lord Chancellour, in full Parliament, before the King, Bishops and Lords, and six Articles were objected by them against him. The first was, That he purchased Lands of the King of great value, whilst he was Chancellour; the other five, as the Record saith, were only Quarrels, and of little concern.</p>
                     <p>To the first, and most considerable, the Chancellour put in a fair Answer; the Commons reply, and urge things to the utmost, and amongst other things, say, That whereas by the Popes Provisions, a Person was recommended to the Priory of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonies;</hi>
                        <pb n="273" facs="tcp:94716:140"/>
he, the said Chancellour, would not suffer him to be admitted till the <hi>Grantee</hi> had contracted to pay to the Chancellor, and his Son 100 <hi>l.</hi> yearly: and then paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel this with <hi>Thorp</hi>'s Case, and would have had the Chancellor in the same fault with <hi>Thorp,</hi> for Bribery as a Judg, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently incur the same Judgment. The Chancellor replies, and shews great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Cases. Upon the whole matter, Judgment was given against him, pursuant to the Accusation for Misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours only, in which the Bishops were, and might be present; and the parallelling it with <hi>Thorp</hi>'s Case, was only in the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Cause by the Commons, and no part of the Accusation.</p>
                     <p>Neither is it reasonable to believe that which our Author asserts in the same Page, <note place="margin">Gr. Qu. <hi>p.</hi> 90.</note> that the Prelates were free Agents, and might withdraw at some times, and be present at others, as they saw cause. For beside that, this is contrary to the express Law of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> which expresly declares that 'tis their duty to be present in all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings <hi>in Curia Regis,</hi> which in that place must be understood of the Parliament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were to be present with the other Lords, tho I know that <hi>Curia Regis,</hi> is sometimes taken in a more laxe Sense; for all the Courts in <hi>Westminster</hi> are the King's Courts, and unto which they were to give Obedience and Attendance in Cases
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:94716:141"/>
not prohibited. I say, over and above, this Act at <hi>Clarendon,</hi> it seems to me very unreasonable to suppose, that such a Body of Men had liberty to give their Attendance when they pleased, without leave of the House, or cause shewed why 'twas fit they should be absent, or that the Author of the Letter meant more when he saith, they might have been present, than that they were not prohibited by the Law of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> which only had Relation to Matters of Blood. But these Men had other Canons to go by, when they thought fit, as well as those of <hi>Toledo,</hi> and 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable enough, that the rest of the Noble-Men, finding them most constant Factors for the Pope, were willing enough to let them be absent upon any colourable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence when they desired it. Is not one clear Precedent against them in point of greater weight, than many dubious, and equivocal ones; which cannot without great Art, be wire-drawn to speak to their advantage? Let him consult the Discourse of Peerage, <hi>pag.</hi> 17. The Case of the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> 7 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. <hi>Rot. processus</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rot. Proces in Parl.</note> 
                        <hi>cor Dom. Rege in Parl.</hi> in 5 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. This Noble-Man came into Parliament, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed before the King and Lords, that he had done against his Allegiance, in gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power and giving Liveries; this Fact by the Lords, was adjudged no Treason, for which he gives Thanks to the Lords
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:94716:141"/>
his Judges, and a day after, the Commons do the like, where the Prelates are named, as our Author affirms, and to which I shall speak by and by. But in 7 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4 the same Earl was in actual Rebellion in the <note place="margin">Gr. Qu. <hi>p.</hi> 117.</note> 
                        <hi>North,</hi> and his Forces dispersed by the Earl of <hi>Westmarland;</hi> but he, and the Lord <hi>Bardolf</hi> fled into <hi>Scotland,</hi> the rest were most of them taken Prisoners. This Case came into Parliament, where the King commands the Lords Temporal, Peers of the Realm, to advise what Process to make, and what Judgment to render against the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and Lord <hi>Bardolf.</hi> Nothing can be plainer than that the King look'd upon the Lords Temporal as those Peers who were proper to give Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment touching their Fellow Peers, who had fled from Trial in a case of Blood: The Record goes on; the said Lords ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised thereupon, and gave Counsel to the King: Then the said Lords, Peers of the Realm, by assent of the King, order sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning the said Lords to appear at a day given, or to stand convicted by Award of the Peers in Parliament. The King farther demanded the Opinion of the Lords Temporal touching the Arch-bishop of <hi>York,</hi> who was in the same Treason. The Lords Temporal, by the Assent of the King, and by their Authority, declared, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded the said Earl, and Lord, to stand convict of Treason, for not appearing
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:94716:142"/>
upon Summons. 'Tis very clear, that this whole Business was transacted by the Lords Temporal without the Bishops, and with the Concurrence of the King. 'Tis not to be believed that the Bishops would have sate quiet, had they thought themselves wronged in these Proceedings: See the Discourse of Peerage, <hi>pag.</hi> 17, 18. I think it hardly possible to find a more clear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in the Point than this is. First, here were two Noble Lords defeated in actual Rebellion, and fled from Justice into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> The King upon this, would not so much as consult with his Prelates, knowing them by Law no proper Counsellours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Peers in matters of Blood, applies himself to his Lords Temporal, they order Proclamations by order of the King, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning the said Lords to appear at a day certain, or to stand convict; they not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, are by Award of the Lords Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral convicted of Treason; and a Year after, one is slain, the other mortally woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at <hi>Bramham-moor</hi> in <hi>York-shire.</hi> Can any thing be more agreable to the Practice at this day against Men that fly from Justice, and are convicted for non-appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? He must have a new way of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning, who considering that in 4 <hi>E.</hi> 3. the Earls and Barons are declared those Peers, to whom such Judgments belong; that in 5 <hi>E.</hi> 3. the Prelates declared, that in a Case where Blood might be, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:94716:142"/>
not to them to be present; that in 7 <hi>R.</hi> 2. the Temporal Lords were only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in a Case where the Accusation was Treason, with many other Cases, that in 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. the Lords are declared Judges in such matters; that in 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. in a like Trial or Judgment, the Temporal Lords are all named, who were the Judges; that now in 7 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. the Temporal Lords are again declared Judges, and after all this, that the Prelates should be deemed proper Judges in Cases of Blood upon bare Surmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and no direct Proof, seems to me to savour of a Man wedded to an Opinion which he resolves to maintain; when at last, tho Precedents confirm what the Law is, 'tis that must determine the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy. This I say in Relation to what Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> objects. This Precedent may in <note place="margin">Gr. Qu. <hi>p.</hi> 95.</note> part, serve to give answer to those Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments drawn from the Identity of Names, to the Identity of Right. The Bishops saith the <hi>Grand Questionist</hi> are sometimes comprehended under the name of Grands, Seigneurs, and Peers; therefore their Right is equal to all others who enjoy those Names: How he attempts to make this good, we shall see anon. But first, let him consider how weak a way of arguing this is; we know nothing is more equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal than Names. Many are called Lords, who had once that Name, as Embassadors, Chief Justice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or such whose Fathers
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:94716:143"/>
are Dukes; so Earls Eldest Sons, yet are indeed but Commoners: so <hi>Baronagium</hi> comprehends all the whole Parliament; Barons there are of the Cinque-Ports, of the Exchequer, and of some chief Towns, as I have noted before from Mr. <hi>Selden:</hi> so we are not to judg the Right from the Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, but govern the Appellation by the Right.</p>
                     <p>The first Precedent he urges is, <hi>pag.</hi> 96. where in 4 <hi>E.</hi> 3. an Act passed for Trial by Peers, <hi>Cotton, Numb.</hi> 6. 'Tis agreed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the King, and all the Grands in full Parliament, that tho the Lords had tried some, who were not their Peers, upon Accusation by the King in a summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way against Law, it should be so no more. If the Bishops were here compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under the Name of Grands, so were the Commons too, if it should be an Act of Parliament; will he hence infer, <note place="margin">See before <hi>p.</hi> 131. the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords there ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</note> that the Commons have an equal Right with the Lords because they all are called Grands?</p>

I think therefore I may safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude this Point: That where Grands are named alone, there not only the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, but the Earls, Barons, Judges, and Commons might be comprehended, but where the Grands are mentioned after the Earls, and Barons, there the Bishops who ought first to be named, shall never be taken in secondarily, and by Implication. Neither is it any thing to our Question, whether it were for their Honour to be absent in some Cases, as he intimates, <hi>pag.</hi> 100. in the Case of <hi>Roger Mortimer,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gr. Qu, <hi>p.</hi> 100.</note> but what the matter of Fact was.</p>

                        </q> Here he would infer that the Prelates were present at the Examination of that Capital Crime, under the name of Peers, because at that time, there were no Dukes, nor
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:94716:144"/>
others of Superiour Degree to Earls; but <note place="margin">See before <hi>p.</hi> 131.</note> he doth not consider, that the word <hi>Peers,</hi> in this place, doth only denote who those Peers then mentioned were [Peers] <hi>viz.</hi> Earls and Barons, not Bishops, as before <hi>Magnates,</hi> viz. <hi>Comes, Baro, Miles,</hi> &amp;c. As when we say a Noble-Man is to be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Peers, we understand only those that are truly so, and not others that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times may be called so; this is much clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Record 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. <hi>N.</hi> 30. The Lords Temporal by the Assent of the King, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>N.

                        <note place="margin">2 H. 4. <hi>N.</hi> 30</note> and others, Traitors; this Judgment was after the Parties were dead, and but the second Successor after <hi>Edward</hi> the third. Why did not now the Prelates come in and claim their Right? Certainly they would have done it, but that they knew the Law and Practice was against them; what else is material in this Chapter, hath been taken notice of by the Author of the Letter, and others; so that it needs no further Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination: and I may safely conclude, that where the Prelates are not named, they are not understood. Now that in this case, the Bishops could not be meant by the word <hi>Peers,</hi> is very plain from the Record it self: For the fore-named <hi>Iohn Mautre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> being not in hold, the <hi>said Peers do pray</hi> our Lord the King, that search should be made for him throughout the Realm;
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:94716:144"/>
and a Reward promised. Now if the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops were meant by the word Peers alone, for Earls and Barons are named, witness the Peers, Earls and Barons; then by Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Reason the <hi>said Peers</hi> should be meant only of the Bishops, as if they alone had made the desire for the Apprehension of the said <hi>Matrevers,</hi> and the Earls and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons had been unconcerned, which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd: See 4 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Mem.</hi> 3. <hi>N.</hi> 3.

                     </p>
                     <p>Our Author concludes his third Chapter with the Case of <hi>Henry Hotspur,</hi> the eldest Son of the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> who for having levied War with others against the King, was declared a Traitor (being before slain in Battel) by the King and Lords in full Parliament: this was upon <hi>Friday</hi> the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>February;</hi> upon the same <hi>Friday,</hi> upon that Case, and the Petition of the Earl Father to <hi>Henry,</hi> and Examination of his Cause by the Lords as Peers of Parliament, to whom such Judgment belonged (for the King would then have referred the whole matter to the Judges) he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared innocent of Treason, or Felony, but only finable for Trespass at the King's Pleasure: for which the said Earl gave Thanks to the King and Lords, for their rightful Judgment, and also at the same time purged upon his Oath the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and other
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:94716:145"/>
Lords, who were suspected to be of the Confederacy with the said <hi>Henry Hotspur,</hi> alias <hi>Percy.</hi> This was the work of <hi>Friday</hi> the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>February;</hi> on <hi>Saturday</hi> the <hi>19th,</hi> the Commons give Thanks to the Lords Spiritual and Temporal for the rightful Judgment they had given as Peers of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 5 <hi>H.</hi> 4 from <hi>N.</hi> 12, to <hi>N.</hi> 17. This is the whole Case as to Father and Son. Now <note place="margin">5 H. 4. <hi>N.</hi> 12. <hi>to</hi> 17.</note> whether the Bishops were present at all these Proceedings, and how far, is the Question. The <hi>Grand Questionist</hi> contends they were present at the Proceedings both against the Father and the Son; at that against the Son from the word, <hi>full Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which he seemeth to infer, must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Bishops; and at that against the Father, from the Thanks made by the House of Commons the next day after the acquittal of the Earl.</p>
                     <p>First, as to the Son: It appears plainly by the Historians of those times that he was slain in the fourth Year of the King, in the life-time of the Father, who soon after broke out into Rebellion, so that at the time of <hi>Henry</hi>'s Death he was only a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner, and consequently not to receive any Judgment in the Lord's House alone, nor could he be made a Traitor other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than by Act of Parliament; so that the word <hi>full Parliament,</hi> must either refer to some particular Act of Parliament made
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:94716:145"/>
in his Case, in which the Bishops might be present, and the Commons concur, or else the Proceedings were wholly irregular and contrary to their own Agreement, in 4 <hi>E.</hi> 3. Now from an illegal Act, no Right can be concluded.</p>
                     <p>As to the Earl himself, we find him sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly after in open Rebellion, defeated, and escaped into <hi>Scotland</hi> with Lord <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolf,</hi> and convicted of Treason by the Temporal Lords, for not appearing upon Summons, and all this within two Years after. Now can it be reasonable to think that the Bishops were present at the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittal of this very Lord in 5 <hi>H.</hi> 4. who were not present in 7 <hi>H.</hi> 4. which was but two Years after, nor were present at a like Case in 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>N.</hi> 30. against the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> and others, which was not three Years before? Neither can any weight be laid upon the Thanks of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which was only matter of Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and performed at another time when the House was assembled upon other matters, but seeing them there, might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their Thanks to them also, who though they could not contribute, did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to hinder the Clemency of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Lords towards the Earl; besides, at the same time it was accorded by the King, and Lords, upon the Desire of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, that certain ill Officers about the King should be discharged, in which the Bishops
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:94716:146"/>
might be Instrumental, and very well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve <note place="margin">Gr. Qu. <hi>p.</hi> 119.</note> the Thanks of the Commons, at which Desire of the Commons, they might assist, and be absent at the rest.</p>
                     <p>The Precedent of <hi>Iohn</hi> Lord <hi>Talbot</hi> will not avail him; he exhibited an Accusation against the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> for certain Treasons by him committed; this Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was in the <hi>Marshalsea</hi> before the Earl of <hi>Bedford,</hi> Constable of <hi>England.</hi> The King, to put an end to this matter, doth by Act of Parliament make an Abolition, and Discharge of the said Accusation, and Discovery. The words are, That the King by the Advice and Assent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons, made an Abolition of the said Detection. Whoever denied the Bishops Consent in a Legislative way? and had it been otherwise, the Commons could not have been, I think, regularly concerned. 2. <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>N.</hi> 9. <note place="margin">2 H. 6.

                     <p>The Precedent of the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> in 28 <hi>H.</hi> 6. I thought to have passed over, being a Case as irregular in the Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, as unjust in those that put to death that unfortunate Man. Much Art was used by the Court to have preserved him from the Envy of the People. A Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment assembled at <hi>Westminster,</hi> after dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed into <hi>London,</hi> then prorogued to
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:94716:146"/>
                        <hi>Leicester;</hi> that dissolved, and another cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at <hi>Westminister,</hi> in which the Duke ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, which exasperated the Commons against him. But upon the whole Record it appears that no Issue was joyned; for after Articles exhibited by the Commons, and his denial of them, <hi>March</hi> 14, at the least of the eight first, and giving some Answers to others on the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, he was sent for again, and the Chancellour acquainted him, that he had not put himself upon his Peerage, and now asketh him how he would be tried; who instead of pleading, put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon the King's Order, who caused him to be banished for five Years. By all this it appears, here were no judicial Proceedings, which could not be before Issue joyned: so that although the Bishops were present at the reading of the Articles; yet this can be no Precedent to entitle them to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in judicial Proceedings in Capital Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, for here were none at all in this Case, and till Issue joyned, the Bishops are not bound to withdraw. Neither ought it to seem strange that the Viscount <hi>Beaumont</hi> should make Protestation in the name of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal against these Proceedings, which they finding to be extra-judicial in very many Particulars, they did not know, I mean the Bishops, as well as some of the Lords, what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction might be made to their Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice: for sometimes they met in one
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:94716:147"/>
place, sometimes in another, and not always in the Parliament-House, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult of this Business. Besides, many things pass <hi>sub silentio,</hi> which being questioned, would not have been allowed: these Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations being added to what hath been said by the Author of the Letter, seems to me a full Answer to this Precedent, in which the <hi>Protestatio</hi> is only <hi>Protestatio</hi>

                     <p>IN this Chapter our Author hath em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed <note place="margin">Gr. Qu. <hi>p.</hi> 121.</note> all his Art to assert the Peer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the Bishops, and that they make a third Estate in Parliament, in what sense they are called Peers; as also that the entire Clergy, met in Convocation, make a third Estate, I have largely shewed before, and shall not now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat. I admit they are sometimes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Lords Spiritual, tho not so before <hi>Rich.</hi> II. but <hi>Prelates</hi> or the like, Peers of the Realm, Peers in Parliament. If by that Appellation you would make them Equals to the <hi>Nobilitas Major,</hi> I think they never were, yet have they many Privtledges in respect of their Seats and Episcopal Dignity in the Lords House; and, by reason of their most honourable Profession, have all of them Precedence to Barons. I admit also that the Clergy is really a third Estate; and that the Bishops, in respect
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:94716:148"/>
that they are the Head of the Clergy, may sometimes in ordinary Discourse be called so, but are in truth never so exclusively to the rest of the Clergy, they all making but one Body, or third Estate, fully represented in Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as I have sufficiently, I hope, made appear, <hi>pag.</hi> 19, 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. As also that they had the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of Barons and Peers, not that they really were so, which must have enobled their Blood, but in respect of their Tenure <hi>in Capite sicut Baroniam,</hi> or, <hi>per Servitium Baroniae,</hi> and for the most part so called by themseves only. Our Author's Suggestion, <hi>p.</hi> 151. that they sit in Parliament in a double Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, <note place="margin">Gr. Qu: p. 151.</note> as it is new, so is it not solid. He saith, when they sit in the House in a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial way, they sit only in the Capacity of Temporal Barons; and that this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Constitution of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> where the King requires their Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance as his Barons: But that in their Legislative Way, they have a farther Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, as representing a third Estate in Parliament, I say this Fancy is new; for I do not believe any before him look'd upon them as representing a third
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:94716:148"/>
Estate in Parliament: and not repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting it, I know they have been said to sit in respect of their Possessions, which are Temporal in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but not so when given <hi>Deo &amp; Ecclesiae;</hi> but that they sate in any other Quality than Spiritual Persons, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard, nor can conceive. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks if they have a Capacity to sit in the Quality of Temporal Barons, they should also have a Capacity to change their Spiritual Robes, and put on Temporal. The Constitutions of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> he saith, require their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance in Judicature as his Barons; and from thence would infer they sit in the Quality of Temporal Barons. But how doth this follow? I hope they may sit as Spiritual Barons. But when all is done, this Allegation of his is not sincere, for the words are, <hi>Debent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teresse judiciis curiae Regis sicut caeteri Barones;</hi> or, <hi>cum caeteris Baronibus;</hi> that is to say, 'tis their Duty to be present in Trials in the King's Court with the other Barons, or as the other Barons are there present; which words are far from inferring that they sit there in the Quality of Temporal
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:94716:149"/>
Barons (no more than the Judges) rather that they sit not as Barons at all, but only amongst them who are so. It is evident therefore that his first Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, drawn from the Constitutions of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> is not solid. His next <note place="margin">Gr. Qu. <hi>p.</hi> 151.</note> Suggestion, that they are a third Estate in Parliament (if by Parliament he mean their Convention in Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) from the issuing out of Writs to the Guardian of the Spiritualties in the Vacancy of the Episcopal See, I shall not contend with him; only I think it from hence plain, that they have Right to sit as Members of the Convocation properly, where, with the rest of the Brethren, they make up a third Estate, in which Writs there is generally a Clause of <hi>Praemunientes</hi> added, to shew that other Clerks are to be chosen to sit in Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for which reason the Guardians in their Vacancy have their Writs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to them, lest the Convocation should not be full. Now how this can prove them a third Estate in the Lords House, I should be glad this Author would instruct me? so that his Conceit of their sitting there in
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:94716:149"/>
a double Capacity, is of no weight, and all his Precedents cited to that purpose, might have been spared, which do not in the least measure prove that the Bishops sit in the Lords House as a third Estate; because Clerks shall be chosen to sit in Convocation, by Writs directed to the Guardians of the Spiritualties, where there are no Bishops, or when they are beyond Sea, rather evinces the necessity of a Convocation to meet in Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation as to Ecclesiastical Matters, which are only proper for their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, Let it be observed that his Quotations out of the Author of the Letter, <hi>pag.</hi> 93. as to Doctor <hi>Standish</hi> his Case, are mistaken; the Author's words are, the Judges said—<q>The Lords Spiritual have no Place in <note place="margin">7 H. 8. <hi>p.</hi> 184.</note> Parliament by reason of their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualties <hi>(in which respect, in truth their place is in Convocation)</hi> but by reason of their Temporal Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; that is, holding their Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:94716:150"/>
Possessions in nature of Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</q> The Scope of that Book is to shew that a Parliament might be held without them, who indeed were no Barons, but had liberty to sit among them by an Indulgence in respect of their Possessions. And at last, I am perswaded our Author will hardly be bound by that Opinion; for if that be true, how can they sit there as a third Estate, if their Right to sit there be only as Temporal Barons? This Authority is only from <hi>Kelway,</hi> 7 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. 184. See the Case at large in <hi>Burnet.</hi>

                        <pb n="273" facs="tcp:94716:150"/>
Our <hi>Grand Questionist</hi> goes on, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours <note place="margin">Grand Quest. <hi>p.</hi> 260.</note> to prove, and clear that intricate matter (as it hath been made) touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Interest the Clergy then had in Parliaments, as well as Convocations: but chiefly to prove, that all the Interest they had in Parliaments, was not meerly upon the account of their Temporal Baronies, which the Bishops and many of the Abbots then had; this he saith, is the great, but common mistake of the Author of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>'Tis first to be observed, that he hath not proved, that to hold Land by Baron-Service, and to be a Baron, is all one, which by me is left doubtful, as appears by what is said in the first Chapter of this Treatise. Neither see I any reason why <hi>tenere per Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roniam,</hi> should make a Baron more than <hi>Tenere per Militare Servitium,</hi> should make a Knight.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That what he now saith, is only a Pursuit of his precedent Conceit, that the Bishops sit in the Lord's House in a double Capacity, because, as he saith, there is a Distinction made, even in Parliament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the several Estates of the Clergy and Laity. How far this is argumentative, and how far his Precedents warrant what he affirms, I shall examine by and by; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the mean time, would desire him to tell me, whether they could come to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament at all without first receiving the King's Writ? and in the next place, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:94716:151"/>
the King's Writ imply any other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, than as Spiritual Persons, holding their Possessions <hi>per Servitium Baroniae,</hi> and voting among the Lords, in respect of their Lands, which are in their own nature, Temporal Estates in the Hands of Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Persons, but by their Dedication to God, made spiritual also; which is as much as can be drawn from what Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> saith in the place quoted by our Author, <hi>pag.</hi> 151. That they met as Counsellors in the <hi>Saxon</hi>'s time in their <hi>Wittena Gemot,</hi> I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but whether by virtue of any Writ, Summons, or rather by general Allowance as Counsellors, or what other way, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove: Records there are none, or very few; and Historians give but a dark ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of those Times, and things then one: but which way soever they then sate, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly by <hi>William</hi> I. their right of sitting was much altered, the Frame of things being in some measure altered also, in so much that they must now meet under such Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and no other, as were by him allowed them, which by all Men is agreed to be as Tenants to the King <hi>in Capite,</hi> for their Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, which they held in the Nature, and by the Service of Baronies. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, I see not what use he can make of the Distinction made in Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the several Estates of the Clergy and Laity. The Question is not, Whether the Clergy and Laity are distinct Estates? which no Man ever denied: but, whether the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:94716:151"/>
Bishops, distinct from the other Clergy in Convocation, be an entire third Estate in the Lord's House: that they are so, no Man hath yet proved. His Authority out of <hi>Eadmerus,</hi> speaking of what was done in Parliament in 3 <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. saith, it was done <hi>Utrius<expan>
                              <am>
                                 <g ref="char:abque"/>

                              <ex>que</ex>
                           </expan> ordinis concordi Curâ, &amp; sollicitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> by the unanimous care and trouble of both Orders, Ranks, or Degrees: Why must <hi>[Ordo]</hi> signify an Estate, rather than a Degree or Rank? Now I hope Men of different Degrees may sit together with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being different Estates. Dukes, Earls, Marquesses, Viscounts, Barons, now sit together, yet may make but one Estate. But let <hi>[Ordo]</hi> signify that Estate as he would have it, and as he thinks it doth; why must it signify an intire Estate? or what doth it more import, than that it was done by the Joint-Consent of the Lords and Commons? who might then sit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and were not at any time left out, as is sufficiently proved by Mr. <hi>Petyt. Matth. Paris</hi> his <hi>Clerus</hi> and <hi>Populus,</hi> and the other Cases by him there mentioned, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the whole Body of the Clergy and Laity met together in Parliament, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as well the Inferiour Clergy as the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, sitting in their due Ranks. All the rest of his Precedents made use of by him, seem rather to enforce that the King is not a third Estate, than that the Bishops are more than a part of a third Estate among the Lords. But this Point, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:94716:152"/>
the King be one Estate or not in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament; and how an Head can be considered as no part of the Body, I leave to others to dispute, but must rest in this undeniable Conclusion, that there can be no legal co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Power however the case stands: for as in the Body natural, nothing can be done without the concurrence of the Head: So in the Body Politick, nothing can justly be done without the concurrence of the King in matters of publick concern in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, except their Proceedings deviate <note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>I have put off the Examination of the first part of his fourth Chapter, that I might conclude this Discourse with an Answer to the Matters he there alledgeth.</p>
                     <p>He finds himself pressed with that strong Argument, drawn as well from <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> as from divers Precedents, that the Bishops were not Peers to Noble-Men, but were themselves tried by a common Jury in Matters Capital; and therefore were not of Condition to try Noble-Men, who had in themselves Inheritable Noble Blood.</p>
                     <p>To this Argument he opposes two things. First, That the matter of Fact <note place="margin">Grand Quest. <hi>p.</hi> 124.</note> cannot be made out that a Bishop hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been tried by Commoners. Secondly, That if it could, it doth not overthrow their Peerage in Parliament.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="277" facs="tcp:94716:152"/>
This second Assertion I will easily grant, if by Peerage in Parliament, be no more meant than a Community of Appellation by reason of their sitting amongst the Lords, and their Precedence in place, with some other Priviledges as to Amercia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, days of Grace, and the like. But certainly if it can be cleared, that they have of right been tried by common Juries, and that as well before, as after the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th:</hi> Nay, that they have not look'd upon the Lords in Parliament as their Peers, and proper Judges: I may then rationally conclude that they are not Peers in Parliament to that end to try, or be tried by Noble-Men there.</p>
                     <p>It is plain by all our Law-books, that out of Parliament no such Priviledg belongs to them. For first, out of Parliament, over and above the express Authority of <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> a Judg in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s time, Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> a great Judg in our time, Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> a great Lawyer, and Antiquary; <note place="margin">

Now if this be confessed to be the Law out of Parliament, let the Author give me one Example, that a Man of right ought for a like Offence to be tried by one sort of Jury out of Parliament, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in it. The Case of Appeals, under which Covert he endeavours to hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:94716:153"/>
I shall discuss anon. The Priviledg they claimed as Clerks, was common to all other Clerks as well as to them, but there are many Cases of Clerks tried in Secular Courts, and the Trial allowed to be good, to which purpose, see <hi>Cook's second Instit.</hi> 638; but never any Exception of theirs allowed of, as if those Trials were illegal. As to the Case of Bishops, and their Trials by common Juries, Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> is very clear, and gives many Examples both before, and after <hi>Hen.</hi> 8th's time, which are not so to be slighted, as this Author seems to do. That of <hi>John de Isle,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi>'s <note place="margin">Gr. Q. <hi>p.</hi> 146.</note> Brother, is full to the point; where the Bishop was arraigned, and upon Question how he would be tried, stood upon his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg as Clerk, that he was a Member of the Pope's, and therefore ought to be brought to his Answer before his Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who was there ready to demand him, affirming that he ought not to answer before a Lay-Judg; this Plea was rejected, and a day given to the Bishop, and a Jury impannelled, sworn, and tried, (which shews he had his Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge). The Jury bring in their Verdict, and find that the Bishop was not guilty of the Fellony laid to the Charge of <hi>John de Isle</hi> his Brother, and his Companions; but they find that after the Felony committed, the said Bishop knowing that these Persons had committed Felony, did receive and harbour them: upon which, a Writ was
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:94716:153"/>
directed to enquire what Goods and Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels he had, and his Person, upon request of the Arch-bishop, delivered him to be kept as it behoved him to do. Now let any Man judg whether here were not in every respect a legal proceeding. The matter of Fact tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Verdict of twelve Men: Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made concerning his Goods, Lands, and Chattels, himself (the Crime being only receiving of Felons) delivered to the Arch-bishop, either to make his Purgation, or to be kept in due manner. Was here now any Willingness in the Court to break the Law? as our Author saith, <hi>pag.</hi> 146. or not rather a perfect Observation of it. <note place="margin">Gr. Qu <hi>p.</hi> 146.</note> Is not this perfectly agreeable to what Dr. <hi>Ridley,</hi> in his view of the Civil and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Laws, saith <hi>pag.</hi> 86. <q>If a Clerk be first arrested by a Spiritual Judg, and <note place="margin">Ridley, <hi>p.</hi> 86.</note> found guilty, he shall be degraded, and delivered over to the Temporal Power. But if he be first arrested by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The Precedent of <hi>Thomas Merks</hi> Bishop of <hi>Carlisle,</hi> our Author allows to be against him: but asks whether one Precedent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Gr. Qu. <hi>p.</hi> 147.</note> the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8th, be sufficient to expound <hi>Magna Charta:</hi> for in this Case, the Immunities of the Church were conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and a Declaration by them, that their Priviledges extended not to Treason. But for a full Answer, I say first, that there are
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:94716:154"/>
more Precedents than one: but if there were not, would not one, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Opinion of all Lawyers, and Judges, be enough to prevail with a dis-interested Man, to believe that the Peers in <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the <hi>Lex Terrae,</hi> do not intend Bishops to be such Peers as are to receive their Trial by Noble-men? But what Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception can be taken to those Cases after, and in the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8th? Did he not continue the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion all his time? was it more against his Prerogative, than of any of his Predecessors? 'Tis clear enough that the Proceedings before, as well as after, were according to Law, notwithstanding the Clamour of the Clergy, as is plain by Mr. <hi>Selden.</hi>

Here you see whatever the Carriage of the Clergy was, and what-ever Judgment was given
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:94716:154"/>
against him: His Exceptions were as much against any Trial in Parliament by the Lay-Lords, as else-where. And that conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Injury they conceived done to them, was, that they should be tried in any Secular Court whatsoever. This you may see in <hi>Du Fresnes Glossary Verbo (Par.)</hi> The Trial he required was, <hi>per Episcopos Pares suos,</hi> By the Bishops his Peers. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears also by the Complaint of the Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> that he was brought to be tried <hi>coram Laico Iudice,</hi> before a Secular Judg. By this our Author's Mistake may appear, who saith, <hi>pag.</hi> 144. That they look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Gr.

Neither did they look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves under the same Condition that Lay-Men were; but being a distinct Body a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves, thought it reasonable to be judged by themselves only, and in their own Courts: an Innovation the Law ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver allowed, or gave any Countenance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. I confess, I cannot but wonder that any one Person, of how great Parts soever, should go about to contradict the Opinion of very many learned Judges, who have all asserted the contrary, to wit, that Bishops
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:94716:155"/>
ought to be tried by Commoners; and no one Lawyer of any note, that I know of, hath hitherto maintained the contrary. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks those of the Long-Robe should be tender in opposing the Judgments of <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Cook, Doddridg,</hi> and <hi>Selden,</hi> except their Opinions were back'd by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Judges equal in Ability and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to those before named.</p>
                     <p>Having thus cleared the Precedents ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> and others, from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of this Author; let us now see what is alledged by him to prove that it was not always so, but that sometimes they were tried by the Noble-Men as their Peers in Parliament. And to that purpose he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the Case of <hi>Stratford</hi> Arch-bishop of Canterbury, out of Arch-bishop <hi>Parker's Antiq. Ecclesiae Britan.</hi> who tells you that <hi>Stratford</hi> was at the King's Suit accused of Capital Crimes in the Exchequer, that he <note place="margin">Gr. Qu. <hi>p.</hi> 126.</note> put himself upon his Trial in Parliament; that a Parliament was called, and he, after some Opposition, admitted into the House; and there, as our Author saith, put himself upon the Trial of his Peers: this it seems is the Relation of <hi>Matth. Parker.</hi> (By the way, whom he meant by his Peers, doth not yet appear) whether the Clergy only, or the Lay-Lords.</p>
                     <p>But let us have recourse to the Record, as it is abridged by Sir <hi>Robert Cotton,</hi> 15 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Numb.</hi> 8. <note place="margin">15. E. 3. <hi>N.</hi> 8</note>

The same day the King came into St. <hi>Edward</hi>'s Chamber, commonly called the Chamber <hi>de Pinct,</hi> (the painted Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) before whom, all the Lords and Commons, the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> humbled himself, and required his Favour, which he granted. Afterwards the Arch-bishop desired that where he was defamed through the Realm, he might be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned in open Parliament before his Peers: probably by his Peers, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the Bishops, as others had done, and not the Lay-Lords: Besides, this seems to be a Desire of his at a Conference before the King and Lords; for it was in the painted Chamber, whereas the Commons usually sate in the great Refectory, now called <hi>Westminster-Hall.</hi> Let us observe the King's Answer, which was, that he would attend the common Affairs, and after hear others; where we see the King did not grant his Desire, but gave only a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory Answer. Lastly, it doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that he was ever arraigned in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for the Record saith, <hi>Numb.</hi> 49. And it is to be remembred, that all things touching the Arraignment of the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> should remain with Sir <hi>William de Kedelsby,</hi> Keeper of the Privy-Seal. By which it is evident, that these things were not then put into the Hands of Sir <hi>William de Kedelsby,</hi> but to remain there, where probably they were before, and were only some Papers relating to
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:94716:156"/>
what was before done in the Chequer; for I find no Arraignment recorded about that time. Two Yearsafter, <hi>viz.</hi> 17 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. All the Proceedings against the Arch-bishop were cancelled by order from the King; so that nothing appears to have been done against him to any purpose, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Parliament, or else-where.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, there was a continuance of the Parliament in 15<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, from day to day, for a Week, about the Trial of Noble-Men, that they should not be put to answer, but in open Parliament by their Peers, to which purpose, there are named four Bishops, four Earls, and four Barons as a Committee to draw up the Plot.</p>
                     <p>These Persons being in their Device, assigned, as hereafter doth ensue. Under the Name of which Peers, they bring in the Chancellour, and Treasurer, and such like Officers, and that all Estates should enjoy their Liberties, 15 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>N.</hi> 6, 7, 8. Here was indeed a Matter concerning Trials of Noble-Men had under Consideration, but never reduced to any Law, as the Practice of subsequent Times, and the late Bill of the Lords about Trials, do enough mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest.</p>
                     <p>But doth it not appear by this Record, that the Bishops, were not reckoned Nobles of the Land, when he finds the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and Treasurer, and such like Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, attempted to be brought in at that time, and so not to have had any Right
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:94716:156"/>
before? But saith our Author, it after fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that they may not lose their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralities, Lands, Goods, and Chattels. Now none were capable to lose their Temporalities but Bishops, therefore this Law must have respect to them, as well as other Nobles of the Land.</p>
                     <p>The Answer to this is very easy, that the Clergy, who had then all Power, did endeavour to bring in their Fellows the other great Officers, who were almost all Church-men. <hi>Simon Langham</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> was Chancellour, <hi>William Molso</hi> Dean of St. <hi>Martins le Grand,</hi> Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and Keeper of the Kings Treasure and Jewels, with many others, as you may find <hi>Baker,</hi> p. 141. These had Temporalities to lose, and such Officers, the Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways hoped to have had of their own Tribe; but, as I said before, of this At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt came no other Effect than to shew their aspiring Thoughts. And whatever Opinion the Author of the <hi>Iurisdiction of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gr. Qu. <hi>p.</hi> 128.</note> 
                        <hi>the House of Peers,</hi> is of, as to the Roll of 4 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. I believe the Law at this day will not be so taken, that a Chancellour being no Peer, shall be so tried by reason of his Office. I am sure, my Lord Keeper <hi>Bridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> being no Peer, never voted in the House of Lords, and the present Lord Chancellour, when he gives his Vote, goes to his place as a Baron. See <hi>Hakewell,</hi> p. 114. Ancient Customs, how these great Officers are placed in Parliament when
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:94716:157"/>
they are Peers, and when not; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if their placing be different, their Trials ought to be so too. Neither can it seem reasonable to any considerate Man, that a Person, though such an Officer, should not be capacited to give his Vote as a Baron, and yet by virtue of his Office, should be tried by Noble-Men. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I must take leave to deny what he affirms, that they are Peers by virtue of their Office, or that they have Right to be present in Parliament in all Cases of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, so as to concur in Sentence with the Nobles of the Land, as our Author affirms, <hi>pag.</hi> 132. The King may make <note place="margin">Gr. Qu: <hi>p.</hi> 132.</note> whom he pleases Chancellour, and the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute assigns his Place, but he cannot vote there without the King's Letters Patents to that purpose, as I conceive: See <hi>Old Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, Hakewell,</hi> p. 14.</p>
                     <p>I have in the first Chapter of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise spoken largely to that Point, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in what sense a Bishop may be called, <hi>Peer of the Realm.</hi> And <hi>pag.</hi> 90, and 91. have handled the matter of Proxies, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may pass over the Case of Arch-bishop <hi>Arundel,</hi> which our Author proposes, <hi>pag.</hi> 128.</p>
                     <p>To the Case of <hi>William de la Pool,</hi> I have spoken before, only shall here observe, that the submitting his Cause to the King, was no waver of his Peerage, for the matter never came to any formal Issue; consider th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This was no Waver of any Legal Trial by his Peers, nor any disrespect to the Lords, who might otherwise have ordered the summoning a Jury to try the Fact, but by the King's Pardon that labour was saved.</p>
                     <p>The like may be taken notice of in that famous Case between the Earl of <hi>Hereford</hi> and <hi>Essex,</hi> against the Earl of <hi>Glovester</hi> and <hi>Hertford,</hi> in 20 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. <hi>Riley</hi> p. 74.

The King, for Remedy of this, appoints the Bishop of <hi>Ely, William</hi> of <hi>Valence</hi> his Uncle, <hi>Iohn Mettingham,</hi> and <hi>Robert Hertford,</hi> to hear the Complaints of the said Earl, and also the Answer of the said Earl of <hi>Glocester,</hi> and his Servants, to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the Earl of <hi>Hereford,</hi> and to sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon a Jury for the Trial of the same, and also commanded <hi>Robert Tiptoft, Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciario suo de Westwell,</hi> to be there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and to summon the said Delinquents to be before the said Commissioners, and that Enquiry should be made <hi>per Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum tam Magnatnm, quam aliorum proborum Hominum, &amp; Legalium de partibus Walliae,</hi>

                     <p>In this Record there are many things Observable; First, The Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> here mentioned, was not a Judg in this Case between the two Earls, but joyned in Commission with others, who were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to summon a Jury to enquire of the matter of Fact, not to condemn either Party, but was only in the nature of an Inquest, or Grand-Jury, in order to a Trial. 2. That Noble-Men <hi>[Magnates]</hi> such as refused to take an Oath, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned of the Jury. 3. That the Verdict was given in to the Commissioners, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding some of the Jury were not sworn. 4. That the Jury was summoned out of several Counties, <hi>viz. Glocestershire</hi>
                        <pb n="189" facs="tcp:94716:158"/>
and <hi>Wales.</hi> Lastly, and that for which I have chiefly produced it, that this Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of both Parties to the King was no waver of their Peerage. Neither doth it appear, that this Award made by the King with the Consent of those Prelates, Earls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was made in Parliament, tho it be <hi>inter Placita Parliamentaria,</hi> but only by such private Counsellours as the King thought fit to make use of in that Affair. That it was no Parliamentary Judgment; is evident from these two Reasons: First, The putting themselves to the Reference of the King, was no putting themselves upon any Trial by their Peers, because that should have been done only by the Earl of <hi>Gloster,</hi> against whom the Bill was found; whereas here the Reference is made by both, <note n="b" place="margin">The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son I conceive why the Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the King, was made by them both, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings could be in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </gap> returned upon Oath, and so in it self null:</note> and to the Kingalone. Next we find the King here was present with the rest, which was not usual; if the Lords had proceeded judicially wherever the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was heard, whether in Parliament, or else-where. Besides, it is observable that the word <hi>Consilium,</hi> is twice written with an <hi>[s];</hi> whereas, if it had been a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the word would have been written with a <hi>[c],</hi> as was generally observed by the Writers of those Times. In Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, this Record makes nothing either to the Bishops Power of judging in Criminal Cases, or that Submission of a matter to the King should be a waver of Peerage, but was a making the King an Arbitrator,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:94716:159"/>
for they knew the Verdict was void, being not upon Oath.</p>
                     <p>I have before denied that such Persons as sate in the Lord's House by virtue of their Office, had any Right to be tried by Noble-Men, except they had an inherita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Right of their own, as well as their Office. I am not therefore concerned to examine as to Predial Feudal, or Personal Right, what is urged by our Author, or <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Disc.</hi> of Peer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, <hi>p.</hi> 4. Gr. Qu. <hi>p.</hi> 132.</note> any other, because I have throughout this Discourse, maintained that no Man can have any Priviledg, or Right of Trial, but according to the nature of his Peerage, which seems to me, not only reasonable, but within the plain meaning of <hi>Magna Charta:</hi> that the Triers and Party tried, ought to be of the same Condition, and capable to undergo the same Penalties in like Case. That what the Discourser hath said as to the Regradation of their Peer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age when their Office shall be taken away, means no more, than that Officers shall no longer sit among the Peers, not that they had any Right of Peerage during the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance thereof, tho they were placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them by a particular Law, or Usage. Neither is our Author's Reason of any force, that because Persons enobled in Blood in a Forreign Country, shall not try <note place="margin">Gr. Qu. <hi>p.</hi> 134.</note> a Peer of <hi>England;</hi> therefore the Parity is not of Blood, but of Priviledg in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For he cannot but know that all Laws are originally made for the benefit
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:94716:159"/>
of those who are born subject to them, or adopted into them by Naturalization, and such shall have the full benefit of all things appliable to their <hi>English</hi> Condition, as if they were natural born-Subjects. Others that are Strangers, tho of equal, or greater Quality, shall not enjoy the Rights invested in the Natives by their Birth, but only the Protection, and Priviledge of the Laws of that Country where they are, during their abode there.</p>
                     <p>Another Argument is drawn by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor from the Proceedings in Cases of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal against a Noble-Man at the Suit of the Party: He argues thus. If in Appeal of Murther, or the like, at the suit of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a Noble-Man shall be tried by a Jury of good Free-holders, then their Exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from being always so tried, proceeds from their sitting in Parliament, and not from Nobility of Blood, and therefore all those who have Right to sit in that House, have Right to the same Priviledg: But the Bishops have Right to sit in the same House, and are called Barons, therefore they ought to enjoy the same Priviledge other Barons have.</p>
                     <p>This Argument, how specious soever it may appear, is unconclusive in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects. First, It doth not follow, that those that have Priviledg to sit in the same House, have the same Priviledges to all Intents, and Purposes. My Lords the Judges, and all Justices of the Peace, sit
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:94716:160"/>
upon the same Bench, and by the same Commission, yet are not equal in all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances. Nay; my Lords the Bishops themselves, though they are of the same Order and Quality, yet are not equal in Priviledges. I have before shewed that there were <hi>Barones Minores,</hi> who were not properly Barons, but so called, and might be left out at the King's Pleasure: But such as are enobled in Blood may demand their Writs, which the <hi>Barones Minores</hi> could not. And if now the Bishops have that Right (which is not certain) it is because they are to summon the Clergy, without which the Parliament would not be compleat as to the Convocation. And were it not for that Reason, the Bishops might be now wholly left out, for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only Barons by Tenure, cannot be in any other Rank than were the <hi>Barones Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nores,</hi> who were left out at the King's Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. I have before asserted, they hold their Possessions, <hi>per Servitium Baroniae,</hi> as a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, not Honour to them; and their sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting among the Lords was only indulged to the Dignity of their Function as Bishops, they being indeed no more than Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Neither secondly, doth it any way follow, that because Peers in some Cases shall be tried by a Common Jury, therefore those who are properly Commoners, and only pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged to sit among the Lords, should par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of the same Honour with them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="193" facs="tcp:94716:160"/>
To examine farther into the Reason, why in all Criminal Cases at the Suit of the King, the Trial shall be by Peers, not so in an Appeal for the same Crime, Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> will tell you, One reason is because the Trial, if it ought to be so, must be before a Lord Steward, and no Appeal can be brought before a Lord Steward, who is but only Temporary, but ought to be brought before the Judges in the King's ordinary Courts of Justice. We are likewise fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to consider, that Inequality of Persons, is not of the Law of Nature, but of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Constitution; and that the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> is but a Confirmation of our ancient Rights, in which all Subjects were <hi>Pares.</hi> But since it is apparent, that ever since <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and perhaps long before, the Trials at the Suit of the Party have been as they now are: we must look upon them as a Branch of the common Law of <hi>England,</hi> never taken away from the Commoners; but that the King, and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-Men, as to what concerned the Crown, were contented to introduce that manner of Trial as to the Nobles, and long use and Custom hath now made it to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as the Law of <hi>England;</hi> yet the poor Commoner never received that way of Trial as to his own Right, who look'd upon the Verdict of twelve substantial Men of his Neighbourhood, as much better Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for them and their Heirs, than a Trial upon Honour: When upon their Appeal
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:94716:161"/>
it would always have been in the Power of the King to name again the same Lords for Triers, which they had before, and by that means defeat them of the benefit of their Appeal, to which the Law gives so great respect, that upon an Appeal brought, all Proceedings at the King's Suit should (as has been taken for Law) stay till the Appeal were determined, because a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular wrong to a private Person in the Murther of an Husband, or very near Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is of greater Consideration to the Party, than the general loss of a Subject is to the King.</p>
                     <p>I shall not pursue this Author in his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression touching the ground, and reason <note place="margin">Gr. Qu. <hi>p.</hi> 135.</note> of the Trial by Peers, since our Question is not, what the Law may be in other Countries; but what the Practice of our own is, and of what sort of People those Peers are to be composed. That is to say, Whether the Jury for the Trial of Bishops shall be composed of Noble-Men, or of Commoners?

A shrewd Objection I take it this is! for every one ought to be credited in his own Art, and 'tis ten to one the Generality of the Lawyers are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the right, than Strangers to the Profession, or Lawyers of a lower Rank, than those great Masters have been. But
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:94716:161"/>
that he may say something, he tells you <note place="margin">Gr.

What then? doth this Omission supersede those Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents laid down by him in that <hi>Rapsody,</hi> as he calls it, which was as much his as the other? The leaving out that Passage might be a Neglect in the Printer: I am sure, 'tis no Retractation of what he had said before. Neither need I tell this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, how Books come sometimes to be corrupted. Secondly, He saith, some things <note place="margin">Gr.

                     </p>
                     <p>I have at last examined all the parts of this elaborate Treatise, in which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath endeavoured with all Art and Industry imaginable, to support a declining Cause. I have not to my Knowledg, left any Argument unconsidered, which hath been thought material by this Writer to be urged in defence of that Cause, the Maintenance whereof he had undertaken. I have been longer I confess, in this Discourse than at first I thought to have been, but this must be attributed to the Subtilty of my Adversary, who by learned Digressions, and cunning Insinuations, hath indeed clouded the Truth, and rendered it less visible to the Eyes of common Readers.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding, what I have said, if this Drudgery of being present as Judges in Criminal Cases, or in the Trials of Noble-Men in Parliament, be the Right of the Lords Spiritual in Parliament: If the Embassadours of Christ, the Messengers of Peace, and the Preachers of Mercy and Reconciliation to God in Christ, have more mind to be Executioners of God's strange Work, than in what he delights? If they delight rather to make Wounds, than to bind them up, let them enjoy that Burthen
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:94716:163"/>
according to their Desire. But their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to it hitherto, have been ineffectual, and of late, all Power of Judicature in Cases of Blood, hath been denied them in several Parliaments by both Houses. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath this Author been yet so happy, as to have produced any one clear Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, where they have been present at the Trial, and have given Votes for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittal, or Condemnation of any Noble-Man brought to Judgment in Parliament in Cases of Blood: Or that any of their Order have been in such Cases tried by Noble-Men, or indeed have desired to be so tried.</p>
                     <p>Certainly this Nation, together with the most of other Christians in <hi>Europe,</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved under the Papal Communion till the times of Reformation; and therefore the Bishops here cannot reasonably be supposed to have enjoyed Priviledges different, or greater than those enjoyed by their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in other Places, where they had the greatest, as well Power, as Honour. But I think I may with Confidence affirm they were no where allowed to sit Inquisitors of Blood, and not only to debate, but at their Pleasure to give Sentence in such Cases as Secular Persons in Secular Courts. I very well remember that in the Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun here, 1640, it was at the beginning thereof hotly debated in the Lords House, whether any Bishop might be so much as of a Committee in any Parliamentary
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:94716:163"/>
Examination in the Case of my Lord <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> because it was a Case of Blood, in which, by Law they ought not to meddle; the Debate was put off; and the Bishops were willing to absent themselves accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Opinion of one of their own Body, and agreeable to the Practice and Usage of the Kingdom, being only allowed by the Lords to enter a Protestation, saving their Rights in that, and other Cases. Now this very Question seems to me an over-ruling ours: for if it were then a Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whether they might be of a Committee in Cases of Blood, where the Judges were often joyned with the Lords, it can be no doubt, but that they ought not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to give their Votes as Judges in the like Cases in their Persons.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>SInce Dr. <hi>Brady</hi> received a Reply, two of my Brethren of the Gown, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> both of <hi>Greys-Inn,</hi> have appeared in print, in behalf of the King's <hi>Tenants in Capite,</hi> and will needs have it that these ingrost the Right of coming to <hi>Parliament,</hi> as one calls it, or the <hi>Magnum Concilium,</hi> as the other, till 49 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>One professes that he never read what <note place="margin">Antid. Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. <hi>p.</hi> 56.</note> has been wrote upon this Subject either by Mr. <hi>Petyt</hi> or me.</p>
                  <p>The other slights it all, as a Dispute not worth the Cost and Pains spent about it; <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> p. 156.</note> and grants many of Dr. <hi>Brady</hi>'s <hi>Hypotheses,</hi> but denies his Consequences, and so allows him to be a good Antiquary, but an ill Logician.</p>

That there was a <hi>Curia Regis,</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Council of the Tenants in Chief</hi> (such especially as held of the King by <hi>Knights Service)</hi> distinct from the <hi>Great Council</hi> of the Nation, or <hi>Parliament:</hi> In which <hi>Curia,</hi>

                     <hi>Knights Service</hi> never met in any <hi>Council</hi> or <hi>Court,</hi> but thereby it became the <hi>General Council</hi> of the Nation, or <hi>Parliament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which, since he is opposed by these two learned Authors, agreeing with me, they have given so much Credit to my No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they have prevented that fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trouble; which I might have given the inquisitive World upon that point.</p>
                  <p>If I can free my self from the force of these Gentlemens Arguments, or Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon those things wherein I differ from them, I think I need not fear the empty Thunder of Men of other Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but may look upon my Notions as sufficiently established.</p>
                  <p>Both Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> are Men of much longer standing, and greater natural and acquired Parts, then I can pretend to; yet if I have the good fortune to fall into the Paths of ancient Truth, no modern Authorities ought to beat me out of them. They both will have it, that the <hi>Tenants in Chief</hi> were the only Members of the <hi>Curia</hi>

                     <hi>Regis,</hi> which was held for Matters within the King's ordinary Power, and of the <hi>Magnum Concilium,</hi> or <hi>Parliament,</hi> where the extraordinary Power was exercised. Against them both, before I examine their supposed grounds from Authority, this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Objection in reason may be urged.</p>
                  <p>If all the <hi>Tenants in Capite by Knights Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> were obliged to attend in the <hi>Curiâ,</hi> either by virtue of their Tenure as <note n="a" place="margin">Ant.

Can a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Summons, and notice of <hi>Arduous Affairs,</hi> which is Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi>'s Notion, lay <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> p. 150.</note> a greater Obligation upon them to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, who, however, were bound to come?

Indeed Dr. <hi>Brady,</hi> who will have it that every full Confluence of the <hi>Tenants in Chief</hi> by Knights Service to Counsel, was a <hi>General Council</hi> of the Nation; supposes that even before King
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:94716:167"/>
                     <hi>John's Charter,</hi> and while he thinks that they were to come to <hi>Parliament ex More,</hi> without Summons, if but a few appeared, it was no <hi>General Council:</hi> which is an absurd Supposal, unless there was before that a Law in being, that they should not act without a certain number, as supposing that forty were to make a full House, as now 'tis said to be with the Commons; for otherwise they who did appear, did, according to the general Rule of making Laws, bind them who were absent through their own default.</p>
                  <p>But if we consider how contrary it was to the Usage of those Times, to make Laws, or insert Clauses, or Words, idle or unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, we shall not easily believe that they would, according to Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi>'s Supposal, have made Provision for the particular summoning of those for <hi>arduous Affairs,</hi> who were obliged to attend at the <hi>Council</hi> without such Summons. Indeed I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that Dr. <hi>Brady</hi> hath charged me with putting such a sense upon <hi>King John's Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> as would imply a needless Provision.</p>
                  <p>The Doctor tells us that by <hi>King John's Charter</hi> the Cause of Summons was to be exprest, and from thence he would infer that it was a <hi>Great Council</hi> there inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; for, saith he, such Provision <hi>were needless if there had been but one Cause for which they were to be summoned,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dr</hi> Brady <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi> Jani Angl. <hi>p.</hi> 30.</note> which he urges as the Consequence of my interpreting that Summons there provided
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:94716:167"/>
for, to have been only for raising such Aids in the <hi>Curia</hi> as could be imposed upon the King's immediate Tenants; and none else. Now admit that this had been to a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and had taken in all manner of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to be laid upon the Subject, if the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of <hi>Taxes</hi> were the only work of a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> the providing that they should have notice when a <hi>Tax</hi> had been required, would have been as impertinent; and if the <hi>Parliament</hi> had any other Power, this Provision had been as defective as he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses 'twas, according to my rendring, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous.</p>
                  <p>For that Summons mentioned in <hi>King John's Charter,</hi> is restrained, and limited to the granting of <hi>Aids,</hi> but there is not one word, or syllable of making, or enacting Laws, which is the main business of <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments,</hi> and therefore this must be intended of some Inferiour Counsel, and not of the <hi>General Council</hi> of the Kingdom. But if the <hi>Charter</hi> be taken to be meant only of raising such <hi>Aids</hi> as lay upon none but the <hi>King's Tenants,</hi> if those <hi>Aids</hi> branch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into <hi>Escuage</hi> and <hi>Tallage,</hi> here were two Causes of Summons, as the one or the other was required; or if only such <hi>Aid</hi> as <hi>Escuage</hi> was within the Provision, still the Cause or the Occasion of raising the <hi>Escuage</hi> might be different; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the cause of Summons more than one; nay some might have been obliged to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon one Cause of Summons exprest,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:94716:168"/>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> who was the first Author of a Lawyer that ran Counter to me, makes a distinction between a <hi>Parliament</hi> and a <hi>Curia Regis,</hi> which I conceive to be without any difference in Relation to the several Powers of the <hi>Curia,</hi> and the <hi>Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> of the Nation, except that 'twas less in

                        </gap>as,</hi> or <hi>And</hi> joyned with it, can be <hi>expositive</hi> of those other words.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore the Assertion that <hi>And</hi> may be used <hi>exegetically</hi> stands naked by it self, without any colourable Cover or Support; and I would gladly see at least some Colour for the Belief, that the <hi>Conjunction And,</hi> was ever used as <hi>expositive,</hi> or <hi>exegetical</hi> of any word or words foregoing; Indeed when 'tis <hi>Husband and Wife,</hi> they may notional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be the same in Affections and Desires, and become one Flesh, as Body and Soul make one Man: But I think no Man will say that the Wife is exegetical of the Husband, and is no more than what was mentioned before
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:94716:171"/>
when the Husband was named, nor will any but such as believe the Mortality of the Soul, and that 'tis nothing else but the Temperament of the Body, or its animal Spirits, suppose the Soul and Body to be the same; indeed if they were, the Body ought to stand by it self, without mention of the Soul with a <hi>distinctive And.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Till some one Instance can be produced, in which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> can make it out to the common reason of Mankind, that <hi>And</hi> ought to be used otherwise than as <hi>intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of something not expresly mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> he must give me leave to think that in the matter of our Dispute <hi>And</hi> is <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily introductive of some other Persons.</hi> But according to the Rule of making <hi>And exege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,</hi> where 'tis expressed in the Instance given in the Record 48 <hi>H.</hi> 3. <hi>Si videatur Communitati Praelaturum &amp; Baronum, Et</hi> must by plain Consequence be <hi>exegetical</hi> of the <hi>Praelati;</hi> and so the <hi>Barons</hi> were only the <hi>Community</hi> of, or all, the <hi>Praelates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I take it to be obvious that <hi>And</hi> of it self can never be <hi>expositive:</hi> the question then will be, what may or ought to be the Exposition of words, which singly taken, are of more general, or more restrained Senses, and how far they may or ought to be enlarged or restrained, according to their Position, or according to the nature of the words which are used along with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="215" facs="tcp:94716:171"/>
And in my Opinion, it is contrary to the Laws of Interpretation, that a word used in a general Sense, and as comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding others, should explain those others particularly set down, as that <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas</hi> which here Mr. <hi>W.</hi> would have taken in a general sense, as not confined to one Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, should explain what is meant by <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, Peers,</hi> and <hi>Barons,</hi> before particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized: on the other side, words of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular explicit meaning, coming before or after, one of more general import, shall explain and restrain the general Sense. Thus <hi>Praelatorum &amp; Baronum,</hi> either before or after <hi>Communitar,</hi> restrain that word <hi>Communitas</hi> to the <hi>Community of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and Barons;</hi> and I dare say, no one Record can be shewn of the times, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or after the <hi>49th</hi> of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. which will warrant a contrary Exposition of such Words. And indeed there has no Reason been pretended why <hi>Communitas</hi> or <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulus,</hi> joyned to some Orders of Men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, should be the same with what went before, but what is a manifest beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Question, and supposing that the <hi>Commons</hi> were not present in the General Councils at the Times the Records mention, and therefore that the word <hi>Communitas</hi> or <hi>Populus</hi> was superfluous, and referred to what was sufficiently exprest before, was <hi>comprehensive</hi> of the foregoing Particulars, as Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> will have it: this illogical <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titio</hi>

through all Doctor <hi>Brady</hi>'s Writings.</p>
                  <p>But let us a little observe the pennings of Records, which may give Light to this matter; you shall there find words of a restrained Sense, following one of more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, to be <hi>exegetical</hi> or <hi>explanatory</hi> of the general, as the <hi>Peers, Earls,</hi> and <hi>Barons;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rot. <hi>Parl.</hi> 4. E. 3. <hi>N.</hi> 3. les Piers Counts &amp; Barons.</note> there <hi>Earls</hi> and <hi>Barons</hi> denote what <hi>Peers</hi> are meant, because there might have been <hi>Bannerets,</hi> an inferiour Order of <hi>Peers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then you shall find words of a limited Sense going before to be restrictive of a word following, which otherwise would have had a more general Sense, as <hi>Earls</hi> and <hi>Barons</hi> [the <hi>Peers]</hi> there the <hi>Earls</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Counts &amp; Barons les Piers, 4 <hi>E.</hi> 2. <hi>Rot. Parl.</hi>
                     </note> and <hi>Barons</hi> are the only <hi>Peers:</hi> But where 'tis <hi>Earls, Barons and Peers,</hi> there neither the first nor the last words can be <hi>exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> because <hi>And</hi> severs them, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently makes them to be of different Senses; wherefore <hi>And</hi> is <hi>necessarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductive of other Persons;</hi> and the word <hi>Peers,</hi> which without <hi>And</hi> might have been a <hi>Genus</hi> to the several Species of <hi>Earls</hi> and <hi>Barons,</hi> must needs be an Inferiour <hi>Species</hi> under a <hi>Genus</hi> not there mentioned. But still <hi>Peers</hi> could not have explained the <hi>Earls</hi> and <hi>Barons,</hi> but <hi>Earls</hi> and <hi>Barons</hi> would be <hi>expositive</hi> of <hi>Peers,</hi> which is more comprehensive in its Signification.</p>
                  <p>And thus where 'tis <hi>Communitas Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latorum &amp; Baronum, Communitas</hi> is the <hi>Genus</hi> to these two <hi>Species,</hi> and the more particular words restrain the <hi>Communitas</hi>

to them; wherefore 'tis the whole Body of the <hi>Prelates</hi> and <hi>Barons,</hi> and none else; but where it is <hi>Praelati, Comites, Barones, &amp; Populus,</hi> or <hi>&amp; Communitas,</hi> there the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulus</hi> or <hi>Communitas</hi> must be inferiour to the rest particularly mentioned, being there is a descent from the higher Orders still to the lower; if they begin at the bottom, they end with the highest, at least that which is added at the last, must be something distinct, or different from, or not paticularly exprest in what went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which is enough for my purpose.

Now what Man of common Sense can believe that the <hi>Clerus &amp; Populus cotius Regni,</hi> after the <hi>Comites, &amp; Barones</hi> 5 <hi>Io.</hi> the <hi>Commune de la terre,</hi> after the <hi>Peers;</hi> 9. <hi>Hon.</hi> 3. and <hi>tout le Eomminalty de la terre,</hi> after Countees and Barons, 3 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. were no more than the <hi>Prelates, Earls</hi> and <hi>Barons;</hi> indeed there being no <hi>Et</hi> between <hi>Baronum</hi> and <hi>Cleri,</hi> 5 <hi>Io.</hi> were it not for other Records explanatory of the like, there might be some Colour for Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi>'s supposal that <hi>Eleri &amp; Populi</hi> were only <hi>comprehensive</hi> of the Orders foregoing, and might be in the same sense with <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas Archiepiscoporum, Episcoporum, Comitum, &amp; Baronum.</hi> But for the penning of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, both Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> and Mr. <hi>W.</hi> know better, than to think the Clerks in those times stuffed them with Tautologies.

                  <p>But admit that my Interpretation of Records is generally erroneous; yet 'tis manifest that the Record which is cited and insisted on to warrant the contrary, shews that there were other Persons at the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council</hi> of the Kingdom besides <hi>Prelates, Earls</hi> and <hi>Barons,</hi> and that these were such as are now called <hi>Commons.</hi>

2. In this Parliament 48 <hi>H.</hi> 3. there was a particular matter referred by the King, and that in a <hi>full Parliament</hi> of <hi>Prelates, Peers,</hi> or <hi>Barons, and also the Commons,</hi> to the Disposition and Management of the <hi>Prelates</hi> and <hi>Barons</hi> only; and surely 'twas no great thing for them to be empowered to remove, or put in Electors of the King's standing Counsel, which was all that was referred to them, without consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Commons</hi> upon every occasion. But I cannot discern the least Consequence that because the word <hi>Communitas,</hi> doth many times extend to the <hi>Prelates</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,</hi> which, as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> rightly observes, it doth; that therefore it must be limited to them, and extend no further, whatever words come between. And I would thank <note place="margin">Both Mr <hi>W.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> argue this may: <hi>Vid.</hi> Mr. <hi>H. p.</hi> 152.</note> him that should satisfy my reason how it is possible it should be confin'd to them, when there comes <hi>and,</hi> or <hi>and also</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it farther.</p>
                  <p>If Mr. <hi>Hunt.</hi> had observed how distinctly all the <hi>Orders of Parliament</hi> are mentioned in this Record, <hi>viz. Praelati &amp; Proceres om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; Communitas Regni Angliae,</hi> and again, <hi>Praelati, Barones, ac etiam Communitas,</hi> and had further observed how full and clear the Evidence is, that all of them together re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, or consented to the King's referring the matter before taken notice of, to the Earls and Barons only, or to the <hi>Community</hi> or <hi>Generality</hi> of them, (from whom another <hi>Community,</hi> the <hi>Communitas Regni Angliae</hi>

then and there present, was sufficiently distinguish'd in other parts of the Record) and that that Affair was to be managed <hi>per Consilium Praelatorum, &amp; Baronum,</hi> he would never have insisted upon this as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration that <hi>Communitas Regni An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliae,</hi> after <hi>Praelati &amp; Proceres omnes,</hi> nay, tho with an <hi>ac etiam,</hi> has no other Sense than <hi>Commune Concilium Regni,</hi> and was <hi>as a comprehensive Term of those that made it,</hi>

                  <list>
                     <item>(1.) As to the matter in Issue, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to what our Government was before the <hi>49th</hi> of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3.</item>
                     <item>(2.) As to the manner of summoning the <hi>Parliament,</hi> or <hi>General Council of the Kingdom,</hi> and the <hi>Curia,</hi> whereby he thinks he is able to distinguish the one from the other.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I shall shew the Erroniousness of some Suppositions which may have contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi>'s belief, that the <hi>Tenants in Chief</hi> were the only Members of the <hi>Parliament</hi> till the <hi>49th Hen.</hi> 3. Or that <hi>Tenants in Capite only,</hi> constituted both
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:94716:178"/>
the <hi>Curia</hi> and the <hi>Parliament,</hi> according to the fancied different Summons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I shall shew that he himself, in effect, grants that more than <hi>Tenants in Chief</hi> had right to come to the <hi>Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> of the Nation, in which the Nation's Rights were involved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That even according to his own Notion of <hi>Tenure in Capite,</hi> all <hi>Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Land,</hi> as such, had, till the <hi>49th</hi> of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. right to come to the <hi>General Council</hi> of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fiftly,</hi> That whereas he would set aside the Question of what the Government was till the <hi>49th</hi> of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. as <hi>impertinent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <list>
                     <item>(1.) His own Notion, by which he would supplant the Labours of others, destroy's it self, while mine maintains what he aims at.</item>
                     <item>(2.) He puts such matter in issue for asserting the present Government, as can never be maintained.</item>
                     <item>(3.) He yields so much of the Fact a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, as sets aside the whole Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his <hi>Postscript.</hi> And yet,</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Admit he answers all Objections against his <hi>Postscript,</hi> the Grounds which I go upon are of the most general use.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) The first of his Mistakes, which I cannot but animadvert on, seems to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; for he renders the matter of late put in <note place="margin">Mistakes.</note> Issue, as to what our Government was before the <hi>49th</hi> of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. to be whether the Counties in all this time had their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:94716:179"/>
in <hi>Parliament</hi> by the Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> p. 155.</note> of a Choice? and, as if our Government was according to the Concessions of them who have lately appeared in the defence of it, <hi>to take it's fate</hi> upon this Issue, <hi>viz. Whether our present House of Commons, in the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 154.</note> 
                     <hi>same form as it is now constituted, was not in being ever after the Conquest?</hi> and as if we should yeild, that otherwise it were <hi>no essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of our Government.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I must confess, according to his Insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, that whoever puts it upon this point, <hi>betrayeth the Cause of the Government,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> p. 154.</note> but he would do well to name the Man who has done this Disservice.</p>
                  <p>This I must confess I have insisted upon, that <hi>Proprietors of Land, as such,</hi> without consideration of <hi>Tenure,</hi> or <hi>collated Dignity,</hi> have from the time of <hi>William</hi> the first, downwards to the <hi>49th</hi> of <hi>H.</hi> 3. enjoyed a Right of coming to the <hi>Great Councils of the Kingdom,</hi> and could not be bound by any Laws to which they had not consented either in Person, or by Representation, yielded to sometimes before, but not set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led till the <hi>49th</hi> of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>And Mr. <hi>Petyt</hi> hath satisfied Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> p. 151, &amp; 179.</note> himself, that the <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Boroughs</hi> were represented in <hi>Parliament</hi> from time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the account of Records or History.</p>
                  <p>But this I desire may be considered, that admit there were no Representation of the <hi>Free-holders of the Counties</hi> settled at any time within the Reign of <hi>Hen.</hi> III, or in
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:94716:179"/>
any other King's Reignnow appearing; and farther, that it cannot be shewn, that such <hi>Free-holders</hi> ever came to the <hi>General Councils of the Kingdom</hi> in their own perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Interest; yet however, if it appear that such as are now represented by the <hi>Knights</hi> of the respective <hi>Shires,</hi> gave their Votes to <hi>Parliamentary Proceedings,</hi> by such as they particularly appointed to that end before the <hi>49th</hi> of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. the present Constitution stands sufficiently established without the least Imputation of Novelty, or Usurpation.</p>
                  <p>And this were enough for my purpose: <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vid.</hi> Jus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorum ab an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquo, <hi>Addit.</hi> p. 20, to 32.</note> But since many Arguments induce the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief that before the <hi>49th</hi> of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. such <hi>ordinary Free-holders</hi> often came to the <hi>General Councils of the Kindom</hi> without special Election and Representation, I should have given too great Advantage to the Underminers of <hi>Common Right,</hi> if I should have undertaken to prove that the <hi>Counties,</hi> from the time of the reputed <hi>Conquest downwards, always had their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives by the formality of a Choice,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> I thank him, would put upon me to prove.</p>
                  <p>His second Mistake, as to the manner of summoning the <hi>Great Council</hi> and the <hi>Curia,</hi> wherein he thinks that there lies an essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial difference between the two Courts, is nearly conjoyned to the first, and if it were no mistake, would overthrow my Notion: for if, as he holds, only <hi>Tenants in Chief</hi>
                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:94716:180"/>
made the <hi>General Council,</hi> of the Kingdom, as well as the <hi>Curia,</hi> then my belief that others besides such Tenants had right to come to the <hi>General Council,</hi> would be groundless; and it might be probable that the different <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> p. 149.</note> Summons might distinguish the Courts.</p>
                  <p>But whereas he fancies it to have been <hi>a distinctive Mark, or certain Diagnostick of a Parliament, where the Summons were personal to the Bishops, Earls, and the Greater Barons;</hi> if he had been pleased to have taken the Pains to consult the Records, he would have found the Summons to have been as <hi>personal</hi> to the Wars, and consequently to the <hi>Curia</hi> (which besides other Occasions for its sitting, was held at the place of Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous, to charge <hi>Escuage</hi> upon the <note place="margin">See <hi>Escuage</hi> taxt at such a a Military As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, <hi>Inter Com. de Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min.

If <hi>King Iohn's Charter</hi> requires that the <hi>Great Tenants in Chief</hi> should have parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Summons to <hi>Parliament,</hi> then indeed there would be a reason why, though all the Tenants in Chief were obliged to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in the <hi>Curia</hi> upon general notice, yet some might not be concluded by any Act of Legislation, unless they had notice of Attendance to such end.</p>
                  <p>But if he knew not what was meant by <hi>Tenure in Capite,</hi> 'tis odds but he might mistake the Sense of that part of <hi>King Iohn's Charter</hi> which relates to the <hi>Tenants in Chief.</hi> And if <hi>William</hi> the first did not make an <hi>absolute Conquest,</hi> 'twill be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful how those that derived from under his Grant, should be the only Persons interested in the Government, exclusive of all others: but if he did make <hi>such a Conquest,</hi> then a very little Evidence would be enough to make one believe that none but <hi>Tenants in Chief</hi> were <hi>Cives,</hi> or any part of the <hi>Civil Society.</hi>

                  <p>But let us see what is made of a contrary Exposition.</p>
                  <p>By the first <hi>commune Concilium,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> conceives the <hi>Curia Regis</hi> was meant, <note place="margin">

                     <hi>impose Escuage, or Aid upon his Tenants, except it were in those three Cases of Aid mentioned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then, <hi>Et ad habendum commune Concilium Regni aliter quam in tribus casibus praedictis &amp; de scutagiis assidendis</hi> he conceives to be meant of Parliament, and that <hi>all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters other than those three mentioned, Aids, and Escuage, which were due by Tenure, should be done by that commune Concilium, that is, his Parliament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Truly I know not how he will free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from a contradiction upon this, when he makes <hi>Et ad habendum commune Concilium Regni aliter quam in tribus casibus praedictis, Et de Scutagiis assidendis</hi> to be meant of a <hi>Parliament,</hi> though before he had exempted <hi>Escuage</hi> from the Court of <hi>Parliament</hi> and assigned it to the <hi>Curia.</hi> And this shews clearly, that no other Council but the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria Regis</hi> is there mentioned, there being no Provision, except what was contained under <hi>Liberties,</hi> and <hi>Free Customs,</hi> for any other matters besides <hi>Escuage,</hi> and <hi>Aids,</hi> and these such as he confesses to have been due from the <hi>King's Tenants,</hi> for where 'tis <hi>Nullum Scutagium vel auxilium ponam in Regno nostro, nisi per commune Concilium Regni nostri.</hi> By this <hi>commune Concilium</hi> he owns the <hi>Curia Regis</hi> was meant.</p>
                  <p>For the three <hi>Aids</hi> excepted in the <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> to be sure there was no need of a <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Tenants,</hi> they being Incidents, and of course raised and returned into the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, and the King expresly reserved unto
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:94716:184"/>
himself a Power of raising them without convening any Council at all; so that in short all the <hi>Common Council</hi> that can be here found by him is only a <hi>Curia Regis</hi> for the assessing of <hi>Escuage,</hi> so that where 'tis <hi>Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum Scutagium vel auxilium, auxilium</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to such as lay upon the Tenants who were to be summoned to the <hi>Curia,</hi> who were Tenants <hi>by Knights Service</hi> only; and therefore he rightly observes (if he takes it of such as held not <hi>per servitium Militare)</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Page 151.</note> that the <hi>Burgesses</hi> were not <hi>Suitors to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria Regis,</hi> and where 'tis <hi>Commune Conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium de Auxiliis, &amp; de Scutagiis,</hi> if they ought to be joined together, the Word <hi>Scutagium</hi> brought in with an <hi>and</hi> is <hi>exegeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> and <hi>explanatory</hi> of the general Word <hi>Aid,</hi> and confines it to <hi>Aid</hi> upon Tenants <hi>by Knights Service:</hi> and it is certain that the matters excepted were incident to <hi>Knights Service</hi> as well as <hi>Socage Tenure.</hi> According to which, as <hi>London</hi> held in common <hi>Socage, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Tenures and Estates Members of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we then had such Laws, <hi>quas vulgus elegerit,</hi> and the nwe had materially our three Estates, though not so well sized and sorted as since.</p>
                     <p>We had then I say many great Free-holders <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> p. 157.</note> in every County that by their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures were Members of Parliament, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now we have but two, and tho the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did not not chuse them, yet the Men of that Order, seem chosen once for all interpretatively by the People in their consent to the Government.

                     <p>Besides, <hi>Barones Majores</hi> and <hi>Minores</hi> there, was at this time a distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Barones Regis,</hi> and <hi>Barones Regni,</hi> which I will explain, to prevent any Mistake that may grow thereupon: The <hi>Barones Regni,</hi> were Barons by Tenure, and made part of the Government by the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the first <hi>William,</hi> and so in process of Time, called <hi>Barones Regni,</hi> because they had by Continuance of that Constitution, acquired a fixed Right to that Honour.</p>

Wherefore accordingly King <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Charter confines the special Summons, which as, I say, was to the <hi>Curia Regis,</hi> to such <hi>Great Barons</hi> of the Kingdom as held <hi>in Capite.</hi> There being after <hi>Majores Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rones Regni</hi> in a different Provision, <hi>Et om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes alios qui de nobis tenent in Capite.</hi>

                  <p>Wherefore when all the <hi>Barons</hi> of the Kingdom were summoned, it took in the <hi>Majores</hi> and <hi>Minores,</hi> both those that held <hi>in Capite</hi> and otherwise. But when they are used distinctly, 'tis wholly contrary to his Supposition; for the <hi>Barones Regis</hi> were properly, and strictly, they who held im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately of the King, as all manner of Authorities warrant.</p>

Indeed I am almost ashamed here to bring Proof of a thing so evident: But he may please to observe that <hi>Thanus</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> were always of the same Acceptation. <hi>Thanus Regis</hi> was strictly, he who held Lands of the King by any kind of Tenure; and so was <hi>Baro Regis;</hi> tho somtimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to him that held by <hi>Knights Service,</hi> and an ordinary <hi>Thane</hi> was no <note place="margin">

were his great Officers and Justices. These made a <hi>Select Council,</hi> acting in Parliament, and out of it, either in a full Body, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by Agreement, as I could easily shew.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Tenants in Capite,</hi> were the King's ordinary Council, and therefore manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Assize there was drawn up and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised by them in full Parliament, with the Consent of all the <hi>Barons of the Kingdom:</hi> under which, in those ancient Times <hi>omnes quodamodo ordines Regni continebantur,</hi> as <note place="margin">Cam: Ordines Angl. <hi>p.</hi> 61.

                  <p>Now the Question is, Whether those Tenants <hi>in Capite,</hi> the <hi>Barones Curiae,</hi> were <hi>Barones Regis;</hi> which that they were, I think is very obvious, they being, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of holding of the King, obliged to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend at his Court: And that these were the <hi>King's Barons,</hi> or <hi>Barons of his Court,</hi> or owing Suit, and Service there, must needs be synonimous.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Cook</hi> cites an Answer to a Petition in Parliament, 18. <hi>E.</hi> 1. <hi>Rex non vult aliquem medium,</hi> which is no more than that he would not grant his Tenant who then petition'd, Licence to alien: However he had not forfeited his Land if he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lien'd, but the King might have entred and <note place="margin">2 Inst. f. 66.</note> seized the Land in the Name of Distress for a reasonable Fine for the Trespass: Which the Lord <hi>Cook</hi> takes for the <hi>better Opinion.</hi> And if the Land were forfeited, to be sure the <hi>indivisible Service</hi> could not have been multiplied, as Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> imagines.</p>

'Tis certain, that tho at the Common Law the King, or any other Lord, might have distrained for his Services, reserved upon the Original Grant, in the Lands of any inferiour Grantee as well as in the <note place="margin">1 Instit. <hi>f.</hi> 142.</note> Lands of his immediate Tenants; yet there was this Inconvenience, that the Wardships and Marriages were not so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable when the Lands were parcell'd out, and the Lands of the immediate Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, (who only was to be in Ward, or to be married by the first Grantor) were of less value.</p>
                  <p>Therefore was that Provision by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> by the Interpretation of which, the King was to have Fines upon Aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But tho the Inconvenience of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants aliening to hold of themselves, was taken away by the Statute of <hi>Quia emptores Terrarum,</hi> 18 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. which gave Tenants free Power to alien their Lands; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that the Alienees should hold of the Alienors immediate Lords with an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionment of Services: Yet Licences of Alienation being of settled Prerogative, were not taken away from the King, he not being named in the Statute. <note place="margin">2 Instit. <hi>f.</hi> 67.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>By that Statute indeed, if a Tenant <hi>in Capite</hi> aliened with Licence, the Alience became Tenant <hi>in Capite;</hi> for the Statute divided the Signiory.

And therefore are by no means to be admitted, unless we take the sense of the Judicious Lord <hi>Clarendon,</hi> who rebukes Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> for insisting upon <hi>William</hi> the first his Title by Conquest, as being what he himself renounced and abdicated, if he ever had it.</p>
                  <p>If Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> says that unhappy Great <note place="margin">Survey of the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> p. 109.</note> Man,</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Had taken the pains, and known where to have been informed of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings and Transactions of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, he would have found Cause to believe that that great King did ever dexterously endeavour from the time that he was assured that his Possession would not be disturbed, to divest himself of the Title of a Conqueror, and made his legal Claim to what he had got by the Will of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, whose Name was precious to the Nation, and who was known to have a great Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship for that Prince, who had now reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered what had been his.</p>
                     <p>And he knew so well the ill Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence which must attend the very ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination that the Nation had lost its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, that he made haste to grant them an Assurance that they should still enjoy all the Benefits and Priviledges which were due to them by their own Laws and Customs: By which they should be still governed as they were during that King's whole Reign, who had enough of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable <hi>Demesnes,</hi> and Lands belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:94716:194"/>
to the Crown, of which he was then possest without a Rival, and belonging to those Great Men; who had perish'd with their Posterity in the Battel with <hi>Harold,</hi> to distribute to those who had born such Shares, and run such Hazards in his pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous Adventure. And those Laws and Customs, which were before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, are the same which the Nation and Kingdom have been since governed by to this day; with the Addition of those Statutes and Acts of Parliament, which are the Laws of the Successive Kings, with which they have gratified their Subjects, in providing such new Security for them, and Advantages to the Publique, as upon the Experience and Observation of the Ages and Times when they were made, contributed to the Honour and Glory of the King, as well as Happiness of the People. Many of which are but the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies and Transcripts of ancient Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, making the Characters more plain and legible, of what had been practised and understood in the preceding Ages, and the Observations thereof are of the same Profit and Convenience to the King and People.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>And upon Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his Supposition, that <hi>William</hi> the first, <hi>at his Reception had dispens'd with the Subjection of the Ecclesiasticks, by the Oath he took not to infringe the Liberty of the Church:</hi> The Lord <hi>Clarendon</hi> has to the same purpose with the former, or rather
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:94716:195"/>
as evidence that there was no colour of a Conquest, these words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>They who know any thing of that <note place="margin">Survey of the <hi>Lev.</hi> p. 148.</note> time, know that the Oath he took, was the same, and without any Alteration, that all the former Kings, since the Crown had rested on a single Head, had taken, which was at his Coronation, after the Bishops and the Barons had taken their Oath to be his true and faithful Subjects: The Arch-bishop who crowned him, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented that Oath to him which he was to take himself, which he willingly did, to defend the holy Church of God, and the Rectors of the same; to govern the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal People subject to him, justly to establish equal Laws, and to see them justly executed. Nor was he more wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in any thing, than, as hath been said before, that the People might ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that he pretended any other Title to the Government than by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor; tho it is true, that he did by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees introduce many of the <hi>Norman</hi> Customs, which were found very useful or convenient, and agreeable enough, if not the same, with what had been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practised. And the common Reproach of the Laws being from time to time put into <hi>French,</hi> carries no weight with it: For there was before that time so rude a Collection of the Laws, and in Languages so Forriegn to that of the Nation, <hi>British, Saxon, Danish</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> almost as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:94716:195"/>
as either of the other, that if they had been all digested into the <hi>English,</hi> that was then spoken, we should very little better have understood it, than we do the <hi>French,</hi> in which the Laws were afterwards rendred. And it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der since a Reduction into order was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, that the King who, was to look to the Execution, took care to have them in that Language which himself best un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, and from whence issued no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, the former remaining still in the Language in which they had been written.</q>

                  <argument>
                     <p>That Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> himself in Effect grants, that more than Tenants in Chief had right to come to the <hi>Great Council</hi> of the Nation in which the Nation's Rights were involved.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <q>I Do not deny, (says he) but upon a Change in the Succession to the <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> p. 153.</note> Crown, there might have been in this time extraordinary Conventions of the People, to declare their universal Assent for better assuring such Successors, discoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing the real Prince, and preserving the Peace, as in the Case of <hi>William</hi> the second, <hi>Henry</hi> the first, King <hi>Stephen,</hi> and King <hi>John,</hi> &amp;c. with an assent of such an Assembly as this; at least King <hi>John</hi> should only (if so) have made his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom Tributary to the Pope.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Here he grants that sometimes more than Tenants <hi>in Capite</hi> assembled at Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That to some purposes such Assemblies were needful, not only to quiet the Minds of the People, but to transfer over a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Right.</p>
                  <p>For, he says, if ever there were <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Conventions,</hi> which he owns to have
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:94716:196"/>
been in some Cases, then King <hi>John</hi> could have made the Kingdom Tributary only in such a Council, <hi>viz.</hi> an <hi>extraordinary Convention.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Government</hi> being, <note place="margin">Page 155.</note> as he says, <hi>Rei Publicae Communis Sponsio,</hi> he grants, that the Government here, was not absolutely in the King and his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants in Chief: For if it had, they might have disposed of all the Nation's Rights.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore in effect, he yields, <hi>That the Men of that Order were not chosen once for all</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ibid. <hi>pag.</hi> 157.</note> 
                     <hi>interpretatively by the People in their Consent to the Government.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But further, if he yields us those Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities which shew that the People of the Land, the <hi>Free-holders,</hi> used to assemble for the declaring their Assent to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Governour, with what colour can he set aside those Authorities which menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Assemblies to other purposes in as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Terms?</p>
                  <p>If an <hi>ordinary Free-holder</hi> was under the word <hi>Populus</hi> at an Election to the Crown, or Recognition of a Title; how comes the Signification to be restrained at other times? Will not <hi>Vulgus, Plebs, Populus mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, Laici mediocres,</hi> and the like, denote <note place="margin">Supra <hi>p.</hi> 212.</note> more than Tenants <hi>in Capite,</hi> as well at one publick Assembly in the some King's Reign, as at another? Unless a prior Law be shewn, which excludes the Commons from one <hi>Council,</hi> but admits them to the other? But I cannot find any thing more in this Suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than a downright begging the Question.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:94716:197"/>
Indeed if <hi>William</hi> the first made a Conquest of <hi>England;</hi> so as that he divided out all the Lands of the Kingdom to be held of him in Chief: And the Alienees of <hi>Tenants in Chief</hi> still held immediately of the King; neither of which will readily be proved: then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but not till then, the <hi>Populus Minor</hi> at the <hi>Councils</hi> would be taken for the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants in Chief</hi> only. But the admittance that the presence or consent of more than <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants in Chief,</hi> was at any time needful to any Act of rightful Civil Power, wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys the supposition of a <hi>Conquest;</hi> unless we can believe that the conquer'd ought to give Laws to the Conqueror; or that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding any kind of Establishment, the <hi>dernier</hi> resort, and Supremacy of Power, is always in the People. Which is a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that would unsetle all Governments, making them precarious. Whereas he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self tells us,<q> No Government can be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally, or by any lawful Power chang'd, but <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> p. 122.</note> must remain for ever, once establish'd.</q>

                  <p>THis, though never so strange, I think will be granted me, that he does, if he makes all the Free-holders of the Kingdom Tenants <hi>in Capite per Baroniam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He supposes,<q> that the whole Kingdom was upon the matter turn'd into one great <note place="margin">Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 131.</note> Mannor by <hi>William</hi> the First (all Men made his Tenants) And that all the great Possessions (by which he must mean the Mannors, of which others held) were made <hi>Baronies.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now this, <q>Feudal Baronage, he <note place="margin">Page 129.</note> says, was capable of being multiplied se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <note place="margin">Page 163.</note> ways: For every part of the Fee, however divided, the <hi>Services</hi> reserved <note place="margin">Page 164.</note> upon that Fee, that were <hi>entire</hi> and <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible,</hi> were to be performed by the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Proprietors of the several parts of the divided Fee.</q>
                  </p>

Thus every Proprietor, as he had part of the <hi>divided Fee,</hi> was part of the <hi>Baronage,</hi> and consequently, <q>If all the Baronage both Spiritual and Temporal <hi>de jure,</hi> ought <note place="margin">Page 173.</note> to have Summons now to Parliament, without respect to Estate or Tenure, there would be a great many Pretenders.</q>

                     <q>FOr preventing the Worlds being <note place="margin">Page 156.</note> troubl'd with impertinent Labours, and to divert those that thus em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themselves to Undertakings more useful to the Publick, &amp; advantagious to themselves, he thought fit to tell us, that <hi>the Parliament was always materially the same.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we are at a loss to know what he means, by <hi>materially the same.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For 'tis manifest, that according to his Notion, if the Government were from the time of our Dispute always in one, it would have been <hi>materially the same,</hi> as 'tis now, and yet he will not allow the Legislative Power to be in one here. <q>Every Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Postscript</hi> p. 28.</note> says he, is the Representative of the People in what they are to be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:94716:199"/>
by it, by their consent to it, in the first erecting thereof, they do trust their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> p. 155.</note> with the Rule and Order of their Lives and Estates for the Common-Weal.</q> This seems to be his meaning of <hi>materially the same,</hi> as 'tis brought to shew that 'tis not needful, in order to the maintaining the present right of the Commons, to shew, <q>That the Counties in all this time had their Representatives in Parliament, by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of a Choice.</q> Which no Man, that I know of, has of late laboured to prove.</p>
                  <p>But if this be his meaning of <hi>materially the same,</hi> then all Governments are <hi>materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the same;</hi> Whereas they may be so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, as founded in the consent of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which he presupposes.</p>
                  <p>But if <hi>William</hi> the First was an <hi>absolute Conqueror,</hi> as he all along yeilds to Dr. <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> where was the consent of the People to his Government? And how can a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by consent, now of constituent parts, different from what he thinks ours was at the first Erection by the <hi>Conquest,</hi> be either <hi>materially</hi> or <hi>formally</hi> the same with such a Government by Conquest?</p>
                  <p>But we must seek further for his <note place="margin">Page 148.</note> meaning in <hi>materially the same.</hi> He tells us, the <hi>Parliament</hi> and the <hi>Curia Regis,</hi> were <hi>materially the same,</hi> that is, as one would think there, consisted of the same Members, the only difference being laid to be in the nature of the Summons. And yet he tells
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:94716:199"/>
us, that the <hi>ancient Burroughs sent Members</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Page 151.</note> 
                     <hi>to Parliament,</hi> but that such were not <hi>Suitors</hi> to the <hi>Curia Regis:</hi> How then were these <hi>materially the same?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus 'tis plain that he has laid no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Foundation for our Government by <hi>King, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> or by <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>three States</hi> (which he takes to have been the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Indeed this Assertion, of that famous <hi>Chancellor,</hi> has been much exploded by those, who think that the altering of some Laws, or Customs, is a change of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; And therefore say, that he was greatly mistaken, because many old Customs have been abolish'd: Whereas he certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meant it of the Fundamental Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                  <p>In the 16 of <hi>Henry</hi> the second, that King held his Easter Court Baron at <hi>Windsor,</hi> as <hi>Bromton</hi> shews us, <hi>Rer tenuit Curiam suam in solemnitate Paschali.</hi> Thither indeed <note place="margin">Brompton, <hi>f.</hi> 1060.</note> were flock't most of the Nobility, <hi>fere om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Regni Anglae Episcopii, &amp; Magnates.</hi>

                  <p>I conceive that though to these at the time of the Incorporation, the King gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted several Franchises, as Markets, Fairs, and the like: Yet he gave no Right of sending Members to Parliament, to them who had it not before: but of them that were so incorporated, some were <hi>Minores tenentes in Capite,</hi> inferiour. Tenants in Chief, such as by King <hi>John</hi>'s Charter were (where not incorporated) to be summoned in general to the <hi>Commune Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilium,</hi>

or <hi>Curia Regis.</hi> Many of these for the sake of such Immunities as belonged to free Boroughs, consented to be incorporated: and thereupon they being one entire Body, naturally fell into a Representation, and answered together by their Head-boroughs, or any other that they chose, as one Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>

                  <p>That they held of the King in Chief, and that as other Burgesses of the Kingdom,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:94716:203"/>
they were to be represented at the King's Parliaments, when they happened to be summoned by two of their fellow-Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses, as ever since they were incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they had used to come, for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of <hi>any of their Services.</hi> And that they <note place="margin">So if summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to attend the Justices in Eire, or the like.</note> had not forfeited their Charter, nor ought their Corporation to be dissolved, for that they had duly performed all their Services. And for proof that, to Parliament especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, they had all along come by Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, they appeal to the Rolls of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery.</p>
                  <p>Certainly, no Man, before the Doctor, thought that the coming to Parliament excused any Rent or other Service, which was incumbent upon them.</p>
                  <p>But thus much is obvious from this, that here were <hi>Minores Barones,</hi> Tenants in Chief (whose Tenure must have been cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by Charter) who were fallen into a Representation: And that this was upon the account of Property in Land, which occasioned their Services, and their being united as one Tenant.</p>
                  <p>But besides these, there were Tenants of <hi>Honours</hi> or <hi>Manors</hi> in the King's Hands, or in the Subjects, which were incorporated by the King's Charter, and sent their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives to Parliament.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. That though there is no Evidence that <hi>Representations</hi> for <hi>Counties</hi> were settled before the <hi>49th</hi> of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. Yet the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders

were often at <hi>Parliament</hi> by <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation,</hi> and thence there was ground in reason to occasion the Custom that they should bear the Charges of them that they chose: Nay, if there were no actual Choice, there was tacit Consent, (from which Custom may arise) that those who were willing, and at leisure to be at <hi>Council,</hi> should answer for, and have Contributions from the rest. But let both Dr. <hi>Brady</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> consider the Precedents above <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> p. 149.</note> mentioned, of <hi>Coventry,</hi> and <hi>Bridgwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which did not hold of the King, and yet sent Burgesses to Parliament; and let them give a categorical Answer, whether they believe that the <hi>Majores Barones Regni,</hi> and <hi>omnes alij</hi> holding <hi>in Capite,</hi> mentioned in King <hi>John</hi>'s Charter, <hi>made</hi> the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment till the <hi>49th</hi> of <hi>H.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>This I think may be enough to satisfy any reasonable Man, that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was the same before the <hi>49th</hi> of <hi>H.</hi> 3. that 'twas after, and that it had not its Rise from Rebellion, nor yet from <hi>Conquest,</hi>

                  <p>That there was an absolute <hi>Conquest</hi> of the Nation by <hi>William</hi> the first, and that
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:94716:210"/>
he admitted none to any Shares in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but such as derived their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest from his Bounty, is contended for by many, <hi>Tanquam pro aris &amp; focis.</hi> And tho the History of King <hi>William</hi> the first his entring upon the Government, is very strong against them, and may be the first thing considerable: Yet from the supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the <hi>Tenants in Chief,</hi> such as were the Suitors at the <hi>Curia,</hi> made the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> where the absolute Government of the Nation was plac'd, they very strongly may infer a <hi>Conquest.</hi> Whereas the Proof of the difference of the <hi>Curia Regis,</hi> and the <hi>Concilium Pambritannicum,</hi> or Parliament, shews that all the pretence of <hi>Conquest</hi> is out of doors, and consequently the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is such, as now it is by free Consent on all sides; not founded on Usurpation upon the Rights of any, nor is there the least pretence of unsettling what, as the great <hi>Fortescue</hi> observes, has not chang'd <note place="margin">Supra <hi>p.</hi> 271.</note> with the People, or Rulers.</p>
                  <p>Admit a <hi>Conquest,</hi> and the Inheritance which every one claims in the Laws will be maintainable only as a <hi>naked Right,</hi> and <hi>naked Rights</hi> are thin and metaphysical Notions, which few are Masters or Judges of.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Conquest,</hi> or no <hi>Conquest,</hi> a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment derived from the Pleasure of one, or consented to by all, are Questions which any ordinary Capacity is able to judg of, when the Testimonies rely'd on by both
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:94716:211"/>
sides are laid before them. And though Matters depending upon Testimony, are not capable of Demonstration, so far as they depend upon that; yet where Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies are made use of for the laying a Foundation, upon which some Metaphysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Notions of <hi>Right</hi> are built; it is possible to demonstrate that the Testimonies will not serve the purpose for which they are brought, but are clearly on the otherside. And it that be done, it wholly silences the Dispute, better than Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi>'s Scheme of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mr.</hi> Hunt, <hi>p.</hi> 205.</note> 
                     <hi>Probabilities,</hi> or his Metaphysical, nay, or Physical Notions of the Right of Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
                  <p>If therefore it be shewn that there is not the least shadow for pretence of a <hi>Conquest,</hi> or that only such as derived what they had from the Bounty of the Prince, were inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested in the Government and Legislature, certainly the whole Frame of Consequences built upon such Supposition easily falls to the ground.</p>
                  <p>I appeal to the World, Whether what Mr. <hi>Hunt thought fit to say for the preventing</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Page 206. Page 156.</note> 
                     <hi>the World's being troubled with such imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Labours, and to divert those that thus employ themselves to Undertakings more useful to the Publick,</hi> can be of such a general Use and Satisfaction, as the destroying those Foundations which are laid for a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment not known to our Laws, nor own'd in our so well constituted, and so ancient Frame, the Admittance of which,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:94716:211"/>
would root up the very Foundations.</p>
                  <p>He says our Government was always <hi>materially the same.</hi> When according to him 'twas neither <hi>materially</hi> nor formally <hi>the same</hi> it is now.</p>
                  <p>Whereas this Labour which he explodes, shews that 'twas always both <hi>materially</hi> and formally the same, and therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable.</p>
                  <p>If there were a <hi>Conquest,</hi> that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest</hi> establish'd a Government, or it did not.</p>
                  <p>If it establish'd a Government, then, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him, no following Consent, even of the Conqueror, can divest him of any part of that Right which was given by the <hi>Conquest.</hi> For upon the Bishops account, he tells us, <q>They cannot be detruded <note place="margin">

                  <p>If it be said, This is contrary to the Post-script, which affirms, <q>That nothing can be the Concerns of Men united in any Polity, but may be govern'd and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <note place="margin">Post-scrip, <hi>p.</hi> 33</note> by the Laws of their Legislature for their good;</q>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="296" facs="tcp:94716:212"/>
At least this shews how in matters of Notion, and <hi>naked Rights,</hi> great Wits may not only differ from others, but from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p>But let us give the Argument raised from <hi>Conquest,</hi> its full weight, and see whether Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> maintains our present Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon clearer Grounds than they do who search Antiquity about the Point.</p>
                  <p>The absolute Power and Government <note place="margin">This is begg'd throughout Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s pernicious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogue between a Philosopher and Student of the Common Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                     </note> of the Nation, was by the right of <hi>Conquest</hi> setled in <hi>William the First</hi> and his Heirs: this being so, could not be parted with.</p>
                  <p>For it must be either voluntarily, or by Compulsion: For the first, Sir <hi>Robert Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> will tell you, <hi>No Man can bind himself in a matter depending of his own Will, there can be no Obligation which taketh State from the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Power of Kings, <hi>f.</hi> 1.</note> 
                     <hi>meer Will of him that bindeth himself.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If by Compulsion, then they will tell you <hi>for the same Causes that a private Man may be relieved from his unjust and unreasonable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, as that it was so grievous; or, for he was</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Patriarcha <hi>p.</hi> 97.</note> 
                     <hi>by Deceit or Fraud circumvented, or induced thereunto by Terrour or Force, or just Fear, or by some great hurt; even for the same causes the Prince or Princes may be restor'd in that which toucheth the diminishing of his or their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="297" facs="tcp:94716:212"/>
If it be said, That this would as well hold in relation to the Peoples parting with that Right which was once in them: they will tell you that no Government can be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed but <hi>Monarchy;</hi> That no other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is owned by God Almighty, in the New, or Old Testament, but <hi>Monarchy:</hi> That while God's People were without a <hi>King</hi> in <hi>Israel,</hi> there was Confusion, and Anarchy. If <hi>Adam</hi> was no <hi>Monarch,</hi> at least <hi>God</hi> himself was, and 'twas a <hi>Theocracy.</hi> And therefore admit <hi>Paternal Power</hi> was not <hi>Monarchical,</hi> yet a Man might as well seize upon a People without a Government, as upon a piece of Land unoccupied. And when once he became <hi>Conqueror,</hi> he was let into a Divine Right of ordering arbitrarily all things within that district, and could not depart from it. And though e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>Monarch</hi> was not absolute, (for the Jewish Kings were not) yet every <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch</hi> by <hi>Conquest</hi> must needs be so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received without any Conditions, or Limitations.</p>
                  <p>Now Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> himself, going chiefly to shew that Paternal Power was not, as such, absolute, does not answer this Hypothesis, and the Examination of it depends upon such searches into the bottom of things and the shewing them naked in their Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical Existences, that very few Men can
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:94716:213"/>
judg of the Controversy, at least not so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as may, of the meaning of Writers and Records carefully compared together, and in many places freed from all possible Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity; but still the more ambiguous they are, the more evidently will they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all those Pretences upon which these Notions are built. For if the Records and Histories give such <hi>doubtful Responses,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> imagines, then indeed we must <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> p. 6.</note> look only to the present Government. Whereas if Dr. <hi>Brady,</hi> and his Friends, could shew those ancient Authorities to be plainly on their side, they would have many that would improve their Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the House of Commons their beginning by Rebellion, into an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they ought to be cast off as Usurpers upon the Divine Right of the <hi>Conqueror.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or at least, yeild but that one Point of the <hi>Conquest,</hi> they will tell you agreeably to Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi>'s Assertion, that a Government by <hi>Conquest</hi> is unalterable by any lawful <note place="margin">
                        <hi>p.</hi> 122. supra.</note> Power; And, as that is wholly different from a Government by consent, whatever implies, or admits of the consent of Subjects to the passing any Law, is contrary to the Fundamentals of the Government, and is like a Superstructure of Hay and Stubble, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>h ought to be consumed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="299" facs="tcp:94716:213"/>
Others will tell you that the most free Concessions of a <hi>Conquering Prince,</hi> or one claiming under that Title, and not departing with his Dominion, can no more oblige himself or his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors in any thing that may restrain his Soveraign Will and Pleasure, than a Man can depart with the freedom of his Will.</p>
                  <p>And the most seeming Restraints can be no more than temporary Provisions, or ordinary Methods of Ruling, which the Prince as he found occasion might remove, notwithstanding the strictest Clauses of Perpetuity, they being of like Interpretation with such Passages as related to the continuance of the Jewish Law, or Oeconomy, which was to have no place in the <hi>New Heavens,</hi> and <hi>new Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if they should yeild that all Grants and Charters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are binding to the Prince who made them; yet Sir <hi>Robert Filmer</hi> tells <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vid.</hi> Power of Kings, <hi>f.</hi> 1.</note> us expresly; <hi>The Laws, Ordinances, Letters, Patents, Priviledges, and Grants of Princes, have no Force but during their Life, if they be not ratified by the express Consent, or at least by the sufferance of the Prince following, who had knowledg thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="300" facs="tcp:94716:214"/>
These Notions have more Favourers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, than there are Men of Judgment or Honesty enough to shew the weakness of them. Nor has Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> that I know of, directly encountred them with his two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edg'd Weapon; But if the supposed Fact which they are built upon, be prov'd to be no more than Supposition, all the most spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Superstructures are but Castles in the Air, which vanish like Smoak.</p>
