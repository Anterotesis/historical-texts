            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PROPOSAL To Make Good the Coyn of this Kingdom, Without Diminiſhing the Species thereof.</head>
            <p>WHEREAS the great <hi>Difficulty</hi> that appears in bringing this <hi>Matter</hi> to bare, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Conſideration, That the Calling in all the <hi>Clipt Money,</hi> (being ſo general) will occaſion a great ſtop in <hi>Trade,</hi> the <hi>Market</hi> thereby not able to be Supply'd, beſides the many further <hi>Inconveniences</hi> that may Naturally ariſe: YET the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> for our <hi>Moneys</hi> to be Regulated is ſuch, That it were much more <hi>Eligible</hi> to be ſubject to the hazard of ſuch miſchiefs, than not put a ſtop to that growing <hi>evil:</hi> Both which to prevent, it's <hi>Humbly Propoſed</hi> as an expedient to render it <hi>eaſy</hi> and <hi>practicable,</hi> as followeth:</p>
            <p>THAT a FUND (being made for a Lottery of a Million, or more, if thought fit, to be <hi>Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi> by ſuch Perſons only as ſhall purchaſe their Intereſt by bringing in <hi>Plate;</hi> forthwith to be Coined before the <hi>Clipt Money</hi> be called in) would certainly Anſwer in lieu of <hi>Ballion,</hi> to give an immediate <hi>Supply</hi> to the Market, keep our Money circulating, and remove all Objections.</p>
            <p>THE Quantity of the <hi>Superfluous Plate</hi> in this Kingdom is ſo conſiderable. which, together with the Uſeleſs Plate in <hi>Publick Houſes,</hi> being Prohibited, it's not to be doubted, but One Million, at leaſt, would be ſoon Advanced.</p>
            <p>ESPECIALLY when we conſider the Price that Plate now bares, and how deſirous the People are of coming into another <hi>Lottery,</hi> as plainly appears by the <hi>Prizes</hi> and <hi>Blanks</hi> in the <hi>Million Adventure,</hi> when once paſt the hopes of another <hi>Lottery,</hi> this Seſſions Advanc'd from <hi>Six</hi> Years Purchaſe to <hi>Seven</hi> and an half.</p>
            <p>THE Way and Method for all ſuch Perſons as intend to be <hi>Proprietors</hi> in this <hi>Adventure</hi> is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, that they carry their Plate to the <hi>Mint,</hi> there to receive <hi>Tickets</hi> according to the Value, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting ſo many <hi>Ounces</hi> as ſhall be proportioned to a <hi>Ticket,</hi> and for every odd Sum that ſhall happen over and above, to receive a <hi>Note</hi> for the ſame, Payable at a certain time, after Coming.</p>
            <p>BUT if if it ſhall be thought fit to have ſuch Plate brought into the <hi>Bank,</hi> on the ſame Conditions as above, thence to be Tranſmitted to the <hi>Mint,</hi> to return in Coin; the <hi>Mint</hi> will be greatly eas'd, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Work upon their hands, and the Money made much more <hi>Defuſive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR the <hi>Bank</hi> thereby being enabled to anſwer the Defficiency of the <hi>Mint,</hi> all Perſons of Worth and Credit, that ſhall bring their Money to be Coin'd, will readily take <hi>Notes</hi> upon the <hi>Bank,</hi> for what ſhall fall ſhort, which being for their eaſe; and having a free Credit, the <hi>Million</hi> in <hi>Specie</hi> will remain in the <hi>Bank</hi> to ſupply the Poorer ſort of People, that can afford no Credit, having no more than bare Subſiſtance.</p>
            <p>SO conſequently, The <hi>Bank</hi> will ſupply the <hi>Mint,</hi> and the <hi>Mint</hi> be able to ſupply the <hi>Bank</hi> before Occaſion: Therefore no poſſibility of <hi>Stoppage</hi> in <hi>Commerce,</hi> or want of Current Money.</p>
            <p>BY theſe means, not only the preſent Occaſion is anſwered, by Facilitating the <hi>Coynage</hi> of all the Clipt Money, but a <hi>Million</hi> in Specie is created more; without which, it's directly linking a <hi>Million</hi> from what was in the <hi>Nation</hi> before, which is conceiv'd can hardly be ſpared at this time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> Propoſer <hi>craves leave further to Obſerve, that conſidering the Honourable the</hi> Houſe of Commons <hi>has ſo far proceeded in Relation to the Regulating this intollerable Abuſe, if not effectually Rem<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
