            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </gap>, straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way looking upon the <hi>Bishop</hi> of that place, he said thus unto him: <hi>Christ being witnesse and before the Church, I commend unto thee and thy care this young man, to be especially regarded and educated in all spirituall disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</hi> Whom when the <hi>Bishop</hi> had received into his tui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and promised that he would performe whatsoever he ought, <hi>S. Iohn</hi> againe and againe gives his charge, and contesteth his fidelity: and afterwards he returnes to <hi>Ephesus.</hi> The <hi>Bishop</hi> takes the <hi>young man</hi> home:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4869:12"/>
brings him up as his owne sonne, keeps him within the limits of his dutie, intreats him gently, and at last bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiseth him, and confirmes him. Afterwards, upon remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting something of his care, and giving freer reines to his libertie, the <hi>young man</hi> takes occasion to shake off the yoake of tuition, and falls into bad company, who cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt him: diverting his course from the path of vertue by these meanes. First, they invite him to banquets, then they carry him abroad in the <hi>Night,</hi> afterward to maintaine their profuser expence, they draw him to theevery, and so by degrees to greater wickednesse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now made Captaine in this theevish company. At last Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> returnes and saith; <hi>Goe to Bishop, give me my</hi> depositum, <hi>which I and Christ committed unto thee in the Church which thou governest.</hi> The <hi>Bishop</hi> was asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, thinking that he had deceitfully demanded some money which he never received, and yet durst scarce distrust the Apostle. But as soone as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> said, <hi>I demand the young man and soule of my brother:</hi> the old man hanging downe his head, sighing and weeping, said; <hi>ille mortuus est,</hi> he is dead. <hi>How and with what kinde of death,</hi> said <hi>Iohn? Deo mortuus est,</hi> hee is dead unto God, answered the <hi>Bishop: Nam nequam &amp; perditus, &amp; uno verbo Latro evasit:</hi> for he is wicked and lost, and in a word a Theefe. Much matter might be collected from this Story, to enlarge the ground of our Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to wit, what imminent dangers are ever attending on <hi>Youth,</hi> and how easie it is by the painted flag of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and sensuall pleasure, to draw him to ruine. For doubtlesse, many excellent rules of instruction had this grave <hi>Bishop</hi> delivered and imparted to his young Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pill: many devout taskes and holy exercises had hee commended to his practice: many prayers full of fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent zeale had hee offered for his conversion: many sighes had he sent, many teares had he shed to reclaime him from his former conversation. Yet see, how soone

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited passion.</note> why <hi>Youth</hi> is more subject to this illimited passion, than any other age. The first is, that naturall heat or vigour, which is most predominant in <hi>Youth,</hi> provoking him to attempt the greatest of difficulties, rather than suffer the repulse where hee affects. The second is, want of Employment: which begets this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemperature; whence the <hi>Poet:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Take away Idlenesse, and without doubt,</l>

This want of employment was it, which moved <hi>Aegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi> to shew himselfe more familiar with <hi>Clytemnestra,</hi> than stood well with his honour; for had he ranked himselfe with those valiant <hi>Greekes,</hi> whose resolute ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures gain'd them generall esteeme, he had preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted occasion, and purchased himselfe equall renowne by his valour, as by vaiue expence of time he incurred dishonour.

And no lesse occasion gives wanton discourse, or Lascivious Bookes to the enraged affections of distempered <hi>Youth</hi>: so as, much more blessed were the State, if restraint were made of composing or publishing such Subjects, where every leafe instructs <hi>Youth</hi> in a new lesson of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Alcaeus,</hi> a man of good reputation and generall observance in the Common-wealth; what toyes wrote he of the love of young men? All the writings of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacreon,</hi> are only of love. But most of all other, <hi>Rhegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> even burned with love, as appeareth by his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. Yea even Philosophers (and that by the counsell and authoritie of <hi>Plato,</hi> whom therefore <hi>Dicearchus</hi> did worthily reprehend) became the commenders and honourers of love. Such Discourses should be throwne to the darkest corner of our studies, as that of <hi>Ovids</hi> was by <hi>Augustus,</hi> which tend to corrupt <hi>Youth,</hi> and divert his minde from the exercise of vertue. But alas; to what height of licentious libertie are these corrupter times growne? When that <hi>Sex,</hi> where Modesty should claime a native prerogative, gives way to foments of exposed loosenesse; by not only attending to the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton discourse of immodest Lovers, but carrying about them (even in their naked Bosomes, where chastest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires should only lodge) the amorous toyes of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Adonis:</hi> which Poem, with others of like nature, they heare with such attention, peruse with such devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and retaine with such delectation, as no Subject can equally relish their unseasoned palate, like those lighter discourses. Yea (which hath struck me to more admiration) I have knowne divers, whose unriper yeers halfe assured me, that their greene <hi>Youth</hi> had never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed them in the knowledge, nor brought them to conceit of such vanities, excellently well read in those immodest Measures; yea, and prompt enough to shew

proofes of their reading in publike places. I will not insist upon them, but leave them, to have their names registred amongst those infamous Ladies; <hi>Semphronia, Scribonia, Clitemnestra, Cleopatra, Faustina, Messa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina,</hi> whose memories purchased by odious <hi>Lust,</hi> shall survive the course of time; as the memory of those fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Matrons, <hi>Octavia, Porcia, Caecilia, Cornelia,</hi> shall transcend the period of time. To expresse what especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all motives tend most to increase of this <hi>passion,</hi> I thinke it not amisse: because I hold it necessarie to propose the cause, before we come to cure the effect. For I thinke, according to the opinion of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that then my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions have brought forth good fruit, when by them any one shall be provoked to apply his dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the knowledge and practice of vertue.<note place="margin">

Sure I am, as there is nothing which brings either publike or private State to a remisnesse of government sooner than peace or plentie; so nothing effatuates the understanding of man more, than excesse in meat or drinke, subjecting the intellective part to the bondage of Sence. For what may be the discourse of <hi>Epicurists,</hi> but lascivious, begot on excesse of fare curious and luscious?

Amongst the <hi>Romans, Venus</hi> or <hi>Cous</hi> was the best chance at dice: And no chance, (till some heavie mischance over-take them) more happie in their opinion, than to receive a loving smile or cheerefull aspect from their terrestriall <hi>Venus.</hi> Some Countries I haue read of, whose naturall basenesse, being given to all avarice, induced them to dis-esteeme all respects in this kinde, and to make merchandize of their womens honour.

If otherwise it happen, (as I grant it may) that upon private surmises, or suggestions derived from some factious heads, these men of more eminent note and esteeme have brought your name in question, because (as they were informed) you formerly aspersed a blemish upon their Honour: I would not have you to erre so farre from your owne judgment, as without further discussing the cause, to fall into desperat extremes: for were it not much better for you to sift the cause, how you both are abused, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that base suggestour might be duely censured, and your wrongs mutually redressed, than to vow <hi>Revenge</hi> ere an injury be offered? Yes Sir, beleeve it, much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and safer, and in the opinion of discreet men, wiser: howsoever our hare-brain'd <hi>Gallant,</hi> whose property is to act before he resolve, esteeme it a derogation to ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We account him who can beare the most, to be the strongest; yet esteeme we him who can beare injuries most, to be the weakest; so ill dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed is mans temper, as for an opinion of <hi>Reputation,</hi> hee will incurre apparant errour. Now there is another <hi>Revenge,</hi> which proceedeth from a nature farre more inglorious than the former. And that is, when for some little distaste conceived against our inferiour, (even in worldly respects) wee labour his undoing: yea many times, because hee stands too resolutely for right, wee threaten his ruine: But true shall we finde it:

And this might appeare in poore <hi>Naboth,</hi> who because he would not give the <hi>Inheritance</hi> of his <hi>Fathers,</hi> his <hi>Vine-yard,</hi> he must be stoned.

I might now in this Subject of <hi>Revenge,</hi> inlarge my discourse by speaking of <hi>Anger,</hi> from whence <hi>Revenge</hi> may seeme to receive her originall being: which <hi>Anger</hi> the Poet termes a short fury:
<q>
                     <l>Anger is madnesse,<note place="margin">Horat. l. <hi>1.</hi> epist. <hi>2.</hi>

                  </q>
For what differs an angrie man from a mad-man, save onely in this; his violence of passion continues not so long: for the time it is as vehement and as violent. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent therefore was that precept of Moderation given and observed by that renowned Emperour <hi>Theodosius,</hi> drawne (as may appeare in the like example of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi>) from a former patterne: of whom it is written, that he would never in his <hi>anger</hi> proceed to <hi>Revenge,</hi> or so much as shew any argument of distaste, till hee had repeated over the foure and twentie Greeke letters.

Excellent and proper for our present purpose, is that Fable of the <hi>Fowler</hi> and the <hi>Bird:</hi> A <hi>Fowler</hi> having taken a <hi>Bird</hi> in his snare, was humbly intreated by the <hi>Bird,</hi> that he would free her and give her libertie, and shee would requite this courtesie with three good Lessons; which (if duly observed) would profit him more than her small body.

This the discontented <hi>Fowler</hi> had no sooner heard, than presently he repented himselfe of so rare and inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a losse; which the nimble <hi>Bird</hi> perceiving, thus replied:

The perplexed <hi>Fowler</hi> inquisitive of knowing further, pressed the <hi>Bird</hi> againe; asking her in what particular he had broken any of her Lessons? To whom the <hi>Bird,</hi> flickring a little with her wings, as one that gloried in her unexpected Libertie, answered;

Many excellent <hi>Moralls</hi> are shadowed in these <hi>Fables,</hi> which may deserve observation of the pregnant'st and maturest conceit; not onely in the <hi>Subject</hi> or substance of the admonition, but in the person which giveth this admonition. Where the Poets smoothly, but tartly, used to introduce Beasts, Birds, and such like creatures; admonishing man, the noblest of all creatures, of his dutie. Yea of Beasts, they made choice sometimes of the grossest and contemptiblest, as the <hi>Asse,</hi> to expresse the want of consideration in <hi>Man</hi>; whose diviner parts drowned in the Lees of sensuall corruption, or carnall securitie, become forgetfull of that, for which they were principally created. It were easie to enlarge this <hi>Subject</hi> with much varietie of examples; but my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is, in digressions, rather to touch than treat. Wee have handled two particulars, effectually moving to perswasion; The <hi>Life</hi> of the <hi>Speaker,</hi> that it be unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable; The <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Subject</hi> whereof hee speakes, that it be probable.

For oft-times, through want of matter (being gravell'd with an affected gravitie) they are forced to trifle time in impertinences, and leave that matter untouched for which they came. I could wish that <hi>Young Gentlemen</hi> would principally observe this

Lesson, to be <hi>sober</hi> in arguments of <hi>Discourse,</hi> but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in <hi>reasoning:</hi> for there is nothing that darkeneth or obscureth the Light of <hi>reason,</hi>

But especially in publike assemblies, where difference of judgements oft-times racke our <hi>Speeches</hi> to a higher pin, ought deliberation to be had: for there we cannot recall so soone what we have spoke amisse, as in private, where lesse premeditation may afford matter of satisfaction. I approve likewise of his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who would have such, whose pleasant conceits mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister content to the Hearer, if they meane to jest pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, and force their wits to stem the streame of worlds judgements, (which, I say, are different, and therefore more observant) that they use <hi>Pericles</hi> custome, who determining to speake any thing publikely, desired the immortall gods, that no improvident word should passe his mouth.

his cause, and told him how one had beaten him: <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes</hi> answered him againe, saying: <hi>I doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve this to be true:</hi> the Plaintiffe then thrusting out his voice aloud, said: <hi>What, hath he not beaten me? Yes indeed</hi> (quoth <hi>Demosthenes</hi>) <hi>I beleeve it now, for I heare the voice of a man that was beaten indeed.</hi> Whence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, what effects <hi>vehemencie</hi> of <hi>Passion</hi> produceth, expressing her wrongs so well in words, as they enforce beleefe to the Hearer. Likewise, because examples illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, though they doe not prove; touching <hi>instancie</hi> of <hi>Demonstration,</hi> we have an excellent one in that of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:</hi> who determined to strike the <hi>Senate</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> in feare, <hi>discoursed</hi> at large of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> warres, ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating the danger by proper circumstances, which threatned the publike State; and <hi>instancing</hi> the ruine of many eminent and flourishing States occasioned by the securitie of their people.

This might be confirmed by sundry Histories of serious consequence, especially in those memorable <hi>Sieges</hi> of <hi>Rhodes, Belgrade, Vienna,</hi> and many other; where the resolution of their <hi>Governours</hi> sleighted the affronts of that grand Enemie of Christendome, the <hi>Turke,</hi> and by their valour purchased to themselves both safetie and Honour. Thus farre have we proceeded in our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of <hi>Education,</hi> which we have sufficiently proved to be a <hi>Seasoner</hi> of <hi>Action,</hi> as well as of <hi>Speech</hi> or <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> Neither in <hi>actions militarie</hi> only, but in all <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall Arts</hi> practised in <hi>Rome</hi> during her glorious and flourishing State: from which even many ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies received their name, beginning and being. As the <hi>Figuli</hi> from the <hi>Potters</hi>; the <hi>Vitrei</hi> from the <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers,</hi> the <hi>Ligulae</hi> from the <hi>Pointers</hi>; the <hi>Pictores</hi> from the <hi>Painters</hi>; the <hi>Pistores</hi> from the <hi>Bakers.</hi> All which (as we may reade in most of the <hi>Roman</hi> Authors) had applied themselves, even in the first grounds of their <hi>Education</hi> to these Arts, wherein they grew so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, as they inriched their posteritie by their carefull industrie. But to speake truly of <hi>Action,</hi> as it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally taken, neither <hi>Speech,</hi> nor <hi>Knowledge,</hi> of which we have heretofore spoken, can well want it.

that many (too many, heaven knows) burie their <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> in the grave of obscuritie, reaping content in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known to themselves without communicating their <hi>Talent</hi> to others.

For this burying or suppressing of <hi>knowledge,</hi> it may be aptly compared to the rich <hi>Miser,</hi> whose best of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving is only possessing; for that <hi>Communicative good</hi> he knowes not, but admires so much the <hi>Golden Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> as he prefers it before the <hi>Numbring of his dayes.</hi> Yea, as it is much better not to have possessed, than to mis-imploy that whereof we were possessed; so is he in a happier case who never knew any thing, than such a <hi>Man</hi> who knew much, yet never made a <hi>Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> or edifying use of his <hi>knowledge.</hi> As may appeare by the Parable of the <hi>Talents.</hi> The <hi>Contemplative</hi> part indeed affords infinite content to the Spirituall man, whose more erected thoughts are not engaged to the Meditations of earth, but are spheared in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>these</hi> are also eager hunters after <hi>Fame,</hi> preferring opinion before all other inferiour respects, and wishing rather themselves to die, than it should die. Whence it was, that <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> telling <hi>Alexander</hi> that there were many worlds; <hi>Alexander</hi> wept, replying, <hi>That he had not wonne one:</hi> implying, that his <hi>Fame,</hi> being that which he principally tendred, having scarce yet dispersed it selfe to the circumference of one world; it would be long, ere it could diffuse or dilate it selfe to many worlds. Lastly, they are <hi>Servants</hi> of <hi>Businesse</hi>; being placed neere the <hi>Helme</hi> of the <hi>State:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, like wise and vigilant <hi>Pilots,</hi> must be carefull lest the <hi>Rudder</hi> of the <hi>State</hi> be not shaken by their securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Neither is their <hi>State</hi> so sure, that it should move them to be secure: for men in high places are for most part pursued by many Enemies, whose eyes are ever prying into their actions, which they invert, by labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to bring the <hi>State</hi> in distaste with their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. Now what meanes better to frustrate their practices, than by a serious and cautelous eye to looke into their owne actions? <hi>Diogenes</hi> being as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Now these Enemies of <hi>Greatnesse,</hi> if right use be made of them, may conferre no small profit to such as they hate. NASICA, when the <hi>Roman</hi> Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale was supposed to be in most secure estate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause freed of their enemies, affirmed, that though the <hi>Achaians</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were both brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the yoake of bondage, yet they were in most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, because none were left, whom they might either feare for danger, or who should keepe them in awe.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:4869:69"/>
This we shall finde verified even in our selves: for tell me, are wee not most circumspect in all our actions, wherein we have to deale with our enemie? Are we not fearefull lest by some inconsiderate or prejudicate act, he take advantage of us, and consequently circumvent us? So as our <hi>Enemies</hi> may be used as <hi>Tutors</hi> or <hi>Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> to instruct us, warning us to be advised what wee undertake, lest they take hold of us in our mistake. There is also another benefit redounding to us, of which it were likely we should be deprived, if we wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Enemies,</hi> by whom this benefit is on us conferred. And it is this; wanting <hi>Enemies,</hi> we many times make of our best friends, <hi>Enemies.</hi> Whence <hi>Oenomademus</hi> in a faction in the Ile of <hi>Chios,</hi> counselled his fellowes that they should not expell all their <hi>Enemies,</hi> but still leave some in the Citie, <hi>lest</hi> (quoth he) <hi>being void of all our Enemies, we should begin to quarrell with our friends.</hi> Thus you see, how <hi>Men</hi> of <hi>Place</hi> are of all others least <hi>exempted</hi> from a <hi>Vocation</hi>; for as <hi>Idlenesse</hi> would give them occasion to sinne, so by their <hi>Enemies</hi> should they be soone detected of shame: being more subject to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction in those actions which are their best, than like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to plead a protection for such as are their worst.

Wee shall see in most places both at home and abroad, how such trades or <hi>Vocations</hi> are most used, as may best suit with the nature and condition of the place. As in our <hi>Port-townes</hi> trafficke and commerce, conferring no lesse benefit to the state by importance,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:4869:73"/>
than profit to other Countries by exportance.

Amongst which, I cannot be unmindfull of the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Towne of <hi>Kendall,</hi> and worthy care which they have to see their very young children put to work, being a labour which requires no great strength, to wit, <hi>Wooll-worke.</hi> Wherein, so approved hath their care and industrie beene, as they have gained them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves no small esteeme in forraine places, who are made partakers of the fruit of their labours. For I have known a familie, consisting of seven or eight persons, maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the work of two or three stones of wooll, which amounted not above thirty shillings: and with this they maintained credit, living in an honest and decent manner. Whose labours as they were laudable, so have they beene no lesse furthered, favoured, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by our late gracious Soveraigne of renowmed memory; who, of his princely clemencie, hath dammed all such impositions or heavy taxations as might any way impaire or impeach the free use of that Trade. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit now of late, the Towne of <hi>Kendall,</hi> so famous for <hi>Wooll-worke,</hi> by reason of a late decrease or decay of Trade in those parts, is growne no lesse penurious than populous: so as (with griefe I speake it) such Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants as formerly by their paine and industrie were able to give an almes at their doore, are now forced to begge their almes from doore to doore. The redresse where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as it hath beene by the Prince and those prudent guides and guardians of our State, the Lords of his Privie Counsell, duely intended; so no doubt, but by their wise care it shall be accordingly effected, &amp; those poore people after so many miseries sustained, wholly releeved; to the advancement of Gods glory,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:4869:74"/>
the supportance of many a needfull family, and the succeeding renowne of his Majesty, to whom every subject oweth his life, love and loyalty. The like commendation I could give to the <hi>Copperworkes</hi> used in the North; more especially about <hi>Keswicke,</hi> where divers <hi>Dutch-men</hi> being planted, have for many yeares expressed no lesse judgement than industry in sundry excellent and choice experiments, which to their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding fame may perpetuate their memorie. For these, like cunning and experienced <hi>Artizans,</hi> have to doe in the bowels of the earth, whence they digge <hi>copper,</hi> which with incredible paines they bring to the <hi>Hammer.</hi> For so steepe, ragged and cliffie are those mountaines, whence their <hi>Copper</hi> is digged, as it might seeme a matter of impossibility to effect so intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate a worke; but so infatigable are the Labourers which they employ, as their patience in suffering is no lesse to be commended, than their skill in contriving to be admired.

In the carriage whereof, divers neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie cautions have beene formerly observed by States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. As first, to avoid all occasions of distrust, never to shew too much inwardnesse with forraine States: for this may beget a suspect in your <hi>Prince,</hi> that your aymes are neither faire nor loyall. It was this which broke <hi>Byrons</hi> necke: being accused to have had confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with one <hi>Picote,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Objections framed against <hi>Byron,</hi> for his Treatie with forraine States.</note> borne at <hi>Orleans,</hi> and fled into <hi>Flanders</hi> to have intelligence with the Arch-duke, to which <hi>Picote</hi> he had given an hundred and fifty crowns for two voyages to that effect. Likewise it was obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted against him, that he had treated with the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> three dayes after his comming to <hi>Paris.</hi> Likewise the intelligence he had from the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> in the taking of <hi>Bourges,</hi> giving him advice to attempt against the Kings Armie. Likewise that hee should bring the King before Saint <hi>Katherines</hi> to be slaine there: and to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:4869:79"/>
that end had written to the Governour, giving him some tokens to know his Majestie. Likewise, that he had sent <hi>La Fin</hi> to treat with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Fuentes.</hi> To which, although he replyed, and in some sort purged himselfe, yet those treaties or parlyes which were proved against him, shewed him guiltie of divers indirect proceedings against him. It is dangerous therfore to entertain conference with <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> in matters of State: for howsoever your aymes may be faithfull and honest, such <hi>Treaties</hi> may be so racked and misconstrued by such as maligne your greatnesse, as they will bring you in danger, if not to finall distresse. It is no lesse dangerous to one imployed in affaires of State,<note place="margin">Credulitie in two respects dangerous to persons im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of State. Credulitie in beleeving the relations of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> to be too credulous; and that in two respects: either by being too credulous in <hi>giving trust</hi> to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of others, or by being too credulous in <hi>impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his thoughts</hi> to the secrecie of others. For the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> it detracts much from the worth and estimate of man, yea (and if I may so say) argues great indiscretion to have an care open to all reports, seconding whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is related, with an opinion of credulitie. For such as these, whom either greatnesse of <hi>Place</hi> by <hi>Descent,</hi> or some more noble and native characters of <hi>personall</hi> worth have advanced, need not want for <hi>Relaters</hi> in this kinde, especially if they finde them apt to beleeve whatsoever they shall be readie to report. Neither are any sort of men more subject to the garbe of strange and novell relations than <hi>Travellers:</hi> who may arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate to themselves a libertie of invention in this kinde, by authoritie. Whence it is said, that <hi>Travellers, Poets</hi> and <hi>Lyers,</hi> are three words all of one signification.
Now there is no meanes better to avoid the company of these fabulous <hi>Relaters,</hi> than by interrupting them, or by requiting their <hi>Tales</hi> (to argue their incredibilitie) telling stories farre more strange, and indeed beyond the compasse of common sense.: whereof I have heard a
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:4869:80"/>
                  <hi>merry conceited <hi>Tale</hi> to this effect: A certaine <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller,</hi> or at least one who desired though he never deserved that <hi>title,</hi> reporting wonderfull and incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible things which hee had seene in his travell, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rest related this: Vpon a time it befell (said he) that I travelled along a certaine desart in <hi>Arabia felix,</hi> where I with others who then accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied me, were assailed by a violent showre, so as labouring to flie for shelter to some covert, wee might perceive a little Coppice, wherein grew great store of Cabbages of such huge proportion, as the very leaves thereof (so largely extended were the spurges) might by their greatnesse give shadow to five hundred men. This <hi>Tale</hi> being told, one amongst the rest, to answer his <hi>Tale,</hi> makes this reply by way of discourse upon such occurrents as had hapned him in his Travell, proceeding thus; It fortuned that I with some other Gentlemen of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ranke and quality, travelled neare the <hi>Riphean</hi> Mountaines, in the clifts of which Mountaines abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all metalls, but especially of copper, is daily found: Now as we coasted along, we might perceive some three leagues westward from those <hi>Mountains,</hi> a great number of people beating and knocking with incessant labour, but for what end wee knew not: wherefore with one consent we resolved to approach neerer them, and see about what they so eagerly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured. Where we found five hundred Braziers ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of one Caldron, which was of so huge propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as not any one of all those Braziers, though they were all employed in one worke, could heare one another strike. Good God (quoth the former <hi>Traveller</hi>) for what use was so huge a caldron made? Surely (replyed the second) I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine for what use it should bee, unlesse it were to boyle your Cabbage in.</hi>
This present and pregnant
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:4869:80"/>
answer so daunted that fabulous <hi>Traveller,</hi> as he was ever after more sparing in discourse of his Travells. A <hi>States-man</hi> ought likewise to beware of giving credit to all forra in relations: for divers there be who presuming of the distance of place, will invent and vent their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions to curry favour: having so couched and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested their new-minted <hi>Newes,</hi> as they passe for cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, at least they seeme probable for the present. And herein certainly have many beene abused, giving ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation to what was spoken onely by way of insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. The second respect, wherein a <hi>States-man</hi> ought not to bee too credulous,<note place="margin">Credulity in imparting his thoughts to the secrecie of others.</note> is this; hee must not bee too open brested in <hi>imparting his thoughts</hi> to the secrecy of others. For if we say, that even a private man commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his secrecy to another, becomes his <hi>slave</hi> to whom he committed it: much more a <hi>States-man,</hi> whose af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires have no other limit than the <hi>publike state,</hi> by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting his thoughts, or rather laying himselfe open to the trust or secrecy of others, makes himselfe bound, where he was before free; yea, he endangers the body of the <hi>State,</hi> wherof he is an especiall member, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending or committing her private intendments to the hazard of rumour,<note place="margin">For Cabinet counsell this may be their Motto; <hi>Plenu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that which they least looke for.

And first for the Antiquity of <hi>Dice-play,</hi> we have plenty of authorities every where occurring: being much used by all the Roman Emperours at banquets and solemne meetings, where they bestowed themselves and the time, at no game so much as dice. So as, <hi>Augustus</hi> was said to be a serious gamester at dice: affecting them much, when at any time hee retired from Court or Campe. Whence it is, that <hi>Suetonius</hi> bringeth in <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> speaking thus; <hi>Si quas manus remisi cuique exegissem: aut retinuissem quod cuique donavi, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissem, &amp;c.

This Emperour being naturally addicted to all cruelty, chanced one day amongst others to send for one <hi>Canius Iulus</hi> a Philosopher of eminent esteeme at that time: with whom, after some conference, the Emperour fell into such a rage, as he bade him depart thence, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect within short time to receive due censure for his boldnesse: <hi>For</hi> (quoth he) <hi>flatter not thy selfe with a foolish hope of longer life, for I have doo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, there is no one game which may seeme to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the state of mans life to the full, so well as the <hi>Chesse.</hi> For there you shall find Princes and Beggers, and persons of all conditions ranked in their proper and peculiar places; yet when the game is done, they are all thrust up in a bagge together: and where then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares any difference betwixt the poorest Begger, and the potentest Peere? The like may be observed in this stage of humane frailty: while we are here set to shew
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:4869:96"/>
during the <hi>Chesse-game</hi> of this life, we are according to our severall ranks esteemed; and fit it should be so, for else should all degrees be promiscuously confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: but no sooner is the game done, the thred of our short life spunne, than wee are throwne into a bagge, a poore shrouding sheet, for that is all that wee must carrie with us: where there shall bee no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the greatest and least, highest and lowest: for then it shall not bee asked us how much wee had, but how we disposed of that we had. Thus farre have we discoursed of the first part, to wit, of the <hi>difference</hi> of <hi>recreations:</hi> thinking it sufficient to have touched on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such as are most usuall and knowne unto us. For some others, which wee have purposely omitted, lest our <hi>Mindian</hi> gate should grow greater than our City, we shall have occasion to speake of some of them, when we are to discourse of such <hi>Recreations,</hi> as are to be made choice of by <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of best ranke and quality.

as they betake themselves to, that they bee never too much besotted with them. This course that <hi>Gentleman</hi> tooke, who perceiving himselfe too much affected on <hi>Hawking,</hi> resolved one day to weane his minde a little from it, by trying his patience with some inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences incident to it. Wherefore he set a lazie <hi>Haggard</hi> on his fist, and goes to his sport: where he finds store of game but few flights; for wheresoever the <hi>Partridge</hi> flew, his <hi>Hawke</hi> never made farther flight than from tree to tree, which drove the <hi>Gentleman</hi> faulconer to such impatience, as he lesse affected the pleasure for long time after.

But these experiments as they are oft failing, where the minde is not come to setling: so in my opinion there is no meanes better or surer to weane man, endued with reason, from being too much captived or enchained with these pleasures, than to consider what benefits redound from <hi>moderate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie being unto him referred, he constantly affirmed, that it was not onely lawfull for them to set forth and act those <hi>Playes,</hi> but for Boyes to put on womens apparell for the time.

And in these did <hi>Satyrus</hi> (no doubt) among the <hi>Greekes</hi> shew an admirable Art, being so highly extolled by <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> (for unto him did this <hi>Satyrus</hi> propose the first forme of speaking plainly and articulately) as
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:4869:108"/>
he was no lesse praised by him, than the <hi>Roman Roscius</hi> was by <hi>Cicero,</hi> or <hi>Aesopus</hi> to whom <hi>Cicero</hi> useth many titles of love and familiaritie in his Epistles. For <hi>Roscius</hi> and <hi>Aesopus</hi> were held the choicest and chiefest Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, even at that time when the Common-weale ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled not onely in Eloquence, but also in Wisdome. The like of <hi>Pilades</hi> and <hi>Hyla,</hi> Master and Scholer, who were such passionate Actors, as they enforced admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the hearer. But to what end should I prosecute either <hi>Comick</hi> or <hi>Tragick</hi> subjects any further? My opinion briefly is this; As <hi>Comedies</hi> should breath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Terences</hi> art, <hi>Cecilius</hi> gravitie, <hi>Menanders</hi> sweetnesse, <hi>Aristophanes</hi> conceit, and <hi>Plautus</hi> wit: so <hi>Tragedies</hi> should relish of nothing but of the royall and majestick measures of <hi>Sophocles,</hi> the sententious fulnesse of <hi>Euripides,</hi> and the sincere integritie of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca.</hi> For these which tend to corrupt youth, making their <hi>Stages Stewes,</hi> or their <hi>Scenes</hi> meere <hi>Satyres,</hi> to detract from the credit or estimation of any person ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther publike or private; as their Authors deserve due punishment, so should they be avoided: the former sort, because they are in danger to deprave us; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, because perhaps wee shall heare them touch the credit of such as are neere us. For such Enterludes <hi>(Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen)</hi> as participate with neither of these, but in a temperate and equall course mix profit with honest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; you shall account the time you bestow in hearing them, not altogether fruitlesly spent. For albeit the <hi>Italians</hi> are held worthy before all others to carry away the Garland for Poesie, being for number and measure fuller, and for weight and merit better, as may appeare in the happy labours of <hi>Petrarch</hi> and <hi>Boccace</hi>; yet if wee looke homeward, and observe the grace of our presentments, the curiositie of our properties, and proprietie of our action, wee may justly conclude, that no Nation is or hath beene so exquisite in that kinde.

But to draw in our sailes touching this <hi>Recreation</hi>; as I approve of the <hi>moderate</hi> use and recourse which our <hi>Gentlemen</hi> make to <hi>Playes</hi>; so I wholly condemne the daily frequenting of them: as some there be (especially in this Citie) who, for want of better imployment, make it their Vocation. And these I now speake of, be our <hi>Ordinary Gentlemen,</hi> whose day-taske is this in a word:<note place="margin">

                  </note> They leave their beds, to put on their cloathes formally, repaire to an <hi>Ordinary,</hi> and see a <hi>Play</hi> daily. These can finde time enough for <hi>Recreation,</hi> but not a minutes space for <hi>Devotion.</hi> So as I much feare mee, when they shall be struck with sicknesse, and lie on their death-bed, it will fare with them as it fared with a young <hi>Gentlewoman</hi> within these few yeeres; who being accustomed in her health every day to see one <hi>Play</hi> or other, was at last strucke with a grievous sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse even unto death: during which time of her sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, being exhorted by such <hi>Divines</hi> as were there present, to call upon God, that hee would in mercy looke upon her, as one deafe to their exhortation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ever crying, <hi>Oh Hieronimo, Hieronimo, me thinks I see thee brave Hieronimo!</hi> Neither could shee be drawne from this with all their perswasions; but fixing her eyes intentively, as if shee had seene <hi>Hieronimo</hi> acted, sending out a deepe sigh, shee suddenly died. And let this suffice to have beene spoken of the <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> use of this <hi>Recreation:</hi> upon which I have the longer insisted, because I am not ignorant how divers and different opinions have beene holden touching the lawfulnesse of <hi>Stage-playes,</hi> which I resolved to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile in as briefe and plaine a manner as I could, before I descended to the rest.</p>
               <p>For as much as wee have begunne to treat of such <hi>Recreations</hi> as require small use or exercise of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, we will first proceed with such as follow, being ranked in the same Siedge, because <hi>Recreations</hi> of the

These pleasures are most commonly affected by <hi>Youth,</hi> because they have agility and ability of body to maintaine the pursuit of them: whence the Poet;

The reason may be this; he cannot endure restraint: for the heat of <hi>youth</hi> must needs take aire, or it choaks it selfe with too much holding.

So apt are many in inventing, and eager in pursuing ought which may raise them a name, though in things meerely indifferent. For as reputation is a common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of extraordinary vertue, so every one laboureth to acquire the end, albeit they misse the meanes of acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it. For how should any one imagine (unlesse his conceit were wholly darkned) that these things could be any meanes to perpetuate his name? But so soone transported is <hi>Youth</hi> with any phantasie suggested, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit upon no sufficient ground builded) as whatsoever his conceit whispers to him, that may tend to his praise, he entertaines it with a greedy and eager desire, labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to effect what may gaine him popular esteeme.<note place="margin">

To speake much touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>Recreation</hi> I will not addresse my discourse: only this is my opinion, that as it is <hi>generous,</hi> so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally is it most <hi>harmelesse,</hi> so it be <hi>moderately</hi> used; for otherwise it may weaken or enfeeble the body, impaire the health, and be occasion of many inconveniences: for in my discourse upon the particular branch of this <hi>Observation,</hi> I am onely to approve of such <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations</hi> as are used with <hi>Moderation.</hi> As <hi>Hawking,</hi> which (as I before observed) is a pleasure for high and mounting spirits: such as will not stoope to inferiour Lures, having their mindes so far above, as they scorne to partake with them. It is rare to consider, how a wild <hi>Bird</hi> should be so brought to hand, and so well mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as to make us such pleasure in the aire: but most of all to forgoe her native liberty and feeding, and returne to her former servitude and diet. But in this, as in the rest, wee are taught to admire the great goodnesse and bountie of God, who hath not only given us the Birds of the aire, with their flesh to feed us, with their voice to cheere us, but with their flight to delight us. The <hi>Eagle,</hi> which is indeed the Prince of Birds, and the <hi>prime Hawke,</hi> was observed much among the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> in all their Auguries: so as an <hi>Eagle</hi> hovering in the aire, in the reigne of <hi>Augustus,</hi> and at last setling upon the name of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and just upon the first letter of that name,<note place="margin">

or Birds of Augury, by which they collected what their successe should be, both in peace and war. Albeit, some there were among the <hi>Heathen,</hi> who made small ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them: so as <hi>Claudius Pulcher,</hi> when in taking his <hi>Auspicia,</hi> or the predictions of his successe before <hi>Sicily,</hi> the <hi>Pullets</hi> would not feed, <hi>He commanded they should be plunged in the Sea, that they might drinke, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they would not eat.</hi> It is the saying of an ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>That the piercing eye of the Eagle exceeds the sight of all other Birds:</hi>

Whence many secret and sacred uses might be gathered, (for this is but the type of a divine Morall) if I should insist upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of that blessed Father; but I must briefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend, to speake of the <hi>Moderate</hi> use of this <hi>Recreation.</hi> This pleasure, as it is a princely delight, so it moveth many to be so dearely enamoured of it, as they will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe any charge, rather than forgoe it: which makes me recall to minde a merry tale which I have read, to this effect.
Divers men having entred into discourse, touching the superfluous care (I will not say folly) of such as kept <hi>Dogs</hi> and <hi>Hawkes</hi> for <hi>Hawking</hi>; one <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lùs</hi> a <hi>Florentine</hi> stood up and spake. <q>Not without cause (quoth he) did that foole of <hi>Millan</hi> laugh at these! and being entreated to tell the tale, he thus proceeded. Vpon a time (quoth he) there was a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen of <hi>Millan,</hi> a Physitian for such as were distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted or Lunaticke; who tooke upon him within a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:4869:112"/>
time to cure such as were brought unto him. And he cured them after this sort; Hee had a plat of ground neere his house, and in it a pit of corrupt and stinking water, wherein he bound naked such as were mad to a stake, some of them knee-deepe, others to the groine, and some others deeper, according to the degree of their madnesse, where hee so long pined them with water and hunger, till they seemed sound. Now amongst others, there was one brought, whom he had put thigh-deepe in water: who after fifteene dayes began to recover, beseeching the Physitian that he might be taken out of the water. The Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian taking compassion of him, tooke him out, but with this condition, that he should not goe out of the roome. Having obeyed him certaine dayes, he gave him liberty to walk up and downe the house, but not to passe the out-gate: while the rest of his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which were many, remaining in the water, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently observed their Physitians command. Now it chanced, as on a time he stood at the gate, (for out he durst not goe, for feare he should returne to the Pit) he beckned to a young <hi>Gentleman</hi> to come unto him, who had a <hi>Hawke</hi> and two Spaniells, being moved with the novelty thereof; for to his remembrance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee fell mad, hee had never seene the like. The young <hi>Gentleman</hi> being come unto him; Sir (quoth he) I pray you heare me a word or two, and answer me at your pleasure. What is this you ride on (quoth he) and how doe you imploy him? This is a Horse (replied he) and I keepe him for <hi>Hawking.</hi> But what call you that, you carry on your fist, and how doe you use it? This is a <hi>Hawke</hi> (said he) and I use to fly with it at Pluver and Partridge. But what (quoth he) are these which follow you, what doe they, or wherein doe they profit you? These are dogges (said he) and necessary for <hi>Hawking,</hi> to finde and retrive my game.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:4869:112"/>
And what were these Birds worth, for which you provide so many things, if you should reckon all you take for a whole yeere? Who answering, He knew not well, but they were worth a very little, not above six crownes. The man replied; what then may be the charge you are at with your Horse, dogges and Hawke? Some fiftie crownes, said he. Whereat, as one wondring at the folly of the young <hi>Gentleman</hi>: Away, away Sir, I pray you quickly, and fly hence before our Physitian returne home: for if hee finde you here, as one that is maddest man alive, hee will throw you into his Pit, there to be cured with others that have lost their wits; and more than all others, for he will set you chin-deepe in the water.</q>

                  </note> that the use or exercise of <hi>Hawking,</hi> is the greatest folly, unlesse sometimes used by such as are of good estate, and for <hi>Recreation</hi> sake.

The Physitian saith, that it is the best exercise which is, <hi>ad ruborem, non adsudorem</hi>; refreshing the spirits, and stirring up the bloud a little, but not putting a man into any great sweat: for he that makes his <hi>Recreation</hi> a toyle, makes himselfe likewise Pleasures Thral.

                  </note>It is true, neither am I so stupid, as not to conceive how insupportable the burden of those wrongs is, which touch our name. So as indeed, (to speake as a man unto men,) these wrongs are above the nature of mortalitie to beare: for the <hi>naturall man</hi> tasting more of earth than heaven, whilest he ponders the qualitie of his disgrace, and how farre he stands engaged, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the opinion of men, to beare himselfe like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and not to burie such wrongs in silence, as if sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse of the nature of an injurie; he never considers what the divine Law injoynes, but casteth his eye upon the wrong he sustaines. Wherein, if passion will needs over-master reason, (albeit I doe not hold it consonant
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:4869:115"/>
to the Divine Law, Morall, or Nationall, but to all <hi>generous</hi> spirits experimentally usefull) I could wish him to come off faire at the first, for this either wins him the buckler, or loseth it: so shall hee ever gaine to himselfe an esteeme of conceit, in knowing the nature of a wrong; and an opinion of spirit, in daring to wipe off the disgrace that shall be laid upon him. For this is my Position, <hi>Faile at the first, and faile ever:</hi> for as the first onset terrifies the enemie, so in actions of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the only meanes to gaine opinion is to come off bravely in the beginning. Now perchance it may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, that he from whom you have received wrong, will take no notice of your distaste, but will doe as <hi>hee</hi> did, who receiving a <hi>Challenge</hi> upon some personall touch, whereby he apprehended the occasion for his best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, of making choice (as the <hi>Challenged</hi> may) of <hi>time, place, weapon,</hi> and <hi>second,</hi> returned this answer to the Messenger; For the <hi>time,</hi> I know not when; for the <hi>place,</hi> when that time comes, it shall be the <hi>Alpes</hi>; for the <hi>weapon,</hi> it shall be <hi>Guyes</hi> sword that slew the Cow on <hi>Dunmooth</hi> heath; and for my <hi>Second,</hi> it shall be your selfe, that I may bring you within the compasse of <hi>Duelloes.</hi> If with such your fortune be to deale, (as many there are more valiant in tongue than hand, more apt to offer wrong than tender satisfaction;) know thus much, that these <hi>Alpes</hi> which hee hath named, and whereto he never meanes to come, is what <hi>place</hi> soever you shall meet him; the <hi>time,</hi> whensoever you shall have fit opportunitie to encounter him; the <hi>weapon,</hi> though he chuse it, you may refuse it, (because it is too closely kept to come to) and make choice of your owne weapon lest by going to <hi>Warwicke</hi> Castle to procure a sword, you forget your wrong before you come there; and the <hi>Second,</hi> your only selfe; that as you are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly wronged, you may be particularly righted: for as the wrong toucheth you and no <hi>Second,</hi> so you are
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:4869:116"/>
to right your selfe without a <hi>Second.</hi> But the safest and surest course (as I said before) not to partake with men of this condition, is to refraine their company and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation: for these <hi>firie Spirits,</hi>

Wherfore <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> let me advise you in a word, so to entertaine time in <hi>Recreation,</hi> as the pleasure you take therein, draw not your minds from more serious and usefull imployments. I have proposed to you, and made choice for you, of some <hi>Recreations</hi> which may no lesse delight and benefit your mindes, than these other active delights doe your bodies; use them, and you shall finde such pleasure in them, as you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive profit and pleasure so equally mixed, as if at first intended to make your delight perfect. And so I come to the last branch, shewing <hi>how a Gentleman is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow himselfe in them.</hi>

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:4869:122"/>
So as I have observed some intraunced (as it were) with joy in the chace of <hi>Hare,</hi> or the flight of <hi>Hawke</hi>; which in my opinion argued much lightnesse: for no sooner was their pleasure at a stay or default, than all their former delight was turned to a contrary passion. I commend therefore his resolution who said; <hi>He was never so over-joyed with pleasure, but he thought it good to allay that surpassing joy, with the remembrance of the end of that pleasure.</hi> It is an excellent thing to moderate our joyes, by considering the shortnesse of them; and to allay the height of them, by observing what breaches or intermissions are incident to them. Wherefore above all, it becommeth a <hi>Gentleman</hi> to be circumspect in this kinde, for even by his outward car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage may his weaknesse bee discovered. Sure I am, there is nothing that tasteth more of true wisdome, than to temper our desires in effects of joy: so as I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not sufficiently wonder,<note place="margin">☞</note> how <hi>Chylo</hi> being accounted one of the seven Sages of <hi>Greece,</hi>

The like we reade of <hi>Argia</hi> the prophetesse, who being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in a chariot of gold to the Temple by her two sonnes, whereat shee conceived no lesse joy than if her two sonnes had beene invested with the title of <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,</hi> through excessive joy immediately died. But these passions rather become women than men, who should be themselves still, but especially when they feele any such conceit undermining them. It is written of <hi>Polycrates,</hi> that meditating one day with himselfe, how he had never any thing which crossed him all his life, but enjoyed all successe both at home and abroad, so as he became fearefull to his foes, and powerfull to his friends: resolved to try how hee might crosse his good fortune, by a voluntary incurring of losing that he did exceedingly love. Wherefore one day he went unto the Sea-side, where taking off a Ring which he did
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:4869:122"/>
especially tender, hee threw it into the Sea, intending thereby to crosse himselfe, whom fortune would not: but see how <hi>Polycrates</hi> was crossed in his crosses: for not long after, a fisher-man came and presented him the Ring hee had lost, having found it in the belly of a fish; which did not a little trouble the <hi>Prince,</hi> saying; <hi>I perceive the gods owe mee a displeasure, which they will doe when I least expect it, and make mee so much the more unfortunate, in that I never knew what misfortune meant.</hi> Which he afterwards found true, being depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved both of Crowne and Dignitie. Certainly, there is no meanes better to attemper and allay ones joy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the pursuit of any pleasure, than to crosse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the quest thereof: for this tasteth of true man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, when one can master his affections, and stay himselfe in that he loves. Neither is this hard to doe being once assayed; for wee shall finde more true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in the <hi>moderation</hi> of our pleasure, than in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure it selfe. I have heard of some young <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> who purposely crossing themselves in some one pleasure or <hi>Recreation</hi> which they loved, and betaking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to their chamber, apprehended such a deepe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the fruition of their pleasure, as they visibly (as it were) enjoyed that pleasure in their chamber, which others enjoyed in the field. That conceit is strong I will not deny; but that it should worke so strange and strong an effect, I am doubtfull: yet whosoere they be (if any such there be) sure I am they may well crosse themselves in pleasures abroad, having such pleasant conceits within themselves. Now, as I would have young <hi>

You shall see some of these peasantly <hi>Gamesters,</hi> who partly for desire of winning, or else for feare of losing, shew a perpetuall palsey in their joynts, so full of troubled thoughts they are, or passionate feares, which apparently discover a basenesse of disposition in them, whom either hope of gaine or feare of losse can drive to such extremes. I would have you therefore so to <hi>bestow</hi> your selves in these, as they may never force a change of colour in you: for there is nothing that may derogate more from the native <hi>Character</hi> of a <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> than to expresse the least sembla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Neither is it any lesse touch to a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> whose affections should be so composed as they may expresse his <hi>Nature</hi> without any other <hi>Character,</hi> to fall into <hi>passion</hi> for ought that he shall lose.
Albeit I have heard of one, who (much subject to this imperfection) chanced to be reproved
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:4869:123"/>
by his friend, who in friendly and familiar sort wished him either to learne more patience in gaming, or else to surcease from game. <q>What (quoth he to his friend) doest thou thinke I am a stock or stone, that I should have no sense of my losse? Surely I thinke there is no man that knowes how he comes by his money, but will be moved for the losse of it.</q>
But I approve not of his <hi>Maxime:</hi> you shall see an old <hi>Gamester</hi> beare all crosse chances with an equall and undejected spirit, whereas our young <hi>Gamesters</hi> (for passion is most inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to Novices) upon a crosse throw, pull their haire, teare the Cards, stamp and fret like gumm'd grogram: so farre they are from patience for want of experience. Their younger and unmellowed yeeres never felt the crosses of a <hi>Gamester,</hi> and therefore can hardly digest them when they come. This the Philosopher seemes to confirme,<note place="margin">

                  </note> saying; <hi>Nothing can be violent, being once habituate.</hi> For use or custome as it makes perfectnesse, so it begets a composednesse of minde, to endure with patience whatsoever the extremitie of fortune may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict. But now in my discourse of <hi>Passion,</hi> which makes men so much forget themselves, as they will, rather than want a fit subject to revenge their ill fortunes on, minister occasion of offence to their dearest friends; there is one thing which I would have our young <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen</hi> to take heed of, and that is, in their heat and height of passion to forsweare gaming at all, or with such an one, because they had never fortune to be savers at his hands; yet, as men carelesse of what they sweare, without respect to what they formerly protested, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently fall, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o game againe with the selfe-same company which they had so lately abjured. A dolefull and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full example wee had of this within these few yeeres of <hi>one,</hi> whose more eminent parts interested him greatly in his Countries hope; yet having dipt his hand in bloud, was according to justice and equitie adjudged
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:4869:124"/>
to die, which was afterwards accordingly executed. This <hi>Gentleman,</hi> whose education had beene ever with the best, and in the most frequented places, used much gaming, at which he had generally ill fortune; so as, feeling the smart of it, he resolved, binding his resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with a solemne protestation, that if ever he gamed againe, he might be hange<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: which protestation was so usuall with him, as nothing more frequent. But see this <hi>Gentlemans</hi> miserable end! Within few yeeres after he suffered in himselfe what he had so often wished for himselfe. Take example hence, you I say, who are so prodigall in oathes, vowing, protesting, and swearing in your heat of <hi>passion,</hi> what you are no lesse apt to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get having coold your <hi>passion.</hi> For though you little feare the effecting of that which you wish to your selves, yet time may come when you would wish you had not used those imprecations upon your selves. There is another thing likewise which I could wish young <hi>Gentlemen</hi> to be mindfull of, and it is to make distinction of times for their <hi>Recreations:</hi> for as all times are not for all pleasures, no more are pleasures for all times. Wee are therefore to reserve so much time for our more serious affaires, as not to give way to pleasure or delight, and so neglect what wee should principally intend.<note place="margin">

These are good exercisers of the minds, and such, as being made <hi>Recreations</hi> only, and no tricks to circumvent, may afford some help or benefit to the <hi>Gamesters</hi> understanding. Now therefore, doe not

(<hi>Theotimus</hi>-like) preferre lust before your eyes; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre not any profit you are to reape by gaming, before the inward benefit which you may reape by concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. It is a mercenary Trade, to frequent Gaming-houses for gaine, to alter the propertie of a <hi>Recreation,</hi> and make that an anguish which should be a solace, a torture which should be a pleasure.

How simple he, whose conceit is grounded on the constancie of fortune, who is only constant in inconstancie? How pittifully pittilesse is his case, who puts finger in the eye, because he hath felt her frowne? How forlorne is his hope, who having had experience of the extremest affronts of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, is ever giving himselfe occasion of new sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?

So as it may seeme, it is not given to man to <hi>love</hi> and to be <hi>wise</hi>; because the Lover is ever blinded with affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards his beloved; so as, he dis-esteemes honour, profit, yea life it selfe, so hee may gratifie his beloved. But my opinion is quite contrary; for I hold this as a firme and undoubted <hi>Maxime</hi>; that he who is not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>love,</hi> cannot be <hi>wise.</hi> For is he wise, that reposeth such trust in his owne strength, as if he stood in no need of <hi>friends?</hi> Is he wise, who dependeth so much on his owne advice, as if all wit and wisdome were treasured in his braine? Is he wise, who being sicke, would not be visited; poore, and would not be succoured; afflicted, and would not be comforted; throwne downe, and would not be raised? Surely in the same case is he, who sleights the purchace of a <hi>friend,</hi> preferring his owne profit before so inestimable a prize. There is none, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be valiant, or a profest coward, but may stand in need of a <hi>friend</hi> in a corner. For be hee valiant, hee stands in need of a <hi>friend</hi> to second him; if a coward, he needs one to support him: Therefore, whosoever wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth fortitude, whether it be in minde or bodie, let him embrace <hi>friendship</hi>; for if his weaknesse proceed from the minde, hee shall finde a choice receit in the breast of his <hi>friend,</hi> to strengthen and corroborate him, so as griefe may assaile or assault him, but it cannot dismay or amate him. Againe, if his weaknesse proceed from the bodie, that weaknesse is supplied by the strength of his <hi>friend,</hi> who will be an eye to direct him, and a foot

to sustaine him. <hi>Telephus,</hi> when he could finde none amongst his <hi>friends</hi> to cure his wound, permitted his enemie to doe it: and he who purposed to kill <hi>Prome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus</hi> the <hi>Thessalian,</hi> opened his impostume with his sword. If such effects have proceeded from enmitie, what rare and incredible effects may be imagined to take their beginning from amitie? Than which, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is stricter in respect of the bond, so nothing is more continuate in respect of the time: being so firme, as not to be dissolved; so strict, as not to be anulled; so lasting, as never to be ended.

Likewise, as I would not have you to entertaine so maine a businesse without mature advice, so I would not have you wholly rely upon a friends counsell; but as you are to have the greatest Oare in the Boat, so to make your selfe your owne carver: for he that is enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to his <hi>Choice,</hi> makes a dangerous bargaine.

Wherefore, you should much wrong your <hi>Choice</hi> to restraine her from the use of any pleasure which she affecteth: for so well disposed is she, as shee affecteth no other pleasure than to converse with Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which she holdeth at a higher rate than to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased with a masse of treasure.

How wisely did <hi>Aurelius</hi> cover his <hi>Faustina's</hi> shame, labouring to reclaime by mildnesse, when he could not prevaile by bitternesse?

How resolutely did <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> forbeare his wife <hi>Zantippe,</hi> though a froward woman, because he thought he might better and with more patience converse with others? For <hi>Marriage</hi> is no such merchandize, as to promise returne with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to all factors. There is a ceremoniall custome used by the Duke of <hi>Venice</hi> upon the <hi>Ascension</hi> day, to goe in a vessell called the <hi>Bucentor,</hi> made Galley-wise, with other Nobles a mile or two into the Sea: casting a Ring into it, (by which ceremonie they wed the Sea) that it may never leave the Citie upon drie land. Certainly, whosoever he be that marrieth a <hi>wife,</hi> empledging his faith unto her by a Ring, must not thinke that he hath

brought his ship to a perpetuall harbour, but rather that he is now putting off from Land, and entring the maine Ocean, where he is to encounter with many violent blasts, contrary winds, surging waves, ebs and flowes, which will not end till his journey end.
It were wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome therefore to beare what we may not avoid: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering, that as the <hi>Marriage</hi> state is subject to many occurrences, so it is endowed with sundry excellent pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, <q>as the gravitie of the state requireth:<note place="margin">

Parentage. Benevolence. Fame.</note> as we have touched the first Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or inducement to Love, to wit, <hi>Parentage</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent, which cannot so farre degenerate from it selfe, but it must of necessity shew it selfe: so it attracts other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of love unto it, as <hi>Benevolence</hi> in rewarding; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie or admiration proceeding from the <hi>fame</hi> of such redoubted <hi>Hero's,</hi> as have their names charactred and ingraven in leaves of brasse, to preserve their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie: as <hi>Salomon</hi> for his <hi>wisdome,</hi> whom, no doubt, <hi>Nicaula</hi> Queen of <hi>Saba</hi> had a desire to see &amp; be known to, through report of his wisdome; so as her long jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney seemed short, having understood that to be true with her owne eare, which shee had only heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by report. How much likewise was <hi>David</hi> affected for his <hi>Valour,</hi> in discomfiting the uncircumcised <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listin?</hi> So was <hi>Alexander,</hi> whose report brought the <hi>Amazon Thalestris</hi> from her owne Countrey, of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to be knowne to so invincible a spirit. So <hi>Hercules, Achilles, Dardanus, Diomedes, Scipio, Hannibal, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi> &amp;c. whose exploits purchased them Love to such as were never <hi>acquainted</hi> with their persons. Pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning likewise of injuries,<note place="margin">Pardoning of injuries.</note> is an excellent motive of Love. When <hi>Chylo's</hi> brother was angry that himselfe was not made <hi>Ephorus</hi> as well as he: <hi>O</hi> (quoth he) <hi>I know how to suffer injuries, so doest not thou!</hi> Though <hi>Diogenes</hi> the <hi>Cynick</hi> answered uncivilly to <hi>Alexander,</hi> when he came to his poore Mansion in <hi>Synope,</hi> his Philosophers Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, yet hee replied unto his Satyricall speech with no indignation; but said to such of his attendants, as derided the boarish and exoticke speech of <hi>Diogenes, If I were not</hi> Alexander, <hi>I would wish to be</hi> Diogenes. The like instance may be confirmed by holy Writ: where

                  <hi>Miriam,</hi> for murmuring against <hi>Moses,</hi> was stricken with a lothsome Leprosie: he could not suffer this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne punishment to be inflicted on her,<note place="margin">Numb. 12.10.13.</note> but demanded of God that hee would cure her. Another motive to Love,<note place="margin">Concurrencie in hatred.</note> is <hi>Hatred,</hi> where an ill occasion procureth among enemies a reconciliation. <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilat</hi> enemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, were reconciled in combining their powers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against Christ.

                  <note place="margin">30.</note> but by discovering what his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had secretly intended against him? To which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection it may be thus answered; That, as amongst evill men there can be no true friendship continued, so neither are the <hi>Secrets</hi> of such men, tending ever to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe and effusion of innocent bloud, to be concealed, but by all meanes should be discovered, that such tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call issues might be prevented. Yea, but it may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine objected, that admit this were so, may wee not impart our griefes to a <hi>friend,</hi> or communicate our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells to one, whom we have made triall of to be trustie and faithfull? To which I answer, that wee may, but

with this provision, that we never unrip our bosome so farre, as to give our <hi>friend</hi> power over us, in matters which may either concerne life, state, or name.

Now, how should he comfort you, who is wholly ignorant of the cause of your discomfort; or how minister any receits to you, when he knowes not what distempers you; or how releeve you, when he knowes not of any povertie that hath befallen you? Whereto I answer, that these are not to be numbred among those <hi>Secrets</hi> which wee hold unfitting to bee imparted or discovered, by one <hi>friend</hi> to another; for the discovery of these may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, but cannot prejudice us. Whereas, the disclosing of such <hi>Secrets</hi> as concerne our name, may afterwards brand us with infamie; or such as concerne our state,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:4869:153"/>
may bring us to povertie; or such as concerne our life, may weave our unhappie webbe in a fearfull tragedy. Therefore it is good counsell, not to give our <hi>friend</hi> power over us, but with a circumspect eye to take heed whom we entertaine as a <hi>friend</hi>; and of what nature those <hi>Secrets</hi> are, which we impart to that <hi>friend.</hi> When that unhappie Emperour <hi>Commodus</hi> had communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his secret'st thoughts to <hi>Martia,</hi> his best affected Concubine; and withall, how his purpose was, before many dayes were ended,<note place="margin">

For if we be great, we shall have some to ply our veine, soothing us with the height of our place, the eminence of our state, our easie accesse to a higher step, if we will take hold of occasion; and with these are young-men, whose unripened judgements never attained to the discovery of persons, chiefly pleased, and to these are their secret'st thoughts ever imparted; on these are they wholly plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and in these is their principall trust reposed: yet loe, they trust in <hi>broken staves of reed,</hi>

We shall find these chattering <hi>Swallowes</hi> ever flying about us, pretending friendship and <hi>secrecie</hi> in our counsels; but misery attends us, if we entertaine them.

Wherefore the lesson is good, and well deserveth our observation, which is given to us by the Son of <hi>Sirach:</hi> that not only to our <hi>friends, Acquaintance,</hi> or the like, but even to our children, whose naturall respect to their Parents, should binde them to be gratefull, we should not be too forward in distributing our <hi>Substance,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding thus:<note place="margin">Ecclus. 33 21.</note> 
                  <hi>For better it is that thy children should pray unto thee, than that thou shouldest looke up to the hands of thy children.</hi> If we be advised to use this <hi>Reservancie</hi> to our owne, even those whose naturall affection will enforce bountie at the <hi>Parents</hi> hand, much more to our <hi>Acquaintance,</hi> whose pretended semblances, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward protestations many times tend rather by fawning
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:4869:154"/>
to feed on us, than by true profession of friendship to bestead us. Oh <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> how many through too easie a hold have exposed themselves, as a prey to the avaritious desires of their followers; where many times it falleth out, that the <hi>servant</hi> is able to purchase his <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> having enriched himselfe by feeding his humour! Yet see the unthankfulnesse of many of these; having made them a garment of their masters shreads, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed themselves to a great estate by his prodigalitie, they can learne to put on a scornefull countenance towards their landlesse master, entertaine him with contempt, forget his bountie, and ascribe all to their owne thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving providence, which proceeded meerely from his profusenesse. So well can these thriving <hi>Timists,</hi> who raise their fortunes from their masters ruines, shape themselves to all times, that they may profit by all meanes. There are <hi>Acquaintance</hi> likewise, whose aimes as they extend only to themselves, so they will use any indirect course, how irregular soever, to bring their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose about. And of these, we had a <hi>late</hi> example, even in our owne Countrey, and within the walls of this flourishing Citie: which example, that it might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine to the memory of succeeding times, for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit whereof, as well as of these present, our labours should be addressed, I thought good here to set downe.
<hi>There was a young <hi>Gentleman,</hi> whose profuser course having consumed much of his meanes, was enforced, upon some present extremities urging him, to make a morgage of a peece of land, which peece was the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry last which he had left him: the money being lent and spent, and now the un-foreseene day of payment approaching, the young <hi>Gentleman</hi> driven to an exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, made recourse by chance, to an ancient <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance</hi> of his, by trade a <hi>Chandler,</hi> who was a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied man, and could finde a <hi>friend</hi> in a corner, who upon a commodious bargaine would at any time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:4869:155"/>
him of a good Summe. Hee, the <hi>Chandler</hi> I meane, noting what benefit the <hi>Morgage</hi> of the young <hi>Gentlemans</hi> land might be unto him, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed his estate, which now lay a bleeding, and tooke the <hi>Morgage</hi> into his owne hand, concluded with the <hi>Gentleman,</hi> and releeved his present wants, proposing a certaine day for redemption of the said <hi>Morgage:</hi> which was kindly accepted of by the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,</hi> little thinking how he fell from the fire into the flame, and by avoiding <hi>Charybdis,</hi> had fallen into <hi>Scylla.</hi> The time now drew neere, which was limitted the <hi>Gentleman</hi> to redeeme the premises: whence a double care or feare ensued; a feare and provident care in the <hi>Gentleman</hi> of procuring money to redeeme it; a feare in the <hi>Chandler,</hi> lest it should be redeemed, and so the hopes he had of so beneficiall a bargaine frustrated. Which to prevent, (marke the impiety of the age even in this one example) the <hi>Chandler</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the day limitted and prefixed, repaires to a consort of opportunate Agents for his purpose; <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacinates</hi> fleshed in all mischiefe, and ready to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace any motion, or engage themselves in any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which might minister fuell to their riot. And these he acquaints (as it seemes their <hi>Acquaintance</hi> was ancient) how he knew of a rich <hi>Bootie</hi> for them, if they had hearts to attempt, and resolutions to effect, what their present wants enforced them to attempt. They desirous to heare of that booty, promising him reward if their purpose came to effect, pressed him (as little pressing needed to such a base <hi>instrument</hi>) that he would discover, where this bootie might be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased. He imparted his minde freely, and told them that such a <hi>Gentleman</hi> (being the same who had made a <hi>Morgage</hi> of his land unto him) was to come provided of a great Summe of money, upon such a day, and by such a place, as gave opportunitie for
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:4869:155"/>
the attempt, which they might easily obtaine, having none but himselfe and his man to resist them. They, at the first seemed jealous of him, imagining it was some fetch meerely to intrap and circumvent them; but being more confident upon his protestations, that his purpose was to benefit them, not to betray them; they generally consented to this plot, provided that they might have his company, not onely to direct them, but share and partake with them: whereto the <hi>Chandler</hi> condescended, choosing rather to be an assistant in the practice, than prevented of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. To be short, vizards and disguises were provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and all things fitted, that such an attempt might be furthered: where, by direction of their <hi>Leader,</hi> they tooke their stand, where the unfortunate <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman</hi> was to passe; who, within some few houres after, came according to their expectance, provided of a Summe purposely to redeeme his estate (the last remainder of his fortunes) out of the hands of the <hi>Chandler.</hi> But he is intercepted and bid stand, whose present occasions admit no stay: and in briefe, strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of all his money, and bound, he and his man, and throwne into a gravell-pit, where wee leave them: and returne to this perfidious <hi>Chandler,</hi> who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to be a sharer as well in the stake, as in the forfeiture of his estate, is by his wittie <hi>Copesmates</hi> used after another sort than hee looked for; being bound hand and foot, and throwne into a ditch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning; where he remained, till a Shepherds boy having occasion to come that way, hearing one piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously mourning, drew neere to the place where hee heard the voice; but seeing onelye there bound in an ugly vizard, and disguised after an uncoth manner, as one afraid, he run from him, albeit the <hi>Chandler</hi> humbly intreated him, to lend his helping hand to loose him. The noise which the <hi>Chandler</hi> made, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring

aid from the Shepherd, and the Shepherd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying aid to the <hi>Chandler,</hi> was now come to the care of the afflicted <hi>Gentleman,</hi> and his man: wherefore they sent out their complaint, as men pitifully distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; which the Shepherd hearing, came forth with to the place where they lay bound, and seeing the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,</hi> and his man, lent them his helping hand, and delivered them from their bonds: directing them withall, to the Pit where the <hi>Chandler</hi> his treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Acquaintance</hi> lay, whom hee knew by his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise to be one of those, who had taken his money from him: but having pulled off his vizard, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him to be none but the <hi>Chandler,</hi> his professed <hi>friend</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you may imagine what diversitie of perplexed thoughts encountred him; but suspecting the worst, which after proved the truest, hee caused him to be brought before a <hi>Iustice,</hi> where he was examined touching the premises, which, to his shame hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, discovering himselfe to be both <hi>Actour</hi> and <hi>Authour</hi> of that perfidious complot. For which, being committed, and legally tried, he was adjudged according to his desert, to receive the condigne pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of death. Whose goods being confiscate, our late Prince of renowned memory, out of his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all compassion to the <hi>Gentlemans</hi> estate, allotted so much in his princely bounty, as redeemed his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged lands, repossessing him thereof to his great joy, and an example to succeeding ages, not to repose too much confidence in the profession of <hi>Acquaintance.</hi>
                  </hi>
Many examples of like sort (though this may seeme im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel) might be here produced, but I cannot insist upon this point. What hath beene herein discoursed, principally tendeth to this end and purpose, to deterre young <hi>Gentlemen</hi> from discovering themselves too o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly to these glozing and temporizing <hi>Acquaintance,</hi> whose onely ayme is to benefit themselves by their
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:4869:156"/>
weaknesse, and make their prodigality the only foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of their providence. Whence it is, that many times they become enrichers of their retinue, but beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerers of their posterity. And which is of all others most miserable, those, whose <hi>Sponges</hi> they were, and had squeased them of all their fortunes, will contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously demeane themselves towards them, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfully sleight them, who by impoverishing their owne meanes, have enriched them; whose natures in the person of one especiall ungratefull man, are to life expressed by the Poet;

And let this suffice to be spoken of <hi>Reservancie</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Acquaintance,</hi> both in respect of our <hi>secrecie</hi> of <hi>counsell</hi>; lest by discovering our selves either upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of anothers trust, or transported with passion, (the end whereof is the beginning of repentance) wee give out <hi>friend</hi> power over us, and so by too credulous trust bewray our owne weaknesse: or in respect of our <hi>Substance</hi>; by a prodigall bountie to our friends and followers, without respect had of our meanes, and so make our followers our masters. So as, it is right wholesome counsell, which that wise Sonne of <hi>Sirach</hi> gave, and which wee formerly alleaged, but cannot be too often renewed;<note place="margin">Ecclus. 33.18.</note>

by too open a discovery of themselves, or by too pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall a hand in giving, what they may afterwards stand in need of to releeve themselves. But of these we shall have occasion to speake more amply in our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of <hi>Moderation</hi>; meane time, let this lesson be ever imprinted in the Tablet of your memory:

                  <hi>Ambition,</hi> the second assailant of <hi>Temperance,</hi> is such an high-mounting bird, as shee useth to build her nest ever in the tallest <hi>Cedars,</hi> hatching her aëries in the highest spires, to expresse her unbounded aymes.

Though they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume their meanes, yet is the port they live at meane: for they have abridged their <hi>familie,</hi> reduced their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants to a small number, and (unnecessary expences set aside) drawne themselves to within as narrow a compasse as possibly they may. For to take a view of those which are in ordinary roule, you shall finde none but a Page, a Coachman, a Lackey, and perchance a Cooke, if the vailes of the house will maintaine one, or they be not in fee with some City Cooke, whom they usually repaire to, <hi>at best betrust,</hi> and so run on score quarterly.

For what engagement worse than <hi>debt,</hi> when every shadow resembles a Sergeant, every familiar touch or stroke of a friend, an arrest of an Officer? <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> hearing of them talke in his Court, what a huge summe of money a certaine Knight in <hi>Rome</hi> owed at his death, and that all his goods were to be sold, to make payment of his debts, commanded the Master of
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:4869:179"/>
his <hi>Wardrobe</hi> to buy for him that <hi>bed,</hi> wherein this <hi>Knight</hi> used to lie: <hi>For,</hi> sayes hee, <hi>if I cannot sleepe soundly in that bed wherein hee could sleepe, that owed so much, then surely I shall sleepe in none.</hi> Surely, there is no affliction greater to a <hi>Noble Spirit,</hi> whose thoughts cannot endure engagement, than to be subject to the extremitie of an unconscionable <hi>Creditor,</hi> who usually makes advantages his revenues, and forfeitures the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauncers of his fortunes. Neither is this respect to bee had only in the disposing of your selves in <hi>Court</hi> or <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> but likewise in the <hi>Countrey:</hi> for though it be best spent, which is bestowed in Hospitalitie, and in relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving those hungry soules, whose expresse images require your charitie; yet are you to consider how charitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with it selfe: so as, howsoever you are bound to releeve and support those, whose present wants exact so much at your hands, yet ever with reservancie of a competent or convenient providence, so to sustaine the want of others, as not to procure want to your selves by sustaining others. But this needs little pressing: for experience shewes, that very small instruction will suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice any one to be provident enough in their bounty or exhibition to the poore.

<pb n="335" facs="tcp:4869:179"/>
have an eye to <hi>pleasure</hi> or <hi>profit,</hi> this <hi>frugalitie</hi> or equally tempered <hi>providence</hi> must be Soveraignesse in both. For first, there is no <hi>pleasure</hi> which hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to <hi>vertue:</hi> how then may that properly be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a <hi>pleasure,</hi> which hath no relation to <hi>frugalitie,</hi> under which name all <hi>vertues</hi> may seeme to be compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed? Likewise, there is no <hi>profit</hi> which is not joyned with honestie; how then may that properly be termed a <hi>profit,</hi> which hath no respect to honest providence, upon which all <hi>profits</hi> are truly grounded? The best course then that you can follow, either in your choice of <hi>pleasures,</hi> or pursuit of <hi>profit,</hi> is ever to examine whether that <hi>pleasure</hi> which you affect, have respect to <hi>vertue,</hi> or that <hi>profit</hi> which you have in pursuit, be firmly grounded on honest <hi>providence:</hi> so shall neither <hi>pleasure</hi> so much inthrall you, as to engage your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes to her, nor <hi>profit</hi> so entangle you, as to neglect conscience for the love you beare her. Surely, there is nought more dangerous to young <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> whose unriper yeeres have not sufficiently instructed them in the follies of vanitie, than to give reines to their desires, and so become <hi>Bondslaves</hi> to <hi>pleasure.</hi> For those that will deny their eyes nothing that they can desire, nor resist their owne wills in ought that they affect, be they endued with never so much wisdome, it becomes foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnesse, being blinded with their owne delights. They then onely, whose native <hi>temperance</hi> hath prepared them, or continuall wrastling with the infirmities of nature hath inured them, have attained this degree of perfection; not only (I say) to use <hi>Moderation</hi> in their expence, but in their restraint of every <hi>pleasure</hi>; labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to become commanders of themselves in the <hi>desires</hi> and <hi>affections</hi> of this life: which of all others make men the absolutest conquerours. For man, whose naturall pravitie, drawne from the corruption of his first pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, is ever working in him new motions of disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:4869:180"/>
layeth continuall siege and batterie to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse of the soule, suggesting to her motives of <hi>pleasure</hi> and delight, which the carnall man will easily conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to, because he favoureth not the things of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Yea, how many doe wee see, who begin in the <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> but end in the <hi>flesh,</hi> making their end farre worse than their beginning? How necessary then is this <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,</hi> to curbe or checke such inordinate motion as arise in us, by reason of our naturall infirmitie and weaknesse? Neither doe I so much insist upon the <hi>Moderation</hi> of your expences, as if <hi>Coine</hi> were of that esteeme, as it only deserved respect. For if <hi>Riches</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, wee are not to set our hearts upon them; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to shew our indifferencie towards them in our free and liberall use of them.<note place="margin">

or carelesse expence of <hi>Time</hi>; the Ambitious, Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and miserable covetous person. For the first, he trifles away <hi>Time,</hi> in the pursuit of impossibilities, spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his meanes, and misspending <hi>Time,</hi> in hope of a day; which day he seldome or never sees, for his <hi>Time</hi> is a bridged before it come: so as the date of his death anticipates the day of his hopes. Now to point out the place of his abode, hee is ever to be found in the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentest places, for obscuritie fits not his humour, whose only aymes are to acquire honour. Hee is so farre from <hi>moderating</hi> his humour, as he is humorously conceited of his worth, and thinkes whatsoever the <hi>Parasite</hi> saies in his commendations, to be no lesse than what he in his owne proper person deserves, For his <hi>Contemplations,</hi> they are ever mounting, yet seldom so high mounting as heaven, for his thoughts are directed to another Sphere. He is prodigall in his feasts, solicitous in the pursuit of friends, impatient in the quest of rivalls, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in the dispatch of his affaires:<note place="margin">

                  </note> and though it be a greater reproach to lose what is got, than not at all to get; yet his ayme is to get, though he fore-see his losse before he get: and though the least libertie be appor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the greatest fortune, yet in his highest for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes will he use the greatest libertie: the reason is, hee conceits himselfe to walke in a <hi>Cloud,</hi> where no popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar eye can reach him. He is unmeasurably opinionate, and admires his owne knowledge, wherein he discovers his owne folly: for as he that seekes to be more wise than he can be, shall be found to be lesse wise than hee should be; so he who conceits himselfe more wise than he is, displayes himselfe to the world what he is. So as it seemes, hee differs in opinion from the Poet, who holds this as a maxime:
<q>

                  <hi>Lord turne away my eyes from vanitie</hi>; but this <hi>turning</hi> doth not so much imply the <hi>looke</hi> of the <hi>eye,</hi> as the <hi>lust</hi> or assent of the <hi>heart.</hi> Neither is it so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to make a <hi>covenant</hi> with our <hi>eyes</hi> that they shall not <hi>looke</hi> upon a woman, as to make a <hi>covenant</hi> with our <hi>hearts</hi> that they may never <hi>lust</hi> after a woman. In like sort, if any intemperate or immoderate desire to <hi>luscious fare</hi> or <hi>delicious drink</hi> should surprize us, whose subtill fumes unrivet each joynt of the memory, and loosen the cement which held it fast;<note place="margin">☞</note> (for you shall ever note, as I said before, that deepe drinkers have but shallow memories:) wee are so to prevent the abuse, that wee contemne not the <hi>moderate</hi> and healthfull use of them. For as to use them in excesse is to abuse them, so not to use them at all is to contemne or neglect Gods providence in them. Wee must not say with the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, <hi>Let us eat and drinke, for to morrow wee shall die</hi>; but rather let us eat and drinke, as if to morrow we should die; remembring that strict account which every one must give of the use or abuse of Gods creatures: for it is not the use, but abuse which produceth sinne. So as <hi>Thracius,</hi>

Likewise in the quest or pursuit of honour, as it is <hi>ambition</hi> to hunt after it, undeserved; so it is the most apparent testimonie of true and approved vertue, to obtaine it undesired. For this reluctancie to receiving of honour, can never be without some mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>pride:</hi> for they would have the world to observe, how well they deserve it; and againe, their humilitie (which is seldome in these without some tincture of vaine-glory) in that they so little desire it. So as, these popular and firie spirits, whose only aimes are to digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie

themselves, deserve no sharper curbe for over-valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves, than these, who pride themselves in their humilitie, deserve for counterfeiting a kinde of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basing or dis-valuing of themselves to the eye of the world. Whence I might take occasion to speake of those precise Schismaticks, who cannot endure any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedencie or prioritie of place to be in the Church, but an equalitie of Presbyterie; but I will leave them to a sharper censure, till they be throughly cured of their distemper.</p>

<pb n="374" facs="tcp:4869:200"/>
ascend to: for man, miserable man, what is he, or of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe what can he, to make him absolutely <hi>perfect?</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed can he in nothing but sinne, which is such a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall imperfection, as it wholly detracts from his primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Perfection.</hi> Time was indeed, when man knew no sinne, and in that ignorance from sin consisted his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi> But no sooner was that banefull Apple tasted, than in the knowledge of sinne he became a professant. Wee are therefore to discourse of such <hi>Perfection,</hi> as wee commonly in opinion hold for absolute, though in very deed it appeare only respective and definite; for to treat of that <hi>Perfection</hi> which is transcendent or indefinite, were to sound the Sea, or weigh the Mountaines, so far it exceedeth the conceit of man: yea, I say, to taske hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane apprehension to the discussion of that soveraigne or supreme <hi>Perfection,</hi> were as unequally matched, as ever were earth and heaven, strength and weaknesse, or the great <hi>Behemoth,</hi> and the silliest <hi>worme</hi> that creepeth in the chinkes of the earth. Let us addresse our selves then to this Taske, and make this our ground, that as no man is simply good but God; so no man is absolutely <hi>perfect</hi> till hee be individually united to God; which on earth is not granted, but promised; not effected, but expected; not obtained, but with confidence desired, when these <hi>few,</hi> but <hi>evill dayes</hi> of our Pilgrimage shall be expired: yet is there a graduall <hi>Perfection,</hi> which in some degree or measure wee may attaine, becomming conformable unto him, whose Image we have received, and by whom we have so many singular graces and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives on us conferred. And this <hi>Perfection</hi> is to be procured by assistance of Gods Spirit, and a desire in man to second that assistance by an assiduall endevour. Which devout and godly endevour, that it might be the better furthered, and his glory, by whose grace we are assisted, the more advanced; needfull it were to reduce to our memory, daily and hourely these two maine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations.

Besides, they are such pleasing <hi>Enemies,</hi> as they cheere us, when they kill us; sting us, when they smile on us. And what is the instrument they worke on, but the soule? And what the time limited them to work in, but our life?

                  </note> to give our owne, and not anothers, for that were robbery: The second is, to give to the poore, and not to the rich in hope of commoditie: The third is, to give in mercy or fellow-feeling of others wants, and not for vaine-glory. For howsoever the poore need not care for any of these respects, because he is rewarded; yet the giver is to care, because his reward should hereby become frustrated.

Thus if we observe aright the zealous and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practice of those blessed <hi>Patternes,</hi> who have gone before us, and have left their memorable lives as exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to be imitated by us, wee shall in some measure at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to that <hi>Perfection,</hi> whereof we now discourse; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring so to moderate our affections herein, as neither vaine-glory, nor any other fleshly respect may inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it selfe in actions of such maine and serious conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.

all those workes of his; creating all outward things for the body, the body for the soule, and the soule for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. And to what end?

                  </note> It is flattery (saith one) to praise in absence; that is, when either the vertue is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, or the occasion is absent. But in the report of our owne praise, admit wee should deserve it; the safest course is to withdraw our eare from hearing it, lest vain-glory transport us upon hearing of those praises which are spoken of us: for if our aymes be only to purchase popular esteeme, preferring the praise of men, before the praise of God, or the <hi>testimony</hi> of a <hi>good conscience</hi>; as our aymes were perverted, so shall we be rewarded. Now there is no better means to abate or extenuate this desire of praise in us, than duly to consider whose gifts they be, that deserve this praise in us: for were they our owne, we might more properly be praised for them; but they are Gods, and not ours, therefore is the praise to be ascribed unto God, and not unto us.

               <p>Thus you have heard <hi>what</hi> we are to seeke, <hi>where</hi> we are to seeke, and <hi>when</hi> we are to seeke. <hi>What</hi>; a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, not of <hi>earth,</hi> but of <hi>heaven. Where</hi>; not on <hi>earth,</hi> nor in <hi>earth,</hi> but in <hi>heaven. When</hi>; while we are here on <hi>earth,</hi> that after <hi>earth</hi> we may reigne in <hi>heaven.

            <head>A Gentleman</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>S a Man of himselfe, without the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of either Taylor, Millener, Seam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster or Haberdasher. Actions of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse he holds his supreme happinesse: The fate of a younger brother cannot depresse his thoughts below his elder. He scornes basenesse more than want; and holds No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse his sole worth. A Crest displayes his house, but his owne actions expresse himselfe. Hee scornes pride, as a derogation to Gentry; and walkes with so pure a soule, as he makes uprightnesse the honour of his Familie. He wonders at a profuse foole, that he should spend when honest frugalitie bids him spare; and no lesse at a miserable Crone, who spares when reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bids him spend. Though heire of no great fortunes, yet his extensive hand will not shew it. Hee shapes his coat to his cloth; and scornes as much to be beholden, as to be a Gally-slave. He hath beene <hi>youthfull,</hi> but his maturer experience hath so ripened him, as he hates to become either <hi>Gull</hi> or <hi>Cheat.</hi> His <hi>disposition</hi> is so <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,</hi> as others happinesse cannot make him <hi>repine,</hi> nor any occurrent save sinne make him repent. He admires nothing more than a constant spirit, derides nothing more than a recreant condition, embraceth nothing with more intimacie, than a prepared resolution.
<pb facs="tcp:4869:242"/>
Amongst men he hates no lesse to be uncivill, than in his feare to God-ward to be servile. <hi>Education</hi> hee holds a <hi>second Nature</hi>; which (such innate seeds of goodnesse are sowne in him) ever improves him, sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or never depraves him. <hi>Learning</hi> hee holds not only an additament, but ornament to <hi>Gentry.</hi> No com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement gives more accomplishment. He intends more the tillage of his minde, than his ground; yet suffers not that to grow wilde neither. He walkes not in the clouds to his friend, but to a stranger. He eyes the <hi>Court</hi> with a vertuous and noble contemplation; and dis-values him most, whose <hi>sense</hi> consists in <hi>sent.</hi> Hee viewes the <hi>City,</hi> with a princely command of his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. No object can with-draw him from himselfe; or so distract his desires, as to covet ought unworthily; or so intraunce his thoughts, as to admire ought ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilely. He lives in the <hi>Countrey</hi> without thought of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression; makes every evening his dayes <hi>Ephemeris.</hi> If his neighbours field flourish, he doth not envy it; if it lie fit for him, he scornes to covet it. There is not that place he sees, nor that pleasure he enjoyes, whereof he makes not some singular use to his owne good and Gods glory. <hi>Vocation</hi> hee admits of, walking in it with so generous and religious a care, as hee makes <hi>Pietie</hi> his <hi>Practice,</hi> acts of <hi>Charitie</hi> his <hi>Exercise,</hi> and the benefit of others his sole solace. Hee understands that neither <hi>health</hi> commeth from the <hi>clouds</hi> without seeking, nor <hi>wealth</hi> from the <hi>clods</hi> without digging. He recommends himselfe therefore in the morning to Gods protection and favour, that all the day long hee may more prosperously succeed in his labour. He holds idlenesse to be the very moth of mans time; Day by day therefore hath he his taske imposed, that the poison of idlenesse may be better avoided. He holds, as Gods opportunitie is mans extremitie; so mans securitie is the Devils opportunitie. Hoping therefore he feares, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:4869:242"/>
he takes heed, and taking heed he becomes safe. Hospitalitie he holds a relique of Gentry: He harbours no <hi>passion</hi> but <hi>compassion.</hi> He grieves no lesse at anothers losse than his owne; nor joyes lesse in anothers successe than his owne peculiar. <hi>Recreation</hi> he useth to refresh him, but not surprize him. Delights cannot divert him from a more serious occasion; neither can any houre-beguiling pastime divide him from an higher contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation. For honest pleasures, he is neither so <hi>Stoicall</hi> as wholly to contemne them, nor so <hi>Epicureall</hi> as too sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually to affect them. There is no delight on mountaine, vale, coppice, or river, whereof he makes not an usefull and contemplative pleasure. <hi>Recreation</hi> he admits, not to satisfie his <hi>sense,</hi> but solace <hi>himselfe.</hi> Hee fixeth his minde on some other subject, when any pleasure begins too strongly to worke upon him: He would take it, but not be taken by it. Hee attempers his attractivest pastimes with a little <hi>Alloes,</hi> to <hi>weane</hi> him all the sooner from their sweetnesse. He scornes that a moment of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent should deprive him of an eternitie of comfort. He corrects therefore his humour, in the desire of pleasure, that he may come off with more honour. <hi>Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> he entertaines with <hi>feare,</hi> but retaines with <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</hi> He consorts with none, but where he presumes he may either better them, or be bettered by them. Vertue is the sole motive of his choice: Hee conceives how no true amitie, nor constant societie can ever be amongst evill men. He holds it a blemish to the repute of a <hi>Gentleman;</hi> and an aspersion to his discretion, to make choice of those for his Associates, who make no more account of time, than how to <hi>passe</hi> it over. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference he affects; and those hee admits only into the list of his discourse, whom he findes more reall than verball, more solid than complementall. He will try him before he rely on him: but having found him <hi>touch,</hi> they touch his honour, that impeach him. <hi>Moderation</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:4869:243"/>
in his desires, cares, feares, or in what this Theatre of Earth may afford, he expresseth so nobly, as neither love of whatsoever he enjoyes can so enthrall him, nor the losse of what he loves can any way appall him. A true and generous Moderation of his affections, hath begot in him an absolute command and conquest of himselfe. He smiles, yet compassionately grieves, at the immoderation of poore worldlings in their cares and griefes; at the indiscretion of ambitious and volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Flies in their desires and feares. <hi>Perfection</hi> hee aspires to; for no lower mound can confine him, no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour bound impale him. <hi>Vertue</hi> is the <hi>staire</hi> that rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to height of this <hi>Story.</hi> His ascent is by degrees; making <hi>Humilitie</hi> his directresse, lest he should faile or fall in his progresse. His <hi>wings</hi> are holy desires; his <hi>feet</hi> heavenly motions. He holds it the sweetest life to be every day better, till <hi>length of dayes</hi> re-unite him to his Redeemer. Hee hath plaid his part on this Stage of Earth with honour; and now in his <hi>Exit</hi> makes heaven his harbour.</p>
