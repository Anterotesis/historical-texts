            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Reverend Fathers, your Lordſhips ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving bene a long tyme Divinitie Readers in the ſchole of Chriſt, and ſome of vs alſo, a long tyme ſcholers brought vp in the ſame ſchole at your feete, give vs leave, we pray you, by way of Queſtion, and not of Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, to propound theſe Demaundes following. And as we brieflie and plainly have oppoſed, ſo let your Lordſhips be wel pleaſed ſimply and honeſtly to make vs anſwere. For we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (as the men of <hi>Beraea</hi> did) ſearched the ſcriptures, for our ſatisfaction in the doubtes propounded, and out of them, not being able to reſolve our ſelves, our deſire is, to be reſolved, by men of greater skill, and not to reſt our ſelves vpon our owne iudgements. Now then we thus propound, and we thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>FIRST, whether every ſupreme Christian Magistrate, for</hi>
               <note place="margin">The like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande wee make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the command of the Church.</note> 
               <hi>every commaund to be given by vertue of his Christian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracie, touching the worſhip of God, ought not to have the word of faith, for the ground and warrant of his commaund; that ſo his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund being of faith, may not be of ſinne?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, whether any ſupreme Christian Magistrate, by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie</hi>
               <note place="margin">The like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande wee make of the abilitie of the Church.</note> 
               <hi>of holy Writ, be inabled to deviſe, ordayne and appropriate a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteriall garment for the Ministerie of the Goſpell, without putting on of which garment, he may commaund the Ministers of the Gospell, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther publikely to pray, to preach the Worde, nor administer the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, if it be lawfull for a ſoveraigne Christian Magistrate, by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:13051:3"/>
authoritie of holy Writ, to ordayne and appropriate a Ministeriall gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the Ministers of the Gospell, then we demaunde, whether by Authoritie of holy Writt, he may ordayne and appropriate ſuch a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteriall garment, as in matter and forme, differeth not from that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and neceſſarie Priestlie garment, which the Prince, &amp; chief Prieſt of Idolatrie hath appropriated to be worne by his Jdolatrous Priestes in their Idoll ſervice?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſon moving vs to make the firſt demaund, reſpecteth ſome others, rather then our ſelves. For we doubt not, but that every ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Chriſtian Magiſtrate, will agnize, that every his mandatorie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning the outward worſhip of God, of what nature, or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie ſoever it be (if it be not ſinne) muſt be of faith. And that no ſuch action of his, can be of faith, vnles the ſame have the word of faith for the ground and warrant thereof.</p>
            <p>Concerning the ſecond Demaund, For our partes we never yet read of any commaundement, of any word of faith, or of any godly exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in holy Writt, whereby the ſupreme Chriſtian Magiſtrate, is either directly, or by conſequence inabled to ordayne and appropriate a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteriall garment, for the Miniſters of the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>For howſoever by imitation of the Prieſtly garmentes, ordayned for the Leviticall Prieſthood, vnder the Law, your Lordſhips may thinke that a miniſteriall garment may lawfully be commaunded for the Miniſters of the Goſpel: nevertheleſſe, there being an expreſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement given vnto Moſes, vnder the law, for the one, and no ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall or particular rule delivered vnto a Chriſtian Magiſtrate, in the Goſpell, for the other, we deſire to be ſatisfied by your Lordſhips, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch an imitation of Leviticall garments, be lawfull, yea or no? If your Lordſhips anſwere, that the inſtitution of a Miniſteriall gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vnder the Goſpel, is not by imitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the Leviticall law, then we demaund, from whence the originall and ofſpring of that Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall garment came?</p>
            <p>If your Lordſhips anſwere, that it ſprange originally from Mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, then you directly charge the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, to have no rule of faith for the guidance of his conſcience in the inſtitution of a miniſteriall garment. For your Lordſhips very well know, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this your owne knowledge, have a longe tyme taught vs, that no deviſe or invention of man, can be a divine rule, for a Chriſtian Magiſtrates conſcience to be guyded by.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:13051:3"/>But aſwell for the better clearing of the proper and right vſe of the Prieſtlie garmentes vnder the law, as alſo of the cleare opening of this poynt, namely, that no reaſon can bee yeelded, from the vſe of the prieſtly garmentes vnder the law, for the vſe of miniſteriall garmentes vnder the Goſpell, we demaund:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether your Lordſhips did ever read in any parte of holy Writ, that the Priestes were commaunded to eate the Paſſeover in any other gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, then in their ordinary garments?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether your Lordſhips did ever read in any parte of holy Writ, that any holy Ministeriall garment was commaunded to bee worne, by him, that cut of the foreskinne of the fleſhe vpon the eight day?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether your Lordſhips have read in any place of holy Writt, that the Prophetes had any proper or ſpeciall attire, enioyned vnto them, as a proper and neceſſarie habite, wherein they ſhould exerciſe, and without which they might not exerciſe their propheticall office? For wee finde it<note place="margin">1. Ki. 20. 41.</note> written; When the Prophet hasted, and tooke the aſhes away from his face, that the King of Iſrall knew him, that he was of the Prophetes. Whereby it ſeemeth vnto vs, that, that Prophet, rather by his face, then by his proper Propheticall garment, was diſcerned from other men to bee a Prophet, especially in the execution of that his propheticall function:<note place="margin">1. Sam. 9. 1<gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> And this agayne is made more manifest, by thoſe wordes which Saule vſed, when meeting with Samuell in the middest of the gate of one of the Cities of <hi>Zuph,</hi> he queſtioned with him after this maner: Tell me, I pray thee, where the Seers houſe is? For had the Prophets bene known in thoſe dayes by their proper propheticall garmentes, then needed not Saul in the middeſt of the gate, and at ſo ſolemne a feast, to have enquired of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muell, for the Seers houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it is written, that Saule knew that it was Samuell, when an ould<note place="margin">Obiection. 1. Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 28. 14 Iſa. 20. 1.</note> man came vp, lapped in a mantell, And <hi>Iſayah</hi> was commanded to looſe his ſackcloth from his loynes, and to put off his ſhoe from his foote. And againe it is written: And in that day ſhall the Prophetes bee aſhamed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very<note place="margin">Zech. 13. 4.</note> one of his viſion, when he hath prophecied, neither ſhall they weare a rough garment to deceyve: And lastly, that Iohn the Baptist had his<note place="margin">Math. 3. 4.</note> garment of Camels hayre, and that a girdle of a skinne was about his loynes: By all which places it is apparant, that in ould tyme the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes vſed a ſpeciall attyre, or habite, and were accustomed to put vpon them a distinct kinde of garment from other men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We confeſſe plainly and ſimply, that your Lordſhips herein ſpeake<note place="margin">Anſwers.</note>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:13051:4"/>
the trueth, neither doe we denie, that it is both lawfull and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the Miniſter of the Goſpell, dayly &amp; ordinarily, to weare ſuch a ſpeciall kinde of civile apparell, as whereby he may be knowne from being a Marchant, a Lawier, a Gentleman, or an Huſbandman: But what for that? For to the poynt in queſtion, what reſolution is that? For how followeth is, that the prophet Iſayah, the other old prophets, and Iohn Baptiſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by their every dayes rough and hayrie apparell, wherſoever in the ſtreetes, in the fields, in the Markets, in the ſchooles, in the gates, in the Court, or in the countrey, they were ſeene, how (we ſay) doeth it follwe (they being knowne by their ſpeciall garments to be of the number of the prophetes) that therefore whenſoever in the Temple, in the Synagogue, or in any other place, wherin they prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied, that they put vpon that their ordinary and vſuall garment, ſome other garment, neceſſarily and properly to be worne in their propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call office? and without which neceſſary and propheticall garment, it was not lawfull for them to propheſie?</p>
            <p>If your Lordſhips could make good your obiection by the holy ſcriptures, you ſhould then have ſome colour from the example of the old prophets, to affirme that extraordinary prophets, (if there were any in our times) might weare ſome rough and haytie garments; But to alleadge theſe examples, as ſufficient authorities for ordinary Paſtours &amp; Teachers, that they may or ought to weare proper miniſteriall gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whenſoever they pray, preache the word or adminiſter the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, is to alleadge <hi>quidlibet pro quolibet?</hi> inſteed of a kernell, to give a nutſhale, and to imagine as <hi>Saul</hi> imagined, that he ſaw <hi>Samuell</hi> when he ſaw <hi>Satan,</hi> who to blind <hi>Sauls</hi> eyes, had put vpon him the forme of an old man lapped in a Mantell.</p>
            <p>And yet nevertheles we grant that from the place of <hi>Samuell,</hi> we may learne thus much: <hi>viz.</hi> If any perſon in our age were ſo ſottiſh, as to ſeek vnto a Witche, to have the body of an Archbiſhop rayſed vp; that Satan in this caſe, by lapping him ſelfe in an Archbiſhops Pall, Rochet and ſquare Cap, might tranſforme him ſelfe to the ſhape and likenes of <hi>Thomas Beckett,</hi> though he be long ſince dead.</p>
            <p>As for that which is alleadged out of the propheſie of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth directly that his garment of Sackcloth, was not any proper pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall garment, but only ſuch an ordinary garment, as whereby in his common and daily attire, his condition of being a Prophet, was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the apparrell of other men, who were no Prophetes.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13051:4"/>
For if by the commandment of looſing the ſackcloth from his loynes, the Lord had meant a proper propheticall Mantell or garment, which was only vſuall in the execution of his propheticall function, then might the ſame well-inough have bene put of, and yet <hi>Jſaiah</hi> not have bene naked, and his buttocks vncovered.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if by <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> garment, a proper propheticall garment in the exerciſe of Propheſie, and not a ſpeciall ordinary garment, common with other Prophets in their daily vſe, had bene noted; then by <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> ſhoes likewiſe, why ſhould not a proper &amp; propheticall kind of ſhoes be vnderſtood?</p>
            <p>And if ſo, why then by this place might not Miniſters be appointed, (whenſoever they pray, preache or miniſter the Sacramentes) to have proper miniſteriall ſhoes or pantofles vpon their feete, aſwell as proper miniſteriall Surplices or Copes vpon their backes?</p>
            <p>The place out of <hi>Zacharie,</hi> and that argument from <hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> apparell, be of like interpretation with that of <hi>Eſai.</hi> And that out of <hi>Zachary,</hi> what ells proveth it, but that the falſe Prophets ordinarily did weare ſome ſuch maner of ſpeciall rough garments, as were after the forme of ordinary garments, worne by the true Prophets? and that thoſe falſe Prophets, for deceiving of the people, by colour of their garments, ſhould have thoſe garments, (as it were) plucked over their eares, and no more be ſuffered by their garmentes, to make their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ſeeme more holy: ſeeing they were never ſent from God, to bee Prophets for the good of his people, but might ſtill have continewed huſbandmen or heards men, as not having any true propheticall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but only making a ſhew their of by their outward rough gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as if their garments had bene ſufficient to have approved their propheſies? In like maner as at this day a number of idole miniſters, have naught<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ells to approve them to be miniſters, but only that they weare a large whit Surplice with two wide ſleeves, and a litle blacke Cappe with foure narrowe corners.</p>
            <p>Nay, againe we demand, whether your Lordſhips have read in holy<note place="margin">1 Chro. 23. 6 1 Chro. 25. 1. 1 Chro. 26. 20. 1 Chro. 9. <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And if your Lordſhips can produce no place out of holy Writt for the proofe of theſe queſtions; then from the example of celebrating the Paſſover, miniſtring Circumciſion, Propheſying by the Prophets, and from ſervices done by the Singers, Porters and Treaſures, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out other miniſteriall garments then were appointed to be vnder the Lawe:</p>
            <p>We demand what good proofe your Lordſhips can make out of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Writt, that miniſters of the Goſpell may be commanded, not to pray, not to preach, and not to adminiſter the Sacraments without miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall garments, not appointed by God, but by man in the time of the Goſpell?</p>
            <p>And yet touching certaine holy garments, vſed by the Prieſtes and Levites vnder the Law, your Lordſhips have not read (as we ſuppoſe) that either <hi>Moyſes</hi> or <hi>Aaron,</hi> did appoint any other holy garments for the Prieſts or Levits in their prieſtly or Leviticall Offices, then ſuch<note place="margin">Exo. 28. 12 29. 30. 35. 41. 43.

            <p>And ſo from the proportion of the Miniſtery of the Prieſthood vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, vnto the miniſterie of faith vnder the Goſpell, we queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thus: If God the only author of the Prieſthood vnder the Law, were the only author of the Prieſts holy and miniſteriall garments, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, why ſhould not the ſame God, being the holy author of the miniſterie of the Goſpell, be likewiſe the only author of miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all garments vnder the Goſpell?

            <p>Beſides, for ſo much as the Prieſts when they came out of the inner Court even to the vtter Court to the people, and approched to thoſe<note place="margin">Ezek. 42. Eze. 44. 15. 17. 18. 19.</note> things which were for the people, were then commaunded to put of their holy and Lynen garments, and to put on their other garments, namely, their Wollen garments which they had put of when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the inner Court.</p>
            <p>From whence we againe demande, what reaſon your Lordſhips can
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:13051:5"/>
yeald out of holy Writt, that the Miniſters of the Goſpell when they approche to pray, to preach the Word &amp; to adminiſter the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which are things for the people vnder the Goſpell, ſhould put vpon them miniſteriall Lynen garments? And not rather from the identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of reaſon and equitie of that order, which was given to the Prieſtes vnder the Law, challendge a free and liberall vſe of their miniſterie in their ordinarie garmentes? We meane ſuch comly and cleanly wollen garmentes, as by the law, vſe, or cuſtome of the countrie, wherein they live, may lawfully be worne.</p>
            <p>Where it is written that David had on him a lynen garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as all the<note place="margin">1 Chro. 15.</note> Levites that bare the Arke, &amp; the ſingers: If your Lordſhips from this place ſhal vrge, that lynen garments were ordinarily worne by the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, among the people, when they approched to the ſervices, which were for the people, you ſhall in this caſe but wreſt the holy ſcriptures, to an other ſenſe then rightly can be gathered from the ſame, becauſe the ſame your ſenſe directly repugneth the aforeſaid teſtimonie of the Prophet Ezekiell: neither indeed doeth this place any more prove, the ordinarie wearing of lynen garmentes, by the Levites among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in the vtter courte, then it doeth prove the ordinarie wearing of an Ephod by King David, whenſoever he came into the Temple to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>The reaſon then of the Levites wearing of lynen garmentes at this tyme, being in the preſence of the Arke of the covenant of the Lord which was now to be remooved from the houſe of <hi>Obed Edom,</hi> and<note place="margin">Num. 4. 15.</note> to be caried vpon the ſhoulders of the ſonnes of <hi>Koath,</hi> and to bee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended vpon by other of the Levites their brethren, in holy garments, it ſeemeth playne that this wearing of holy garmentes, in this peculiar ſervice thus performed to the Lord, in the preſence of the Arke, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the wearing of the ſame garmentes in common ſervices done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people.</p>
            <p>Beſides, that the Singers and Levites did not at any time miniſter in their lynen garmentes, among the people, is apparant. For that the proper place of their miniſtration was before the Arke in the inner court; And this is evident by the ſcriptures:</p>
            <p>For it is written, that <note n="a" place="margin">1. Chr. 15 17. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Heman</hi> and <hi>Aſaph</hi> and <hi>Ethan</hi> were ſingers, and that the King left <note n="b" place="margin">1.

to lift vp their voyce with ioye, and to <note n="d" place="margin">1.

Chr. 6. 32.</note> 
               <hi>Salomon</hi> had built the houſe of the Lord in Ieruſalem, but then alſo, the ſingers continewed their office according to their cuſtome for it is written thus. And the <note n="f" place="margin">2. Chro 5. 12.</note> Levites the ſingers of all ſortes, as of <hi>Aſaph,</hi> of <hi>Heman,</hi> and <hi>Ieduthun,</hi> and of their ſonns, and of their brethren being clad in fyne Lynen, ſtood with Cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bales and with Vyolles, and Harpes, at the Eaſt end of the Altar, and with them an hundred and twentye prieſtes, blowinge which Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pettes, vnles then your Lordſhips be able to proue by holy wrytt, that the inner courte, or holy place, wherein the Altar ſtood, was not a place ſeparated for the preiſtes, &amp; Levites alone, but that the people as well, as the Prieſtes and Levites, came into the ſame place, to worſhipp before the Arke, wee may bouldly (as wee thinke) affirme that you ſhall never be able to prove, that the Prieſtes or Levites vnder the law, did at any tyme weare any Miniſterial garments, when they approched into their vtter court, to the people, to doe ſervices for the people. Among the reaſons (why the Prieſtes vnder the law were commanded to put on their lynen garmentes when they miniſtred in the ſanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and at the table) one reaſon among other is rendered to bee this: namely, for that the garmentes were holy garmentes, as having from the God of holynes an holy inſtitution.</p>
            <p>The reaſon alſo why the prieſtes were commaunded to put of their lynen garmentes, and to put on other wollen garmentes, when they approched to thoſe thinges which were for the people, is this: <hi>viz.</hi> for that they ſhould not ſanctifie the people with their garmentes: From which two reaſons, we queſtion thus:</p>
            <p>Firſt, ſeeing vnder the Miniſterie of the Goſpell, the Miniſters ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, have neither holy place, nor inner court, ſeparated from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; neither any garmentes, by any holy inſtitution, appointed by the name of holy garmentes to miniſter in; we demaund, what authoritie your Lordſhips can alleadge out of holy Writt, that it ſhould not bee as comely and as decent a thinge, for the Miniſters of the Goſpell, to approche vnto prayer, preaching the worde, and adminiſtring the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes (which are things for the people vnder the Goſpell) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Miniſteriall garmentes deviſed, and inſtituted only by man: as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:13051:6"/>
it was for the Prieſtes to approch vnto the like things, which were for the people vnder the Law, without thoſe holy garmentes, which were ordayned by God?</p>
            <p>Secondly, the reaſon of the prohibition of the Prieſtes putting on their holy and prieſtly garmentes, when they approched into the vtter court to thoſe things which were for the people: being this: Namelie, that they ſhould not ſanctifie the people with their garmentes; wee demaunde with what reaſon deduced from holy Writt, you can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne this poſition, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That our Saviour Chriſt (to preſerve the equitie and integritie of that prohibition, aſwell in the tyme of the Goſpell, as in the tyme of the Law, did not inſtitute any proper miniſteriall garmentes, for the Apoſtles, Evangeliſtes, Prophetes, Doers of Myracles, or Teachers, to exerciſe anie their miniſteriall function in, leaſt the people putting an opinion of holynes in their garmentes, might thinke the doing of myracles, preaching the worde, prophecying, or miniſtring the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes, to be ſanctified by their garmentes? And therefore from the manner of preaching the worde, adminiſtring Baptiſme, celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Lordes Supper, doing Myracles, and praying by the Apoſtles, Evangeliſtes, Prophetes, &amp;c. without any proper miniſteriall gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes: we queſtion thus:</p>
            <p>In aſmuch as Iohn Baptiſt did both crye in the wildernes, and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe in Iorden, having vpon him none other proper miniſteriall gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, but onely his ordinarie garment, of Camells hayre, with a girdle of a skinne about his loynes: And ſeeing the Apoſtles did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preache the worde, nor adminiſter the Sacramentes, nor doe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, amonge the people, in any other garmentes, then in their vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and ordinarie garmentes. And beſides, ſeeing the Apoſtles, did not inſtitute or commaunde any proper miniſteriall garmentes for their ſucceſſors, namely for Biſhoppes, Paſtours and Teachers to miniſter in: ſeeing (we ſay) theſe things can not be prooved out of holy writt to be otherwiſe, our deſire is to be ſatisfied from your Lordſhips, by ſome holy rule of faith, why Biſhops, Paſtors, and Teachers, ſo long after the Apoſtles tymes, ſhould be commaunded, to weare any other forme or manner of garmentes in their holy miniſtrations, then ſuch their ordinarie and vſuall garmentes, (being comelie and cleanly gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes) as by cuſtome, or law of the Countrey, they vſually weare.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:13051:7"/>For if all ordinarie garmentes be ſanctified a like, to miniſter, and people, by the worde of God and prayer, as all ordinarie meates and drinkes be, we demand, what reaſon your Lordſhips can alleadge out of holy writt, that the publike ſervice, accompliſhed by the Miniſter, in his ordinarie apparell, ſhould not be as acceptable to the Lord, as is the publique ſervice performed by the people, in their ordinarie gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.</p>
            <p>And if your Lordſhips can affoord vs no reaſon out of holy Writt, why offering vp of prayers, preaching the Worde, or adminiſtring the Sacramentes, ſhould be leſſe acceptable to the Lord, when the ſame are performed in an ordinarie garment, and not in a proper miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all garment: we then demaunde, whether your Lordſhips by any rule of holy Writ, can prove vnto vs, that the worde preached, Sacraments adminiſtred, and prayers offered vp in a proper miniſterial, rather then in an ordinary garment, can be of more efficacie, profit or edification vnto men?</p>
            <p>For as the manifeſtation of the ſpirit is given to every man to profit withall, ſo muſt all things which are done in the Church, bee done to the vſe, benefite and profite of the Church: Vnto theſe two latter que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, if your Lordſhips ſhall anſwere, that the miniſtration of the Worde and Sacramentes, can not be proved by holy Writ, to bee in it owne nature, either more acceptable to the Lord, or of more efficacie, profite and edification vnto men, when the ſame is accompliſhed by a Miniſter, wearing only his ordinarie garment: And yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſhall tell vs, that the not wearinge of a proper miniſteriall gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the ſervice of prayer, preaching the Worde, and miniſtring the Sacraments, may be both diſpleaſing to God, &amp; hurtful to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, vpon circumſtance &amp; contempt of the Churches, or Magiſtrates commaund: Then we replie and affirme, that you begge the thing in queſtion, driving vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> backe agayne, to ſeeke your reſolution of that doubt, which we moved above, in the ſecond principall demand:</p>
            <p>For vnleſſe the Church and ſovereigne Chriſtian Magiſtrate, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled by holy Writt to commaund a proper miniſterial garment vnder the Goſpell, the not wearing of ſuch a proper miniſteriall garment, commaunded by the Magiſtrate, or by the Church, can be neither an offence to God, nor hurtfull to the people.</p>
            <p>Beſides if neither the Church nor Magiſtrate, have any certaine rule out of holy Writt, for the reſolution of faith, in commanding a proper
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:13051:7"/>
miniſteriall garment; Then lyeth the ſame Miniſteriall garment vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a iuſt ſuſpition of abomination, as being a thing invented by man: And then alſo how ſhould a Miniſter beeing bound to take for his marke the only will of God, as it is manifeſted &amp; opened vnto him in the word, be excuſable <hi>in foro conſcientiae,</hi> if in the execution of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, he may faſhion him ſelfe to the invention of man?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the preaching of the worde of God, is of greater moment and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Obiection.</note> 
               <hi>then that the ſame ſhould be left of for the not vſing of a proper ministeriall garment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is true indeed (ſay wee) if a Miniſter by the vſe of ſuch a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> ſhould not ſinne? But that a Miniſter not fully perſwaded in his minde of the lawfull vſe of a proper miniſteriall garment, may weare it doubtingly, and ſo ſinne, to the end he may preache the Worde: we doubte greatly whether your Lordſhips bee able to prove this out of holy Writt &amp; of this we pray your reſolutions? For how ſhould a man doe evill that good may come thereby, when as the Scripture teacheth vs, that his damnation is iuſt, that ſo doeth?</p>
            <p>The not preaching of the word then, being no ſinne in a Miniſter, when for the keeping of a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, in not vſing a proper mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall garment, he is commanded by a ſuperiour power not to preach the word; we demand herevpon, whether your Lordſhips ſinne not rather in preſſing, then the Miniſter in refuſing this kinde of Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall garment.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing wee are fallen by occaſion vpon this compariſon of preaching the worde, and wearing a proper miniſteriall garment, we pray your Lordſhips patiently to heare, and quietly to anſwere our demandes?</p>
            <p>Our demand then, is whether in your iudgements, the preaching of the word be not in it owne nature more precious, more needfull and more profitable for the people, then can bee the wearing of a proper miniſteriall garment?</p>
            <p>If your Lordſhips ſhould preferre the wearing of ſuch a miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all garment to the preaching of the worde, in this caſe, if we ſhould hould our peace, the very ſtones might cry out ſhame vpon our faces; for we are taught out of holy Writt, that <hi>Marie</hi> was commended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Martha,</hi> for that ſhee ſitting at the feete of Ieſus to heare him preach the word, had choſen the better parte, even one thing that was neceſſary, and which might not be taken from her.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:13051:8"/>If your Lordſhips anſwere (as the trueth is) that the preaching of the word, is more precious, needfull and profitable for the Church, then is the wearing of a proper miniſteriall garment; Then wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand why grave, learned and Godly Preachers, whom the King him ſelfe confeſſeth to love and to honor, have bene put to the worſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſilence, ſuſpended &amp; excommunicated for the not wearing of ſuch a Miniſteriall garment, when as notwithſtanding light, laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, and vnlearned Miniſters no-preachers, (if ſo be they have worne a proper miniſteriall garment) have bene ſuffered quietly to enioy their functions, and their benefices?</p>

            <p>Indeed if it may pleaſe your Lordſhips, this is ſoone ſaide; but by<note place="margin">Gentl.</note> your leaves, the thing is not ſo ſone done; yea and beſides we demand what good ſecuritie your Lordſhips can give vnto the King and State in this caſe?</p>
            <p>For in a matter of ſo great danger, as is the perill of the ſoules of the Kinges ſubiectes, it were no good ſaftie (in our opinion,) to truſt your bare wordes for the time to come; when as in time paſt vpon pretence of the wante of able &amp; preaching Miniſters, ye have thought it fitt, rather then to have none at all, to reteyne a number of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preaching miniſters, knowne to bee no better then idle beaſtes and flow bellies.</p>
            <p>And if your Lordſhips already have ſuch a ſufficient number of <hi>learned, ſober, wiſe and ſofte ſpirited Preachers,</hi> to bee diſpoſed vpon vacant benefices at your commaunde, as that you bee able to furniſhe the Churches of all thoſe miniſters, whom you intend to deprive, for not conformitie vpon an inſtant: wee praye your Lordſhippes to reſolve the Kinge what charitie you have carryed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde his people in time paſt, when you have collated (for a great parte) the benifices of your owne giftes, either vpon no Preachers, or at leaſtwiſe vpon ſtrawberie preachers; but if your Lordſhippes intende hereafter to ſende foorth Preachers, that ſhall yeeld beryes, not once in the yeare onely, but at the leaſt ſtrawe once every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth; then wee demande? what thankes you would con<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, in caſe they ſhould provide no better Cookes for the dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of your dyners, then ſuch onely, as vnder one whole monethes ſpace, could not diſpatch the roaſting of an egge, or frying of a ſmelt?</p>
            <p>If your Lordſhips thinke that the preaching Miniſters, not yeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Chriſtian Magiſtrates authoritie, in the not vſing of this miniſteriall (falſly by you ſo called indifferent) apparell, by ſuch their diſobedience, may bee an example vnto the people, of like diſobedience in other matters: Then wee demande, whether your Lordſhippes carry not a teſtimonie in your owne conſciences, that their abſtayning from the vſe of Miniſteriall apparrell, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede not rather from an honeſt and good hearte, to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of GOD, then of any evill affection conceyved againſt the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:13051:9"/>
authoritie of the Magiſtrate? for before the Kingdome of England was lawfully inveſted in the Royal perſon of our Soveraine Lord King IAMES, did not ſundry of them abide many ſharpe reproches and bitter tauntes, for their Scotizing, and defending the ſingle forme of church policie, vpheld by the Kings authoritie in the Realme of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land? yea and doe not the ſame Miniſters now at this day hartily and devoutly pray, for the life and proſperitie of the King, the Queene, the noble yong Prince, and all other the Kings Royall progenie? yea and excepting this one point of their not conformitie vnto the ceremonies (wherein they alleadge for them ſelves, the conſcience of the vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes and inconvenience of the ſaid ceremonies) are they not knowne to be men worthy to be reſpected as the Miniſters of Chriſt? men of good reputation for learning? of honeſt converſation? and peaceable among their neighbours? and men very obedient (this one thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) to all authoritie? by whoſe good doctrine alſo, and example of life, the Magiſtrates in every Countie have found it more eaſie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinew the common people in the dewties of their ſubiection, and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie to the ſupreme power?</p>
            <p>Nay, which is more at this very inſtant, doe not they extraordinarily declare and teſtifie their love, their loyaltie and their fidelitie vnto the King, when by their loanes they ſupply the Kings want, though in the meane time they them ſelves want, and be driven to borrow to ſupply their owne neceſſities? if then in theſe great and waightie things, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to the dignitie of the Kings Crowne, they carefully and holily approve the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelves to be both teachers &amp; followers of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles doctrine, would they not aſwell (trow you) by the wearing of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteriall garment, ſubiect their neckes to the Kings authoritie, if by a greater band of faith &amp; obedience to the moſt high and mightie God, they were not drawne to the not wearing thereof?</p>
            <p>Touching the reaſon yealded by ſome, that miniſteriall apparell, is to diſtinguiſh the miniſter from other men: it ſeemeth vnto vs to be a reaſon altogether without reaſon: for albeit the outward forme of a Miniſters ordinary apparell may lawfully and expediently differ from the outward faſhion of apparell common to other men, and ſo the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters perſon by his apparell may be knowne vnto all ſuch as know him not by face: Nevertheleſſe it is void of all ſenſe, that his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall apparell, in the publike ſervice of that Church, whereof he is a Miniſter, ſhould bee an inſeparable note, to diſtinguiſh his perſon,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:13051:9"/>
from the perſons of every of his people: For ſithence by name, by face, by office, by place, by voice, yea by ordinary apparrell alſo, every mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is, or ought to be known vnto his people, what a kind of found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is it, to imagine that a miniſter can better be knowne by wearing of a miniſteriall garment, then by the dewe execution of his miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all function.</p>
            <p>Concerning the reaſon of decencie and comlines vrged by ſome, for the vſe of a white miniſteriall garment, in the miniſterie of the Goſpell, becauſe the ſame cometh more aptly to bee diſcuſſed in the queſtion following, we will not trouble your Lordſhips at this time with any other matter, about the two firſt demandes: And therefore we will proceede to the thirde; which for your Lordſhips better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, we hold it not amiſſe to repeate againe.</p>
            <p>If it bee lawfull for a ſoveraine Magiſtrate, by authoritie of holy writt, to ordeine and appropriate a miniſteriall garment, for the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpell, then we demand, whether by authoritie of holy Writt, he may ordayne and appropriate ſuch a miniſteriall garment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in matter, forme and <hi>ſpecie</hi> differeth not from that miniſteriall gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which by the high Prieſt &amp; chiefe Prince of idolatry, hath bene, and ſtill is ordeyned and appropriated to be a neceſſary prieſtly gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for his idolatrous Prieſts, in their idoll ſervice?</p>
            <p>And to the end your Lordſhips may perceave our demands to bee made co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcionably &amp; not humorouſly, or novelouſly, we have thought neceſſary to lay downe and annex certaine principles or canons out of holy Writ, whervpon our Demands and reaſons are grounded, which grounds and reaſons alſo, we extend againſt croſſing in Baptiſme, and Kneeling in the acte of receving the Communion.</p>

            <p>From theſe grounds of the Law, the Prophets, and the Goſpell, wee demand whether your Lordſhips againſt theſe, can oppoſe any other rules of holy Writt, to prove that any Chriſtian Magiſtrate, Chriſtian Miniſter, or Chriſtian people may be blameleſſe and without fault, <hi>in foro conſcientiae,</hi> if in the publike and outward worſhip of God, either he ſhall command, or they ſhall vſe, any the relickes, monuments or memorialls, any the delectable, vaine, and vnprofitable things, ſome times, or now apperteyning to the idolatrous ſacrifice of that great and knowne idole, the Popiſh Maſſe.</p>
            <p>For if every commandement of the firſt Table of the Law, be a way, and bee a path out of the which no Chriſtian ought to turne a ſide, either to the right hand, or to the left; but in the which every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is bound aſwell in the time of the Goſpell, as every Iſraelite was bound in the time of the Lawe to walke; then not onely that great Idoll of the Popiſh Maſſe it ſelfe, ſett vp and worſhipped in the time of the Goſpell; but then alſo, all relickes, monuments, memorialls and delectable things with their acceſſaries, appendices, and appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinances, as a menſtrous cloth, ought to be caſt away, and to bee bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den get ye hence; eſpecially we ſay in the publike ſervice and worſhip of the true God.</p>
            <p>For by how much more, the glorie of the Sonne, who ſpake from heaven, doeth farre excell the honour of a ſervant, which ſpake on earth, by ſo much the more ought that Idoll &amp; that Idolatrie, which is ſet vp and committed in the time of the Goſpell, be eſteemed more vile and deteſtable, then was that Idoll and that Idolatrie ſet vp and committed in the time of the law.</p>
            <p>The reaſons of the prohibition of coveting, and of taking any the images, their coverings, their ornaments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their golde and their ſilver, vnder the Law were in number foure: Namely:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First they were an abhomination to the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then: A feare of the peoples being ſnared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, a threat of being accurſed:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And lastly, for that they were vaine, and could nothing profite.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:13051:10"/>If then that great Idoll of the Popiſh Maſſe, with all the Copes, Veſtiments, Surplices, Croſſes, Kneelings, Candles and other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morialls and delectable things, invented for the adorning and pompe thereof, be abhominable and accurſed in the ſight of God, bee alſo vaine and can nothing profit men: If alſo the Magiſtrate, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and people beleeving the Goſpel, may be ſnared, and ſhalbe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed after the maner of the Iſraelites, if ſo be without warrant from holy Writt, they ſhall vſe theſe things in the worſhip of God; we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, whether from the doctrine of the Law, the Prophets, and the Goſpell, we may not conclude thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>With whatſoever things, either Magistrate, Minister, or peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may be ſnared, and for the vſe of whatſoever things they may be accurſed, thoſe things may not lawfully be commanded or vſed in the publike worſhip of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But aſwell the Magistrate as the Ministers and people may then be ſnared, and ſhalbe accurſed with, and for the command and vſe of Copes, Surplices, Croſſes, &amp;c. when in the publike wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, they be commanded and vſed without warrant of his word:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore Copes, Surplices, Croſſes, &amp;c. may not be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nor vſed in the publike worſhip of God, without warrant of his word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If your Lordſhips denie the aſſumpt; and anſwere, that Copes, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, Croſſes, &amp;c. commanded and vſed for the adorning, and bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of that great Idoll the Maſſe, bee in their owne nature thinges indifferent, and none other otherwiſe can be accurſed or be a ſnare to any Chriſtian Magiſtrate, Miniſter or people, then as they bee imployed to the vſe and ſervice of that Idoll; and in this regarde, their free and liberall vſe is no more now forbidden, then is the eating of meates ſacrificed vnto Idolls, and that therefore all feare of being ſnared and accurſed, doeth ceaſe, becauſe wee have free libertie by the word for the eating of meates ſacrificed vnto Idolls; then here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto wee replie, that your anſwere is very vnſufficient and vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and without any ſtrength of reaſon, drawne from holie Writt.</p>
            <p>For though wee grant that nothing is vncleane of it ſelfe, and that we ought not to accompt that polluted, which God hath purified:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:13051:11"/>
nevertheleſſe we pray your Lordſhips to reſolve vs by holy Writt, that God hath by his worde aſwell purified Copes, Surplices, Croſſes, &amp;c. for the outward vſe of his publike worſhip, as by his word hee hath purified meates ſacrificed vnto idols, for the private vſe of mans life.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Peter</hi> had faſtened his eyes vpon the ſheete, let downe from<note place="margin">Act. 11.</note> heaven by the foure corners, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered and ſaw foure footed beaſts of the earth, and wilde beaſts, and creeping things, and foules of the heaven, which were all the good creatures of God, and which alſo in the beginning were created for the foode of man: only for a time while Iſraell was vnder the Schoolmaiſterſhip of the Lawe, certayne of theſe creatures were forbidden to be eaten, not becauſe they were in their owne nature evill, or vncleane, but only becauſe they were made vncleane for a time, by prohibition: And therefore when the fulneſſe of time was come, and that Chriſt the ende of the Lawe, was ryſen from the dead, the law of not eating meates forbidden ceaſed: And by letting downe the ſheete, and commandement given to <hi>Peter,</hi> to ſlay and to eate, <hi>Peter</hi> was aſſured that all thoſe meates were reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their primarie vſe, integritie, and puritie. And therefore theſe creatures being in their owne originall nature good; and in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning ſanctified by the Lord, to the vſe of mans life, howſoever the idolaters prophanely &amp; abuſively did ſacrifice them vnto their idoles, yet could thoſe idoles never ſo pullute them by their abuſe, as that they might vtterly take away the good and profitable vſe, for the which they were firſt created.</p>
            <p>But that Copes, Surplices, Croſſes, Candles, and other memorialls and delectable things, authoriſed by that man of ſinne, for the pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous ſervice of his great idoll, the Maſſe, bee of the nature of meates, or of the nature of gold and ſilver, (howſoever ſacrificed vnto idolls) we deny.</p>
            <p>For firſt: meates, gold and ſilver in their owne nature, were by creation (as earſt was ſaide) good, and to the ende wherevnto they were created ever bleſſed of God, and never accurſed; whereas on the other ſide, no reliques, monuments, or memorials of any idolatrie, were ever bleſſed, but ever accurſed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they were never in their firſt originall good or profitable, no not for that vſe wherevpon they were imployed: for as the Idole it ſelfe, is vayne, vnprofitable, polluted and abhominable, yea nothing in reſpect of that thing which it repreſenteth, even ſo alſo bee all the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſories
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:13051:11"/>
and appurtenances thereof, damned and execrable.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, theſe reliques, monumentes and memorialls of Idolatrie, being not the workes of God, created in the beginning for the vſe of man, but the workes of mens handes, applied to the ſervice of an Idol, are not by the prohibition of God, vncleane, and polluted only for a tyme, as certeyne meates were, but are evermore by a perpetuall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, things damned and accurſed for the vſe of any ſervice vnto God: And therefore howſoever (as meates are vſually ſolde in the ſhambles) they may be ſold in a ſpinſters, or in an Embrotherers ſhopp, and may be vſed by man, to ſome benefite of this life: yet that they may be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated from the ſervice of an Idol, to the worſhip of the trew God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warrant of being ſanctified to that vſe, by the worde of God, or that the Miniſters and people profeſſing the goſpell, may as intyrely &amp; freely vſe and receive them in the outward worſhip of the trewe God, as the popiſh prieſtes and people did in the ſervice of their great Idoll the Maſſe; we deny: And whether you be able to prooue the contrarie out of holy Writ, we demaund your reſolutions?</p>
            <p>And thus much for confirmation of the aſſumption of our former requeſt: it followeth that we demaund, whether your Lordſhips by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie rule out of holy Writ, be able to repugne theſe concluſions follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Firſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All Idolls with all their ornamentes, and all their appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, by the doctrine of holy Scriptures, as a menstruous cloth, are to be cast away and to be bidden get you hence:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Popiſh Maſſe is an Idoll, and all the Copes, Surplices, Croſſes, Candles, &amp;c. have bene, and yet be, ornamentes and appurtenances vnto that Idole of the popiſh Maſſe:</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Therefore the popiſh Maſſe, and all Copes, Surplices, Croſſes, Candles, &amp;c. as a menstruous cloth are to be cast away, and to be bidden gett you hence.</hi>

            <p>If your Lordſhips deny the truth of the firſt propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the firſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to be proved by thoſe places before quoted out of the law, the Prophetes and Apoſtles, then we pray your Lordſhips to yeeld vs ſome reaſon, from other places of holy Writt, for the confirmation of ſuch your negation?

            </p>
            <p>From theſe grounds of holy Writ, taken out of the law, we demand,<note place="margin">Deut. 12. 30. 31.</note> whether the worſhip of every Idoll, and falſe god, or not, rather every ſuperſtitious, and falſe worſhip of the true God bee forbidden? And whether this ſuperſtitious and falſe worſhip of the trew God, bee not intended to be that maner, forme and faſhion of worſhip, both wholy and in parte, which the Gentiles vſed in the worſhip of their Idolles?</p>
            <p>For there being a commaundement given before vnto the children of Iſraell, for the burning of the Images, and of the vtter deſtruction of all the Idolles of the Cananites: it is by theſe Scriptures commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (after theſe Idoles were deſtroyed, and the Images burnt) that the children of Iſraell ſhould not ſo much as once hearken after, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; how thoſe nations ſerved their gods, leaſt they ſhould be taken in a ſnare, to doe ſo, and likewiſe vnto the Lord their God, as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did vnto their Idoles:</p>
            <p>And thus much alſo doth that argument, drawen from the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the goſpell enforce, of not having felowſhip, concord, parte, or agreement with beliall; or with an Idoll: of the not taking of the marke of the beaſt in their handes, or in their foreheads; And therefore we again demand, whether the Church (falſly ſo called) of Rome, be not this great whore, with whom the kings of the earth have co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted fornication? And whether ſhee alſo be not from the earth, and of this

world? Whether the beautie of this great whore ſtand not in outwarde pompe of apparell, and outward ſhewes, after the manner of a ſtrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pett?</p>
            <p>Whether this outward pompe of apparell and ſhewes of impudency conſiſt not partly in Copes, Surplices, Croſſes, and ſuch like traſhe? And whether theſe Copes, Surplices, Croſſes, &amp;c. be not deſigned by that whore, to be the proper and peculiar cognizances, tokens, badges and enſignes of her lovers, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitting fornication with her great Idoll the breaden God?</p>
            <p>If your Lordſhips can iuſtly deny our demaunds, in the affirmative to be true: we then agayne demaund; If the bryde of the lambe, being a pure virgine, ſhall at any tyme be apparelled, in the acte of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of her beloved, like to the minnions wayting vppon the great Whore, in the acte of her fornications: wee demaunde (wee ſaye) whether the Bryde (in this caſe) can be precious and amiable in the eyes of the Bridegrome? can be ſaid to have no concord with beliall? no parte with an infidell? no agreement with an Idoll? can bee ſaide, not to take vpon her hande, vpon her forehead, or vpon her backe, the marke of the beaſt? Can be ſayd, not to doe ſo, and lykwiſe to the bryd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grome, as the mynions of the whore, doe to their Idole? or not to doe ſo, and lykewiſe, to God, as the papiſts doe to the devill?</p>
            <p>Nay, if the Church of England herſelf alone; bee not the bryde, but one of the maydes of the Bride, and if alſo ſhee profeſſe hir ſelf, to be the firſt of the three, rather then the laſt, of the the thirty worthyes and honorable Virgins; we demand what holy reaſon ſhould move this maide of England, ſtill to faſhion her Necklaces, her Bracelets, hir Frontlets, hir Cheynes, hir Iewels, hir lynen Apornes, hir gaudie Kirtles, like to thoſe which the moſt famous ſtrumpett, that ever was, (for pompous oſtentation and braverie) daily vſeth and putteth on, eſpecially ſithence all hir other fellow maides, in other Countries at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending vpon the Bride with moſt ſolemne vowes and obteſtations, and with a moſt holy diſdayne and indignation have abandoned and caſt away, as a menſtruous cloth, what attire ſoever hath bene, or yet is proper, to the minions of that great Whore?</p>
            <p>If your Lordſhips anſwere that the Maide of Englande, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly inſtructed from the Bridegroms voice, (that no Cope, Surplice or Croſſe is vncleane of it ſelfe,) may command hir Damſels, to attyre and faſhion their liveries, colours and badges, like to thoſe which the

            <p>For vnleſſe the Chriſtian Magiſtrate be armed with power from the Bridegrome, to chardge the maide of England to be thus attired, your Lordſhips can not be ignorant, but that aſwell the nurſing Father in commanding, as the nurſe Child in obeying, ſhall ſinne againſt the Bridgrome.</p>
            <p>For howſoever it may bee lawfull for the Chriſtian Magiſtrate to command or forbidde the vſe, or not vſe of every kinde of creature, which in it owne nature, by vertue of creation, is good, and therefore only called indifferent, becauſe indifferently at the moderate pleaſure of every man, the ſame with prayer and thankſgiving, may be vſed, or refuſed, for the vſe of this life without offence to God; nevertheles we greatly ſtand in doubt, whether the Chriſtian Magiſtrates authoritie reach ſo farr as to command that the worke of mans hands be vſed in the outward worſhip of the true God, which for the pollution and prophanation thereof in the ſervice of an Idoll, is become for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the true God, abhominable and damned.</p>

               <hi>maintenance and defence of our Copes, which are to be vſed onely in our Cathedrall and great churches, and not in your Parochiall churches, yet we pray you to carry a better estimation of the wearing of Surplices, by your Ministers, then you doe of the wearing of Surplices, by the popiſh Priests: Becauſe the fountayne from whence ours ſprange, and the end wherevnto ours tende and are applyed, bee much every way different from theirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why then give vs leave<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by your Lordſhips favour, to demand what<note place="margin">Gentl.</note> were the fountaynes from whence, and what are the endes wherevnto both theirs and ours ſprang, and do tend? Your Lordſhips can not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye but as theirs were firſt worne, without any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of God, ſo be ours, and that therfore, as the wearing of theirs was but by deviſe and authoritie of man, ſo is ours: As theirs were commaunded for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, comelines and decencie, vnto the minions of the great whore, ſo be ours commended to be decent, comely and orderly garments, for the maydes of the bryde. As theirs were for a conformitie amonge the lovers of her that committed fornication, ſo bee ours for an vniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie among the lovers of a pure and chaſt virgin: As theirs were for<note place="margin">Treat: of ceremon: ſect. 3.</note> notes and diſtinctions betweene the people and the prieſtes, ſo be ours held to be markes betweene the ſhepheardes and the ſheepe: As theirs might not be worne but vpon the vpper peltes of their prieſtes, ſo muſt not ours be vſed, but vpon the vpper garmentes of our miniſters: As their Prieſtes might not ſacrifice, nor make holy water without them, even ſo is it not lawfull for our Miniſters without them, to pray or to adminiſter the Sacramentes. As theirs were ſignificant, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, were altogether idle, vayne, fruitleſſe, and without edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: ſo be ours mainteyned to bee neither darke nor dumme cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, to ſerve as a decent order, and diſcipline, and ſuch as be apt to ſtirre vp the dull mynd of man, to the remembrance of his dutie to God, by ſome ſpeciall ſignification, whereby he might bee edified, to have reſpect how to pleaſe God and profit the church. Whereas never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe they be in trueth without edificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, without profit, nay rather
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:13051:16"/>
hurtfull to the church, without pleaſing God, without vſe, idle, vayne, and needles; As theirs might not be vſed at any other time, or in any other place, but only in the place &amp; at the time of their ſervice of their falſe god; ſo may not ours be vſed in any other place, or at any other time, but only at the time, and in the place of the worſhip of the true God.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, whoſoever amonge the Prieſtes, refuſed to weare their Surplices, were adiudged Sciſmatickes and to bee excommunicated; even ſo what ſoever miniſter, among our Miniſters, denieth to receive and to put on one of our Surplices, he is at the pleaſure of his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie, for ſuch refuſall, to be ſuſpended, excommunicated, and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. In ſo much as there is not any one leaſt circumſtance to be found, wherein their, and our Surplices, differ in matter, forme, vſe, ende, or application.</p>
            <p>And thus much of our Demaundes, grounded vpon holy Writt, whether the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, may commaunde and appropriate a Miniſteriall garment for the Miniſters of the Goſpell, and eſpecially ſuch a Miniſteriall garment, as hath bene a prieſtly garment, for the Prieſtes of that great Idoll the Maſſe.

               <hi>From which grounds we demand:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether your Lordſhips can prove out of holy Writt, that there can be a ſervice yealded vnto God, where God hath not given a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement?</p>
            <p>Whether the more a man thinketh to doe any thinge by his owne wiſedome, and not as God inſtructeth him, the more he doe not prove him ſelfe to be a vile beaſt?</p>

            <p>Whether God wilbe honored, according to mans fantaſie, or rather doth not deteſt, whatſoever is not grounded vpon his worde?</p>
            <p>If your Lordſhips for the avoyding of theſe demandes, ſhall deny the feigned making of a croſſe, and feigned ſigning of the childe in the forehead with a croſſe, in the adminiſtration of Baptiſme, to be any ſervice, or to be any worſhip vnto God, and therefore neither voluntarie ſervice, neither will-worſhip vnto God: then we demaunde for what intent, or to what end, the making of a Croſſe, and ſigninge the forehead of the childe with a croſſe, is commaunded as a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie ſervice, to be performed by the Miniſter, in that publique acte of Gods worſhip? for if the forme and manner of Gods worſhip (as you ſay) be eſtabliſhed, preſcribed, &amp; conteyned in the booke of common<note place="margin">Conſtitut. &amp; ca. publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed 1604. com. 4. 10.</note> prayer, if alſo the miniſtration of the Sacrament commaunded in that booke, be (as you ſay) no corrupt, ſuperſtitious, or vnlawfull worſhip, neither conteyning any thing in it that is repugnant to the ſcriptures: how ſhould not the making of a Croſſe, and ſigning of the childe in the forehead with a croſſe, but be a pure, a religious, &amp; a lawfull wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip vnto God? Beſides, if making a croſſe vpon the childes forehead, and ſigning the forehead of the childe with a croſſe, be no act of gods worſhip in the adminiſtration of Baptiſme; Then we demaund, how the Miniſter <hi>in foro co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcientiae,</hi> can be guiltles of taking the holy name of God in vaine, when as in the act of Gods ſervice and worſhip, hee doth neither worſhip, nor ſerve God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But, Sirs, by your patience, the Minister in obeying the authoritie of</hi>

For (ſay we) where no commaundement of God, there no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice vnto God: And therefore if the Church, by ſuch her commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, doe but pleaſe hir ſelfe; and not ſerve and pleaſe God.

               <hi>But, Sirs, the acte of making a Croſſe, and ſigning the childe in the</hi>

For if it be a meere tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall, and no divine or religious action<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or if it be partly traditional, and partly divine, we ſtill vrge your Lordſhips to prove vnto vs, by the holy ſcriptures, whether it were ever lawfull in any act of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to act a thing meerely traditionall, or partly traditionall, and partly divine.</p>

            <p>We confeſſe, that the Church with the Magiſtrates conſent, may determine of the comely and orderly acting of theſe things: becauſe <hi>Aliquo per Deum mandato, omnia ea mandantur, ne quibus illud mandatum commodè &amp; religiosè adimpleri non potest:</hi> And therefore thoſe divine, neceſſarie, and naturall actions before remembred, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending vpon, or proceeding from the powers and faculties of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die or mind, being ſuch as without which the outward ſervice of God can not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> commodiouſly, decently, and orderly be accompliſhed, we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that they be confirmed vnto vs from generall rules of holy writ.</p>
            <p>And this alſo may ſerve for an anſwere, for the having of water, &amp; a veſſell to conteyne water; becauſe, as water of neceſſitie is required to the adminiſtration of baptiſme, ſo muſt alſo water (we having no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters running through our churches) of neceſſitie be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyned in ſome veſſell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but as for making a croſſe, or ſigning the forehead of the child with a croſſe in baptiſme, becauſe the ſame by your confeſſion, is no

            <p>
               <hi>But by your patience, Sirs, this making a croſſe vpon the childes fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Biſhops.</note> 
               <hi>and this ſigning him with a ſigne of the croſſe, in token, &amp;c. though the ſame be no part of Baptiſme, nor any parte of the outward worſhip of God, nor any naturall, nor neceſſarie action of the body or mind, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which Baptiſme can not be administred, yet is the ſame a ſolemnitie, &amp; an ornament apperteyning vnto Baptiſme, by the order of the church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which ought not to be omitted and left vndone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But by your Lordſhips favour, this your Apologie is of no freſher<note place="margin">Gentl.</note> hue, nor of any deeper dye, then wherewith the great Papiſtes and fond Canoniſtes have alwayes bepainted and becouloured their ſigning, their ſalting, their ſpitteling, their oyling, their chriſmating, and their other ſuch like ſolemnities, according to theſe verſes:</p>
            <q>
               <l>Sal, oleum, chriſma, cereus, chriſmate, ſaliua,</l>
               <l>Flatus, virtutem Baptiſmatis ista figurant;</l>
               <l>Haec cum patrinis, non mutant eſſe, ſed ornant.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And therefore we pray your Lordſhips to reſolve vs by ſome place of holy Writt, whether the Papiſts and you, or either of you, be inabled to invent, or ordeyne ſuch ſolemnities, ornaments, ſignes &amp; figures of croſſes to be vſed in the publique adminiſtration of Baptiſme, as never once came in the mind of God to have deviſed or vſed? And ſo much the rather doe wee deſire your Lordſhips reſolutions herein, becauſe there is no maner of ſolemnitie, ſigne, figure or ornament of a croſſe, required by the book of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon prayer, to be vſed in that adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Baptiſme, which in the ſame book, is intituled private Baptiſme.</p>
            <p>For if Baptiſme without any reall ſolemnitie, or actuall ornament of a croſſe, or of the ſigne of a croſſe, may bee adminiſtred privately, how much more without theſe humane ſolemnities and ornamentes might baptiſme be adminiſtred publiquelie?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:13051:18"/>There being then in the Church of England, two formes &amp; maners of the adminiſtration of Baptiſme, the one private, the other publike; the one with a croſſe, the other without a croſſe, and both of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by your late Canons, not to be corrupt, ſuperſtitious, or vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, by meanes alſo whereof there is to be ſeene no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formitie, or vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie betwene having ſolemnities &amp; ornaments of croſſes, &amp; ſignes of croſſes in publike baptiſme, &amp; betwene the not having ſolemnities and ornaments of croſſes, and ſignes of croſſes in private baptiſme: we pray your Ll. to reſolve vs out of holy writ; whether theſe ornaments &amp; ſolemnities of croſſes, &amp; ſignes of croſſes, for the ſtability of publike peace &amp; quiet in the church, &amp; the not enforcing of any mans conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with the vſe of the croſſe, might not aſwell be left out in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of publike, as it is in the adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of private baptiſme?</p>
            <p>For whether reſpect be had to the brethren offended, or made weake by the vſe therof, or whether we regard the not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firming &amp; ſtrenghte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſuperſtitious in their error, there is farr much more danger like to enſue, both to the one ſorte &amp; to the other, by the vſe of it, in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike, then in private Baptiſme, by reaſon that the aſſembly generally is evermore great in the one, and never but ſmall in the other.</p>
            <p>But to let paſſe this deformitie of croſſing &amp; not croſſing, in publik &amp; private baptiſme, we will proſecute ſome few demands, not yet moved, concerning the feigned imaginarie and ayrie croſſing, vſed in publike Baptiſme. And firſt, we pray your Lordſhips to reſolve vs out of holy writ, how a Miniſter, <hi>in foro conſcientiae,</hi> can be cleare &amp; without ſinne, when as in the ſame publike &amp; continewed act of Gods worſhip, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginarily &amp; feignedly he ſhal affirme the doing of a thing, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> indeed &amp; in trueth he doth not, ne poſſibly can do? if the Miniſter then without ſome inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, chalk, rudle or ſuch like, can make no croſſe vpon the childs forehead, and yet ſhall ſay (as the booke preſcribeth) that he ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth him with the ſigne of the croſſe, what a groſſe fitten call ye that?</p>
            <p>To affirme that the paſſing of the Miniſters hand, thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me or finger, croſwiſe in the ayre over the childs forehead, is to make a croſſe vpon the childs forehead, &amp; that the ſame paſſing in the ayre, is alſo the ſigne of a croſſe, this (we ſay) to affirme, is as if a man ſhould aſſevere, that the flying of a bird in the ayre, &amp; the ſlyding of a ſerpent vpon a ſtone, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a bird, and the ſigne of a bird in the ayre; a ſerpent, and the ſigne of a ſerpent, vpon a ſtone: And to ſay that there is an inviſible croſſe, or a ſigne of an inviſible ſigne of a croſſe, remaining in the ayre over
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:13051:19"/>
the childes forehead, how abſurd, and without all reaſon that ſaying is, we leave to your Lordſhips conſiderations.</p>
            <p>For if it be vnpoſſible to make a croſſe, or the ſigne of a croſſe, vpon the running water, much more vnpoſſible is it to make a croſſe, or the ſigne of a croſſe, in the ſubtile and repleniſhing ayre: wherefore vnleſſe your Lordſhips can prove by ſome rule of holy Writt, that every Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is indowed with power from above, to make croſſes, and ſignes of croſſes, which be inviſible, and that theſe inviſible ſignes and croſſes be alſo inviſible tokens in the childes forehead, of his being not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of Chriſt crucified, of his manfull fighting, &amp;c. we demand, what good plea <hi>in foro conſcientiae,</hi> your Lordſhips can frame to diſchardge the Miniſter from being guilty of a thrice feigned, imaginary &amp; lying croſſe? we ſay, thrice faigned at the leaſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, we receive and doe ſigne thee: ſecondly, with the ſigne; and thirdly, of the Croſſe. And what, if we ſaide fourthly, in token? for what token can the child, or his witneſſe, in his name receive &amp; keepe, when as neither he, nor they, have any croſſe, any ſigne, or any token of a croſſe given or delivered vnto them at all? which maner of croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, ſigning and tokening, may well bee compared to our atturnies proceeding by ſignes and profers, ſignes and profers; when indeed by ſuch their pleadings they haſten not, but delay their clyents cauſes, only making ſignes and profers, ſignes and profers, as though by this meanes they haſtened to an end, when as indeed they mind no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe.</p>
            <p>But to ſpeake no more of the Miniſters feigned ſignes and profers of making croſſes &amp; ſignes of croſſes in the ayre, vpon or over the childs forehead; Wee demand? whether not to be aſhamed to confeſſe the faith of Chriſt crucified; whether not to be aſhamed manfully to fight vnder his banner, againſt ſinne, the world and the divell; whether not to be aſhamed to continewe Chriſtes faithfull ſouldier and ſervant to his lifes end? We demand (we ſay) whether theſe three graces, be not all, &amp; every of them, inward, inviſible and ſpirituall graces, yea or no?</p>
            <p>If your Lordſhips anſwere, (as the trueth is) that theſe graces be all ſpiritual, inviſible &amp; inward graces, then becauſe by the book of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer (ſo the Miniſter make a croſſe) it is not materiall of what forme the croſſe be made: we demand, by what rules of holy writ, your Lordſhips can prove, that the ſigne of the croſſe of ſaint <hi>Iohns</hi> of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> the ſigne of ſaint <hi>Andrews</hi> croſſe, the ſigne of ſaint <hi>Peters</hi> croſſe,

the ſigne of the croſſe made after the Greeke T. or like the Hebrew χ. or like the Greeke <hi>X.</hi> or the ſigne of any other croſſe, (for there be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other formes of croſſes) can be a token of theſe ſpirituall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible graces, if ſo be they were engraven with a Diamond vpon the childes forehead.</p>
            <p>If your Lordſhips anſwere affirmatively, that the ſigne of ſaint <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes</hi> croſſe, of ſaint <hi>Iohns</hi> croſſe, of ſaint <hi>Peters</hi> croſſe, or the ſigne of any other croſſe, made by the Miniſter vpon the childes forehead, is a token of theſe inward, ſpiritual and inviſible graces; then we demand, whether your Lordſhips aſcribe not like power to every miniſter, for the tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſubſtantiation of every inviſible croſſe, feinedly made in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Baptiſme, to the forme of a true &amp; viſible croſſe, as the Pope attributeth to every Prieſte, for the tranſubſtantiation of every piece of bread, wherevpon he bloweth at the Altar, into the Body of Chriſt? or if your Lordſhips anſwere (becauſe there is no croſſe ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to be ſeene, but intelligiblie to be vnderſtood) that the imaginary feigned &amp; ayrie croſſe is a token of theſe inviſible &amp; ſpirituall graces; then againe we pray your Lordſhips to reſolve vs out of holy Writt, whether God did ever ordeine any inviſible ſignes, to bee inviſible to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, of inviſible graces, yea or no?</p>
            <p>And if God did never ordeine ſuch ſignes; then we demand, what authoritie man hath to ordeine ſuch ſignes?</p>
            <p>But if your Lordſhips ſhall anſwere negatively, <hi>viz:</hi> that the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſigne of the croſſe, imaginarily pretended to bee made by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, is not a token of theſe inward and ſpirituall graces; then wee demande, whether your Lordſhips with your owne mouthes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce not that thing to be falſe, which the booke of common prayer commandeth every Miniſter, with his lips to proclaime to be true?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But Sirs, by your leave, the Church hath power from Christ to ordeyne</hi>

Indeed, if this your propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could be proved true by any doctrine drawne from any other place of holy Writt, we would eaſilie graunt, the church with conſent of the chriſtian Magiſtrate having comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Copes, Surplices, Croſſes, kneelings, &amp;c. to be vſed in the church, that this the Apoſtles rule did binde all thoſe to kneele, to make croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and to weare Copes, and Surplices, not vngaynely, diſorderly or ſlovenly, but comely, hanſomely, and netely; but ſeeing your propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is falſe, and can not by any other place of holy ſcripture be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved true, you have drawne in the Apoſtles rule, as it were by the hayre, and pluckt it in, as it were by the heeles, to a wrong purpoſe, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it to a wronge ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, becauſe theſe wordes <hi>decencie</hi> and <hi>order,</hi> mencioned in your propoſition, carrie a double ſenſe, we pray your Lordſhips to reſolve vs, whether by theſe wordes <hi>decencie &amp; order,</hi> you meane ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie ſuch a decencie, and ſuch an order, as for the allowance whereof, playne and evident teſtimonies may be founde in holy Writt, that the ſame decencie and order is pleaſing vnto God? or whether you meane ſuch a decencie and order only, as for the which (we having no other warrant, then tradition or commaundment of man) is only pleaſinge vnto man? touching which latter kinde of decencie and order, the ſame being but humane, we demaund, if either Miniſters or people bee not fully perſwaded in minde, that this humane decencie and order, is by ſome generall rule of holy Writt, aſwell pleaſing vnto God; as the ſame by ſome law of man, is knowne to be well pleaſing vnto man: we demaund (we ſay) in this caſe whether Miniſter or people, <hi>in foro con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiae,</hi> be obliged to vſe this ſo called and commaunded decencie or order, yea or no? For albeit every ſoule be ſubiect to the higher pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; nevertheleſſe, for the avoyding of error, and that the conſcience of every ſoule may be vpright with God, in her ſubiection, to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of man: the conſcience muſt take direction, not from the onely will and authoritie of man, but from the only Writt and authoritie of God. And therefore as every Magiſtrate, ought to be fully perſwaded in his conſcience of his commaund, before he conſcionably may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, that to be obeyed which he commaundeth: even ſo it be hoveth every ſoule, before he obey, to be perſwaded fully in his minde, that the thing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded, ought for conſcience ſake, to be obeyed, becauſe the ſame is approved by the holy word of God: For otherwiſe howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever outwardly he may ſerve, and pleaſe the Magiſtrate, yet inwardly &amp;

in the ſpirite, he can never be aſſured that in this caſe, he ſhal ſerve God: becauſe the Magiſtrates commandement ſimply conſidered in it ſelf, is not any true ſpirituall guide, for the conſcience of any ſoule, to be ledd and conducted by.</p>
            <p>Now then to your Lordſhips former queſtion, whether the Church and ſupreme chriſtian Magiſtrate, ought not to ſitt, as ſoveraigne Iudge, vpon the conſcience of every ſoule, about the determination of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie and order to be kept by that ſoule, your Lordſhips by this our diſcourſe, eaſily may perceave, that we may well anſwere your demand, if we propound but one queſtion to another.</p>

And indeed to eſtabliſh the command or conſcience of the civill Magiſtrate, to be the ſquire &amp; plu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>met of every ſubiects conſcience, were to wreſt the holy Scriptures, &amp; to eſtabliſh (as the Antichriſtianites do) a tyranny over the conſciences of ſubiects: Thus much touching that later kind of humane decencie and order before ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>And as concerning that kind of decency &amp; order for the which there may be teſtimonies found in holy Writ, that they be pleaſing vnto God: we affirme that the church and Chriſtian Magiſtrate ought not only to be commanders and preſervers of the ſame, but that both Miniſters and people alſo ought to be followers and embracers thereof.</p>
            <p>Nay, we ſay more, yea we affirme, that every humane decencie &amp; order whatſoever ought to ſtoupe and give place vnto that order and decencie for the which teſtimonies are to be found in holy writ, that the ſame be pleaſing vnto God, And therfore we demand, by what rule of holy writ, your Lordſhips can prove your late convocationall canons, to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance from the ſpirit of Chriſt, when as by the ſame ye have co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a decencie &amp; order, meerly humane preciſely to be obſerved in the church, inſteed of that decencie &amp; order which at the beginning was in the church &amp; which being pleaſing vnto God could not be but divine?</p>

            </p>
            <p>By your Lordſhips favour, before we make full anſwer vnto this your<note place="margin">Gentl.</note> queſtion; we demand, whether your Lordſhips bee able to prove out of holy Writt, that the outward forme and maner of acting any ſervice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, by our Saviour Chriſt or his Apoſtles in prayer, preaching the word &amp; adminiſtring the Sacraments, was an vnorderly, or an vndecent forme or maner of acting that ſervice before God, yea or no?</p>
            <p>If your Lordſhips anſwere, as the trueth is, that the outward maner of acting every kind of ſervice by our Saviour Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles, was ſo decently &amp; orderly done, and ſo acceptable vnto God, as nothing in the outward acting thereof could be more, wee then pray your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips to reſolve vs firſt, what warrant you have out of holy writt, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeyſe all the Miniſters of the outward acting of the whole worſhip of God in prayer and adminiſtring the Sacraments, without a Surplice?</p>
            <p>Secondly, what warrant you have from the ſpirit of Chriſt, to diſſeyſe all the Miniſters of the acting of ſome part of Gods worſhip, in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of publike Baptiſme, without making a croſſe vpon the childes forehead, and ſigning him with the ſigne of the croſſe?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, what approbation you have from the ſpirit of Chriſt, wholy<note place="margin">Conſt. 27</note> to diſſeyſe all the ſonnes and daughters of God, of the acte of ſitting in the acte of receiving the Sacrament of the Lordes Supper? For in that you have commanded that no Miniſter, when he celebrateth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhall wittingly adminiſter the ſame to any but to ſuch as kneel, you haue, by conſequence, inhibited every one that ſitteth, to receive the ſame. And thus to eſtabliſh your owne humane decencie and order of kneeling, in the acte of receiving the communion, you have diſſeyſed vs of that Euangelicall decencie and order of ſitting, warranted vnto the Miniſters and vnto vs by the example of our Saviour Chriſt and his<note place="margin">Mar. 14. 18.</note> Apoſtles, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as at his laſt Supper, he him ſelf delivered both the Bread and the Wine vnto his Apoſtles, as they ſate, and not as they kneeled at the Table; whereby it appeareth that you looked not vnto the holy one of Iſraell, nor ſought vnto the Lord; and he yet is wiſeſt.<note place="margin">Iſa. 21. 1. 2</note>

            <p>Beſides, we demand, whether your Lordſhips had not worthely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to have bene much praiſed and commended by all the churches, for that thanks might have bene given by many vnto God, for you, if ſo be for reverence vnto the example of our Saviour Chriſt, who did all things well, and conformitie to his Apoſtles, ye had commanded the people not to have kneeled in the acte of receiving after the faſhion of the catholicke fornicatours, who doe all things ill, but rather to have ſitten after the maner of the Apoſtles? eſpecially ſithence betwene this maner preſcribed of receiving the Sacrament of the Lordes Supper kneeling, &amp; the maner of the receiving the Sacrament of Baptiſme, yea and the word it ſelfe, ſitting or ſtanding, and not kneeling, there can be found no maner of conformitie at all; And yet as we deny not (when we come to the Font, or to the Sermon, both before, &amp; after the Word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and Baptiſme adminiſtred) but that we ought reverently and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formely to kneele in prayer &amp; thankeſgiving preſcribed by the booke. Even ſo alſo, we acknowledge, when we come to the Lords Table, that before and after the deliverie and receiving of the Sacrament, we ought to confeſſe our ſinnes, to pray and to give thankes, reverently and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formely kneeling vpon our knees: But that we ſhould more kneele in the very acte of receiving Bread and Wine, at the Miniſters hand, at the Lords Table, then in the name of our children, in the very acte of our childrens receiving Water vpon their faces, or being dipt in Water, wee ſhould kneele at the Font, in the time of Baptiſme; we for our partes muſt confeſſe, that as yet this myſterie of conformitie and reverence, to kneele in the acte of receiving the communion, is hidden from vs:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:13051:23"/>
becauſe we ſee no more needfulneſſe of reverence and conformitie for kneeling, to be in the acte of receiving the one Sacrament, then to be in the act of receiving the other: nor that there is any greater reverence, or conformitie of kneeling to bee vſed, when the Miniſter breaketh bread for our bodyes, which periſheth at the communion Table, then when he breaketh the bread of life for our ſoules, which periſheth not in the Pulpit.</p>
            <p>Nay, furthermore what conformitie is there preſcribed in the booke of common prayer; when in one &amp; the ſame church, and in one &amp; the ſame act of receiving the Lords Supper, it permitteth the Miniſter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſtanding, and preſcribeth the people to receive kneeling? or what greater reverence is there required by the ſheepe, then is to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the ſheepheard, who ſhould be an example to the flocke?</p>
            <p>The words of the book for the Miniſters ſtanding, when he receiveth the communion, ſeeme vnto vs to bee ſo perſpicuous and without all maner of ambiguitie, as without an abſurditie they can not bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued to command a Miniſter to kneele<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the maner how the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the place, or how other Miniſters, if any be preſent to helpe him, ſhould receive, is not preſcribed at all, vnleſſe it be preſcribed, that he and they, ſhould receive ſtanding.</p>
            <p>Nay, howſoever in the ſame book it be ſaid, that the Miniſter ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the communion in both kindes to the people in their hands knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, nevertheleſſe it followeth not herevpon, (the law being not in the negative, but in the affirmative) that the Miniſter may not deliver the communion to the people ſtanding or ſitting, or that the people be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly bound not to ſtand or to ſitt, but to kneele.</p>

            <p>If any of your Ll. had bene Archbiſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> or of <hi>Creete,</hi> had bene Biſhop of <hi>Ieruſalem, Rome</hi> or <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> in the Apoſtles time: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnder the title of order &amp; vniformitie, or by right of ſuperioritie &amp; power, (you might without breach or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradiction of the Apoſtles doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine) have co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded any brethren, within your charge, being weak in faith, to have eaten meats, forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the law, or ſacrificed vnto Idols?</p>
            <p>Againe, if any of your Lordſhips in the Apoſtles time, had bene an Archbiſhop or a Biſhop, and by your Archiepiſcopall, or Epiſcopall authoritie, had commaunded the Paſtours, Elders and Brethren vnder your chardge, being weake in faith, by example of the ſtrong in faith,
<pb facs="tcp:13051:28"/>
and for conformities ſake, to have eaten meates ſacrificed vnto Idols, or forbidden by the law; we demand, whether ſuch your commandement had bene a charitable commandement, yea or no?</p>
            <p>Yea, and we demand, whether the ſame your commandement (vnder what pretence of canonicall obedience, vnitie or conformitie, ſoever) might have excuſed the weake in faith, from ſinning againſt Chriſt, if at your commandment they being not fully perſwaded in their minds, had eaten of theſe meates doubtingly?</p>
            <p>And if the Apoſtles charitie were ſo great, as that he would never have<note place="margin">1. Cor. 8. 13.</note> eaten fleſh, while the world ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth, rather then he would greeve or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his weak brother, or give him an occaſion to ſinne; we dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d how ſmall charitie the men of our age may ſeeme to have, who be ſo far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not greeving &amp; not offending a weak brother, &amp; of not giving him an occaſion to ſinne, as that not only they content not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelves, by eating fleſh themſelves, to grieve &amp; to offend a weak brother, &amp; to give him an occaſion to ſinne, but alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand a weake brother to eate that meate, by eating wherof, he can not but fal, but ſtumble, but grieve, but offend, but ſinne, and but deſtroy him ſelfe? This kind of charitie may deſerve vnhappely the name of ſome Synodal or Provincial charitie, but certes it can neverworthely deſerve to be called an Apoſtolicall charitie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But, Sirs, you miſtake the matter very much, you deceive your ſelves, &amp;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Biſhops.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Touching the chriſtian Magiſtrates authoritie about ordering rites<note place="margin">Gentl.</note> &amp; ceremonies in the church, we have ſomewhat at large argued before, which we had thought might have fully ſatiſfied your Lordſhips, but becauſe it pleaſeth you ſtill to preſſe vs with the ſame, we muſt once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine plainly ſignifie vnto you; that we beleeve, that your ſelves do not attribute any more ſpirituall authoritie vnto the King, to make, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute and ordeine canons, conſtitutions, rites or ceremonies, then you give vnto him ſpirituall power to preach the word, adminiſter the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and excommunicate: For we beleeve, that your ſelves with the reſidue of the clergie, aſſembled by the Kings writt, in your convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, doe chalendge all ſpirituall power vnto your ſelves, to make, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deine and decree all maner of canons, conſtitutions, ordinances, orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, rites and ceremonies in the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:13051:28"/>Yea, and this ſpirituall power we beleeve, that you pretend to be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved vnto your ſelves, and the reſt of the clergie in the convocation, not from any ſpirituall power inveſted in the perſon of our ſoveraigne Lord the King, but onely from the ſpirituall power of our Saviour Chriſt alone. And this is manifeſt by your Cxxxix. canon, for ſo are your words: <hi>Whoſoever ſhall hereafter affirme that the Sacred Synode of this nation in the name of Christ, and by the Kings authoritie aſſembled, is not the church of England by repreſentation, let him be excommunicated, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe wordes (wee ſay) of your canon, <hi>viz. Sacred Synod is aſſembled in the name of Christ, and by authoritie of the King,</hi> plainely teſtifie, that you hold your Synode not to be aſſembled by authoritie of the King, in the name of the King, or in the name of Chriſt and the King, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the name of Chriſt: And therefore by your owne wordes, wee are inforced to beleeve that you attribute vnto the King none other autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, then ſuch as you attribute to the godly Kinges of <hi>Judah:</hi> namely an authoritie to aſſemble and command your perſons, as they aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and commanded the perſons of the Prieſtes. What? to execute the<note place="margin">1. Chron. 13. 2.</note> rites and ceremonies of the Kinges of <hi>Iudah?</hi> No: but to execute the rites and ceremonies of God.</p>
            <p>And ſo we beleeve your perſons being aſſembled by authoritie and commandement of the King, that your ſelves by your owne authoritie, and that in the name and by the power of Chriſt, and not in the name and power of the King, doe ordeine, decree and make canons, conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, rites and ceremonies, as if they were ſent vnto vs, by your handes, from God. And thus much doe the very firſt words of your firſt canon, and ſome words in your 140. 141. canons clearly prove: For howſoever in the title of your book, you vſe theſe words: <hi>Constitutions and Canons treated and agreed vpon, by the Biſhop of London, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet both in the proheme &amp; body of your firſt cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you affirme as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.

But howſoever (as yet) wee beleeve not this latter, yet ſtill we beleeve, that you appropriate vnto your owne perſons aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by the Kings writt, a ſole power, and that from our Saviour Chriſt, to give vnto your decrees, canons, conſtitutions, rites and ceremonies, their firſt being and their firſt birthright: and that you aſſigne vnto the King none other power, but a power of their after birth, &amp; of ratifying and confirming of that life, &amp; being, which your perſons have firſt put into them: So that the King is in this, but as it were an executioner of your canons, and not you the executioners of the Kings decrees. Yea &amp; thus much M.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Againe to deviſe new rites and ceremonies for the Church, is not the Princes vocation, but to receive and allow ſuch as the Scriptures and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons commend, and ſuch as the Biſhops &amp; Pastours of the place ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, not infringing the Scriptures or canons, &amp; ſo for all other eccleſiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call things &amp; cauſes, Princes be neither the deviſors nor directors of them, but the confirmers and establiſhers of that which is good, and displacers, and revengers of that which is evill, which power we ſay they have in all things, be they ſpirituall, eccleſiasticall or temporall.</hi> ibid. pag. 252.</p>
            <p>Yea, and moreover we beleeve, if any ſhould impugne or gaine-ſay, this your power of making ſpirituall and eccleſiaſticall decrees, in your

convocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not to belong properly to your miniſteriall power which you have by your divine offices in the church, that you would then fly for the interpretation of the ſtatute: <hi>1.

H. the eight hir Maieſties Father, or to K. Ed. 6. hir Maieſties brother: And that the Kings and Queenes of this Realme, may not challendge authoririe and power of any miniſtery of divine offices in the Churches.</p>
            <p>But vnder God to have ſoveraintie &amp; rule of all maner of perſons borne within hir Realmes, ſo as no other foreigne power, ſhal or ought to have any ſuperioritie over them; vpon this iniunction (we ſay) we build our former credence, that your Lordſhips iudge your only perſons, and the perſons of the reſt of the Clergie, &amp; not the miniſterie of your divine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, or any parte thereof, to be vnder the obedience of the Kings power; vnto which miniſterie alſo of divine offices, you attribute right of ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and making canons, rites and ceremonies in the Church, as a right properly incident and appertaining to that miniſtery, not of doctrine, but of divine governement, which you challendge to be due vnto you, as vnto Miniſters and Officers appointed to rule and governe the Church vnder Chriſt, by the holy Scriptures; And therefore we pray your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips henceforwards to put vs vnto no more paine, to anſwere this your argument, of Kingly and ſupreame authoritie.</p>
            <p>For we beleeve aſſuredly, if Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Deanes, Archdeacons and the reſt of the clergie, aſſembled by the Kings writt, by their delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate counſaile, voluntary and vnconſtrayned will, had not in their Synod decreed the vſe of Copes, Surplices, Croſſes, ſquare Cappes, Tippets, and ſuch traſh, or if they had not by the preſident of their aſſembly, moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſupplicated the King to command the vſe of theſe things, thus ordeined by them ſelves: we perſwade our ſelves aſſuredly, that the King by his abſolute, regall and ſupreame power, would never have conſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Deanes, Archdeacons, &amp;c. to have vndergone the yoke of theſe ceremonies; for the King right well knoweth, that in ſo doing, he ſhould not have walked in the wayes of the Godly kings of <hi>Iudah,</hi> then whoſe holy example to followe, his Highnes hath proteſted, to deſire nothing more.</p>
            <p>Neither for any other purpoſe, as it ſeemeth vnto vs, by your late ſpeaches in the eares of the King (<hi>no ceremony, no Biſhop</hi>) doe your ſelves
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:13051:30"/>
preſſe theſe ceremonies, then that they ſhould be in your owne hands, as croſier ſtaves, to ſtay vp from falling the tottering walles of your Lordly Iuriſdictions. And yet becauſe we never read in holy Writt, that any ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony was ever planted by our heavenly Father, to bee a leanetoo, for any Biſhops of Gods planting, or that the vnplanting of an humane ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, would be the vnplanting of any of Gods Biſhops, what ſhould we gather from hence, but that <hi>your Lordſhips bee no Biſhops of Gods planting;</hi> for Biſhops planted by the hande of God, in the Vineyard of Chriſt, be ſo faſt ſett, and ſo deeply rooted, that by no blaſt or ſtorme of humane ceremonies, they can be blowne vp.</p>
            <p>And thus much touching your argument of the Kings co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, for orders ſake; As for the indifferencie of the things commanded, the ſame hath already bene handled in an other place; but touching the laſt part of your exception, that the vſe of theſe things is not commanded, to the end, that men ſhould be grieved, offended, fall, ſtumble, ſinne, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them ſelves; we reiect this, as an impertinent &amp; inſufficient anſwere to our demand; for our demand tendeth not to inſinuate, that we think, that theſe things be commanded to the end, that every man by the vſe of them, ſhould ſinne, but our demand concerneth the vncharitable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, of the vſe of theſe things impoſed vpon a weake brother, which weake brother, by the vſe of theſe things (notwithſtanding the commandement) can not but full, but ſtumble, but give an offence, but ſinne. What? becauſe of the commandement? No: but by reaſon of his weaknes, which the commandement hath not power to ridd, and take from him. And therefore vnles your Lordſhips by ſome learning taught you in holy Writt, can informe your ſelves, &amp; our Chriſtian Magiſtrate, that your Synode in the Apoſtles abſence, is placed in the Apoſtolike chaire, and being ſo placed, hath alſo received by the Apoſtles doctrine, an Apoſtolike authoritie, to commande thoſe thinges in his abſence, which he expreſly forbade in his preſence, wee doubt greatly whether your convocationall aſſembly, can charitably by Gods Law command the weake in faith, to eate meate ſacrificed vnto Idols, and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to weare a Surplice, a Cope, a ſquare Cap, a ſhaven Crowne, a Fryers Coule, or a Monckes Hood, yea or no?</p>
            <p>Nay, ſithence the Apoſtle hath directly, and in plaine termes forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10 28.</note> the ſtrong in faith, the eating of meate ſacrificed vnto Idolls; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of him that ſhewed it, and for the conſcience, not of thine, but of that other which ſayeth, this is ſacrificed vnto Idols; and if withall, hee
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:13051:30"/>
have taught, that it is evill, for a man to eate with offence: we demand, by what rule of holy Writt, your Lordſhips can aſſure the conſcience of our Chriſtian Magiſtrate, and the ſoules of your aſſembly in convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that his Highnes and they ſhall doe charitably, vprightly, and not ſinne, in the ſight of the Lord, in caſe by a commandement, ye impoſe a neceſſitie of eating meates, or vſing things of like indifferencie, vpon the weake, which the weake, by the Apoſtles doctrine have free libertie, nay rather which by the Apoſtles doctrine they be taught, ſo longe as they be weake, not to vſe.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if eating, drinking, appareling, croſſing or kneeling, doubting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; without faith, or with offence, be ſinnes againſt the ſoule &amp; defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſoule, we then pray your Ll. to deale plainly with vs, &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely to teach vs, whether it be an Apoſtolike charitie, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand the doing of a thing which can not be done, either by the weak in faith, but doubtingly; or by the ſtrong in faith without offence, giving an occaſion to fall, or putting a ſtumbling block before his brother?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But, Sirs, by your patience, the Christian Magiſtrate doeth not inioyne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Biſhops.</note> 
               <hi>neither doeth the Clergie in their convocation decree, that the Miniſters or people, ſhould weare a Surplice, make a Croſſe, or kneele doubtingly and without faith, only his commandement is, that they kneele, that they make a croſſe, and that they weare a Surplice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, by your Lordſhips favour, we demand, whether ſuch their doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Gentl.</note> &amp; ſuch their being without faith, can either be purged by any gliſter or be diſpenſed with, by any facultie of humane authoritie?</p>
            <p>Yea, and whether any humane diſpenſation, or purgative receipt, may be of ſuch validitie and operation, <hi>in foro conſcientiae,</hi> that it may exempt the patient, or the diſpencer <hi>in foro conſcientiae</hi> from ſinne, in caſe hee iudge his apparell, croſſings and kneelings, to be vncleane?</p>
            <p>For though the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, be perſwaded through the Lord<note place="margin">Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 14. 14</note> Ieſus, that there is nothing vncleane of it ſelfe, yet to him that iudgeth it vncleane, to him it is vncleane. And therefore albeit the chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate may not ſinne in his commandement, yet may neither Miniſter nor people, be without ſinne, in their obedience.</p>
            <p>For the conſcience only of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mander (be he never ſo Chriſtian) can not be any warrant for the conſcience of him that obeyeth doubtingly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But, Sirs, it is their folly, &amp; their wilfull peeviſhnes, that (having bene ſo</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bb.</note> 
               <hi>long a time inſtructed) they have no better profited, in the knowledg of their chriſtian libertie, &amp; of the cleanes of the things: (by my faith) if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinew
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:13051:31"/>
weake longe, it were not amiſſe to bring ſome of them to the ſtake.</hi> Oh! my Lords, <hi>bona verba quaeſumus,</hi> ſoft fire maketh ſweet malt, preach<note place="margin">Gentl.</note> faith we beſeech your Lordſhips, but ſwear not by your faith: For by your Lordſhips favour, if the Apoſtle (having aſwel by doctrine as by example taught the weak brethren, among the Romans and Corinthians, of their<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 1. Cor. 8.</note> Chriſtian libertie, did neither reprove them of peeviſhnes, wilfulnes, or folly, neither yet condemne their ignorance of Chriſtian libertie to be a ſinne againſt Chriſt, albeit the ſame their ignorance, conſiſted only about the vſe of meates, created for the benefit of mans life; wee deſire your Lordſhips to reſolve vs out of holy Writt, whether ignorance of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an libertie, in the weake of our time, which conſiſteth about the vſe of things dedicated to the ſervice of an Idoll, may be a ſinne againſt Chriſt, for not vſing the ſame, in the worſhip of the true God?</p>
            <p>Beſides, we demand, by what rule of holy wtitt your Lordſhips in theſe things may condemne an other mans ſervant, or iudge his errour of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian libertie in this caſe, to bee worthy of puniſhment? For ſeeing ye be not able to make him ſtand, whom God hath left weak, &amp; not inabled to ſtand: And ſeeing the Apoſtle did not preſcribe vnto the weake brethren of his time, any time for the amendement of their errour, of the not vſe of things indifferent, but did rather bind him ſelf &amp; all other, for all ages to come, by his example, never to eate fleſh, while the world ſtandeth, that he might not offend his brother, or cauſe him to fall, or to ſtumble: The Apoſtle, we ſay, having appointed no time, no not while the world ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth in this caſe, &amp; all others of the ſame nature, we demand, by what rule of holy Writt, your Lordſhips may limite a certaine time, as by the eight, tenth or twelfe moneth for the reformation of iudgment, in this but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed errour, of not vſing Popiſh apparell, croſſings and kneelings?</p>
            <p>Nay if by the decree &amp; canons of the Apoſtle, both Miniſters &amp; peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, be infranchiſed, to vſe, and not to vſe, theſe things freely &amp; frankly without lett; we then demand, by what rule of holy Writ, it may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for your Synode, by a provinciall ordinance and conſtitution, to change and to turne this their Chriſtian freedome and libertie, into a meere ſlaviſh ſervitude and neceſſitie? And therefore we proteſt from your Synod, and avow, that <hi>your Synode in this caſe, was not guided by the ſpirite of Christ,</hi> and that therevpon it followeth your decrees, (ſo many of them) as abate the edge of charitie, whetted vpon the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, by the Apoſtles rule, or bringing into bondage againe, ſervants<note place="margin">Cor. 10. 28.</note> manumiſſed by the authoritie of Chriſt, that the ſame your decrees
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:13051:31"/>
are both erroneous in them ſelves, and iniurious to the church of God.</p>
            <p>For vnleſſe the world have bene diſſolved ſince the Apoſtles tyme, and that the ſame world, ſtand not now, which ſtood then; or vnles the ſame be not charitie now, and the ſame freedome now, which the Apoſtle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for charitie, and left for freedome: or vnles you would have vs, winke with our eyes, leaſt we ſhould ſee, and ſtoppe our eares, leaſt wee ſhould heare, and harden our heartes leaſt we ſhould vnderſtand, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently have no faith, except it be <hi>a Synodall, a Provinciall, or a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbury-church faith:</hi> we muſt needes ſpeake both what wee have ſeene, what we have heard, and what we have vnderſtood, out of holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; Namely that <hi>ſome of your Synodall decrees be oppoſite &amp; repugnant to the Apostles both chriſtian charitie and christian libertie.</hi>
            </p>

But to the poyntes. And firſt, becauſe (as earſt hath bene ſaid) it was the decree, and ſupplication of your Synod that begate this commandement, and not this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that travayled, and brought your Synodall decree and ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the birth: touching which your Synodall decree, for the vſe of theſe ornaments, rites &amp; ceremonies, by the weak, what els is there to be added, then that we deny againe, what in effect, more then once, &amp; twice, we have in this behalfe denied before: namely granting theſe thinges in their owne nature to be indifferent, and that they may be vſed in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, by them that be ſtrong in faith, &amp; have knowledge of their indifferencie: nevertheleſſe we deny that by any Decree of the Church, they may be appointed to be vſed, by the weake, and them that have no knowledge of their indifferencie: For this we have learned of the nature of things indifferent, if the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience be ſtrong, that the things be good; if the conſcience be weake, that they bee evill: not in regarde of their owne nature, but in regarde of the conſcience of him that iudgeth them to be evill.</p>
            <p>For as it is not meate it ſelfe, but the vſe of meate, wherevnto the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle would have men ſticke, ſo is it not apparell, a Croſſe, or a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, wherevpon the ſervantes of Chriſt are to caſt their eyes, that they may not be reprehended, by their conſciences rightly guyded, for the vſe of that thing which they vſe; And how ſhould a conſcience bee rightly guyded in the thing which he vſeth, vnles he have grounde out of Gods worde for the thinge which he vſeth? But he hath (you will ſay) a commaundement of God, to obey the higher powers, in the vſe of thinges indifferent. This is true in deed (ſaye we) if they (having for the guyde of their conſciences, the holy worde of God) ſhall iudge the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:13051:32"/>
thinges, and the vſe of the things, for the ſervice wherevnto they bee commaunded, to be indifferent; but they being not fully perſwaded in their myndes, both of the indifferencie of the thinges, and of the vſe of the things, in that ſervice wherevnto they bee commaunded, how can your Lordſhips proove, that in this caſe the Church may decree, and the Magiſtrate command them to do an act, in the doing whereof, they ſhall commit ſinne, yea and which they can by no meanes avoyde, if in doing the thing commanded, they ſtand in doubt. For he that doubteth is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,<note place="margin">Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 14. 23</note> in that he doth, becauſe he doeth it not of faith. And what ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is not of faith, is ſinne.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, becauſe no canon, nor decree of the Church, can cleanſe a mans conſcience of the weaknes of faith, or poure ſtrength into the ſame that he ſinne not; we affirme, that every decree, and canon of your Synod, which giveth an occaſion of offence, and emboldeneth the weak in faith to ſinne, by the vſe of theſe rites and ceremonies, in the worſhip of God, is a Canon and is a Decree conteyninge matter in the ſubſtance of it, contrary and repugnant to the doctrine of the Apoſtle: And that therefore it is no ſinne, for any brother weake in fayth, not to obey the ſame, though at the requeſt of your Synod, it hath pleaſed our Chriſtian Magiſtrate to inioyne him therevnto: becauſe the ground-worke of your Decree being ſandy, the buylding of the Magiſtrate, can not ſurely and firmely ſtande: This your Lordſhips argument therefore of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vſe of indifferent things, by commandement of the chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, for orders ſake, is but a begging of the point in queſtion: For wee hold, that no church, nor chriſtian Magiſtrate, can decree or impoſe any rites and ceremonies (being relickes, monuments, or memorialls of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie) to be vſed, no not for orders ſake, in the worſhip of the true God; becauſe the vſe of all relickes, monumentes, and memorialles of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, in divine worſhip, is not a thing, not only not indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but a thing in all reſpectes, meerely and abſolutely vnlawfull.

            <p>The Atheiſtes, as they neither embrace the doctrine, nor reverence the perſon of the Miniſter of Chriſt, much leſſe doe they regard from whence miniſteriall apparell originally came. Only if they live vnder an ordinary, who glorieth to be a ceremonie maſter, they can then find witt, and opportunitie, and agilitie, and nimblenes ynough, to make vſe of theſe ceremonies, as by them to worke miſchief againſt their Godly Miniſter, if at any time them ſelves be reproved for their drunkennes, whoredome, vſurie, ſwearing, poperie and ſuch like: But if any of them<note place="margin">Biſhop Horne.</note> being of the age of 60. 70. or 80. yeares, ſhalbe willed by their honeſt ordinarie, to returne home, and to learne of their Miniſter the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme, before they proſecute their preſentment, for the not wearing of a Surplice in this caſe, rather then they wilbe religiouſly taught the principles of godlines, at their Miniſters hand, they force not for xxv. yeares ſpace together, to bee wholy ſilent: Liking in the meane while the not wearing of a Surplice well ynough. And as for our partes, and others of the Religion, we doubt very much whether your Lordſhips be able to prove, that the Surplice, the croſſe in Baptiſme, or kneeling in the act of receiving the Communion, were by their firſt originall of any integritie, for an orderly or comely vſe of outward divine ſervice or worſhip, as now they be vſed, yea or no; For though now they bee vrged as decent and comely ſignes and ornaments, to the forme of Gods worſhip; yet if at the beginning they were not for this end and purpoſe, drawne directly or by conſequence, from ſome expreſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, but were meerely the deviſes &amp; inventions of men: then can we not aſſure our ſelves, that they be reſtored, to their ancient integritie. For how ſhould their originall bee of ancient integritie, when they had beginning, not from the will of God, but from the witt of man? not from the Well of life, but from the pitt of death? when they<note place="margin">Deut. 31. 28</note> were not pure, but corrupt, &amp; therefore without integritie? For which cauſe we are to beware leaſt we be taken in a ſnare by them, provoking the Lord to anger through the workes of our owne hands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:13051:34"/>And howſoever theſe ceremonies be taken from men, better affected to the Goſpell, then be the Papiſtes: nevertheleſſe ſeeing ſervants (be they never ſo young) are not to be guided by their fellow ſervants (be they never ſo old) without knowledge of their Lord &amp; Maſters pleaſure, firſt declared vnto them by his Prophets or Apoſtles, we pray your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips to prove vnto vs, out of holy Writt, that theſe ceremonies hold their originall from God.</p>
            <p>For, if they be not according to the old way, which is the good way,<note place="margin">Ierem. 16</note> and wherein we are bidd to ſtand, and to behold, and to aske after it, namely, the Teſtimonie which is bound vp, and the Law which is ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led<note place="margin">Iſai. 8. 16</note> vp among Gods Diſciples, then ſhall the Paſtours offend for run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning<note place="margin">Iere. 2. 8. 36</note> about ſo much, to change their wayes, going after things that doe not profit; yea (if they doe not according to this word) they may iuſtly<note place="margin">Iſa. 16. 20</note> be reproved, becauſe their is no light in them.</p>
            <p>The ancienty then of your ceremonies, let the ſame be as ancient as poſſibly ye can deviſe, yet in reſpect of the ancient of dayes, and of him that inhabiteth the eternitie, they ſhalbe but novelties, and the Author of them but a noveliſt. For as this ſaying in the Schoole of reaſon, is true, <hi>omne magnum tum est paruum, cum ſit aliquid maius;</hi> ſo is this ſaying alſo in the ſame Schoole true, <hi>omne vetus tum est novum, cum ſit aliquid vetustius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea and the holy Scriptures teach vs, to call thoſe things new, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever man inventeth, be the errour never ſo old. They have (ſaith the holy Ghoſt) offered vnto Devills, not vnto God, but to gods whom they<note place="margin">Deu. 32. 17</note> knew not: new gods, that came newly vp, whom their Fathers feared not; And in an other place, they are pronounced to be accurſed when<note place="margin">Deut. 27. 5.</note> they turne after other gods, which they have not known, whereby alſo is reproved the vanitie and fondnes of thoſe men, which leave that which is certeine, to follow that which is vncerteine.</p>
            <p>If the Apoſtle then, the firſt and moſt ancient father of all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren whom he begate with the word of the Goſpell, and the planter of all the Churches among the Gentils, never knew thoſe or any the like rites, ornaments, or ceremonies, much leſſe never knew them to be for any decent and orderly forme of Gods worſhip, in any of the churches which he begate, and which he planted; it muſt needes follow (as wee conceave) that the children of the Church, (who deviſed and appointed theſe rites and ceremonies, for an orderly and decent forme of Gods worſhip, in the ages ſucceeding the Apoſtles) left the ancient integritie
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:13051:34"/>
together with the certaine and ſingle forme of Gods worſhip, ſetled in the Apoſtolicall churches, without any miniſteriall apparrell, croſſings or kneelings in the act of receiving the communion: And ſo following their owne hearts, became Noveliſtes vnto the Apoſtles, in theſe vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine and new found ceremonies.</p>
            <p>Neither for the poynt in queſtion is it materiall, whether they were children, next and immediatly ſucceeding the Apoſtles, yea or no: For ſo ſoone as they declined from that integritie, &amp; ſimple maner of Gods<note place="margin">Deut. 9. 12.</note> worſhip, and from that certeyntie, wherein the Apoſtle left the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, even ſo ſoone was their vncerteyne and newly ſtart vp forme of Gods worſhip corrupt and impure: For when the Lord hath once ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken<note place="margin">Deut. 5. 22.</note> wordes, and doeth add no more, thereby we are taught, by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to lay our handes vpon our mouthes, to bee content with his word, and to add nothing of our owne. Yea and we bee warned to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware,<note place="margin">Deu. 11. 16</note> leaſt our heartes deceyve vs, and leaſt we turne aſide by deviſinge fooliſh inventions, according to our owne fantaſies.</p>
            <p>Wherefore your Lordſhips argument, of ſuch ancientie, and of ſuch integritie of theſe ceremonies, as declineth from that ancient, and in al poyntes and qualities certeyne and vpright forme of Gods worſhippe practiſed without Copes, Surplices, Croſſes, and kneelings in the acte of receyving the communion, by the Apoſtle in all the Churches plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his Miniſterie, argueth rather corruption and noveltie, then ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any ancientie or integritie.</p>
            <p>And therefore we pray your Lordſhips, that hereafter you would be adviſed by vs, not to licenſe your Scribes and prolocutors, to caſt an imputation of Noveltie vpon the Miniſters of Chriſt: or to vpbrayde them with that odious and reprochfull name of Noveliſtes: leaſt for their ſafegard, and iuſt defence in this behalfe, they be conſtreyned to pray for remedy, protection, &amp; ayde from our Sovereigne Lord King Iames: That by a writ of errour, out of the Recordes of the High Court of Parliament, to be graunted vnto them, they may procure the rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and adnihilating of your worthie orators, their vniuſt and Nove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous accuſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: For vnleſſe it ſhould ſeeme a ſmall matter, in your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips ſight, to vpbrayd our Sovereigne Lord the King, his Nobles and Commons of both Realmes, with a blemiſh of being Noveliſtes, and to be complotters of Novelties, for that his Highnes, and they, by al good counſelles, endevour, that the Engliſh, and Scottiſh nations, ſhould bee vnited into one people, and be reſtored to their firſt and ancient name
