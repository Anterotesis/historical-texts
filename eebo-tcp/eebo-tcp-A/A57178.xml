            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe generality of ingenious Philosophers, within whose industrious capacities Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion sitteth triumphant, do in the sympathie of their resolutions confesse, that there is no Love comparable to that which is built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rock of Vertue; divine experience doth by (sacred) examples daily demonstrate us, that desires which exceed the limits of Honour, ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> alwayes in the prime of their hopes meritorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly crost by some prejudicial misfortune: whereas on the contrary, Love grounded upon a sacred de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, doth not only most flourishingly live in fortunate prosperity, but likewise dieth in most blisful assured felicity: God at all times hateth a disloyal heart, and with the events of contentation coronizeth that Love whose effects tend to unfained fidelity. The rage of Loves passions are great, and so great, that in a manner all esteeme <hi>Venus</hi> powerful; for first she (as mother) predestinateth, and then <hi>Cupid</hi> (as her obedient son) striketh whom she com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. By Nature all men are made of one essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial substance, yet being produc'd under divers Planets, Love with her intricate authority doth
<pb facs="tcp:57367:5"/>
more torment some then others; for beauty hath such power, and her power such vertue, that (in a manner) all Mortals are some times scorcht with the ardent flames of her tirannical recognisance; as well Potentates, as Impotents, fight under the banner of Beauty; and <hi>Cupid,</hi> the <hi>Paphian</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, being blind, as soone strikes Robes as Rags; Art can never displace the impression which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath imprinted, nor Dignities ever avoid that which Divinity setteth down for a period. All men are subject to Love; therefore no marvel if Love so seize the top of Princes conceits, that they build their external felicity upon enjoying their Mistris favour; and lay their (sacred sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed) foundation of hope, in being inrolled a servant upon the memorial of their Saints con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations: Youthful fancies very often run at randome; yet being once in the field of love, vanquished by the prospect of some excelling beauty, they so render themselves captives to the (Circes) inchantments of partial complexions, that they will not onely ingage their constancy for the obtaining of their hearts desire; but also pawn their lives, yea fidelities, for the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing of their breasts contentation; as by the sequel of this ensuing History shall most mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly appeare.</p>

speedily depart my Castle, for this your first of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence give you an absolute pardon. I have here wholly betaken my self to sorrowfulnesse, and have long since devoted my zeal to the shrine of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consolation, my desire is neither to see nor be seen, but rather to lead the Pilgrimage of my life from the sight of any: This solitary place I have elected for my Purgatory; And here, unlesse death prevent my premeditations I resolve to abide the return of a most dear Friend of mine, which inconstant Fortune this fourty Moneths hath detained from me. I in heart hate the sight of any, and for his sake loath the prospect of all. Therefore at the request of a sorrowful Lady, (or if ever a tormented Damsel, may gain acceptance at the Bar of your Discretion) I beseech you delay not to depart, that according to my accustomed manner I may sincerely upon the Altar of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, devoutly sacrifice my affectionate sighes; In token, that till death in the Garden of my Maiden Amity, the resemblance of his self, and <hi>Idea</hi> of his perfections, shall (to my everlasting comfort and souls contentation) immortally flourish.</q>
            <p>The Princes having very lowly saluted this lovely Lady, and with attentive ears listned to the effect of her speeches, They both began or at least <hi>Thalmeno</hi> for both, instantly to frame her this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne reply.</p>
            <q>RIght vertuous Lady! (for so your inward qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and exterior perfections demonstrate you

to be) if our sudden arrivall hath prejudiced your sorrowful devotions, or detained you from execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting some service due to your Friend; by so much the more we are thereof exceedingly discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented. But since the purity of our pretence may plead for the excuse of our audacity, and the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of our resolutions crave remission for our boldnesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we doubt not, but having heard the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of proceedings, you will in equity afford us a benigne pardon: For know fair Lady, that we are both Princes; the one heir apparant to the Crown of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the other to the Diadem of <hi>Cicilia</hi>; Our Names <hi>Palma</hi> and <hi>Thalmeno:</hi> who in the prime of our bloomy minority, before the consideration of future fortune was established in the Zenith of our capacities, we resolved to travel, and so secretly imbarquing our selves (without taking leave of our Parents) we of late arrived in the next brdering Harbour; since which time, as (faithlesse) Fortune would, (E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rour being our guide) we strayed into aan unknown Desart, where these three dayes we have most dangerously travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, without finding sustenance to relieve our hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry stomacks; So that at last ranging these soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Forrests, we fortunately arrived to the view of this your Castle: Our pretence, fair Lady, is not to incur your indignation, but onely to entreat you to relieve us with some benigne demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of courtesie; that in giving Nature her due, we may avoid the tyrannizing dint of Death, which most inhumanely doth now begin to domineer over us: which if you effect, as vertuous reason cannot

well deny we shall continually remain servants both to your Bounty and Beauty; and till the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of death, hold the term of our lives as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain re-bought by your Majesticall Merits, and likewise depart when it shall please you to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us.</q>
            <p>The Lady pondering upon these pitiful speeches, very soon in her breast conceived a motion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentation, which flaming in the embers of her zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous imaginations, very secretly commanded her to entertain them with all agreeable curiosity: so that taking them kindly by the hand, she most debonair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conducted them to a very sumptuous Dining-chamber, where causing her waiting Virgins to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, and furnish the Table with such store of rich poverty as her solitary Cell could afford, They very orderly without the vanity of prolixious ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies fell hungerly to their meat; till repast being done, the Princes satisfied, and the Tables taken up, <hi>Thalmeno</hi> still burning with desire to know the effectuall cause of this Ladies desolate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, evpaporating bashfulnesse, and arming his capacity with courage, he very boldly (yet with a Princely grace) continued his familiar Oration as followeth:
<q>MOst beautiful Damsellif the repetition of your misfortunes renew not your grief, or the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>splay of your sorrows increase not your discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations, I would (if I might crave so much grace at your Lilly hands) entreat you to relate why

so sadly you make this Desart your domestical Mansion. And the occasion why so often with vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of sighes you repeat the name of <hi>Maedor.</hi> Me thinks your Beautifull face, Slender personage, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestical comportment, and vertuous perfections, should rather befit a Monarchs Court than a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Countrey, and a Princes bed than a Pilgrims Cottage. But whether wade I so far, since by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience I am taught to see, that all are subject to fate, and none exempt from adversity? for assoon the Prince as the Peasant, the Madame as the Milk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, are (or at least may be) crost with the dart of <hi>Cupid,</hi> the sting of sorrow, or the Tyranny of misfortune; Therefore fair Lady, if any of these distastful accidents have befaln you, with the (So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign) salve of patience so mollifie your passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and raze out your sorrows, that the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of aggravation may not overtop the blossoms of your flourishing Juvenility, and so Tragically bring your beautiful self to the (untimely) enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a desperate Martyrdome.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Lady perceiving Prince <hi>Thalmeno</hi> had now ended his speech; For answer thereunto replyed him as followeth.</p>
            <q>KNow, vertuous Prince, that I have long since loved a Noble Cavalier, the absence of whom hath willingly constrained me to live thus solitarily. Name him I will not, because the motive thereof will refresh the birth of my accustomed dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consolation: yet in respect you shall not condemn

me of perverse ingrateful coynesse, I will (if you please to attend my arrival) bye me to my Closet, and there constrain my trembling Pen to indite the secrets of his Mistris sorrows, and in effect to discover the sole History of my as yet tragical misfortunes.</q>

            <p>But by that time a future hour was spent, and swiftly constrained to follow his forepast prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors; Lo, immediately the Lady descended the stairs, and so presenting her self to their views, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered them this short speech following.</p>
            <q>MOst renowned Princes!

in such sort, that to be plain I could not esteem of any with whom I was contented to finish the limits of this my terrestriall pilgrimage: by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue whereof, I some two years remained without either fixing mine eyes upon the influence of Love, or ever devoting my breast to the shrine of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But at last <hi>Cupid</hi> storming at my Liberty, and <hi>Venus</hi> her self at my single estate, (acknowledging that there was no life but Love, nor no paradise but the pleasures of Marriage) they so bent their invective ambition against my innocency; that at last by the means of <hi>Fortune,</hi> which had likewise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded her self in the union of their sympathy, they unexpectedly to my Fathers Court sent a sweet young Prince named <hi>Maedor,</hi> being son and heire to <hi>Orlando</hi> King of <hi>Biafara</hi>; which Prince being pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated with the report of my Personage, came of purpose to <hi>Numidia</hi> to protest him my Servant: Upon the soyl of whose beautifull Complexion I no sooner settled the influence of my Regards, but I immediately felt the flames of fancy sparckle within the concavity of my tormented breast. On the other side, Prince <hi>Maedor</hi> so often frequented my company, that at last (if his Protestations were unfained) he reposed his blisse in my Beauty, and reaped his chiefest pleasure in enjoying my (desired) presence: So that tract of time did (by reason of many amourous Glances) so firmly unite our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections with the twist of combined Ratification, that in few dayes I became mistris of his thoughts, and he master of my imaginations. But now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spightfull Destiny resolving to metamorphose our

The interiour lineaments owed nothing in correspondence to the outward Edifice; for the Portals and Galleries were of snow-white Ivory, the Bedsteds of clarent Amber, the Coverlids and Curtains of green Damask imbossed with Emeralds and Chrysolites, and the Tapestry of Crimson-Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet imbrodered with Amethysts and Pearle. In the spacious Courts and delicious Bowers (which <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> had adorned with the Treasure of her painted Drapery) were likewise many curious (conceited)
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57367:16"/>
fountains, some thither conveyed by the instinct of Nature, and othersome they erected by the Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Art) There might you have seen <hi>Diana</hi> errais'd aloft upon a sumptuous Pillar, with a Bow in one hand, and a Banner (wherein was charactered <hi>Chastity</hi>) in the other, from whose Alabaster Paps the water sweetly distilling, was by her Nymphs in Chrystall Vases received, and so artificially convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Fountains centre; and also another, where <hi>Pallas, Minerva</hi> and <hi>Iuno,</hi> do from their breasts rain Veines of water upon the beautiful faces of <hi>Daphne</hi> and <hi>Phylomela</hi>; the which entring their coral lips, doth distill to the concavity of their Chrystaline Paps; from whence with a stern coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, they furiously sprout it in the eys of inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <hi>Iupiter</hi> and lustful <hi>Tereus</hi>; also upon the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of these fountains are growing many fruitful Fig-tres, whereon artificially range divers harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Birds, whose heavenly musick according with the waters murmure, doth yield forth many ravishing Tunes of Angelical melody: so that there wanted no bravery to make this sumptuous Palace a terrestrial Paradice; It was impaled with lofty Woods, fenced Draw-bridges, and impregnable Bulwarks, as also circumferenced with a dainty River, within whose Tempee Gleam many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istrine Swans most pleasantly imbathed themselves. So that our two Princes with their Nymph, being arrived to this dignified Palace, were forthwith met by an ancient Damsel, who seeming to be thereof Lady, very kindly bad them welcome: her habit was of a Sable hue, having her snowy haire

dangling down her withered face; her beauty seem'd to be nipt by age; yet in the lineaments of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion lay furrowed the anatomy of an indifferent Countenance: the arches of her sorrowful eyes were overvail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which desolate Lady, after having had some conference with these our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Princes, and perceiving how the zeal of their youthful resolutions were devoted to travel, she with a faint voice delivered them these speeches:
<q>COurteous Friends, (for such I wish you to be) fear not to enter this Palace, but advance with applause! for your eyes shall be presented with such delectable objects, as shall both please your thoughts, and solace your contemplations.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Whereat she abruptly brake off, and so as fast as the Postilions of <hi>Aeolus,</hi> fled to the Forrests.

by the Ladies were conducted to a sumptuous Bed-chamber, where divers flourishing Knights were unchastely Courting of their beauteous Paragons, yea and with such unseemly dallyance, that <hi>Vesta</hi> nay <hi>Venus</hi> her self could scarce refrain from blush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at their immoderate familiarity; in such sort, that being glutted with the variety of divers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaste prospects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (which to repeat would but vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly replenish the Readers capacity with prejudicial contemplations) they were at last by many radiant Tapers alighted to their chambers: where to passe away the tediousnesse of the night, two lascivious Ladies were proffered to bear them company: But our young Princes (albeit ardently tempted with carnal inchantments) having th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Our Princes seeing this pretty pigmy, and with advised deliberation pondering upon the Etimoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of his speeches, could not at first refrain from infusing their contemplations within the Cabinet of astonishment; but at last more seriously rumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting which way to elect for their security, they both resolved to follow the tender guide; thereby to free themselves from the peril of this ensuing stratagem; upon which resolution, arming their courage with magnanimity, they as having <hi>Pegastan</hi> wings flew through the Courts, directing their pace to a lofty mountain, from whence they espied this glorious Palace, to be suddenly swoln up in the earths con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavity, and in such admired sort, that no appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of foundation remained, but was utterly raz'd out as if the essence thereof had never there erected his (once) substantial situation.

(prospective) accident our Princes could not at first believe, but instantly thereupon surmised that their eyes and imaginations had been deluded with invasions: the Dwarf perceiving their doubtful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities, ran exactly from them; when to comfort their passions, the old forlorn Lady which they first met, again presented her self to their viewes, and so after having lowly saluted them, very mournfully uttered these speeches.</p>
            <q>MY sonnes (quoth she) my name is <hi>Vertue,</hi> who of my own authority have invented this Tragedy for your advantage.

of Piety. And to the end that, being absent, you may still ponder and premeditate upon my Exhortations, here take this Paper and observe such Divine counsel as I have therein prescribed for your salvations.</q>
            <p>Which having said, she in the twinkling of an eye elevated her self in the air, and so a brumy cloud orevailing her in the cincture of his imbracements she immediately vanished.</p>

               <hi>Thalmeno</hi> and <hi>Parma,</hi> perceiving that <hi>Delmon</hi> had
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57367:24"/>
finished his speech, being partly in conceit ravished with the report of fo flourishing a Kingdom, giving him thanks for their benign entertainment, as also for his debonair vertuous exhortations, very joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully departed: where travelling a long time these unknown Countries, they at last very fortunately arrived to the chiefest City of <hi>Zanfara,</hi> where the Court then was; And taking up the Lodge in the best Inne which the City did afford, they there some three dayes rested, to refresh themselves of their forepast (troublesome) travels: And after having (as was requisite) given almighty <hi>Iove</hi> most humble thanks for their safe arrival, they betook themselves to this private parley, where <hi>Thalmeno</hi> began as followeth.</p>
            <q>MOst dear Cousin! We are now in a Kingdom far from our Native country; and therefore with celerity it behoveth us to settle our proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon the main of some resolution, to the end we may futurely avoid the receipt of ensuing mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. Therefore, understanding that the King exceedingly delighteth in heroical Vertues, it were not in my opinion unfit to betake our selves under the umbrage of his service, where cherishing our va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous magnanimity, we may produce the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations of dignified Princely atchievements, whose effectual apparitions in the eyes of all spectators may condignly purchase us the title of gallant (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired) admiration.</q>
            <p>Prince <hi>Palma</hi> hearing <hi>Thalmeno</hi> utter this haughty resolution, very instantly returned him this reply:
<q>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:57367:25"/>MOst affectionate Cousin, I allow right well of your conclusitive determination: therefore, delayes set apart, let us proffer our selves to the Kings service. This day, I understand, he resolveth to hunt in a Forrest neer-adjoyning the Court; where, if you please, we may present him with a submissive supplication, thereby to intrude our selves within his Princely service; but let our names be obscured under the cloud of secrecy; So that <hi>Thalmeno</hi> may be termed <hi>Thalmo,</hi> and I <hi>Palma</hi> named <hi>Plivio,</hi> justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our selves to be both Knights of <hi>Arabia.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This pleasant invention was well liked of <hi>Thal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meno</hi>; And so solacing their cerebrosity, they forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with indited this supplication, which by a young Knight (a fri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So imploring your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty to admit us into your service, and to grace us with that stellified Title to be invested your Servants, We in all humilitie prostrating our lives to your (gracious) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, Rest,</p>

And therein to conclude, because peradventure the discreet Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may think the time too tedious in describing their proceedings, let this as a brief annotation suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: That their valorous actions, vertuous demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, gallant comportment, heroical courtesie, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57367:26"/>
Princely grace, did so conquer the capacity not only of the King, but the Commons; that in a manner all the Island of <hi>Cicilia</hi> esteemed them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the prize of Olympian victory, I mean the Trophees of Laurel dignified honour: Which by often demonstrations of their interior audacity did so instigate the King with the meritorious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of preferring them, that not long after their arrivals, he appointed <hi>Thalmeno</hi> to be Attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant on the Princesse <hi>Athelia</hi> his daughter; and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd <hi>Plivio</hi> to be Lieutenant of <hi>Ithica</hi>-castle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the fair Princesse <hi>Mersilva</hi> daughter unto <hi>Samor</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> was retained prisoner.</p>
            <p>But leaving them, I mean the aforenominated <hi>Plivio</hi> and <hi>Mersilva,</hi> to the protection of fortune, we will for a whiles entreat of <hi>Thalmo</hi> and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse <hi>Athelia.</hi>

Therefore, <hi>Thalmo,</hi> since my minde may not be subject to the serviles of Love, let my commands in the closet of thy capacity be a media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix to make thee give a solemn <hi>conge</hi> to thy peevish (commenced) enterprise.</q>

How can I live without fixing mine eyes upon the Beauty of faire <hi>Florina</hi>? and losing her sight, how can I demeure upon this vain earth, without drowning my self in the brinish tears which distill from the Conduit of mine eyes?

            <p>
               <hi>Mersilva</hi> greatly astonished at his pretence, began exceedingly to weep, because the sequel thereof with sorrow toucht her to the quick; still sighing and raging, as if the Coffin of her breast would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately rent in sunder with imminent aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, alwaies calling on the goddesse <hi>Diana,</hi> whom sincerely she prayed to revenge her quarrel, and to shelter her from the rapine of this imodest Knight: but at last considering that silence was a shew of consent; disdaining ever to stain the purity of her fame with deformity, or the Noble discent from whence she was extract, with disgrace; making a muster of her angry Muses, in the valley of her cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brosities indignation, she very resolutely with an

            <q>INhumane Knight, since thou wilt not be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Reason, because reasonless, nor vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to permit me to depart in patience without ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishing mine honour with the spot of infamy; know, that rather then I will once consent to thy lascivious demand, or ever agree to thy lustful desire I will voluntarily be the administer of mine owne untimely martyrdom.</q>
            <p>And therewith unsheathing an inameled knife, which she had pending to her golden girdle, (as a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Lucretia</hi>) with a fatal stroke she resolved to destroy her self: but the divilish Knight suspecting some such accident, very soon wrestling the knife from her hand, prevented her purpose; the which having done (setting hold of the bridle) he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately alighted her from her horse, whereat being overcome with fear, she in a dangerous trance fell to the ground, where metamorphising her cherry taint to a <hi>Cynthian</hi> complexion, she there lay speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, as much trembling as an Infant-prisoner hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the sentence of death pronounced against him; the which to arouse, <hi>Blithion</hi> spake to her in this sort.</p>

               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:57367:66"/>Which having ended, <hi>Mersilva</hi> arising on her knees most sorrowfully (with fountaines of teares distilling down the soyls of her Vermillion cheeks) interrupted him in this manner:

But here again the doleful confluence of her disastrous tears imbathed her faltring tongue in the Acheron stream of silence, so that the courage of her exteriour audacitie not permitting her to depaint the Physnomy of her inward aggravations, she (overvailing the instinct of her eyes with the Curtaines of perplexity) lay for a while sencelesse, as if the valour of her conceits had been smothered up in the antipathy of discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations; when arousing her sorrowfull capacity with the contemplation of imminent fear, she sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly started up, and most inhumanely tore the sparkling tresses of her golden haire, wherewith dame Nature had most gloriously imbellished her; which tragical object, might (<hi>Blithion</hi> excepted) have made the most bloody inhumane <hi>Scythian</hi> to pitty her estate; nay, have caused the senselesse obdurate Rocks themselves to weepe, and sorrowfully to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When being on the point to make shipwrack of her Honesty, and to set her Maidenhood to sale, lo thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therward unexpected came <hi>Plivio</hi> galloping amain; the wich <hi>Mersilva</hi> (to her Nectar-comfort) espy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to him very loudly cryed out in this sort: Ah <hi>Plivio!</hi> as thou tenderest my Love, and desirest mine Honour, assist thy distressed <hi>Mersilva,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the devilish pretence of this unmerciful Tigre with the merited guerdon of condigne punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plivio</hi> perceiving it to be his sweet <hi>Mersilva,</hi> instantly (as being inflamed with revenge) made his Courser more swiftly advance then the Jennets of <hi>Iupiter:</hi> when leaping from his horse, he with his Rapier drawn approaching his thrice mortal Enemy, very furiously uttered these words: Ah wretched Villain! make ready thy sword; for if there were no more men living, thou immediately dyest.

Which when the Queen, together with her daugher <hi>Athelia</hi> and the rest of the Ladies understood, they all praising the Almighty, gave likewise incessant thanks to <hi>Plivio</hi> for his undanted magnanimity; and exceedingly rejoyced in that the Princesse <hi>Mersilva</hi> was so fortunately preserved: when rising, they left the Forrest, and instantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned

               <hi>Why</hi> Plivio, <hi>you erre from your matter; for Wives and Husbands are not incident to our Theames. Plivio</hi> seeing her merrily disposed, framed her this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing answer:</p>

<q>AH faire <hi>Mersilva!</hi> It is your (alone) cruelty which hath engendred my sorrows; and only your coynesse which hath caused my aggravation: For since your departure, I have here remained in such discontented sort, as, if you triumph not of my misery, you would condignly pitty my malady.

Gate, betwixt twelve and one) they would attend the thrice happy arrivals of their sweet Saints; which warning, though short, yet seemed so sweet to their Ladies imaginations, that (applause building trophies of content in their trembling resolutions) they very pleasantly deluded the time in familiar dalliance; till at last, the hour (as they thought) being come, and their Princes ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, metamorphosing their mirth to melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, and their joy to discontent, they began to blame them for to much (unmerited) constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; sometimes condemning them of ingratitude, and then again instantly with a sigh recalling their speeches, fearing lest the influence thereof might by some uncustomed accident be transpor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

dying their milk-white cheeks with a vermilion blush, they in their night-apparel descended; the glimpse of whose glorious appearance our two young Princes no sooner espied, but advancing their pace with exquisite delectation, they went and saluted them, where so joyfull a meeting of divine sympathy was betwixt them demonstrated, that forgetting their senses, and almost themselves, I thought they would for that night have made their amorous demeure upon the Lily incarnate soile of their coralline lips; no words could they utter, becaus their tongues were (by love) devoted to silence, and such as past, were clamorous volleys of sorrowfull sighes, which redoubling each on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, strove which should first unite each others heart with the sympathy of superabundant affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But in fine, yea, and in the twinckling of an eye they heard in the palace a fierce and terrible noise, as if in a manner the whole Court had been in a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious uproare, which repleating their senses with fear, and replenishing their conceit with timerosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, drave them all into a very effeminate humor of exact dispair; in such sort, that they knew not how to save themselves, nor where to convey their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestical Ladies from the gurmandizing jaws of ruth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful distresse; till at last, <hi>Thalmeno</hi> knowing their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state fickle, and perceiving it now stood upon him desperatly to cast at all, (I mean either to lose his own life, or his dear <hi>Athelia,</hi> which he esteemed far more pretious) refetching the courage of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted magnanimity from the confines of feare, and arming the interior lincaments of his valorous

So that when the limits of night was expired, and that the dawn drew near, Aurora in her silver ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel no sooner began to look through the Case<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of heaven, but our masters and Princes so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the matter, that their flags and streamers were abroad playing with the wind, their Ordnance and Muskets arang'd and laden, their waste-cloaths unloosed, their Nettings laced up, their Yards sling'd, their Companies divided, their Linstocks lighted, the Master upon the poop with his silver Sword to whease them to the Lee-ward, and the Trumpets ready at a beck to sound the first onset: On the contrary part, the Gally dighted her self in the pride of her warlike jollity, and with a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous resolution came towards them, making such terrible clamors and out-cries, as if they meant to affight <hi>Iupiter</hi> himself in the cittadel of his impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnable monarchie: when instantly, the wind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining to fresh, our Master by the condesent of the three Princes edged very neare; and so being come within Cannon shot, brought themselves by their short sails, resolving to attend her comming, and with honour to fight it out; the which the Galley-Slaves

            <p>But again to our Combatants; who eagerly seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, did so valorously behave themselves, that it was impossible yet to judge, which side Fortune did most favour. But to conclude: as time gives a full period to all terrestrical accidents; when the fatall day was almost finished, wherein many had their lives catostrohies most famously signed with the signet of death, the Galley most dangerously (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween wind and water) received despairful shot, in such pittiful manner, that they all within-board made a pittiful cry: the which our Princes under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, instantly conceived some hope of victory; whereupon they afresh let fly their roaring Canon, whose fiery bullets wrapt in terrour, made such spacious breaches in the side of the Galley, that they seeing no apparition of hope whereon to rely amaining their saile, immediately yeelded, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring themselves to the mercy of their mortal ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: the which our Princes an company per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, for sudden joy shouted amain, triumphing in the conquest of so famous a Victory; when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly

they hoisted out their Shallop to avoid the prize: but now when she was replenished suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently with men and munition, if any repulse perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture should have been offered, our Princes were in a difficult difference which of themselves should therein go Commander. <hi>Thalmeno</hi> he willingly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered his service, and <hi>Palma</hi> he vowed not to stay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde; but princely <hi>Maedor,</hi> whose magnanimous, breast did likewise in harbour a <hi>Hectors</hi> courage, seeing his associates in contention, which should first be admitted, stept in and furiously protested that they should both stay with their Laides, and he only would go Master of the Ships: they likewise hearing of his voluntary resolution, allowed best of his reason, and so gave sentence he should. Whereupon with a noise of harmonical trumpets, away goes <hi>Maedor,</hi> and down goes <hi>Thalmeno</hi> and <hi>Palma</hi> to the Cabin. Their even now comfortlesse Ladies, being by the Herauld of report adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised of the victory, came reciprocally to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them with congratulation of their undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted magnanimities, where so joyfull a meeting was betwixt them demonstrated, that their conceits which right then swimmed in the Ocean of dispair, did now float upon the blisful waves of pleasant delectation; for their Cynthian complexions were metamorphosed to cherry countenances; and their mournfull eyes which were almost submerg'd with brinish teares, did now reflect their beams of splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent vivacity, as glorious <hi>Phaebe</hi> being free from the cloudy prison of sable obscurity, each joyfully joyed in each others presence; either reap'd more

then exquisite applause, and (in fine) all received such delectable contentation, that to be plain, my abrupt pen can no way display thereof the exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitenesse, because my peevish capacity was never acquainted with the labyrinth of the like amorous encounters.

a Commander, therefore kind Knight, in respect that with such heroical voluntariness you have afforded us our lives, Know that within this next adjoyning Cabine, there is resident a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lady, whom fortune hath predestinated to be our prisoner: Her parentage I know not; but if outward gestures may depaint inward qualities, I presume she is some Lady of noble decent; her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour (though in adversity) is such, that as she carrieth her perplexity with a modest countenance, so she disdaineth to render her self tributary to the infidelity of Fortune.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maedor</hi> no sooner understood this (unexpected) newes, but burning with desire to know what this Lady might be; very friendly commanded the Captain to bring him to her presence; where he was no sooner ariv'd, but he might perceive this doleful Lady as it were imbathing her self in the stream of her tears; having prostrated her person one the floore, and overvailed her Visage with an obscure skarf, lying as it were in a Cyatical Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargie, thinking that the first that entered was the Harbinger of death, or to be plain, the inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane administer of her untimely martyrdome: but lo, it fell out otherwise; for when she thought he was lodging his Rapier in the cytadel of her inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent breast, why even then he took seisure of her lily hand, and with an amiable voice uttered these speeches.</p>

               <hi>Arise fair Lady; for your life and liberty is granted you!</hi> Whereat very instantly, as being acquainted with the voice, she with a commendable grace start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up; and pereeiving (as indeed she thought) that it was her Princely <hi>Maedor</hi> which pronounc'd that melodious sentence; at the hearing thereof, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ravished with too many divine cogitations, in a dangerous swound she <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Thanks, courteous Prince, for your heroical benignity; &amp; more then fortunate am I, to be the essential subject of your dilectable contentation.</hi> But here Prince <hi>Palma</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting her speeches, went majestically, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise saluted her; where betwixt these three ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesticks of affection, such joyful plaudities of exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site amity was repeated, that <hi>Athelia</hi> and <hi>Mersilva,</hi> (of <hi>Florina</hi> unseen) sitting attentively in a corner admired what this unlookt for prospect betokened; for first investing the habilement of a jealous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, they thought this minion of beauty was of purpose come to frustrate their hopes of expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed contentation: but instantly poizing the fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to their Princes by their own affections, and their undaunted loves by their absolute likings, (repenting themselves for the conceit of such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited inconstancy) they both resolved in fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liare amity very kindly to salute them: but Prince <hi>Maedor</hi> standing aloof from their presence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecturing by the mutability of their countenances, that their imaginations were tosticated in the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of perplexitie, finding a lovely remorse in his affectionate breast, with a gallent (heroical) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution went and in this sort, saluted them:</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:57367:89"/>FAir Princesses, (and therefor fair, because em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellished by supreame deity) This beautious Nymph (if speaking without partiality) which here presents her selfe before the influence of your contemplation, is (only) the sweet substance of my (admired) <hi>Florina; Florina</hi> I say, whose exquisite pourtraict and dainty personage I adore as the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que goddesse of my capacities felicitie.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Athelia</hi> and <hi>Mersilva</hi> swallowing down the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brosian sweetnesse of these sugred speeches, and infusing in their cerebrosities the unlook't for event of this applausible accident, demonstrating by the plaudity of their smiling aspects, that their conceits were rak'd up in the imbers of delectation, with the sympathizing unity of one melodious voice returned him this harmonical answer:</p>
            <p>Nay then, Prince <hi>Maedor,</hi> we exquisitely rejoyce in that Celestiall deity hath Coroniz'd the trinary of our affections with the Garland of content; and much solace in that the fancies of our conceits are so blisfully confirmed by the fortunate arrival of your divine <hi>Florina</hi>! Whereupon Prince <hi>Maedor</hi> gratifying their courtesies with thanks, and their curiosities with affection, taking each by the Lily hand, determined to go and salute his Saint; but on the contrary part, Prince <hi>Thalmeno</hi> and <hi>Palma</hi> conceiving their determination, thought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their purpose, and so imbracing the Lady <hi>Florina</hi> in their armes, went reciprocally likewise to meet them, yea, and in such amorous sort, that
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57367:89"/>
each lovely Band advancing there pace, they at last, very affectionately approached one the other; where on both sides was demonstrated such super-ceremonious courtesie, that for instant joy me thought my Muse stood silent, as being ravished with pleasure in the labyrinth of delectable admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>To relate therefore the lovely-smiles, affectionate sighes, piercing countenances, and pleasant prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle which were banded and sent between this amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous army, were but a meritorious subject to make this my (abrupt) Pamphet swel into an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple story.

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:57367:90"/>
of report bruted amongst them, but instantly lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their amorous (yet chaste) dalliance, they very cheerefully (being desirous to repleat the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of their eyes with so wished for an object) most couragiously mounted the upper Deck, by which time the winde continually freshing, they were almost approching the shore: the prospect whereof so revived their sickly senses, that Prince <hi>Thalmeno</hi> at last seeing the Ship at an Anchor, very couragiously commanded the Boatsen to set them a-land.</p>
            <p>In which mean time the three Princesses hying to their cabinets, did so gorgeously dight themselves in the pride of their glistering jollity, that they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther resembled heavenly Nymphs, then humane Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragons, and Sacred Queens, then Terrestrial Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages: For their Angelical cheeks, which their golden hair delighted to sport withall; their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by fronts, within whose Alabaster circumference the Graces range in; their piercing eyes of power, to obscure the brightness of Olympus; and their Ivory paps, wherein their azured veins make their Nectar Ampythrite display such a delicate apparition of Paphian allurement, that I absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conjectured <hi>Ulysses</hi> would have stoopt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template on the soyle of their countenance; and <hi>Iupiter</hi> himself, at their delicate sight, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested their favourite, would have left fair <hi>Gany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede</hi> desolate upon the Downs of <hi>Ida.</hi> So now the blisful hour of their departure being come, arm in arm, like Saints of Felicity they rushed forth,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57367:90"/>
presenting themselves to their Princes; who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending their arrivall, received them with more then exquisite applause; where amongst them past so many millions of Amazon speeches, that the motives thereof, would have daunted the proudest enemie of (Angelicall) <hi>Cytherea</hi>: But in fine, they generally taking leave of the Company, (and the Shallop ready) in most exquisite Heroical manner they most gallently departed: At whose <hi>Ultimum vale,</hi> the Master gave such a thundering volley of Ordnance, that the rebounding Eccho thereof drave the Harbouring Cicilians into the affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humour of Timerositie; upon which unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Accident, presupposing that some Forreign Enemy was come to invade them, they in swarmes of Martiall Troops directed their course to the Sea-side; upon whose obdurate Sands with Drums couragiously sounding, and Ensignes sumptuously displayed, they very valorously attended their Landing. Our Princes perceiving this unexpected Warlike Assembly, began immediatly to doubt the issue of their Martialll determinations; so that grounding their resolutions upon the Rock of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and their imaginations upon the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark of Tranquility, they afar off comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a Banner of Truce to be demonstrated; and so evapourating feare from their courage, and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merosity from their Countenances, they very au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daciously drew near the shore; Which the Cici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians espying, being desirous to know of what Countery they were, and what this unaccustomed Alarme meant, in swarmes of Martial Troops
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57367:91"/>
with magnanimous resolutions, they advanced, to prevent their landing: But Prince <hi>Thalmeno</hi> with the rest of his amorous Associates, not passing for their flourishing bravadoes, commanded the Boatien to row them ashore; which no sooner was effected, but presenting their Ladies with many sugred kisses (for their <hi>Bien Venue</hi>) each con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting his own beautifull Saint, they very vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly marched forwards: The Cicilians conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to have fought some hot skirmish, being one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly instead thereof met by this weake company, drag'd their Ensignes with laughter in the dust, whereas heretofore they superbiously displayed them in the aire with doughtinesse. In fine, the chiefe Commanders of the Regiments, burning with desire to know what this Martial effeminate, Tragi-Coemedy meant, with couragious resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions advanced their spaces to parle with them: whom no sooner they approached, but first glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their aspects upon the beautifull countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Angelicall Ladies, they at last making an Apostrophe from their Beauties, settled their rights upon the bold Complexions of the admired Knights; so that their (Lynceus) eyes ranging cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspectly upon the valorous Physnomy of their Heroical visages, they at last very apparently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their Soveraigne young Prince <hi>Thalmeno</hi> to be there present: At which applausible (contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative) Object, having their hearts conquered with instant Trophies of many delectable Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, they casting aside their weapons, went and submissively prostrated themsemselves to his feet:

whlch Prince <hi>Thalmeno</hi> perceiving, after having gratified their loyall affectionate humility with thanks, commanded them to Troop up their Forces, and so to accompany him and his Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly associates to the Palace: Which radiant cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall newes was no sooner bruted in the Camp, but very sumptuously in Warlike array, the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches being strewed with Laurel boughs and Roses, they gallantly marched forwards; whereof the ancient King <hi>Druino</hi> being certainly advertised, (having his heart ravished with the applausible news of his Son <hi>Thalmeno's</hi> arrivall) instantly commanded three superbious rich Coaches to be sent towards them, to convey him with his Princely companions to the Court, which trampling coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Coursers, like the Steeds of <hi>Phaebus,</hi> made such speedy celerity, that in short time they drew neer the Suburbs of <hi>Mesana</hi>; which being the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital City of <hi>Cicilia,</hi> was so proudly dight in the pride of her warlike jolity, that the multitude of roaring Canons, and silk (<hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57367:95"/>
whose infamy, another <hi>Cicilian</hi> saluting the King, (fetching his cariere) galloped within the Lists; which, as the first, was by the <hi>Hungarian</hi> in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vanquished: The King astonished hereat, by his Page-royal sent the Conqueror a Present; and so extolling highly his valour, commanded two fresh Champions to be admitted; which instantly was accomplished. But wavering Fortune resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved (for a time) to smile on the strange Cavaliers, did by the instinct of her Camelion influence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually afford them victory; so that of twenty <hi>Cicilian</hi> Champions which ran that day, not one remained Conqueror, but all to their immortall shame, returned vanquish'd. The whole assembly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring hereat, could not refrain from (blushing) astonishment: the which the King remarking (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly) commanded the Triumphes for that day to break off, and so the general assembly depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But now as the rumour hereof was bruted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and almost in the Court no other news walking; our three young Princes (I mean <hi>Thalmeno Palma</hi> and <hi>Maedor</hi>) storming with disgrace to see their associats so defeated, (tickling their conceits with the consideration of honour) &amp; fame likewise in their brests refreshing the embers of magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they at last gave this period to their resolutions, that the very next morn (secretly) in person (maugre the effects of Fortune) they would maintaine the Combate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Upon which resolute determination, they hied to the Kings Munition-house, and there chose each of them a green Armour of Velvet, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bossed with fixed Stars and Roses of pure beaten gold: But again, the better to bring their purpose
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57367:95"/>
to passe, they under the mask of disguise, secretly so wrought with the King, that the next morn, to decide the Combate, there should be of each side elected three chiefe Champions, whereof, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever remained Conqueror, should immortally be invested with the Olympian garland of dignified fame. Whereupon <hi>Aurora</hi> (hauing washt her Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber locks in the azured Plain of <hi>Thetis</hi>) no sooner with her <hi>Cynthian</hi> complexion appeared in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled sky, but the Drums traversing the Streets, advertised all (aswel natives as forreigners) of the Kings intended resolution. The <hi>Cicilian</hi> Knights (not knowing of the three Princes determination) prepared themselves to the Combate, and so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise did the strangers, amongst whom, they elected three magnanimous Princes, whose names anone shall be at large related. In fine, King <hi>Druino,</hi> the Queen, the three Princesses, with the rest of the Nobility, were againe seated in the Theatre, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly burning with desire to know on whose side (inconstant) Fortune would encline: whiles thus all things was ready, the Herauld no sooner soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Combate, but three strange Champions entered the Lists, being gallantly mounted and dight in silver Armour, inameled with Azure, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Plumes all white and blew, prefiguring hope: on the contrary part, whiles the <hi>Cicilians</hi> were in contention, which three should enter: Lo, even then three gallant Cavaliers (being <hi>Cicilians</hi>) unexpectedly arrived, richly mounted upon snow-white Barbarian Coursers, apparell'd in green Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, having their Plumes crymson and white, displaying the beauty of their Ladies; the King and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57367:96"/>
company admiring what these unknown <hi>Cicilians</hi> (commending their audacious valour and marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all dexterity) commanded them to begin. So the two foremost having made obeisance, giving Spurs to their Jennets, very valorously advanced; at which furious encounter, they both so glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously behaved themselves, that it was difficult to censure whose side victory did most favour, but at last the <hi>Cicilian</hi> making a short turn (as being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in those martial actions) planting his Lance in his enemies Crest, very gallanty bore him of the Saddle, to the no little rejoycing of the whole As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, which for ravishing applause shouted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine. The second stranger, not any thing daunted with his fellows mis-fortune, very couragiously set forwards; who being by the next <hi>Cicilian</hi> as bravely met, were both (at first) very neer dismoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: In which triumphant Combate, having bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their Lances (and sent the shivers in the Aire to band with <hi>Mars</hi>) they retired; but no sooner were they furnished by their Pages with fresh Lances, but giving spurs to their Coursers, they again ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd, where the <hi>Cicilian</hi> so gallantly behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that at the next encounter he forced both horse and man to the ground, yea and with such a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible fury, that the whole assembly conjectured he had given the world his (last) fatal farewel; which the third strange Champion perceiving (as having his valorous courage inflamed with honour) with an undaunted resolution gave Spurs to his Jennet; so the last <hi>Cicilian</hi> Knight perceiving his approach, with a fierce audacity ran to encounter him, where b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
